      <title>Scattering theory for the defocusing 3d NLS in the exterior of a strictly convex obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the global well-posedness and scattering theory for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation $iu_t + \Delta_\Omega u = |u|^\alpha u$ in the exterior domain $\Omega$ of a smooth, compact and strictly convex obstacle in $\mathbb{R}^3$.It is conjectured that in Euclidean space, if the solution has a prior bound in the critical Sobolev space, that is, $u \in L_t^\infty(I; \dot{H}_x^{s_c}(\mathbb{R}^3))$ with $s_c := \frac{3}{2} - \frac{2}{\alpha} \in (0, \frac{3}{2})$, then $u$ is global and scatters. In this paper, assuming that this conjecture holds, we prove that if $u$ is a solution to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in exterior domain $\Omega$ with Dirichlet boundary condition and satisfies $u \in L_t^\infty(I; \dot{H}^{s_c}_D(\Omega))$ with $s_c \in \left[\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}\right)$, then $u$ is global and scatters.
  The main ingredients in our proof are the linear profile decompositions in the critical space $\dot{H}_D^{s_c}(\Omega)$ and embed it to the nonlinear equation. Inspired by Killip-Visan-Zhang[Amer. J. Math. {\bf138} (2016)], we overcome the difficulty caused by the breakdown of the scaling and translation invariance. This allows us to utilize the concentration-compactness/rigidity argument of Kenig and Merle [Invent. Math. {\bf 166} (2006)]. To preclude the minimal counterexamples, we established the long-time Stricharrtz estimates and the frequency-localized Morawetz estimates.</description>

      <title>Born and Inverse Born Series for a Special Case of the Second Harmonic Generation Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Born and Inverse Born series for a special case of the second harmonic generation system of PDEs. We give a recursive formula for the forward operators and prove boundedness conditions that guarantee the convergence of the Born and inverse Born series. We also use fixed point theory to give explicit conditions for convergence of the Born series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a simple proof of the fact that - in all dimensions - there are no homogeneous solutions to the thin obstacle problem with frequency $\lambda$ belonging to intervals of the form $(2k,2k+1)$, $k \in \mathbb{N}$. In particular, there are no frequencies in the interval $(2,3)$.</description>

      <title>The Vlasov-Poisson system with a perfectly conducting wall: Convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Vlasov--Poisson system in a $C^3$ convex domain $D$ with a perfectly conducting wall. We introduce the asymptotic domain $D_{\infty}$ for the domain $D$. Then under acceptable assumptions on $D$, we show that for localized initial data, the velocity of particles is asymptotically supported in the (closure of the) asymptotic domain $\overline{D_{\infty}}$ and the solutions exhibit the asymptotics of modified scattering.</description>

      <title>Mathematical analysis of the velocity extension level set method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A passively advected sharp interface can be represented as the zero level set of a level set function $f$. The linear transport equation $\partial_tf+v\cdot \nabla f =0$ is the simplest governing equation for such a level set function. While the signed distance of the interface is a geometrically convenient function, e.g., the norm of the gradient is everywhere one, its time evolution is not governed by the linear transport equation. In computational fluid dynamics, several modifications of the simplest case have been proposed in order to compute the signed distance function or to stabilize the norm of the gradient of a level set function on the interface. The velocity extension method is a prominent method used for efficient numerical approximation of the local signed distance function of the interface. Our current paper presents a rigorous mathematical formulation of the velocity extension method and proves that the method provides the local signed distance function of the moving interface. A key is to derive a first-order fully nonlinear PDE that is equivalent to the linear transport equation with extended velocity. Then, wellposedness of the PDE is established in the class of $C^2$-smooth solutions, global in time and local in space, with the local signed distance property, as well as in the class of $C^0$-viscosity solutions, global in time and space. Furthermore, partial regularity of the viscosity solution is proven, thus confirming that, if initial data is smooth near the initial interface, the viscosity solution is smooth in a time-global tubular neighborhood of the interface, coinciding with the local-in-space $C^2$-smooth solution.</description>

      <title>From bosonic canonical ensembles to non-linear Gibbs measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mean-field limit of the 1D bosonic canonical ensemble in a superharmonic trap. This is the regime with temperature proportional to particle number, both diverging to infinity, and correspondingly scaled interactions. We prove that the limit model is a classical field theory based on a non-linear Schr{\"o}dinger-Gibbs measure conditioned on the L2 mass, thereby obtaining a canonical analogue of previous results for the grand-canonical ensemble. We take advantage of this set-up with fixed mass to include focusing/attractive interactions/non-linearities in our study.</description>

      <title>A game interpretation for the weighted $p$-Laplace equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain a stochastic approximation that converges to the viscosity solution of the weighted $p$-Laplace equation. We consider a stochastic two-player zero-sum game controlled by a random walk, two player's choices, and the gradient of the weight function. The proof is based on the boundary conditions in the viscosity sense and the comparison principle. These results extend previous findings for the non-weighted $p$-Laplace equation [Manfredi, Parviainen, Rossi, 2012]. In addition, we study the limiting behavior of the viscosity solution of the weighted $p$-Laplace equation as $p\rightarrow\infty$.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz regularity of homogenization with continuous coefficients: Dirichlet problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study uniform Lipschitz regularity estimates for elliptic systems in divergence form with continuous coefficients, based on rapidly oscillating periodic coefficients derived from homogenization theory. We extend a result by Avellaneda and Lin [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 40 (1987), pp. 803-847] by minimizing all regularity conditions of the given data to integral conditions. We remark that the coefficients of an elliptic operator have Dini mean oscillation, which corresponds to the results of the latest general regularity theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the Leray--Hopf solutions of the 2D inhomogeneous Navier--Stokes system that become strong for positive times. This characterization relies on the strong energy inequality and the regularity properties of the pressure. As an application, we establish a weak-strong uniqueness result and provide a unified framework for several recent advances in the field.</description>

      <title>On the principle of linearized stability for quasilinear evolution equations in time-weighted spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasilinear (and semilinear) parabolic problems of the form $v'=A(v)v+f(v)$ with strict inclusion $\mathrm{dom}(f)\subsetneq \mathrm{dom}(A)$ of the domains of the function $v\mapsto f(v)$ and the quasilinear part $v\mapsto A(v)$ are considered in the framework of time-weighted function spaces. This allows one to establish the principle of linearized stability in intermediate spaces lying between $\mathrm{dom}(f)$ and $\mathrm{dom}(A)$ and yields a greater flexibility with respect to the phase space for the evolution. In applications to differential equations such intermediate spaces may correspond to critical spaces exhibiting a scaling invariance. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the applicability of the results.</description>

      <title>A few sharp estimates of harmonic functions with applications to Steklov eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On smooth compact manifolds with smooth boundary, we first establish the sharp lower bounds for the restrictions of harmonic functions in terms of their frequency functions, by using a combination of microlocal analysis and frequency function techniques by Almgren and Garofalo-Lin. The lower bounds can be saturated by Steklov eigenfunctions on Euclidean balls and a family of symmetric warped product manifolds. Moreover, as in Sogge and Taylor, we analyze the interior behavior of harmonic functions by constructing a parametrix for the Poisson integral operator and calculate its composition with the spectral cluster. By using microlocal analysis, we obtain several sharp estimates for the harmonic functions whose traces are quasimodes on the boundary. As applications, we establish the almost-orthogonality, bilinear estimates and transversal restriction estimates for Steklov eigenfunctions, and discuss the numerical approximation of harmonic functions.</description>

      <title>Turbulent solutions of the binormal flow and the 1D cubic Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last three decades there is an intense activity on the exploration of turbulent phenomena of dispersive equations, as for instance the growth of Sobolev norms since the work of Bourgain in the 90s. In general the 1D cubic Schr\"odinger equation has been left aside because of its complete integrability. In a series of papers of the last six years that we survey here for the special issue of the ICMP 2024 ([12],[13],[14],[15],[16],[7],[8]), we considered, together with the 1D cubic Schr\"odinger equation, the binormal flow, which is a geometric flow explicitly related to it. We displayed rigorously a large range of complex behavior as creation of singularities and unique continuation, Fourier growth, Talbot effects, intermittency and multifractality, justifying in particular some previous numerical observations. To do so we constructed a class of well-posedness for the 1D cubic Schr\"odinger equation included in the critical Fourier-Lebesgue space $\mathcal FL^\infty$ and in supercritical Sobolev spaces with respect to scaling. Last but not least we recall that the binormal flow is a classical model for the dynamics of a vortex filament in a 3D fluid or superfluid, and that vortex motions are a key element of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Orbital instability of periodic waves for generalized Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equations with a source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of generalized Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equations in one space dimension with a nonlinear source is considered. The purpose of this contribution is twofold. On one hand, the local well-posedness of the Cauchy problem on periodic Sobolev spaces and the regularity of the data-solution map are established. On the other hand, it is proved that periodic traveling waves which are spectrally unstable are also orbitally (nonlinearly) unstable under the flow of the evolution equation in periodic Sobolev spaces with same period as the fundamental period of the wave. This orbital instability criterion hinges on the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem, on the smoothness of the data-solution map, as well as on an abstract result which provides sufficient conditions for the instability of equilibria under iterations of a nonlinear map in Banach spaces. Applications of the former criterion include the orbital instability of a family of small-amplitude periodic waves with finite fundamental period for the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers-Fisher equation, which emerge from a local Hopf bifurcation around a critical value of the velocity.</description>

      <title>Polynomial mixing for the white-forced wave equation on the whole line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to investigate ergodicity of the white-forced wave equation on the whole line. Under the assumption that sufficiently many directions of the phase space are stochastically forced, we prove the uniqueness of stationary measure and polynomial mixing in the dual-Lipschitz metric. The difficulties in our proof are twofold. On the one hand, compared to stochastic parabolic equation, stochastic wave equation is lack of smoothing effect and strongly dissipative mechanism. On the other hand, the whole line leads to the lack of compactness compared to bounded domain. In order to overcome the above difficulties, our proof is based on a new criterion for polynomial mixing established in [20], a new weight type Foia\c{s}-Prodi estimate of wave equation on the whole line and weight energy estimates for stochastic wave equation.</description>

      <title>Spectrally accurate fully discrete schemes for some nonlocal and nonlinear integrable PDEs via explicit formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct fully-discrete schemes for the Benjamin-Ono, Calogero-Sutherland DNLS, and cubic Szeg\H{o} equations on the torus, which are $\textit{exact in time}$ with $\textit{spectral accuracy}$ in space. We prove spectral convergence for the first two equations, of order $K^{-s+1}$ for initial data in $H^s(\mathbb T)$, with an error constant depending $\textit{linearly}$ on the final time instead of exponentially. These schemes are based on $\textit{explicit formulas}$, which have recently emerged in the theory of nonlinear integrable equations. Numerical simulations show the strength of the newly designed methods both at short and long time scales. These schemes open doors for the understanding of the long-time dynamics of integrable equations.</description>

Abstract: This article introduces the $L_p$-Gauss dual curvature measure and proposes its related $L_p$-Gauss dual Minkowski problem as: for $p,q\in\mathbb{R}$, under what necessary and/or sufficient condition on a non-zero finite Borel measure $\mu$ on unit sphere does there exist a convex body $K$ such that $\mu$ is the $L_p$ Gauss dual curvature measure? If $K$ exists, to what extent is it unique? This problem amounts to solving a class of Monge-Amp\`{e}re type equations on unit sphere in smooth case:

  e^{-\frac{|\nabla h_K|^2+h_K^2}{2}}h_K^{1-p}
  (|\nabla h_K|^2+h_K^2)^{\frac{q-n}{2}}
  \det(\nabla^2h_K+h_KI)=f,
  \end{align} where $f$ is a given positive smooth function on unit sphere, $h_k$ is the support function of convex body $K$, $\nabla h_K$ and $\nabla^2h_K$ are the gradient and Hessian of $h_K$ on unit sphere with respect to an orthonormal basis, and $I$ is the identity matrix.
  We confirm the existence of solution to the new problem with $p,q&gt;0$ and the existence of smooth solution to the equation (\ref{0.1}) with $p ,q\in\mathbb{R}$ by variational method and Gaussian curvature flow method, respectively. Furthermore, the uniqueness of solution to the equation (\ref{0.1}) in the case $p,q\in\mathbb{R}$ with $q&lt;p$ is established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study continuity of the multiplier operator $e^{i q}$ acting on Gelfand--Shilov spaces, where $q$ is a polynomial on $\mathbf R^d$ of degree at least two with real coefficients. In the parameter quadrant for the spaces we identify a wedge that depends on the polynomial degree for which the operator is continuous. We also show that in a large part of the complement region the operator is not continuous in dimension one. The results give information on well-posedness for linear evolution equations that generalize the Schr\"odinger equation for the free particle.</description>

      <title>Local enhancement of the mean-field approximation for bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum many-body dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) on the lattice in the mean-field regime. We derive a local enhancement of the mean-field approximation: At positive distance $\rho&gt;0$ from the initial BEC, the mean-field approximation error at time $t\leq \rho/v$ is bounded as $\rho^{-n}$, for arbitrarily large $n\geq 1$. This is a consequence of new ballistic propagation bounds on the fluctuations around the condensate. To prove this, we develop a variant of the ASTLO (adiabatic spacetime localization observable) method for the particle non-conserving generator of the fluctuation dynamics around Hartree states.</description>

      <title>A novel necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of $2\times 2$ first-order linear hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a necessary and sufficient stability condition for a class of two coupled first-order linear hyperbolic partial differential equations. Through a backstepping transform, the problem is reformulated as a stability problem for an integral difference equation, that is, a difference equation with distributed delay. Building upon a St\'ep\'an--Hassard argument variation theorem originally designed for time-delay systems of retarded type, we then introduce a theorem that counts the number of unstable roots of our integral difference equation. This leads to the expected necessary and sufficient stability criterion for the system of first-order linear hyperbolic partial differential equations. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.07989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev type inequalities on nonlocal Sobolev spaces driven by $p$-L\'{e}vy integrable kernels, by imposing some appropriate growth conditions on the associated critical function. This naturally allows to devise Sobolev embeddings, as well as, compact embeddings of nonlocal Sobolev spaces into Orlicz type spaces. The Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev type inequalities, as in the classical context, turn out to have some reciprocity with Poincar\'{e} and Poincar\'{e}-Sobolev type inequalities. The classical fractional Sobolev inequality is also derived as a direct consequence.</description>

      <title>Positive solutions of the $\mathcal{A}$-Laplace equation with a potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.01755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study positive solutions of the quasilinear elliptic equation $$Q'_{p,\mathcal{A},V}[u]\triangleq-\mathrm{div}{\mathcal{A}(x,\nabla u)}+V(x)|u|^{p-2}u=0,$$ in a domain $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, where $n\geq 2$, $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, the divergence of $\mathcal{A}$ is the well known $\mathcal{A}$-Laplace operator considered in the influential book of Heinonen, Kilpel\"{a}inen, and Martio, and the potential $V$ belongs to a certain local Morrey space. The main aim of the paper is to extend criticality theory to the operator $Q'_{p,\mathcal{A},V}$. In particular, we prove an Agmon-Allegretto-Piepenbrink (AAP) type theorem, establish the uniqueness and simplicity of the principal eigenvalue of $Q'_{p,\mathcal{A},V}$ in a domain $\omega\Subset\Omega$, and give various characterizations of criticality. Furthermore, we also study positive solutions of the equation $Q'_{p,\mathcal{A},V}[u]=0$ of minimal growth at infinity in $\Omega$, the existence of a minimal positive Green function, and the minimal decay at infinity of Hardy-weights.</description>

      <title>The 3D Euler equations with inflow, outflow and vorticity boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.15180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 3D incompressible Euler equations in a bounded domain are most often supplemented with impermeable boundary conditions, which constrain the fluid to neither enter nor leave the domain. We establish well-posedness with inflow, outflow of velocity when either the full value of the velocity is specified on inflow, or only the normal component is specified along with the vorticity (and an additional constraint). We derive compatibility conditions to obtain regularity in a H\"{o}lder space with prescribed arbitrary index, and allow multiply connected domains. Our results apply as well to impermeable boundaries, establishing higher regularity of solutions in H\"{o}lder spaces.</description>

      <title>Regularity and Optimal Control of Non Local Cahn Hilliard Brinkman system with Singular Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of two incompressible, immiscible, isothermal fluids in a bounded domain and a porous media is described by the coupled Cahn-Hilliard-Brinkman (CHB) system. The CHB system consists of the Cahn-Hilliard equation describing the dynamics of the relative concentration of fluids and the Brinkman equation for velocity. This work addresses the optimal control problem for a two-dimensional nonlocal CHB system with a singular-type potential. The existence and regularity results are obtained by approximating the singular potential by a sequence of regular potentials and introducing a sequence of mobility terms to resolve the blow-up due to the singularity of the potential. Further, we prove the existence of a strong solution under higher regularity assumptions on the initial data and the uniqueness of the solution using the weak-strong uniqueness technique. By considering the external forcing term in the velocity equation as a control, we prove the existence of an optimal control for a tracking type cost functional. The differentiability properties of the control-to-state operator are studied to establish the first-order necessary optimality conditions. Moreover, the optimal control is characterised in terms of the adjoint variable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electro--energy--reaction--diffusion systems are thermodynamically consistent continuum models for reaction--diffusion processes that account for temperature and electrostatic effects in a way that total charge and energy are conserved. The question of the long-time asymptotic behavior in electro--energy--reaction--diffusion systems and the characterization of their equilibrium solutions leads to a maximization problem of the entropy on the manifold of states with fixed values for the linear charge and the nonlinear convex energy functional. As the main result, we establish the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions to this constrained optimization problem. We give two conceptually different proofs, which are related to different perspectives on the constrained maximization problem. The first one is based on the Lagrangian approach, whereas the second one employs the direct method of the calculus of variations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the transient scattered and transmitted fields generated when an incident electromagnetic wave impinges on a dielectric scatterer or a coated conductor embedded in an infinite space. By applying a boundary-field equation method, we reformulate the problem in the Laplace domain using the electric field equation inside the scatterer and a system of boundary integral equations for the scattered electric field in free space. To analyze this nonlocal boundary problem, we replace it by an equivalent boundary value problem. Existence, uniqueness and stability of the weak solution to the equivalent BVP are established in appropriate function spaces in terms of the Laplace transformed variable. The stability bounds are translated into time-domain estimates which determine the regularity of the solution in terms of the regularity of the problem data. These estimates can be easily converted into error estimates for a numerical discretization on the convolution quadrature for time evolution.</description>

Abstract: We show that a reformulation of the governing equations for incompressible multi-phase flow in the volume of fluid setting leads to a well defined energy rate. Weak nonlinear inflow-outflow and solid wall boundary conditions complement the development and lead to an energy estimate in terms of external data. The new formulation combined with summation-by-parts operators lead to provably nonlinear energy stability.</description>

Abstract: Well-posedness in time-weighted spaces for quasilinear (and semilinear) parabolic evolution equations $u'=A(u)u+f(u)$ is established in a certain critical case of strict inclusion $\mathrm{dom}(f)\subsetneq \mathrm{dom}(A)$ for the domains of the (superlinear) function $u\mapsto f(u)$ and the quasilinear part $u\mapsto A(u)$. Based upon regularizing effects of parabolic equations, it is proven that the solution map generates a semiflow in a critical intermediate space. The applicability of the abstract results is demonstrated by several examples including a model for atmospheric flows and semilinear and quasilinear evolution equations with scaling invariance for which well-posedness in the critical scaling invariant intermediate spaces is shown.</description>

By relying on the proof framework established in \cite{DJLW}, the Pohozaev identity and the classical blow-up analysis, we prove the existence theorem under some appropriate condition. Our results generalize Jost-Wang's results \cite{JLW} from regular Toda system with positive functions to the singular Toda system involving sign-changing weight functions.</description>

      <title>The Variation of the Uncentered Maximal Operator with respect to Cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.10747v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the maximal operator with respect to uncentered cubes on Euclidean space with arbitrary dimension. We prove that for any function with bounded variation, the variation of its maximal function is bounded by the variation of the function times a dimensional constant.
  We also prove the corresponding result for maximal operators with respect to collections of more general sets than cubes. The sets are required to satisfy a certain inner cone star condition and in addition the collection must enjoy a tiling property which for example the collection of all cubes does enjoy and the collection of all Euclidean balls does not.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of time fractional Kudryashov Sinelshchikov equation describing the pressure waves in a mixture of liquid and gas bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is concerned with an approximate analytical solution for the time fractional Kudryashov Sinelshchikov equation by using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space method. The main tools of this method are reproducing kernel theory, some important Hilbert spaces, the normal basis, orthogonalisation process, and homogenization. The effectiveness of reproduc ing kernel Hilbert space method is presented through the tables and graphs. These computa tional results indicate that this method is highly accurate and efficient for the time fractional Kudryashov Sinelshchikov equation. Also, it is demonstrated that the approximate solution uniformly converges to exact solution by using reproducing kernel Hilbert space method.</description>

      <title>Large-scale behaviour of Sobolev functions in Ahlfors regular metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the behaviour at infinity of $p$-Sobolev functions in the setting of Ahlfors $Q$-regular metric measure spaces supporting a $p$-Poincar\'e inequality. By introducing the notions of sets which are $p$-thin at infinity, we show that functions in the homogeneous space $\dot N^{1,p}(X)$ necessarily have limits at infinity outside of $p$-thin sets, when $1\le p&lt;Q&lt;+\infty$. When $p&gt;Q$, we show by example that uniqueness of limits at infinity may fail for functions in $\dot N^{1,p}(X)$. While functions in $\dot N^{1,p}(X)$ may not have any reasonable limit at infinity when $p=Q$, we introduce the notion of a $Q$-thick set at infinity, and characterize the limits of functions in $\dot N^{1,Q}(X)$ along infinite curves in terms of limits outside $Q$-thin sets and along $Q$-thick sets. By weakening the notion of a thick set, we show that a function in $\dot N^{1,Q}(X)$ with a limit along such an almost thick set may fail to have a limit along any infinite curve. While homogeneous $p$-Sobolev functions may have infinite limits at infinity when $p\ge Q$, we provide bounds on how quickly such functions may grow: when $p=Q$, functions in $\dot N^{1,p}(X)$ have sub-logarithmic growth at infinity, whereas when $p&gt;Q$, such functions have growth at infinity controlled by $d(\cdot, O)^{1-Q/p}$, where $O$ is a fixed base point in $X$. For the inhomogeneous spaces $N^{1,p}(X)$, the phenomenon is different. We show that for $1\le p\le Q$, the limit of a function $u\in N^{1,p}(X)$ is zero outside of a $p$-thin set, whereas $\lim_{x\to+\infty}u(x)=0$ for all $u\in N^{1,p}(X)$ when $p&gt;Q$.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Random Evolution Equations of Parabolic type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an abstract framework to obtain convergence rates for the approximation of random evolution equations corresponding to a random family of forms determined by finite-dimensional noise. The full discretization error in space, time, and randomness is considered, where polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is used for the semi-discretization in randomness. The main result are regularity conditions on the random forms under which convergence of polynomial order in randomness is obtained depending on the smoothness of the coefficients and the Sobolev regularity of the initial value. In space and time, the same convergence rates as in the deterministic setting are achieved. To this end, we derive error estimates for vector-valued PCE as well as a quantified version of the Trotter--Kato theorem for form-induced semigroups. We apply the abstract framework to an anisotropic diffusion model with random diffusion coefficients.</description>
