      <title>Index Modulation Embedded Mode Hopping for Anti-Jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the crowded spectrum, frequency hopping (FH) techniques are now very difficult to achieve efficient antijamming and increase spectrum efficiency (SE) for wireless communications. The emerging orbital angular momentum (OAM), which is a property describing the helical phase fronts of electromagnetic waves, offers the potential to improve reliability and increase SE in wireless communications. To achieve efficient anti-jamming and increase SE of wireless communications with slight computational complexity cost, in this paper we propose an index-modulation embedded mode-hopping (IM-MH) scheme, which simultaneously activates several OAM-modes for hopping along with additional index information and signal information transmission. We analyze the average bit error rates (ABERs) for our proposed IM-MH scheme with perfect channel state information (CSI) and imperfect CSI, respectively. We also propose the index-modulation embedded double-serial MH (IMDSMH) scheme, which randomly activates one OAM-mode as the serial second hop to transmit the hopping signals in the IM-MH scheme, to further decrease the ABER of wireless communications. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that our proposed schemes within a narrowband can achieve the low ABER and significantly increase the SE. Also, the ABERs of our proposed IM-MH and IM-DSMH schemes are around 25% and 10%, respectively, compared with that of the mode hopping scheme.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware UAV-Enabled Target Tracking: Online Optimization with Location Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory design, the total propulsion energy consumption and initial-final location constraints are practical factors to consider. However, unlike traditional offline designs, these two constraints are non-trivial to concurrently satisfy in online UAV trajectory designs for real-time target tracking, due to the undetermined information. To address this issue, we propose a novel online UAV trajectory optimization approach for the weighted sum-predicted posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) minimization, which guarantees the feasibility of satisfying the two mentioned constraints. Specifically, our approach designs the UAV trajectory by solving two subproblems: the candidate trajectory optimization problem and the energy-aware backup trajectory optimization problem. Then, an efficient solution to the candidate trajectory optimization problem is proposed based on Dinkelbach's transform and the Lasserre hierarchy, which achieves the global optimal solution under a given sufficient condition. The energy-aware backup trajectory optimization problem is solved by the successive convex approximation method. Numerical results show that our proposed UAV trajectory optimization approach significantly outperforms the benchmark regarding sensing performance and energy utilization flexibility.</description>

      <title>RIS-Based Self-Interference Cancellation for Full-Duplex Broadband Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-duplex (FD) is an attractive technology that can significantly boost the throughput of wireless communications. However, it is limited by the severe self-interference (SI) from the transmitter to the local receiver. In this paper, we propose a new SI cancellation (SIC) scheme based on reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), where small RISs are deployed inside FD devices to enhance SIC capability and system capacity under frequencyselective fading channels. The novel scheme can not only address the challenges associated with SIC but also improve the overall performance. We first analyze the near-field behavior of the RIS and then formulate an optimization problem to maximize the SIC capability by controlling the reflection coefficients (RCs) of the RIS and allocating the transmit power of the device. The problem is solved with alternate optimization (AO) algorithm in three cases: ideal case, where both the amplitude and phase of each RIS unit cell can be controlled independently and continuously, continuous phases, where the phase of each RIS unit cell can be controlled independently, while the amplitude is fixed to one, and discrete phases, where the RC of each RIS unit cell can only take discrete values and these discrete values are equally spaced on the unit circle. For the ideal case, the closed-form solution to RC is derived with Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Based on Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) algorithm, we optimize the RC for the case of continuous phases and then extend the solution to the case of discrete phases by the nearest point projection (NPP) method. Simulation results are given to validate the performance of our proposed SIC scheme.</description>

      <title>On the Fundamental Trade-Offs of Time-Frequency Resource Distribution in OFDMA ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is widely recognized as a pivotal and emerging technology for the next-generation mobile communication systems. However, how to optimize the time-frequency domain radio resource distribution for both communications and sensing, especially in scenarios where conflicting priorities emerge, becomes a crucial and challenging issue. In response to this problem, we first formulate the theoretical relationship between frequency domain subcarrier distribution and the range Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB), and time domain sensing symbol distribution and the velocity CRB, as well as between subcarrier distribution and achievable communication rates in narrowband systems. Based on the derived range and velocity CRB expressions, the subcarrier and sensing symbol distribution schemes with the optimal and the worst sensing performance are respectively identified under both single-user equipment (single-UE) and multi-UE orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) ISAC systems. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the impact of subcarrier distribution on achievable communication rates in synchronous narrowband OFDMA ISAC systems is marginal. This insight reveals that the constraints associated with subcarrier distribution optimization for achievable rates can be released. To substantiate our analysis, we present simulation results that demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed distribution schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly growing field of wearable technology, optical devices are emerging as a significant innovation, offering non-invasive methods for analyzing skin and underlying tissue properties. Despite their promise, progress has been slowed by a lack of specialized prototypes and advanced analysis techniques. Addressing this gap, our study introduces, HydroTrack, an 18-channel spectroscopy sensor, ingeniously embedded in a smart-watch. Accompanying this hardware, we present signal processing and data analysis techniques implemented at the edge, designed to maximize the utility of our system in comprehensive health tracking. A pivotal application of our device is the real-time assessment of hydration levels in physically active individuals. We validated our prototype and analytical approach through experiments on six participants, focusing on hydration dynamics during physical exercises. Our findings reveal an accuracy of avg. 95% in determining hydration states.</description>

      <title>Laugh Now Cry Later: Controlling Time-Varying Emotional States of Flow-Matching-Based Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People change their tones of voice, often accompanied by nonverbal vocalizations (NVs) such as laughter and cries, to convey rich emotions. However, most text-to-speech (TTS) systems lack the capability to generate speech with rich emotions, including NVs. This paper introduces EmoCtrl-TTS, an emotion-controllable zero-shot TTS that can generate highly emotional speech with NVs for any speaker. EmoCtrl-TTS leverages arousal and valence values, as well as laughter embeddings, to condition the flow-matching-based zero-shot TTS. To achieve high-quality emotional speech generation, EmoCtrl-TTS is trained using more than 27,000 hours of expressive data curated based on pseudo-labeling. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that EmoCtrl-TTS excels in mimicking the emotions of audio prompts in speech-to-speech translation scenarios. We also show that EmoCtrl-TTS can capture emotion changes, express strong emotions, and generate various NVs in zero-shot TTS. See https://aka.ms/emoctrl-tts for demo samples.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Near-Far Field Channel Estimation for Holographic MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic MIMO communications, enabled by large-scale antenna arrays with quasi-continuous apertures, is a potential technology for spectrum efficiency improvement. However, the increased antenna aperture size extends the range of the Fresnel region, leading to a hybrid near-far field communication mode. The users and scatterers randomly lie in near-field and far-field zones, and thus, conventional far-field-only and near-field-only channel estimation methods may not work. To tackle this challenge, we demonstrate the existence of the power diffusion (PD) effect, which leads to a mismatch between the hybrid-field channel and existing channel estimation methods. Specifically, in far-field and near-field transform domains, the power gain of one channel path may diffuse to other positions, thus generating fake paths. This renders the conventional techniques unable to detect those real paths. We propose a PD-aware orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm to eliminate the influence of the PD effect by identifying the PD range within which paths diffuse to other positions. PD-OMP fits a general case without prior knowledge of near-field and far-field path numbers and the user's location. The computational complexity of PD-OMP and the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound for the sparse-signal-recovery-based channel estimation are also derived. Simulation results show that PD-OMP outperforms state-of-the-art hybrid-field channel estimation methods.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO Surveillance of Multiple Untrusted Communication Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system is considered for enhancing the monitoring performance of wireless surveillance, where a large number of distributed multi-antenna aided legitimate monitoring nodes (MNs) proactively monitor multiple distributed untrusted communication links. We consider two types of MNs whose task is to either observe the untrusted transmitters or jam the untrusted receivers. We first analyze the performance of CF-mMIMO surveillance relying on both maximum ratio (MR) and partial zero-forcing (PZF) combining schemes and derive closed-form expressions for the monitoring success probability (MSP) of the MNs. We then propose a joint optimization technique that designs the MN mode assignment, power control, and MN-weighting coefficient control to enhance the MSP based on the long-term statistical channel state information knowledge. This challenging problem is effectively transformed into tractable forms and efficient algorithms are proposed for solving them. Numerical results show that our proposed CF-mMIMO surveillance system considerably improves the monitoring performance with respect to a full-duplex co-located massive MIMO proactive monitoring system. More particularly, when the untrusted pairs are distributed over a wide area and use the MR combining, the proposed solution provides nearly a thirty-fold improvement in the minimum MSP over the co-located massive MIMO baseline, and forty-fold improvement, when the PZF combining is employed.</description>

      <title>Blind Beamforming for Coverage Enhancement with Intelligent Reflecting Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional policy for configuring an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) typically requires channel state information (CSI), thus incurring substantial overhead costs and facing incompatibility with the current network protocols. This paper proposes a blind beamforming strategy in the absence of CSI, aiming to boost the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among all the receiver positions, namely the coverage enhancement. Although some existing works already consider the IRS-assisted coverage enhancement without CSI, they assume certain position-channel models through which the channels can be recovered from the geographic locations. In contrast, our approach solely relies on the received signal power data, not assuming any position-channel model. We examine the achievability and converse of the proposed blind beamforming method. If the IRS has $N$ reflective elements and there are $U$ receiver positions, then our method guarantees the minimum SNR of $\Omega(N^2/U)$ -- which is fairly close to the upper bound $O(N+N^2\sqrt{\ln (NU)}/\sqrt[4]{U})$. Aside from the simulation results, we justify the practical use of blind beamforming in a field test at 2.6 GHz. According to the real-world experiment, the proposed blind beamforming method boosts the minimum SNR across seven random positions in a conference room by 18.22 dB, while the position-based method yields a boost of 12.08 dB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) for physical wireless environments have been recently proposed as accurate virtual representations of the propagation environment that can enable multi-layer decisions at the physical communication equipment. At high-frequency bands, DTs can help to overcome the challenges emerging in high mobility conditions featuring vehicular environments. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven workflow for the creation of the DT of a Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication scenario and a multi-modal simulation framework for the generation of realistic sensor data and accurate mmWave/sub-THz wireless channels. The proposed method leverages an automotive simulation and testing framework and an accurate ray-tracing channel simulator. Simulations over an urban scenario show the achievable realistic sensor and channel modelling both at the infrastructure and at ego-vehicles. We showcase the proposed framework on the DT-aided blockage handover task for V2X link restoration, leveraging the framework's dynamic channel generation capabilities for realistic vehicular blockage simulation.</description>

      <title>A Novel Joint Angle-Range-Velocity Estimation Method for MIMO-OFDM ISAC Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is emerging as a key technique for next-generation wireless systems. In order to expedite the practical implementation of ISAC in pervasive mobile networks, it is crucial to have widely deployed base stations with radar sensing capabilities. Thus, the utilization of standardized multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) hardware architectures and waveforms is pivotal for realizing seamless integration of effective communication and sensing functionalities. In this paper, we introduce a novel joint angle-range-velocity estimation algorithm for MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems. This approach exclusively depends on the format of conventional MIMO-OFDM waveforms that are widely adopted in wireless communications. Specifically, the angle-range-velocity information of potential targets is jointly extracted by utilizing all the received echo signals within a coherent processing interval (CPI). The proposed joint estimation algorithm can achieve larger signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) processing gains and higher resolution by fully exploiting the echo signals and jointly estimating the angle-range-velocity information. A theoretical analysis for maximum unambiguous range, resolution, and SNR processing gains is provided to verify the advantages of the proposed joint estimation algorithm. Finally, the results of extensive numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the proposed joint estimation approach can achieve significantly lower root-mean-square-error (RMSE) performance for angle/range/velocity estimation for both single- and multi-target scenarios.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Aided Joint Source Channel Coding For High Realism Wireless Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (deep JSCC) has been demonstrated to be an effective approach for wireless image transmission. Nevertheless, most existing work adopts an autoencoder framework to optimize conventional criteria such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) which do not suffice to maintain the perceptual quality of reconstructed images. Such an issue is more prominent under stringent bandwidth constraints or low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To tackle this challenge, we propose DiffJSCC, a novel framework that leverages the prior knowledge of the pre-trained Statble Diffusion model to produce high-realism images via the conditional diffusion denoising process. Our DiffJSCC first extracts multimodal spatial and textual features from the noisy channel symbols in the generation phase. Then, it produces an initial reconstructed image as an intermediate representation to aid robust feature extraction and a stable training process. In the following diffusion step, DiffJSCC uses the derived multimodal features, together with channel state information such as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as conditions to guide the denoising diffusion process, which converts the initial random noise to the final reconstruction. DiffJSCC employs a novel control module to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model and adjust it to the multimodal conditions. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets reveal that our method significantly surpasses prior deep JSCC approaches on both perceptual metrics and downstream task performance, showcasing its ability to preserve the semantics of the original transmitted images. Notably, DiffJSCC can achieve highly realistic reconstructions for 768x512 pixel Kodak images with only 3072 symbols (&lt;0.008 symbols per pixel) under 1dB SNR channels.</description>

      <title>A Modular Pragmatic Architecture for Multiuser MIMO with Array-Fed RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a power- and hardware-efficient, pragmatic, modular, multiuser/multibeam array-fed RIS architecture particularly suited to operate in very high frequency bands (high mmWave and sub-THz), where channels are typically sparse in the beamspace and line-of-sight (LOS) is required to achieve an acceptable received signal level. The key module is an active multi-antenna feeder (AMAF) with a small number of active antennas placed in the near field of a RIS with a much larger number of passive controllable reflecting elements. We propose a pragmatic approach to obtain a steerable beam with high gain and very low sidelobes. Then, $K$ independently controlled beams can be achieved by stacking $K$ of such AMAF-RIS modules. Our analysis takes in full account: 1) the near-end crosstalk (NEXT) between the modules, 2) the far-end crosstalk (FEXT) due to the sidelobes; 3) a thorough energy efficiency comparison with respect to conventional active arrays with the same beamforming performance. Overall, we show that the proposed architecture is very attractive in terms of spectral efficiency, ease of implementation (hardware complexity), and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>One-Bit MIMO Detection: From Global Maximum-Likelihood Detector to Amplitude Retrieval Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As communication systems advance towards the future 6G era, the incorporation of large-scale antenna arrays in base stations (BSs) presents challenges such as increased hardware costs and energy consumption. To address these issues, the use of one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)/digital-to-analog converters (DACs) has gained significant attentions. This paper focuses on one-bit multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection in an uplink multiuser transmission scenario where the BS employs one-bit ADCs. One-bit quantization retains only the sign information and loses the amplitude information, which poses a unique challenge in the corresponding detection problem. The maximum-likelihood (ML) formulation of one-bit MIMO detection has a challenging likelihood function that hinders the application of many high-performance detectors developed for classic MIMO detection (under high-resolution ADCs). While many approximate methods for the ML detection problem have been studied, it lacks an efficient global algorithm. This paper fills this gap by proposing an efficient branch-and-bound algorithm, which is guaranteed to find the global solution of the one-bit ML MIMO detection problem. Additionally, a new amplitude retrieval (AR) detection approach is developed, incorporating explicit amplitude variables into the problem formulation. The AR approach yields simpler objective functions that enable the development of efficient algorithms offering both global and approximate solutions. The paper also contributes to the computational complexity analysis of both ML and AR detection problems. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed formulations and algorithms.</description>

      <title>RIMformer: An End-to-End Transformer for FMCW Radar Interference Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar plays a pivotal role in the field of remote sensing. The increasing degree of FMCW radar deployment has increased the mutual interference, which weakens the detection capabilities of radars and threatens reliability and safety of systems. In this paper, a novel FMCW radar interference mitigation (RIM) method, termed as RIMformer, is proposed by using an end-to-end Transformer-based structure. In the RIMformer, a dual multi-head self-attention mechanism is proposed to capture the correlations among the distinct distance elements of intermediate frequency (IF) signals. Additionally, an improved convolutional block is integrated to harness the power of convolution for extracting local features. The architecture is designed to process time-domain IF signals in an end-to-end manner, thereby avoiding the need for additional manual data processing steps. The improved decoder structure ensures the parallelization of the network to increase its computational efficiency. Simulation and measurement experiments are carried out to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed RIMformer can effectively mitigate interference and restore the target signals.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS Aided MISO SWIPT-NOMA System with Energy Buffer: Performance Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) and energy buffer aided multiple-input single-output (MISO) simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, which consists of a STAR-RIS, an access point (AP), and reflection users and transmission users with energy buffers. In the proposed system, the multi-antenna AP can transmit information and energy to several single-antenna reflection and transmission users simultaneously by the NOMA fashion in the downlink, where the power transfer and information transmission states of the users are modeled using Markov chains. The reflection and transmission users harvest and store the energy in energy buffers as additional power supplies, which are partially utilized for uplink information transmission. The power outage probability, information outage probability, sum throughput, and joint outage probability closed-form expressions of the proposed system are derived over Nakagami-m fading channels, which are validated via simulations. Results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves better performance as compared to the proposed system with discrete phase shifts, the STAR-RIS aided MISO SWIPT-NOMA buffer-less, conventional RIS and energy buffer aided MISO SWIPT-NOMA, and STAR-RIS and energy buffer aided MISO SWIPT-time-division multiple access (TDMA) systems. Furthermore, a particle swarm optimization-based power allocation (PSO-PA) algorithm is designed to maximize the uplink sum throughput with a constraint on the uplink joint outage probability and Jain's fairness index (JFI). Simulation results illustrate that the proposed PSO-PA algorithm can achieve an improved sum throughput performance of the proposed system.</description>

      <title>Waste Factor and Waste Figure: A Unified Theory for Modeling and Analyzing Wasted Power in Radio Access Networks for Improved Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Waste Factor (W), also denoted as Waste Figure (WF) in dB, a promising new metric for quantifying energy efficiency in a wide range of circuits and systems applications, including data centers and RANs. Also, the networks used to connect data centers and AI computing engines with users for ML applications must become more power efficient. This paper illustrates the limitations of existing energy efficiency metrics that inadequately capture the intricate energy dynamics of RAN components. We delineate the methodology for applying W across various network configurations, including MISO, SIMO, and MIMO systems, and demonstrate the effectiveness of W in identifying energy optimization opportunities. Our findings reveal that W not only offers nuanced insights into the energy performance of RANs but also facilitates informed decision-making for network design and operational efficiency. Furthermore, we show how W can be integrated with other KPIs to guide the development of optimal strategies for enhancing network energy efficiency under different operational conditions. Additionally, we present simulation results for a distributed multi-user MIMO system at 3.5, 17, and 28 GHz, demonstrating overall network power efficiency on a per square kilometer basis, and show how overall W decreases with an increasing number of base stations and increasing carrier frequency. This paper shows that adopting W as a figure of merit can significantly contribute to the sustainability and energy optimization of next-generation wireless communication networks, paving the way for greener and more sustainable, energy-efficient 5G and 6G technologies.</description>

      <title>MMVR: Millimeter-wave Multi-View Radar Dataset and Benchmark for Indoor Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compared with an extensive list of automotive radar datasets that support autonomous driving, indoor radar datasets are scarce at a smaller scale in the format of low-resolution radar point clouds and usually under an open-space single-room setting. In this paper, we scale up indoor radar data collection using multi-view high-resolution radar heatmap in a multi-day, multi-room, and multi-subject setting, with an emphasis on the diversity of environment and subjects. Referred to as the millimeter-wave multi-view radar (MMVR) dataset, it consists of $345$K multi-view radar frames collected from $25$ human subjects over $6$ different rooms, $446$K annotated bounding boxes/segmentation instances, and $7.59$ million annotated keypoints to support three major perception tasks of object detection, pose estimation, and instance segmentation, respectively. For each task, we report performance benchmarks under two protocols: a single subject in an open space and multiple subjects in several cluttered rooms with two data splits: random split and cross-environment split over $395$ 1-min data segments. We anticipate that MMVR facilitates indoor radar perception development for indoor vehicle (robot/humanoid) navigation, building energy management, and elderly care for better efficiency, user experience, and safety. The MMVR dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12611978.</description>
