      <title>Smart Acoustic Lining for UHBR Technologies Engine Part 1: design of an electroacoustic liner and experimental characterization under flow in rectangular cross-section ducts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new generation of Ultra-High-By-Pass-Ratio (UHBR) turbofan engine while considerably reducing fuel consumption, threatens higher noise levels at low frequencies because of its larger diameter, lower number of blades and rotational speed. This is accompanied by a shorter nacelle, leaving less available space for acoustic treatments. In this context, a progress in the liner technology is highly demanded, prospecting alternative solutions to classic liners. The SALUTE H2020 project has taken up this challenge, proposing electro-active acoustic liners, made up of loudspeakers (actuators) and microphones (sensors). The electro-active means allow to program the surface impedance on the electroacoustic liner, but also to conceive alternative boundary laws. Test-rigs of gradually increasing complexities have allowed to raise the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) up to 3-4. In this first part, we describe the control laws employed in the experimental campaigns, and present the scattering performances in rectangular waveguides with monomodal guided propagation. These results have assessed the isolation capabilities, stability and robustness of such programmable boundary technology, allowing to gain confidence for the successive implementation in a scaled turbofan test-rig.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Photoresponse for InGaAs Infrared Photodetectors Using Plasmonic WO$_{3-x}$/Cs$_y$WO$_{3-x}$ Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and accurate detection of light in the near-infrared (NIR) spectral range plays a crucial role in modern society, from alleviating speed and capacity bottlenecks in optical communications to enhancing the control and safety of autonomous vehicles through NIR imaging systems. Several technological platforms are currently under investigation to improve NIR photodetection, aiming to surpass the performance of established III-V semiconductor p-i-n (PIN) junction technology. These platforms include in situ-grown inorganic nanocrystals and nanowire arrays, as well as hybrid organic-inorganic materials such as graphene-perovskite heterostructures. However, challenges remain in nanocrystal and nanowire growth, large-area fabrication of high-quality 2D materials, and the fabrication of devices for practical applications. Here, we explore the potential for tailored semiconductor nanocrystals to enhance the responsivity of planar metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors. MSM technology offers ease of fabrication and fast response times compared to PIN detectors. We observe enhancement of the optical-to-electric conversion efficiency by up to a factor of ~2.5 through the application of plasmonically-active semiconductor nanorods and nanocrystals. We present a protocol for synthesizing and rapidly testing the performance of non-stoichiometric tungsten oxide (WO$_{3-x}$) nanorods and cesium-doped tungsten oxide (Cs$_y$WO$_{3-x}$) hexagonal nanoprisms prepared in colloidal suspensions and drop-cast onto photodetector surfaces. The results demonstrate the potential for a cost-effective and scalable method exploiting tailored nanocrystals to improve the performance of NIR optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Mechanical behavior of HTS tape in highly flexible REBCO cable under tensile and torsional loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One kind of highly flexible REBCO cable (HFRC) has been proposed recent years, which contains REBCO superconducting tapes wound onto a spiral tube. Under external loads, spiral tube is prone to complex deformation, leading to unpredictable characteristics of HFRC. In this paper, we analysis the deformation process of spiral tube under tension and torsion. Based on the geometrical relationship between tapes and spiral tube, the mechanical behavior of tapes in HFRC is further studied.</description>

      <title>Radiation Resilience of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Schottky Barrier Diodes Under High Dose Gamma Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic investigation of the electrical characteristics of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) has been conducted under high dose $^{60}$Co gamma radiation up to 5 Mrad (Si). Initial exposure of the diodes to 1 Mrad (Si) resulted in a significant decrease in on-current by $\sim$78% and an increase in on-resistance from $\sim$3 m$\Omega \cdot$cm$^2$ to $\sim$14 m$\Omega \cdot$cm$^2$ compared to the pre-radiation condition, likely due to the generation of radiation-induced deep-level acceptor traps. However, upon exposure to higher doses of gamma radiation (3 and 5 Mrad (Si)) over a prolonged duration, the device performance partially recovered due to a radiation annealing effect. This effect is facilitated by secondary electrons generated through Compton scattering, which dissipate kinetic energy as heat throughout the lattice, thereby annealing the trapping centers responsible for device performance degradation. The capacitance-voltage (C-V) characterization revealed that the net carrier concentration in the $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ drift layer reduced from $\sim$3.19 $\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$ to $\sim$3.05 $\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$ after 5 Mrad (Si) irradiation. Temperature-dependent I-V characteristics showed that irradiation leads to a reduction in both forward and reverse current across all investigated temperatures ranging from 25 to 250$^\circ$C, accompanied by slight increases in on-resistance, ideality factors, and Schottky barrier heights. The reverse breakdown characteristics of the $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ SBDs showed a slight increase of the breakdown voltage after radiation. Overall, $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Schottky diode exhibits high resilience to gamma irradiation, with performance degradation mitigated by radiation-induced self-recovery, highlighting its potential for radiation-hardened electronic applications in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>General reconstruction of elastic strain fields from their Longitudinal Ray Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for reconstruction of elastic strain fields from their Longitudinal Ray Transform (LRT) in either two or three dimensions. In general, the LRT only determines the solenoidal part of a symmetric tensor field, but elastic strain fields additionally satisfy mechanical equilibrium, an extra condition that allows for full reconstruction in many cases. Our method provides full reconstruction for general elastic strain fields in connected objects whose boundary only contains one component, while previous results included other requirements such as no residual stress, or zero boundary traction. This allows for full reconstruction in energy resolved neutron transmission imaging for simple objects. Along the way, we prove that the LRT of a potential rank-2 tensor restricted to a bounded set determines the potential on the boundary of the set up to infinitesimal rigid motions on each component of the boundary. The method is demonstrated with numerical examples in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid electromagnetic toroidal vortices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ubiquitous occurrence of toroidal vortices or vortex rings in fluid-dynamic scenarios in nature has garnered significant attention of scientific frontier, whilst, the electromagnetic counterparts of which were only proposed recently with two distinct manifestations: vector toroidal pulses [Nat. Photon. 16, 523 (2022)] and scalar phase toroidal vortices [Nat. Photon. 16, 519 (2022)]. This dichotomy in the understanding of toroidal vortex phenomena has prompted a reassessment of their fundamental nature. Herein, we theoretically propose a novel form of electromagnetic toroidal vortex solutions, that uniquely integrate both scalar and vector characteristics, challenging the prevailing notion of their mutual exclusivity. We also present the experimental generation of the hybrid toroidal vortex pulses by a compact coaxial horn emitter augmented with a metasurface. This methodology not only demonstrates the feasibility of creating such complex vortex structures but also endows the resulting pulses with unique properties, including the coexistence of transverse orbital angular momentum, electromagnetic vortex streets, and topological skyrmion textures. These attributes introduce new dimensions in topologically complex structured waves, opening avenues for enhanced free-space information transmission, topologically nontrivial light-matter interaction and microscopy techniques.</description>

      <title>Retrieval of phase information from low-dose electron microscopy experiments: are we at the limit yet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenge of imaging low-density objects in an electron microscope without causing beam damage is significant in modern TEM. This is especially challenging for life science imaging, where the sample, rather than the instrument, still determines the resolution limit. Here, we explore whether we have to accept this or can progress further in this area. To do this, we use numerical simulations to see how much information we can obtain from a weak phase object at different electron doses. Starting from a model with four phase values, we compare Zernike phase contrast with measuring diffracted intensity under multiple random phase illuminations to solve the inverse problem. Our simulations have shown that diffraction-based methods perform better than the Zernike method, as we have found and addressed a normalization issue that, in some other studies, led to an overly optimistic representation of the Zernike setup. We further validated this using more realistic 2D objects and found that random phase illuminated diffraction can be up to five times more efficient than an ideal Zernike implementation. These findings suggest that diffraction-based methods could be a promising approach for imaging beam-sensitive materials and that current low-dose imaging methods are not yet at the quantum limit.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-agnostic Metasurface Design for Next Generation 2D Photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a versatile technique for inverse designing 2D photonic crystal metasurfaces. These surfaces, known for their ability to manipulate light-matter interactions, can be precisely controlled to achieve specific functionalities. The key lies in efficiently optimizing the geometric patterns and dimensions of the metasurface. Through a composite method which exploits two well-established paradigms - Covariance Matrix Adaptation optimization and Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA), we demonstrate our ability to design and optimize resonances in metaelements to achieve desired optical performance such as near-perfect absorption at chosen wavelengths/optical modes, which otherwise proves to be challenging or even impossible with conventional inverse design implementations. We apply our method to design three-layered structures involving a monolayer absorber, transparent metasubstrate, and a back mirror to get near 100% absorption at one or two chosen wavelengths. For illustration, we choose black phosphorus and silicon metasurface to predict ~100% absorption in a monolayer at 1550 nm. The versatile technique can be applied to tailor reflectance and transmittance for any optical mode and wavelength. This computationally efficient design method paves the way for creating high-performance 2D metasurface-based devices with a variety of applications, including quantum technology components such as single photon sensors and biphoton sources, communication systems, and non-linear light conversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical interactions in nanostructures are vital for both fundamental research and practical applications. The optical Kerr effect, a third-order nonlinear phenomenon, induces anisotropic refractive index changes in materials under high-intensity laser beams. However, its limited magnitude restricts its application in free-space nanophotonics. In this study, we demonstrate a significant enhancement-by many orders of magnitude compared to a bare film-of the optical Kerr effect using guided-mode resonance in a dielectric diffraction grating. We designed, fabricated, and measured the transmittance of a resonant silicon nitride crossed grating under short light pulses, observing spectral resonance shifts with varying pulse power and over fifty percent modulation of resonance magnitude. This work also explores the potential of the grating for dynamic pulse shaping, opening new avenues for advanced all-optical devices utilizing enhanced Kerr nonlinearities in dielectric gratings.</description>

      <title>Closely piling up of multiple adhesive fronts in adhesive friction due to re-attachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Friction impacts a wide range of fields, spanning engineering, geology, biomechanics, and numerous others. As a fundamental force, it influences various aspects of our daily lives and industrial processes across multiple disciplines. To understand how adhesive friction seemingly breaks the size limit dictated by the fracture theory, here we investigate the sliding of elastic solids adhered to a rigid surface via multiple adhesive springs. With the consideration of random re-attachment of detached adhesive springs, we find that the shear-off force of the interface can significantly exceed predictions made by the fracture theory, with substantial adhesive forces distributed across the entire interface. Through this observation, we identify multiple adhesive fronts closely aligning along the interface, exhibiting similar force profiles. Moreover, the number of these regions seems to generally increase with the interface size, resulting in a linear rise in the calculated shear-off force with interface size. Therefore, we conclude that the close accumulation of multiple adhesive fronts along an interface aids each other through random healing so as to erase the size effect of the fracture theory, which offers valuable insights into understanding the phenomena associated with adhesive friction along an interface in various fields.</description>
