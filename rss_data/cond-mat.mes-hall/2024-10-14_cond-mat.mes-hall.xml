      <title>Adjoint computation of Berry phase gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Berry phases offer a geometric perspective on wave propagation and are key to designing materials with topological wave transport. However, controlling Berry phases is challenging due to their dependence on global integrals over the Brillouin zone, making differentiation difficult. We present an adjoint-based method for efficiently computing the gradient of the Berry phase with respect to system parameters, involving only one forward and one adjoint calculation. This approach enables the use of advanced optimization techniques, such as topology optimization, to design new materials with tailored topological wave properties.</description>

      <title>Dirac-point spectroscopy of flat-band systems with the quantum twisting microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent development of the quantum twisting microscope, we formulate a theory of elastic momentum-resolved tunneling across a planar tunnel junction between a monolayer graphene layer situated on a tip and a twisting graphene-based sample. We elucidate features in the dependence of the tunnel current on bias and twist angle, which reflect the sample band structure and allow the tip to probe the momentum-and energy-resolved single-particle excitations of the sample. While the strongest features originate from the Fermi edge of the tip, we argue that features associated with the tip Dirac points provide a more immediate and precise map of the sample band structure. We specifically compute the low-temperature tunneling spectrum of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) rotated relative to the tip by nearly commensurate angles, highlighting the potential of Dirac-point spectroscopy to measure single-particle spectral functions of flat bands along specific lines in reciprocal space. Furthermore, our analysis of tunneling matrix elements suggests a method to extract the ratio of the intra-and inter-sublattice tunneling parameters $w_0/w_1$ of MATBG from the differential tunneling conductance. Finally, we discuss signatures of $C_{3z}$ symmetry breaking in the tunneling spectrum using strained MATBG as an example. Our work establishes a general theoretical framework for Dirac-point spectroscopy of flat-band systems using the quantum twisting microscope.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Simulation of 2D Transducers Based on Suspended Graphene-Based Heterostructures in Nanoelectromechanical Pressure Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene-based 2D heterostructures exhibit excellent mechanical and electrical properties, which are expected to exhibit better performances than graphene for nanoelectromechanical pressure sensors. Here, we built the pressure sensor models based on suspended heterostructures of graphene/h-BN, graphene/MoS2, and graphene/MoSe2 by using COMSOL Multiphysics finite element software. We found that suspended circular 2D membranes show the best sensitivity to pressures compared to rectangular and square ones. We simulated the deflections, strains, resonant frequencies, and Young's moduli of suspended graphene-based heterostructures under the conditions of different applied pressures and geometrical sizes, built-in tensions, and the number of atomic layers of 2D membranes. The Young's moduli of 2D heterostructures of graphene, graphene/h-BN, graphene/MoS2, and graphene/MoSe2 were estimated to be 1.001TPa, 921.08 GPa, 551.11 GPa, and 475.68 GPa, respectively. We also discuss the effect of highly asymmetric cavities on device performance. These results would contribute to the understanding of the mechanical properties of graphene-based heterostructures and would be helpful for the design and manufacture of high-performance NEMS pressure sensors.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Band Topology in Twisted Bilayer Kagome Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically protected corner states serve as a key indicator for two-dimensional higher-order topological insulators, yet they have not been experimentally identified in realistic materials. Here, by utilizing the effective tight-binding model and symmetry arguments, we establish a connection between higher-order topological insulators and twisted bilayer kagome lattices. We find that the topologically nontrivial bulk band gap arises in the twisted bilayer kagome lattice system due to twist-induced intervalley scattering, leading to the emergence of higher-order topological insulators with a range of commensurate twist angles, and the higher-order band topology is verified by the second Stiefel-Whitney number and fractionally quantized corner charges. Moreover, we investigate the influence of disorder and charge density wave order on the stability of higher-order topological insulator phases. The results show that the corner states of twisted bilayer kagome lattice systems are robust with respect to disorder and charge density wave. Our work not only provides a feasible approach to realize the readily controllable higher-order topological insulator phases by employing a simple twist technique, but also demonstrates that the twisted bilayer kagome lattice systems exhibit the robustness of higher-order band topology, making it feasible to check above prediction in experiments.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Discovery of Kagome Materials in Transition Metal Oxide Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome materials have been found to exhibit exotic physical properties such as spin frustration, charge density waves, and unconventional superconductivity. However, the number of materials with kagome lattice-related properties discovered so far is relatively small, limiting the exploration of the physical phenomena associated with kagome materials. Due to the weaker interlayer coupling in two-dimensional kagome materials, they are more likely to exhibit kagome lattice-related physical properties. Therefore, the search for potential two-dimensional kagome materials is crucial for understanding the underlying physics of kagome lattices. In this work, we performed high-throughput workflow to discover thermodynamically stable kagome transition metal oxide monolayers based on "1+3" strategy. Starting from a pool of 349 candidate materials, we identified 12 globally stable kagome monolayers, including both magnetic and non-magnetic structures. These monolayers were classified into four categories based on their electronic structures, lattice types, symmetry, band gaps, and magnetic properties. A detailed analysis was performed on kagome structures exhibiting band features near the Fermi level. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the "1+3" strategy in constructing kagome lattices, providing a pathway for further theoretical and experimental exploration of kagome materials and their potential quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Extensions to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model: Linear chains and their topological properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model describes the dynamics of spinless fermions in a one-dimensional lattice, with sublattices $A$ and $B$, and governed by staggered hopping potentials $v$ and $w$ representing the intracell and intercell hopping energies, respectively. In this study, we extend the SSH model into three distinct types: a trimer chain, the generalized trimer chain, and a hexagonal chain. The trimer chain involves three sublattices with intracell and intercell hopping potentials $v$ and $w$, respectively. The generalized trimer chain incorporates the intracell hopping $v_1$ and $v_2$ and intercell hopping $w_1$ and $w_2$ to differentiate the hopping energies between different sublattices in the chain. The hexagonal chain is composed of six sublattices with intracell hopping potential $v$ and intercell hopping potential $w$. We utilize exact diagonalization to determine the bulk eigenvalues of the different models. We find that in the trimer and generalized trimer chain, the bulk eigenvalues exhibit conducting characteristics, independent of the hopping parameter, owing to the presence of a flat band situated along the Fermi energy. In the hexagonal chain, the bulk eigenvalues display semi-metallic characteristics in the region $v&lt;w$ and metallic when $v=0$. Furthermore, we investigate the presence of conducting edge states in the finite chains. The trimer and hexagonal chains show the presence of topologically protected edge states which are manifestations of one-dimensional topological insulators. We also established the bulk-boundary correspondence to calculate for the winding number that predicts the existence of localized edge states in the topological nontrivial phase.</description>

      <title>The spin lifetime of an individual atomic nucleus investigated via local-probe single-shot readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear spins owe their long-lived magnetic states to their excellent isolation from their environment. At the same time, a limited degree of interaction with their surroundings is necessary for reading and writing the spin state. Detailed knowledge of and control over the atomic environment of a nuclear spin is therefore key to optimizing conditions for quantum information applications. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), combined with electron spin resonance (ESR), provides atomic-scale information of individual nuclear spins via the hyperfine interaction. While this approach proved successful in mapping the nuclear spin energy levels, insight in its intrinsic behaviour in the time domain remain limited. Here, we demonstrate single-shot readout of an individual $^{\text{49}}$Ti nuclear spin with an STM. Employing a pulsed measurement scheme, we find its intrinsic lifetime to be 5.3 $\pm$ 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, we shed light on reveal the pumping and relaxation mechanism of the nuclear spin by investigating its response to both ESR driving and DC tunneling current, which is supported by model calculations involving flip-flop interactions with the electron spin in the same atom. These findings give an atomic-scale insight into the nature of nuclear spin relaxation and are relevant for the development of atomically-assembled qubit platforms.</description>

      <title>Simulation and measurement of stray fields for the manipulation of spin-qubits in one- and two-dimensional arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inhomogeneous magnetic stray field of micromagnets has been extensively used to manipulate electron spin qubits. By means of micromagnetic simulations and scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy, we show that the polycrystallinity of the magnet and non-uniform magnetization significantly impact the stray field and corresponding qubit properties. We find that the random orientation of the crystal axis in polycrystalline Co magnets alters the qubit frequencies by up to 0.5 GHz, compromising single qubit addressability and single gate fidelities. We map the stray field of Fe micromagnets with an applied magnetic field of up to 500 mT (mimicking conditions when operating qubits), finding field gradients above 1 mT/nm. The measured gradients and the lower magnetocrystalline anisotropy of Fe demonstrate the advantage of using Fe instead of Co for magnets in spin qubit devices. These properties of Fe also enabled us to design a 2D arrangement of nanomagnets for driving spin qubits distributed on a 2D lattice.</description>

      <title>Low-Temperature Heat Transport under Phonon Confinement in Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat transport in bulk materials is well described using the Debye theory of 3D vibrational modes (phonons) and the acoustic match model. However, in cryogenic nanodevices, phonon wavelengths exceed device dimensions, leading to confinement effects that standard models fail to address. With the growing application of low-temperature devices in communication, sensing, and quantum technologies, there is an urgent need for models that accurately describe heat transport under confinement. We introduce a computational approach to obtain phonon heat capacity and heat transport rates between solids in various confined geometries, that can be easily integrated into, e.g., the standard two-temperature model.
  Confinement significantly reduces heat capacity and may slow down heat transport. We have validated our model in experiments on strongly disordered NbTiN superconducting nanostructures, widely used in highly efficient single-photon detectors, and we argue that confinement is due to their polycrystalline granular structure. These findings point to potential advances in cryogenic device performance through tailored material and microstructure engineering.</description>

      <title>High frequency breakdown in quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic quantum dots are known to generate very accurate currents and can be used as a source of single electron wavepackets for use in quantum metrology, sensing or information processing. To realise their full technological potential, it is desirable to maximise the frequency of operation to increase the current. However, it has been observed that the mechanism of electron transfer across the quantum dot consistently breaks down for GHz frequencies, and this remains unexplained. Here, we present a novel analysis technique, combined with detailed modelling, to present a mechanism of high frequency breakdown in quantum dots as a rapidly-imparted momentum impulse. Such understanding aids future design and operation protocols, allowing their use in high frequency and real time quantum measurements and technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kinetic Theory of the Linear Response for Weakly Disordered Multiband Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum kinetic theory of the linear response to an electric field is provided from a controlled expansion of the Keldysh theory at leading order, for a general multiband electron system with weak scalar disorder. The response is uniquely partitioned into intraband distribution functions and interband quantum coherences. A new explicit formula is provided for the latter, outlining their true nature as local slave quantities, for which the mesoscopic gradients of the former is uncovered as a new source term. The precise connection with the Kubo formula with vertex corrections in the ladder approximation is established. A pedagogical application to spin-orbit torque theory in the two dimensional electron gas demonstrates the striking efficiency of the new formalism. Some important implications for the theory of orbital transport are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the electronic properties of TiO$_2$ monolayers for solar driven catalysis through transition metal doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Substitutional doping with transition metals is carried out in the Lepidocrocite phase - the stable monolayer geometry of TiO$_2$, using density functional theory (DFT) methods. The doping is carried out at the differently coordinated O atom cites, producing Janus monolayer geometries. Our results indicate that key fundamental properties for photocatalysis can be tuned via doping. Monolayers doped with Ag, Au, Pd and Pt are thermodynamically stable, amongst all considered doping possibilities, as evident from phonon band structure calculations. Electronic structure of the Janus monolayers alters significantly, compared to pristine TiO$_2$, owing to the emergence of mid-gap states. Reduced band gap arises from upward shift of the valence band, suggesting enhanced visible-light response. Dopant atoms also introduce excess electrons in TiO$_2$ monolayers, which are found to localize at a single Ti site. This induces ferromagnetism in the doped monolayers. Furthermore, charge separation between TiO$_2$ and noble metal dopants is observed which is a key parameter in influencing the selectivity and activity of photocatalytic materials. Compared to the pristine TiO$_2$ monolayer, the Janus structure can promote water adsorption, and the Janus monolayers exhibit significantly improved activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction. These findings suggest that engineering a novel Janus TiO$_2$-based monolayer with a noble metal layer on the other surface can offer a potential approach to improve photocatalytic performance over pristine TiO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Optical modeling, solver, and design of wafer-scale single-enantiomer carbon nanotube film and reconfigurable chiral photonic device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of circularly polarized light with chiral matter and functional devices enables novel phenomena and applications. Recently, wafer-scale solid-state single-enantiomer carbon nanotube (CNT) films have become feasible and are emerging as a chiral photonic material platform thanks to their quantum-confinement-induced optical properties and facile scalable assembly. However, optical modeling, solver, and device design tools for such materials are non-existent. Here, we prepare wafer-scale single-enantiomer (6,5) and (11,-5) randomly oriented CNT films and create an optical material model based on measured experimental optical spectra. We also implement a highly-parallel graphic-processing-unit accelerated transfer matrix solver for general bi-anisotropic materials and layered structures. Further, we demonstrate reconfigurable chiral photonic devices in a heterostructure with phase change materials through machine learning-enabled efficient gradient-based inverse design and optimization. Our developed full stack of a chiral photonic material and device hardware platform and a corresponding high-performance differential-programming-enabled solver opens the door for future chiral photonic devices and applications based on single-enantiomer CNT films.</description>

      <title>Bodge: Python package for efficient tight-binding modeling of superconducting nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bodge is a free and open-source Python package for constructing large-scale real-space tight-binding models for calculations in condensed matter physics. "Large-scale" means that it should remain performant even for lattices with millions of atoms, and "real-space" means that the model is formulated in terms of individual lattice sites and not in momentum space, for example.
  Although general tight-binding models can be constructed with this package, the main focus is on the Bogoliubov-De Gennes ("BoDGe") Hamiltonian used to model superconductivity in the clean limit. The package is designed to be easy to use, flexible, and extensible - and very few lines of code are required to model heterostructures containing, e.g., conventional and unconventional superconductors, ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, altermagnetism, and spin-orbit coupling.
  In other words: If you want a lattice model for superconducting nanostructures, and want something that is computationally efficient yet easy to use, Bodge should be a good choice.</description>

      <title>Superradiance of strongly interacting dipolar excitons in moir\'e quantum materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e lattices created in two-dimensional heterostructures exhibit rich many-body physics of interacting electrons and excitons and, at the same time, suggest promising optoelectronic applications. Here, we study the cooperative radiance of moir\'e excitons that is demonstrated to emerge from the deep subwavelength nature of the moir\'e lattice and the strong excitonic onsite interaction. In particular, we show that the static dipole-dipole interaction between interlayer excitons can strongly affect their cooperative optical properties, suppressing superradiance of disordered states while enhancing superradiance of ordered phases of moir\'e excitons. Moreover, we show that doping permits direct control of optical cooperativity, e.g., by generating supperradiant dynamics of otherwise subradiant states of excitons. Our results show that interlayer moir\'e excitons offer a unique platform for exploring cooperative optical phenomena in strongly interacting many-body systems, thus, holding promise for applications in quantum nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Anomalously extended Floquet prethermal lifetimes and applications to long-time quantum sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet prethermalization is observed in periodically driven quantum many-body systems where the system avoids heating and maintains a stable, non-equilibrium state, for extended periods. Here we introduce a novel quantum control method using off-resonance and short-angle excitation to significantly extend Floquet prethermal lifetimes. This is demonstrated on randomly positioned, dipolar-coupled, 13C nuclear spins in diamond, but the methodology is broadly applicable. We achieve a lifetime $T_2'~800 s at 100 K while tracking the transition to the prethermal state quasi-continuously. This corresponds to a &gt;533,000-fold extension over the bare spin lifetime without prethermalization, and constitutes a new record both in terms of absolute lifetime as well as the total number of Floquet pulses applied (here exceeding 7 million). Using Laplace inversion, we develop a new form of noise spectroscopy that provides insights into the origin of the lifetime extension. Finally, we demonstrate applications of these extended lifetimes in long-time, reinitialization-free quantum sensing of time-varying magnetic fields continuously for ~10 minutes at room temperature. Our work facilitates new opportunities for stabilizing driven quantum systems through Floquet control, and opens novel applications for continuously interrogated, long-time responsive quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic process for upconversion photoluminescence via $K$-momentum phonon coupling in carbon nanotubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the intrinsic microscopic mechanism of photon upconversion in air-suspended single-walled carbon nanotubes through photoluminescence and upconversion photoluminescence spectroscopy. Nearly linear excitation power dependence of upconversion photoluminescence intensity is observed, indicating a one-photon process as the underlying mechanism. In addition, we find a strongly anisotropic response to the excitation polarization which reflects the intrinsic nature of the upconversion process. In upconversion photoluminescence excitation spectra, three peaks are observed which are similar to photoluminescence sidebands of the $K$-momentum dark singlet exciton. The features in the upconversion photoluminescence excitation spectra are well reproduced by our second-order exciton-phonon interaction model, enabling the determination of phonon energies and relative amplitudes. The analysis reveals that the upconversion photoluminescence can be described as a reverse process of the sideband emission linked to the $K$-momentum phonon modes. The validity of our model is further reinforced by temperature-dependent upconversion photoluminescence excitation measurements reflecting variations in the phonon population. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of the resonant exciton-phonon coupling in pristine carbon nanotubes and presents potential for advanced optothermal technologies by engineering the excitation pathways.</description>

Abstract: Diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) have attracted significant attention for their potential in spintronic applications. Particularly, magnetically-doped GaN is highly attractive due to its high relevance for the CMOS industry and the possibility of developing advanced spintronic devices which are fully compatible with the current industrial procedures. Despite this interest, there remains a need to investigate the spintronic parameters that characterize interfaces within these systems. Here, we perform spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) measurements to evaluate the spin transfer at a Pt/(Ga,Mn)N interface. We determine the transparency of the interface through the estimation of the real part of the spin mixing conductance finding $G_r = 2.6\times 10^{14} \, \Omega^{-1} m^{-2}$, comparable to state-of-the-art yttrium iron garnet (YIG)/Pt interfaces. Moreover, the magnetic ordering probed by SMR above the (Ga,Mn)N Curie temperature TC provides a broader temperature range for the efficient generation and detection of spin currents, relaxing the conditions for this material to be applied in new spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Loop unitary and phase band topological invariant in generic multi-band Chern insulators</title>

Abstract: Quench dynamics of topological phases have been studied in the past few years and dynamical topological invariants are formulated in different ways. Yet most of these invariants are limited to minimal systems in which Hamiltonians are expanded by Gamma matrices. Here we generalize the dynamical 3-winding-number in two-band systems into the one in generic multi-band Chern insulators and prove that its value is equal to the difference of Chern numbers between post-quench and pre-quench Hamiltonians. Moreover we obtain an expression of this dynamical 3-winding-number represented by gapless fermions in phase bands depending only on the phase and its projectors, so it is generic for the quench of all multi-band Chern insulators. Besides, we obtain a multifold fermion in the phase band in (k, t) space by quenching a three-band model, which cannot happen for two band models.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetoelectric coupling of three dimensional Chern insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orbital magnetoelectric effect is closely related to the band topology of bulk crystalline insulators. Typical examples include the half quantized Chern-Simons orbital magnetoelectric coupling in three dimensional (3D) axion insulators and topological insulators, which are the hallmarks of their nontrivial bulk band topology. While the Chern-Simons coupling is well defined only for insulators with zero Chern number, the orbital magnetoelectric effects in 3D Chern insulators with nonzero (layer) Chern numbers are still open questions. In this work, we propose a never-mentioned quantization rule for the layer-resolved orbital magnetoelectric response in 3D Chern insulators, the gradient of which is exactly quantized in unit of $e^2/h$. By theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the quantized orbital magnetoelectric response remains robust for various types of interlayer hoppings and stackings, even against disorder and lack of symmetries. We argue that the robustness has a topological origin and protected by layer Chern number. It is thus promising to observe the proposed quantized orbital magnetoelectric response in a slab of 3D Chern insulator thanks to recent experimental developments.</description>

      <title>In-situ monitoring the magnetotransport signature of topological transitions in the chiral magnet Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging magnetic fields related to the presence of topologically protected spin textures such as skyrmions are expected to give rise to additional, topology-related contributions to the Hall effect. In order to doubtlessly identify this so-called topological Hall effect, it is crucial to disentangle such contributions from the anomalous Hall effect. This necessitates a direct correlation of the transversal Hall voltage with the underlying magnetic textures. We utilize a novel measurement platform that allows to acquire high-resolution Lorentz transmission electron microscopy images of magnetic textures as a function of an external magnetic field and to concurrently measure the (anomalous) Hall voltage in-situ in the microscope on one and the same specimen. We use this approach to investigate the transport signatures of the chiral soliton lattice and antiskyrmions in Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn. Notably, the observed textures allow to fully understand the measured Hall voltage without the need of any additional contributions due to a topological Hall effect, and the field-controlled formation and annihilation of anstiskyrmions are found to have no effect on the measurend Hall voltage.</description>

      <title>Slow Equilibrium Relaxation in a Chiral Magnet Mediated by Topological Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed a pump-probe experiment on the chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ to study the relaxation dynamics of its non-collinear magnetic orders, employing a millisecond magnetic field pulse as the pump and resonant elastic x-ray scattering as the probe. Our findings reveal that the system requires $\sim$0.2 s to stabilize after the perturbation applied to both the conical and skyrmion lattice phase; significantly slower than the typical nanosecond timescale observed in micromagnetics. This prolonged relaxation is attributed to the formation and slow dissipation of local topological defects, such as emergent monopoles. By unveiling the experimental lifetime of these emergent singularities in a non-collinear magnetic system, our study highlights a universal relaxation mechanism in solitonic textures within the slow dynamics regime, offering new insights into topological physics and advanced information storage solutions.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocity is necessary for robust dimensional reduction and strong responses in stochastic topological systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16720v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological theory predicts the necessary conditions for robust dimensional reduction in a host of quantum and classical systems. Models have recently been proposed for stochastic systems which describe many biological and chemical phenomena. However, general theoretical principles are lacking for this class of systems, exemplified by the breakdown of the celebrated bulk-edge correspondence. We prove that contrary to topological phases in quantum and many classical systems, stochastic systems require non-reciprocal (or non-Hermitian) transitions for robust edge responses, which holds across all dimensions and geometries. We propose a novel explanation of hybridization that destroys edge responses in reciprocal (Hermitian) stochastic systems. Further, we show that stochastic steady states grow dramatically with non-reciprocity, in contrast to their quantum counterparts which plateaus. We analyze the resulting theoretical and physical consequences and how non-reciprocity mitigates the effects of hybridization towards robust edge states in equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states. These results establish the crucial role of non-reciprocal interactions for responses that are robust to random perturbations in active and living matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09074v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the frictional force arising from quantum fluctuations when two dissipative metallic plates are set in a shear motion. While early studies showed that the electromagnetic fields in the quantum friction setup reach nonequilibrium steady states, yielding a time-independent force, other works have demonstrated the failure to attain steady states, leading to instability and time-varying friction under sufficiently low-loss conditions. Here, we develop a fully quantum-mechanical theory without perturbative approximations and unveil the transition from stable to unstable regimes of the quantum friction setup. Due to the relative motion of the plates, their electromagnetic response may be active in some conditions, resulting in optical gain. We prove that the standard fluctuation-dissipation leads to inconsistent results when applied to our system, and, in particular, it predicts a vanishing frictional force. Using a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation tailored for gain media, we calculate the frictional force in terms of the system Green's function, thereby recovering early works on quantum friction. Remarkably, we also find that the frictional force diverges to infinity as the relative velocity of the plates approaches a threshold. This threshold is determined by the damping strength and the distance between the metal surfaces. Beyond this critical velocity, the system exhibits instability, akin to the behaviour of a laser cavity, where no steady state exists. In such a scenario, the frictional force escalates exponentially. Our findings pave the way for experimental exploration of the frictional force in proximity to this critical regime.</description>

      <title>Certifying the quantumness of a nuclear spin qudit through its uniform precession</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin precession is a textbook example of dynamics of a quantum system that exactly mimics its classical counterpart. Here we challenge this view by certifying the quantumness of exotic states of a nuclear spin through its uniform precession. The key to this result is measuring the positivity, instead of the expectation value, of the $x$-projection of the precessing spin, and using a spin &gt; 1/2 qudit, that is not restricted to semi-classical spin coherent states. The experiment is performed on a single spin-7/2 $^{123}$Sb nucleus, implanted in a silicon nanoelectronic device, amenable to high-fidelity preparation, control, and projective single-shot readout. Using Schr\"odinger cat states and other bespoke states of the nucleus, we violate the classical bound by 19 standard deviations, proving that no classical probability distribution can explain the statistic of this spin precession, and highlighting our ability to prepare quantum resource states with high fidelity in a single atomic-scale qudit.</description>
