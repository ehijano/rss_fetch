      <title>Minimal Bounded Speedups of Toeplitz Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate minimal bounded speedups of Toeplitz flows. We demonstrate that the minimal bounded speedup of a Toeplitz flow need not be another Toeplitz flow and describe techniques for determining whether the resulting speedup is Toeplitz. We also provide sufficient conditions to guarantee that the minimal bounded speedup will be a Toeplitz flow.</description>

      <title>Delayed Interactions in Active Agents: Stability and Formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active agents with time-delayed interactions arise naturally in various real-world systems, such as biological systems, transportation networks and robotic swarms. Such systems are typically modeled as Delay Differential Equations (DDEs) that incorporate inertial effects. In this paper, we investigate the stability of pattern formation of active agents with inertia and time delays, in both uncoupled and coupled scenarios. We derive and analyze a high-dimensional linear DDE model that characterizes the stability of such formations. Starting with the uncoupled scenario, where agents are driven only by a virtual leader, we describe the stability spectrum and provide conditions for the delay-independent (absolute) stability of the formations, as well as delay-dependent stability and unstable hyperbolic behavior. Different cases correspond to distinct universality classes of the corresponding spectrum. For the coupled scenario, where agents are driven by both the virtual leader and inter-agent interactions, we consider both symmetric and non-symmetric coupling topologies. Here we also provide an explicit spectrum classification, including the absolute stability criterion. Additionally, we investigate interactions in the large-delay limit, where delays affect inter-agent coupling, while local feedback remains instantaneous. In this limit, we prove rigorously that the stability region in the complex plane of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix converges to a circle centered at the origin, a phenomenon previously observed in delay-coupled networks. Our findings provide a universal framework for understanding stable formations and motions of active agents with delayed interactions.</description>

      <title>Irrational eigenvalues of D-Dimensional Cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular automata are dynamical systems defined on lattices and commuting with the Bernoulli shift. In this work, we focus on the spectral properties of D-dimensional cellular automata. We give a characterization of their spectrum from both topological and ergodic point of view. The main results of the paper show the impossibility for a cellular automaton with a fully blocking pattern to have a measurable irrational eigenvalues. Further more, a cellular automaton with a set of equicontinuity points of positive measure cannot have a measurable irrational eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>Profinite approach to S-adic shift spaces I: Saturating directive sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a series of three, about (relatively)
  free profinite semigroups and S-adic representations of minimal
  shift spaces. We associate to each primitive S-adic directive
  sequence ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ a $\textit{profinite image}$ in the free profinite
  semigroup over the alphabet of the induced minimal shift space. When
  this profinite image contains a $\mathcal{J}$-maximal maximal subgroup
  of the free profinite semigroup (which, up to isomorphism, is called
  the $\textit{Sch\"utzenberger group}$ of the shift space), we say that
  ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ is $\textit{saturating}$. We show that if ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ is
  recognizable, then it is saturating. Conversely, we use the notion
  of saturating sequence to obtain several sufficient conditions for
  ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ to be recognizable: ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ consists of pure encodings;
  or ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ is eventually recognizable, saturating and consists of
  encodings; or ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ is eventually recognizable, recurrent,
  bounded and consists of encodings. For the most part, we do not
  assume that ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ has finite alphabet rank although we establish
  that this combinatorial property has important algebraic
  consequences, namely that the rank of the Sch\"utzenberger group is
  also finite, whose maximum possible value we also determine.
  We also show that for every minimal shift space of finite topological rank, the rank of its Sch\"utzenberger group is a lower bound of the topological rank.</description>

      <title>Chaos on Peano continua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing the result of Agronsky and Ceder (1991), we prove that every Peano continuum admits a continuous transformation that is exact Devaney chaotic; that is, it has a dense set of periodic points, and every nonempty open set covers the entire space in finitely many iterations. We identify a natural class of Peano continua, containing all one-dimensional continua and all absolute neighborhood retracts, which allows us to create locally small perturbations. Using this method, we prove that within these specific classes of continua, exact Devaney chaotic systems are dense in all chain transitive systems, mixing systems are generic among chain transitive systems and shadowing is generic among all continuous systems.</description>

      <title>On the Piecewise Holomorphic Systems with Three Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study piecewise-smooth systems with three zones, $\dot{z} = f_i(z)$, $i = 1,2,3,$ whose discontinuity set $\Sigma$ consists either of a pair of parallel lines or a pair of circles tangent to each other internally or externally. Each $f_i:\overline{\mathbb{C}} \to \overline{\mathbb{C}}$ is assumed to be a holomorphic function. We establish conditions ensuring the existence of limit cycles in such systems and provide lower bounds for the maximum number of limit cycle. Our approach combines the Melnikov method, local integrability properties of holomorphic systems, and the existence of normal forms around zeros and poles.</description>

      <title>On the reducibility of the 1d quantum harmonic oscillator with a quasi-periodic bounded potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the decay along the diagonal of the matrix representing the perturbation with respect to the Hermite basis, we prove a reducibility result in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ for the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator perturbed by time quasi-periodic potential, via a KAM iteration. The potential is only bounded (no decay at infinity is required) and its derivative with respect to the spatial variable $x$ is allowed to grow at most like $|x|^\delta$ when $x$ goes to infinity, where the power $\delta&lt;1$ is arbitrary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce {\it (W')-specification} in terms of language decompositions of subshifts, and show that any recurrence set of a subshift with this property has full Hausdorff dimension. Our main result applies to a wide class of subshifts without specification, such as all $S$-gap shifts, some coded shifts, and the coding space of any transitive piecewise monotonic interval map with positive entropy. Further, for a wide class of piecewise expanding interval maps we show that any recurrence set has full Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing flows from the orbit space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give some simple conditions under which a group acting on a bifoliated plane comes from the induced action of a pseudo-Anosov flow on its orbit space. An application of the strategy is a less technical proof of a result of Barbot that the induced action of an Anosov flow on its orbit space uniquely determines the flow up to orbit equivalence. In another application, we recover an expansive flow on a 3-manifold from the action of a group on a \emph{loom space} as defined by Schleimer and Segerman.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity for the randomly forced Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to investigate ergodicity of the randomly forced Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers(KdVB) equation driven by non-additive white noise. Under reasonable conditions, we show that exponential ergodicity for KdVB equation driven by a space-time localised noise and ergodicity for KdVB equation driven by a multiplicative white noise. Our proof is based on some newly developed analytical properties for KdVB equation, such as Carleman estimate, truncated observability inequality, Foia\c{s}-Prodi estimate. Combining these analytical properties with coupling method and asymptotic coupling method, we can investigate the long time behavior of randomly forced KdVB equation.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Predation on the Dynamics of Chronic Wasting Disease in Deer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a neurological disease impacting deer, elk, moose, and other cervid populations and is caused by a misfolded protein known as a prion. CWD is difficult to control due to the persistence of prions in the environment. Prions can remain infectious for more than a decade and have been found in soil as well as other environmental vectors, such as ticks and plants. Here, we provide a bifurcation analysis of a mathematical model of CWD spread in a cervid population, and use a modification of the Gillespie algorithm to explore if wolves can be used as an ecological control strategy to limit the spread of the disease in several relevant scenarios. We then analytically compute the probability that the disease spreads given one infected member enters a fully healthy population and the probability of elimination, given a fully susceptible population and remaining prions in the environment. From our analysis, we conclude that wolves can be used as an effective control strategy to limit the spread of CWD in cervid populations, and hunting or other means of lowering the susceptible population are beneficial to controlling the spread of CWD, although it is important to note that inferring biologically relevant parameters from the existing data is an ongoing challenge for this system.</description>

      <title>Minimal surface entropy and applications of Ricci flow on finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies minimal surface entropy (the exponential asymptotic growth of the number of minimal surfaces up to a given value of area) for negatively curved metrics on hyperbolic $3$-manifolds of finite volume, particularly its comparison to the hyperbolic minimal surface entropy in terms of sectional and scalar curvature.
  On one hand, for metrics that are bilipschitz equivalent to the hyperbolic metric and have sectional curvature bounded above by $-1$ and uniformly bounded below, we show that the entropy achieves its minimum if and only if the metric is hyperbolic.
  On the other hand, by analyzing the convergence rate of the Ricci flow toward the hyperbolic metric, we prove that among all metrics with scalar curvature bounded below by $-6$ and with non-positive sectional curvature on the cusps, the entropy is maximized at the hyperbolic metric, provided that it is infinitesimally rigid. Furthermore, if the metrics are uniformly $C^0$-close to the hyperbolic metric and asymptotically cusped, then the entropy associated with the Lebesgue measure is uniquely maximized at the hyperbolic metric.</description>

      <title>A noncommutative Ruelle's Theorem for a normalized potential taking values on positivity-improving operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let \(\mathcal{A}\) be a finite-dimensional real (or complex) C*-algebra, \(\Omega_{A}\) an aperiodic subshift of finite type, and \(\mathcal{C}(\Omega_{A}; \mathcal{A})\) the set of continuous functions from \(\Omega_{A}\) to \(\mathcal{A}\). The shift $\sigma$ provides dynamics. Given a real Lipschitz potential $\varphi\in \mathcal{C}(\Omega_{A}; \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{A}))$, where $\mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{A})$ is the set of linear operators acting on a real $\mathcal{A}$, we introduce a noncommutative analogue of Ruelle's operator, which acts on \(\mathcal{C}(\Omega_{A}; \mathcal{A})\). Assuming the positivity-improving hypothesis, we prove a version of Ruelle's Theorem whenever the operator is normalized. An eigenstate (a linear functional) invariant for the action of the noncommutative Ruelle's operator will play the role of the Gibbs probability of Thermodynamic Formalism; to be called a Gibbs eigenstate. We introduce the concept of entropy for a Gibbs eigenstate (obtained from a certain family of potentials $\varphi$) - generalizing the classical one. In our setting, there is currently no direct relationship with cocycles and Lyapunov exponents. We present examples illustrating the novelty of the cases that can be considered, ranging from topics related to quantum channels to Pauli matrices. Interesting cases: $\mathcal{A}=M_{N \times N}(\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathcal{A}= \mathbb{R}^{N}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we show that the quasi-free flows on the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_2$ are generically classifiable by the inverse temperature of their unique KMS state. Along the way, we show that a large class of quasi-free flows on the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_n$ are generically equivariantly $\mathcal{Z}$-stable and their corresponding dual action has the Rokhlin property generically.</description>

      <title>On the numerical computation of $R_0$ in periodic environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to approximate the basic reproduction number $R_0$ as spectral radius of the Next-Generation Operator in time-periodic population models by characterizing the latter via evolution semigroups. Once birth/infection and transition operators are identified, we discretize them via either Fourier or Chebyshev collocation methods. Then $R_0$ is obtained by solving a generalized matrix eigenvalue problem. The order of convergence of the approximating reproduction numbers to the true one is shown to depend on the regularity of the model coefficients, and spectral accuracy is proved. We validate the theoretical results by discussing applications to epidemiology, viz. a large-size multi-group epidemic model with periodic contact rates, and a vector-borne disease model with seasonal vector recruitment. We illustrate how the method facilitates implementation compared to existing approaches and how it can be easily adapted to also compute type-reproduction numbers.</description>

      <title>Designing learning in high dimensional oscillator networks with low dimensional read-out</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate how to configure an oscillator network based reservoir computer with a high number of oscillators and a low dimensional read-out. The read-out is a function on the average phases with respect to each oscillator population. Hence, this read-out provides a robust measurement of the oscillator states. We consider a low number of populations which leads to a low-dimensional read-out. Here, the task is time-series prediction. The input time-series is introduced via a forcing term. After a training phase the input is learned. Importantly, the training weights are introduced in the forcing term meaning that the oscillator network is left untouched. Hence, we can apply classical methods for oscillator networks. Here, we consider the continuum limit for Kuramoto oscillators by using the Ott-Antonsen Ansatz. The success and failure of the reservoir computer is then studied by bifurcations in the coupling and forcing parameter space. We will also show that the average phase read-out can naturally arise when considering the read-out on the phase states. Finally, we give numerical evidence that at least 4 oscillator populations are necessary to learn chaotic target dynamics.</description>

      <title>The distribution of intersections in $\mathrm{SL}(3, \mathbb{Z}) \backslash \mathrm{SL}(3, \mathbb{R})$ and lattices related to roots of cubic congruences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we study the distribution of the intersections between certain translates of closed orbits of the positive diagonal subgroup in $\mathrm{SL}(3, \mathbb{Z}) \backslash \mathrm{SL}(3, \mathbb{R})$ with a maximal parabolic subgroup. These intersections are closely connected to roots of congruences for certain monic, irreducible cubic polynomials $F(X) \in \mathbb{Z}[X]$. The the main result is that the intersections, considered as a sequences in the diagonal subgroup and the parabolic subgroup, are jointly equidistributed. This implies that certain affine lattices determined by pairs of roots of the cubic congruences are jointly equidistributed with corresponding ideals in the associated ring of integers. We note that the techniques here roughly parallel those which has been developed to study the multidimensional Farey sequence, and one hopes that techniques to study roots of congruences will continue to develop.</description>

      <title>Finite-time consensus in a compromise process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A compromise process describes the evolution of opinions through binary interactions. Opinions are real numbers, and in each step, two randomly selected agents reach a compromise, namely, they acquire the average of their pre-interaction opinions. We prove that if the number $N$ of agents is a power of two, the consensus emerges after a finite number of compromise events with probability one; otherwise, the consensus cannot be reached in a finite number of steps (if initial opinions are in a general position). The number of steps required to reach consensus is random for $N=2^k$ with $k\geq 2$. We prove that typically, the smallest number of steps to reach consensus is equal to $k\cdot 2^{k-1}$. For $N=4$, we determine the distribution of the number of steps, e.g., we show that it has a purely exponential tail and compute all cumulants.</description>

      <title>Computation of Feasible Assume-Guarantee Contracts: A Resilience-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a resilience-based framework for computing feasible assume-guarantee contracts that ensure the satisfaction of temporal specifications in interconnected discrete-time systems. Interconnection effects are modeled as structured disturbances. We use a resilience metric, the maximum disturbance under which local specifications hold, to refine assumptions and guarantees across subsystems iteratively. For two subsystems, we demonstrate correctness, monotone refinement of guarantees, and that the resulting assumptions are maximal within ball-shaped sets. Additionally, we extend our approach to general networks of L subsystems using weighted combinations of interconnection effects. We instantiate the framework on linear systems by meeting finite-horizon safety, exact-time reachability, and finite-time reachability specifications, and on nonlinear systems by fulfilling general finite-horizon specifications. Our approach is demonstrated through numerical linear examples, and a nonlinear DC Microgrid case study, showcasing the impact of our framework in verifying temporal logic specifications with compositional reasoning.</description>

      <title>Divisibility by $p$ for Markoff-like Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study orbits in a family of Markoff-like surfaces with extra off-diagonal terms over prime fields $\mathbb{F}_p$. It is shown that, for a typical surface of this form, every non-trivial orbit has size divisible by $p$. This extends a theorem of W.Y. Chen from the Markoff surface itself to others in this family. The proof closely follows and elaborates on a recent argument of D.E. Martin. We expect that there is just one orbit generically. For some special parameters, we prove that there are at least two or four orbits. Cayley's cubic surface plays a role in parametrising the exceptional cases and dictating the number of solutions mod $p$.</description>

      <title>Prospects for acoustically monitoring ecosystem tipping points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many ecosystems can undergo important qualitative changes, including sudden transitions to alternative stable states, in response to perturbations or increments in conditions. Such 'tipping points' are often preceded by declines in aspects of ecosystem resilience, namely the capacity to recover from perturbations, that leave various spatial and temporal signatures. These so-called 'early warning signals' have been used to anticipate transitions in diverse real systems, but many of the high-throughput, autonomous monitoring technologies that are transforming ecology have yet to be fully leveraged to this end. Acoustic monitoring in particular is a powerful tool for quantifying biodiversity, tracking ecosystem health, and facilitating conservation. By deploying acoustic recorders in diverse environments, researchers have gained insights from the calls and behaviour of individual species to higher-level soundscape features that describe habitat quality and even predict species occurrence. Here, we draw on theory and practice to advocate for using acoustics to probe ecosystem resilience and identify emerging and established early warning signals of tipping points. With a focus on pragmatic considerations, we emphasise that despite limits to tipping point theory and the current scale and transferability of data, acoustics could be instrumental in understanding resilience and tipping potential across distinct ecosystems and scales.</description>

      <title>BoolForge: Random Generation and Analysis of Boolean Functions and Networks in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boolean networks are a powerful and popular modeling framework in systems biology, enabling the study of complex processes underlying gene regulation, signal transduction, and cellular decision-making. Most biological networks exhibit a high degree of canalization, a property of the Boolean update rules that stabilizes network dynamics. Despite its importance, existing software packages provide hardly any support for generating Boolean networks with defined canalization properties.
  We present BoolForge, a Python toolbox for the analysis and random generation of Boolean functions and networks, with a particular focus on canalization. BoolForge allows users to (i) generate random Boolean functions with specified canalizing depth, layer structure, or other structural constraints; (ii) construct random Boolean networks with tunable topological and functional properties; and (iii) compute structural and dynamical features including network attractors, robustness, and modularity. BoolForge enables researchers to rapidly prototype biological Boolean network models, explore the relationship between structure and dynamics, and generate ensembles of networks for statistical analysis. It is lightweight, adaptable, and fully compatible with existing Boolean network analysis tools.
  BoolForge is implemented in Python (version3.8+), with no platform-specific dependencies. The software is distributed under the MIT License and will be maintained for at least two years following publication. Source code, documentation, and tutorial notebooks are freely available at: https://github.com/ckadelka/BoolForge.

      <description>arXiv:2312.15378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish functional limit theorems for ergodic sums of observables with power singularities for expanding circle maps. In the regime where the observables have infinite variance, we show that when rescaled by $N^{1/s}(\ln N)^\alpha$, the partial sum process has limit points consisting precisely of increasing piecewise constant functions with finitely many jumps. Our approach combines trimming techniques with a multiple Borel-Cantelli argument. It provides a functional law of the iterated logarithm for heavy-tailed processes where classical almost sure invariance principles do not apply.</description>

      <title>Weighted multiple ergodic averages via analytic observables over $ \mathbb{T}^\infty $: Is exponential pointwise convergence universal?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02866v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By employing an accelerated weighting method, we establish arbitrary polynomial and exponential pointwise convergence for multiple ergodic averages under general balancing conditions in both discrete and continuous settings, including quasi-periodic and almost periodic cases. This work breaks the well-known slow convergence rate observed in classical ergodic theory. We also present joint Diophantine rotations as explicit applications. Specifically, for the first time, by excluding nearly rational rotations with zero measure, we address the fundamental question of whether exponential pointwise convergence via analytic observables is universal, even when multiplicatively averaging over the infinite-dimensional torus $ \mathbb{T}^\infty $. We achieve this by introducing an innovative approach that effectively overcomes the previous difficulties. Moreover, by constructing counterexamples concerning multiple ergodicity, we highlight the indispensability of the joint nonresonance and establish the optimality of our weighting method in preserving rapid convergence. We also provide numerical simulations and analysis to further illustrate and validate our results.</description>

Abstract: We prove that, on any closed manifold of dimension at least two with non-trivial first Betti number, a $C^\infty$ generic Riemannian metric has infinitely many closed geodesics, and indeed closed geodesics of arbitrarily large length. We derive this existence result combining a theorem of Ma\~n\'e together with the following new theorem of independent interest: the existence of minimal closed geodesics, in the sense of Aubry-Mather theory, implies the existence of a transverse homoclinic, and thus of a horseshoe, for the geodesic flow of a suitable $C^\infty$-close Riemannian metric.</description>

Abstract: Let $\{F_n, n\ge 8\}$ be a family of diffeomorphisms on real rational surfaces that are birationally equivalent to birational maps on $\mathbf{P}^2(\mathbb{R})$. In this article, we investigate the mapping classes of the diffeomorphisms $F_n, n\ge 8$. These diffeomorphisms are reducible with unique invariant irreducible curves, and we determine the mapping classes of their restrictions, $\hat F_n, n \ge 8$, on the cut surfaces, showing that they are pseudo-Anosov and do not arise from Penner's construction. For $n=8$, Lehmer's number is realized as the stretch factor of $\hat F_8$, a pseudo-Anosov map on a once-punctured genus $5$ orientable surface. The diffeomorphism $\hat F_8$ is a new geometric realization of a Lehmer's number.</description>

Abstract: Given a countable discrete amenable group, we study conditions under which a set map into a Banach space (or more generally, a complete semi-normed space) can be realized as the ergodic sum of a vector under a group representation, such that the realization is asymptotically indistinguishable from the original map. We show that for uniformly bounded group representations, this property is characterized by the class of bounded asymptotically additive set maps, extending previous work for sequences in Banach spaces and on the case of a single non-expansive linear map. Additionally, we develop a relative version of this characterization, identifying when the additive realization can be chosen within a prescribed target set. As an application, our results generalize central aspects of thermodynamic formalism, bridging the additive and asymptotically additive frameworks.</description>

      <title>Most Probable KAM Tori in Stochastic Hamiltonian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper conducts an in-depth investigation into the impact of stochastic perturbations-particularly multiplicative noise-on the integrable structures of Hamiltonian systems, with a central focus on developing a KAM theory for stochastic Hamiltonian dynamics. We begin by deriving the Onsager-Machlup functional for Hamiltonian systems driven by multiplicative noise and identifying the most probable transition paths of system trajectories. This analysis reveals the fundamental differences in how additive versus multiplicative noise influences the integrability of Hamiltonian systems. Building upon this, we establish a large deviation principle for the system and derive a rate function that quantitatively characterizes trajectory deviations, especially in the regime of rare events. The main contribution of this work lies in demonstrating that, under the small noise limit, the quasi-periodic invariant tori of the unperturbed system persist in a probabilistic sense, indicating the stability of KAM structures under stochastic perturbations. Furthermore, we show that the exponential rate of deviation from the invariant tori exactly matches the large deviation rate function, thus providing a quantitative characterization of the structural persistence and fluctuation geometry of quasi-periodic motions in stochastic Hamiltonian systems. These results extend the classical KAM framework to a stochastic setting and offer new insights into the behavior of complex dynamical systems under the influence of noise.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we survey physically related applications of a class of weighted quasi-Monte Carlo methods from a theoretical, deterministic perspective, and establish quantitative universal rapid convergence results via various regularity assumptions. Specifically, we introduce weighting with compact support to the Birkhoff ergodic averages of quasi-periodic, almost periodic, and periodic systems, thereby achieving universal rapid convergence, including both arbitrary polynomial and exponential types. This is in stark contrast to the typically slow convergence in classical ergodic theory. As new contributions, we not only discuss more general weighting functions but also provide quantitative improvements to existing results; the explicit regularity settings facilitate the application of these methods to specific problems. We also revisit the physically related problems and, for the first time, establish universal exponential convergence results for the weighted computation of Fourier coefficients, in both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional cases. In addition to the above, we explore results from a probabilistic perspective, including the weighted strong law of large numbers and the weighted central limit theorem, by building upon the historical results.</description>

      <title>Scaling of the rotation number for perturbations of rational rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parameter dependence of the rotation number in families of circle maps which are perturbations of rational rotations is described. We show that if, at a critical parameter value, the map is a (rigid) rotation $x\to x+\frac{p}{q}~({\rm mod}~1)$ with $p$ and $q$ coprime, then the rotation number is differentiable at that point provided a transversality condition holds, and hence that the rotation number scales linearly at this parameter. We provide an explicit and computable expression for the derivative in terms of the Fourier series of the map, and illustrate the results with the Arnold circle map and some modifications. Piecewise linear circle maps can also be treated using the same techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the version of the Lyapunov--Perron method operating on individual solutions to investigate the existence of invariant manifolds for non-autonomous dynamical systems, focusing in particular on inertial and stable manifolds. We establish a characterization of both types of manifolds in terms of solutions exhibiting a common growth behavior, analogous to the classical characterization involving hyperbolicity. Furthermore, we introduce a unified formulation of the gap condition, from which known sharp versions are derived. Finally, we show that the constructed inertial manifolds have $C^1$ regularity.</description>

      <title>Self-composition of Frobenius a real number of times, and some conjectures around Weil's Riemann hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety defined on a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. On $X$ there is a special morphism $Fr_X$, which raises coordinates to exponent $q$: $t\mapsto t^q$. The two main results in this paper are:
  Result 1: If Standard conjecture D holds on $X\times X$, then all polarised endomorphisms on $X$ are semisimple.
  Result 2: Being an endomorphism of $X$, we can compose $Fr_X$ a \textbf{positive integer} of times, for example $Fr_X^2=Fr_X\circ Fr_X$, $Fr_X^3=Fr_X\circ Fr_X\circ Fr_X$. On the cohomological level, we can define $(Fr_X^*)^s$ for all integers $s$. What if we can define $(Fr_X^*)^s$ for all \textbf{real numbers} $s$, in a good way (to be made precise later)? This short note presents an approach towards so-called Dynamical degree comparison conjecture and Norm comparison conjecture (allowing to bound the growth of the pullback of iterations of an endomorphism on cohomology groups in terms of that on algebraic cycles), for dominant rational maps and more generally dynamical correspondences, proposed previously by Fei Hu and the author, via such a possibility. The main upshot is a heuristic argument to show that the mentioned conjectures should follow from Standard conjecture D. All this discussion also holds if we replace $Fr_X$ by another polarised endomorphism on $X$.</description>

      <title>Real Rational Surface Automorphisms : Positivity and Linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the real dynamics of a family of rational surface automorphisms obtained from quadratic birational maps of $\pcc$ that preserve a cuspidal cubic and whose critical orbits have lengths $(1,m,n)$ with $1+m+n\ge 10$. Passing to the real locus and cutting along the invariant cubic, we obtain a diffeomorphism of an orientable surface whose fundamental group is free.
  Our key device is a finitely generated invariant, positive semigroup $S_{m,n}$ in the fundamental group on which an iterate of induced action acts by concatenation without cancellation. This positivity yields a nonnegative primitive transition matrix, so Perron-Frobenius theory supplies an explicit exponential growth rate $\lambda&gt;1$ for the induced action on the fundamental group. Consequently, the real map has positive topological entropy. We package the combinatorics of the generators in a ``Core-Tail Induction Principle," which allows us to treat simultaneously seven orbit-data families with only finite base checks. Finally, using Bestvina-Handel and the Dehn-Nielsen-Baer correspondence, we show that the induced outer automorphism with $m+n$ odd is realized by a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism of the cut surface.</description>

Abstract: We prove that a generic reservoir system admits a generalized synchronization that is a topological embedding of the input system's attractor. We also prove that for sufficiently high reservoir dimension (given by Nash's embedding theorem) there exists an isometric embedding generalized synchronization. The isometric embedding can be constructed explicitly when the reservoir system is linear.</description>

      <title>Bohr sets in sumsets I: Compact abelian groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.11997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a compact abelian group and $\phi_1, \phi_2, \phi_3$ be continuous endomorphisms on $G$. Under certain natural assumptions on the $\phi_i$'s, we prove the existence of Bohr sets in the sumset $\phi_1(A) + \phi_2(A) + \phi_3(A)$, where $A$ is either a set of positive Haar measure, or comes from a finite partition of $G$. The first result generalizes theorems of Bogolyubov and Bergelson-Ruzsa. As a variant of the second result, we show that for any partition $\mathbb{Z} = \bigcup_{i=1}^r A_i$, there exists an $i$ such that $A_i - A_i + sA_i$ contains a Bohr set for any $s \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{ 0 \}$. The latter is a step toward an open question of Katznelson and Ruzsa.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a normal projective variety admitting a polarized endomorphism $f$, i.e., $f^*H\sim qH$ for some ample divisor $H$ and integer $q&gt;1$. It was conjectured by Broustet and Gongyo that $X$ is of Calabi-Yau type, i.e., $(X,\Delta)$ is lc for some effective $\mathbb{Q}$-divisor such that $K_X+\Delta\sim_{\mathbb{Q}} 0$. In this paper, we establish a general guideline based on the equivariant minimal model program and the canonical bundle formula. In this way, we prove the conjecture when $X$ is a smooth projective threefold.</description>

      <title>Transforming Norm-based To Graph-based Spatial Representation for Spatio-Temporal Epidemiological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pandemics, with their profound societal and economic impacts, pose significant threats to global health, mortality rates, economic stability, and political landscapes. In response to these challenges, numerous studies have employed spatio-temporal models to enhance our understanding and management of these complex phenomena. These spatio-temporal models can be roughly divided into two main spatial categories: norm-based and graph-based. Norm-based models are usually more accurate and easier to model but are more computationally intensive and require more data to fit. On the other hand, graph-based models are less accurate and harder to model but are less computationally intensive and require fewer data to fit. As such, ideally, one would like to use a graph-based model while preserving the representation accuracy obtained by the norm-based model. In this study, we explore the ability to transform from norm-based to graph-based spatial representation for these models. We first show no analytical mapping between the two exists, requiring one to use approximation numerical methods instead. We introduce a novel framework for this task together with twelve possible implementations using a wide range of heuristic optimization approaches. Our findings show that by leveraging agent-based simulations and heuristic algorithms for the graph node's location and population's spatial walk dynamics approximation one can use graph-based spatial representation without losing much of the model's accuracy and expressiveness. We investigate our framework for three real-world cases, achieving 94\% accuracy preservation, on average. Moreover, an analysis of synthetic cases shows the proposed framework is relatively robust for changes in both spatial and temporal properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural physical, chemical, and biological dynamical systems are often complex, with heterogeneous components interacting in diverse ways. We show how simple graph neural networks can be designed to jointly learn the interaction rules and the latent heterogeneity from observable dynamics. The learned latent heterogeneity and dynamics can be used to virtually decompose the complex system which is necessary to infer and parameterize the underlying governing equations. We tested the approach with simulation experiments of interacting moving particles, vector fields, and signaling networks. While our current aim is to better understand and validate the approach with simulated data, we anticipate it to become a generally applicable tool to uncover the governing rules underlying complex dynamics observed in nature.</description>

Abstract: We study the property of uniform discreteness within discrete orbits of non-uniform lattices in $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$, acting on $\mathbb{R}^2$ by linear transformations. We provide quantitative consequences of previous results by using Diophantine properties. We give a partial result toward a conjecture of Leli\`evre regarding the set of long cylinder holonomy vectors of the "golden L" translation surface: for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, three points of this set can be found on a horizontal line within a distance of $\epsilon$ of each other.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of directed-cycle and catenary linear compartment models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A parameter of a mathematical model is structurally identifiable if it can be determined from noiseless experimental data. Here, we examine the identifiability properties of two important classes of linear compartmental models: directed-cycle models and catenary models (models for which the underlying graph is a directed cycle or a bidirected path, respectively). Our main result is a complete characterization of the directed-cycle models for which every parameter is (generically locally) identifiable. Additionally, for catenary models, we give a formula for their input-output equations. Such equations are used to analyze identifiability, so we expect our formula to support future analyses into the identifiability of catenary models. Our proofs rely on prior results on input-output equations, and we also use techniques from linear algebra and graph theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the semiring of abstract finite dynamical systems up to isomorphism, with the operations of alternative and synchronous execution. We continue searching for efficient algorithms for solving polynomial equations of the form $P(X) = B$, with a constant side B, with the goal of decomposing complex behaviors into simpler systems. Taking inspiration from the characterization of injective polynomials P over dynamical systems, which is based on a condition on the lengths of limit cycles of their coefficients, we introduce a more general notion of pseudo-injectivity by relaxing this constraint. We prove that the associated equations can be solved efficiently, even in certain cases where the input is encoded in an exponentially more compact way.</description>

      <title>Coexistence and Extinction in Flow-Kick Systems: An invasion growth rate approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Populations experience a complex interplay of continuous and discrete processes: continuous growth and interactions are punctuated by discrete reproduction events, dispersal, and external disturbances. These dynamics can be modeled by impulsive or flow-kick systems, where continuous flows alternate with instantaneous discrete changes. To study species persistence in these systems, an invasion growth rate theory is developed for flow-kick models with state-dependent timing of kicks and auxiliary variables. The invasion growth rates are Lyapunov exponents characterizing the average per-capita growth of species when rare. Two theorems are proven to characterize permanence i.e. the extinction set is a repellor. The first theorem uses Morse decompositions of the extinction set and requires that there exists a species with a positive invasion growth rate for every invariant measure supported on a component of the Morse decomposition. The second theorem uses invasion growth rates to define invasion graphs whose vertices correspond to communities and directed edges to potential invasions. Provided the invasion graph is acyclic, permanence is fully characterized by the signs of the invasion growth rates. Invasion growth rates are also used to identify the existence of extinction-bound trajectories and attractors that lie on the extinction set. The results are illustrated with three applications: (i) a microbial serial transfer model, (ii) a spatially structured consumer-resource model, and (iii) an empirically parameterized Lotka-Volterra model. Mathematical challenges and promising biological applications are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stability is a fundamental concept that refers to a system's ability to return close to its original state after disturbances. The minimal conditions for stability when system parameters vary in time, though common in physics, have been largely overlooked. Here, we study the minimal amount of periodic stiffness a linear mass-spring system requires to remain stable and apply our findings to optimally trap the upside-down state of a compass in a time-varying magnetic field. We show that the ability to return close to its original state only needs to be ensured over small but precisely defined durations within each period for the system to achieve dynamic stability. These precise durations form a discrete set, remarkably predicted by rules analogous to those of quantum mechanics. This unexpected connection opens new avenues for controlling dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Multitask Learning with Stochastic Interpolants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for learning maps between probability distributions that broadly generalizes the time dynamics of flow and diffusion models. To enable this, we generalize stochastic interpolants by replacing the scalar time variable with vectors, matrices, or linear operators, allowing us to bridge probability distributions across multiple dimensional spaces. This approach enables the construction of versatile generative models capable of fulfilling multiple tasks without task-specific training. Our operator-based interpolants not only provide a unifying theoretical perspective for existing generative models but also extend their capabilities. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the zero-shot efficacy of our method on conditional generation and inpainting, fine-tuning and posterior sampling, and multiscale modeling, suggesting its potential as a generic task-agnostic alternative to specialized models.</description>

      <title>Proximality and selflessness for group C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07938v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the reduced group C*-algebra of an infinite discrete group having a topologically-free extreme boundary is selfless in the sense of L. Robert. We also prove that selflessness is stable under tensor product among exact C*-algebras and that a C*-probability space is selfless provided that it is either simple and purely infinite or simple, exact, Z-stable, and uniquely tracial.</description>

      <title>Periodicity and Dynamical Systems of Dickson Polynomials in Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical properties of Dickson polynomials over finite fields, focusing on the periodicity and structural behavior of their iterated sequences. We introduce and analyze the sequence $[D_n(x, \alpha) \mod (x^q - x)]_n$, where $D_n(x, \alpha)$ denotes a Dickson polynomial of the first kind, and explore its periodic nature when reduced modulo $x^q - x$. We derive explicit formulas for the period of these sequences, particularly in the case when $n$ is coprime to $q^2 - 1$. In addition, we identify a symmetric property of the polynomial coefficients that plays a crucial role in the analysis of these sequences. Using tools from combinatorics, elementary number theory, and finite fields, we present algorithms to compute the exact period and investigate the dynamical structure of these polynomials. We also highlight open problems in cases where the degree $n$ is not coprime to $q^2 - 1$. Our results offer deep insights into the algebraic structure of Dickson polynomials and their role in dynamical systems over finite fields.</description>

      <title>On $q$-analogs of the $3x+1$ Dynamical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $3x+1$ Conjecture asserts that the $T$-orbit of every positive integer $x$ contains $1$, where $T$ maps $x$ to $x/2$ for $x$ even and to $(3x+1)/2$ for $x$ odd. Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps $x\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In particular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$. This seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the conjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any correspondence between polynomials and positive integers.
  In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend their domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that correspond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power series.
  We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\colon F_2[[q]]\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$ otherwise, where $A,B\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some of these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive integers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that $T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the orbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two fixed points.
  Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these conjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by replacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic integer. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could settle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for both $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.</description>

      <title>Strong averaging principle for nonautonomous multi-scale SPDEs with fully local monotone and almost periodic coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of nonautonomous multi-scale stochastic partial differential equations with fully local monotone coefficients. By introducing the evolution system of measures for time-inhomogeneous Markov semigroups, we study the averaging principle for such kind of system. Specifically, we first prove the slow component in the multi-scale stochastic system converges strongly to the solution of an averaged equation, whose coefficients retain the dependence of the scaling parameter. Furthermore, if the coefficients satisfy uniformly almost periodic conditions, we establish that the slow component converges strongly to the solution of another averaged equation, whose coefficients are independent of the scaling parameter. The main contribution of this paper extends the basic nonautonomous framework investigated by Cheng and Liu in [11] to a fully coupled framework, as well as the autonomous framework explored by Liu et al. in [27] to the more general nonautonomous framework. Additionally, we improve the locally monotone coefficients discussed in [11,27] to the fully local monotone coefficients, thus our results can be applied to a wide range of cases in nonlinear nonautonomous stochastic partial differential equations, such as multi-scale stochastic Cahn-Hilliard-heat equation and multi-scale stochastic liquid-crystal-porous-media equation.</description>
