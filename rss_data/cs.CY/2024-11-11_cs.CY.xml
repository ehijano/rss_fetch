Abstract: This research examines the impact of robotics groups in higher education, focusing on how these activities influence the development of transversal skills and academic motivation. While robotics goes beyond just technical knowledge, participation in these groups has been observed to significantly improve skills such as teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving. The study, conducted with the UruBots group, shows that students involved in robotics not only reinforce their theoretical knowledge but also increase their interest in research and academic commitment. These results highlight the potential of educational robotics to transform the learning experience by promoting active and collaborative learning. This work lays the groundwork for future research on how robotics can continue to enhance higher education and motivate students in their academic and professional careers</description>

      <title>Evaluating 21st Century Skills Development through Makerspace Workshops in Computer Science Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the effectiveness of incorporating makerspace workshops into computer science education by assessing 21st century skills critical thinking, collaboration, communication, and creativity before and after the intervention. Using a pre test and post test approach with the "21st Century Skills Survey Instrument," the study quantifies the impact of makerspace activities on student skill development. Participants included students enrolled in two computer science courses at Cyprus College. Statistical analysis, conducted using Python, revealed significant improvements across all assessed skills, indicating that makerspace workshops enhance essential competencies needed for the modern workforce. These findings provide valuable insights into how experiential learning environments can transform traditional computer science education, promoting a more interactive and engaging learning experience. Future research should focus on larger, more diverse samples and explore specific components of makerspace activities that most effectively contribute to skill development.</description>

      <title>Cast vote records: A database of ballots from the 2020 U.S. Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ballots are the core records of elections. Electronic records of actual ballots cast (cast vote records) are available to the public in some jurisdictions. However, they have been released in a variety of formats and have not been independently evaluated. Here we introduce a database of cast vote records from the 2020 U.S. general election. We downloaded publicly available unstandardized cast vote records, standardized them into a multi-state database, and extensively compared their totals to certified election results. Our release includes vote records for President, Governor, U.S. Senate and House, and state upper and lower chambers -- covering 42.7 million voters in 20 states who voted for more than 2,204 candidates. This database serves as a uniquely granular administrative dataset for studying voting behavior and election administration. Using this data, we show that in battleground states, 1.9 percent of solid Republicans (as defined by their congressional and state legislative voting) in our database split their ticket for Joe Biden, while 1.2 percent of solid Democrats split their ticket for Donald Trump.</description>

      <title>Toward Cultural Interpretability: A Linguistic Anthropological Framework for Describing and Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a new integration of linguistic anthropology and machine learning (ML) around convergent interests in both the underpinnings of language and making language technologies more socially responsible. While linguistic anthropology focuses on interpreting the cultural basis for human language use, the ML field of interpretability is concerned with uncovering the patterns that Large Language Models (LLMs) learn from human verbal behavior. Through the analysis of a conversation between a human user and an LLM-powered chatbot, we demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of a new, conjoint field of inquiry, cultural interpretability (CI). By focusing attention on the communicative competence involved in the way human users and AI chatbots co-produce meaning in the articulatory interface of human-computer interaction, CI emphasizes how the dynamic relationship between language and culture makes contextually sensitive, open-ended conversation possible. We suggest that, by examining how LLMs internally "represent" relationships between language and culture, CI can: (1) provide insight into long-standing linguistic anthropological questions about the patterning of those relationships; and (2) aid model developers and interface designers in improving value alignment between language models and stylistically diverse speakers and culturally diverse speech communities. Our discussion proposes three critical research axes: relativity, variation, and indexicality.</description>

      <title>Evaluating GPT-4 at Grading Handwritten Solutions in Math Exams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have shown promise in accurately grading open-ended student responses. However, few prior works have explored grading handwritten responses due to a lack of data and the challenge of combining visual and textual information. In this work, we leverage state-of-the-art multi-modal AI models, in particular GPT-4o, to automatically grade handwritten responses to college-level math exams. Using real student responses to questions in a probability theory exam, we evaluate GPT-4o's alignment with ground-truth scores from human graders using various prompting techniques. We find that while providing rubrics improves alignment, the model's overall accuracy is still too low for real-world settings, showing there is significant room for growth in this task.</description>

      <title>UKTF: Unified Knowledge Tracing Framework for Subjective and Objective Assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the continuous deepening and development of the concept of smart education, learners' comprehensive development and individual needs have received increasing attention. However, traditional educational evaluation systems tend to assess learners' cognitive abilities solely through general test scores, failing to comprehensively consider their actual knowledge states. Knowledge tracing technology can establish knowledge state models based on learners' historical answer data, thereby enabling personalized assessment of learners. Nevertheless, current classical knowledge tracing models are primarily suited for objective test questions, while subjective test questions still confront challenges such as complex data representation, imperfect modeling, and the intricate and dynamic nature of knowledge states. Drawing on the application of knowledge tracing technology in education, this study aims to fully utilize examination data and proposes a unified knowledge tracing model that integrates both objective and subjective test questions. Recognizing the differences in question structure, assessment methods, and data characteristics between objective and subjective test questions, the model employs the same backbone network for training both types of questions. Simultaneously, it achieves knowledge tracing for subjective test questions by universally modifying the training approach of the baseline model, adding branch networks, and optimizing the method of question encoding. This study conducted multiple experiments on real datasets, and the results consistently demonstrate that the model effectively addresses knowledge tracing issues in both objective and subjective test question scenarios.</description>

      <title>Towards s'more connected coding camps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coding camps bring together individuals from diverse backgrounds to tackle given challenges within a limited timeframe. Such camps create a rich learning environment for various skills, some of which are directly associated with the camp, and some of which are a result of working as a team during the camp. Unfortunately, coding camps often remain isolated from the broader educational curriculum or other bigger context, which downplays the opportunities they can offer to students. In this paper, we present the vision of the European initiative Oscar, which aims at connecting coding camps to the educational and professional context faced by the learners. In addition, we sketch a supporting platform and its features for connected coding camps.</description>

      <title>ICE-T: A Multi-Faceted Concept for Teaching Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topics of Artificial intelligence (AI) and especially Machine Learning (ML) are increasingly making their way into educational curricula. To facilitate the access for students, a variety of platforms, visual tools, and digital games are already being used to introduce ML concepts and strengthen the understanding of how AI works. We take a look at didactic principles that are employed for teaching computer science, define criteria, and, based on those, evaluate a selection of prominent existing platforms, tools, and games. Additionally, we criticize the approach of portraying ML mostly as a black-box and the resulting missing focus on creating an understanding of data, algorithms, and models that come with it. To tackle this issue, we present a concept that covers intermodal transfer, computational and explanatory thinking, ICE-T, as an extension of known didactic principles. With our multi-faceted concept, we believe that planners of learning units, creators of learning platforms and educators can improve on teaching ML.</description>

      <title>An Evidence-Based Curriculum Initiative for Hardware Reverse Engineering Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing importance of supply chain security for digital devices -- from consumer electronics to critical infrastructure -- has created a high demand for skilled cybersecurity experts. These experts use Hardware Reverse Engineering (HRE) as a crucial technique to ensure trust in digital semiconductors. Recently, the US and EU have provided substantial funding to educate this cybersecurity-ready semiconductor workforce, but success depends on the widespread availability of academic training programs. In this paper, we investigate the current state of education in hardware security and HRE to identify efficient approaches for establishing effective HRE training programs. Through a systematic literature review, we uncover 13 relevant courses, including eight with accompanying academic publications. We identify common topics, threat models, key pedagogical features, and course evaluation methods. We find that most hardware security courses do not prioritize HRE, making HRE training scarce. While the predominant course structure of lectures paired with hands-on projects appears to be largely effective, we observe a lack of standardized evaluation methods and limited reliability of student self-assessment surveys. Our results suggest several possible improvements to HRE education and offer recommendations for developing new training courses. We advocate for the integration of HRE education into curriculum guidelines to meet the growing societal and industry demand for HRE experts.</description>

      <title>Gender Inequalities in Content Collaborations: Asymmetric Creator Synergy and Symmetric Audience Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Content-creator collaborations are a widespread strategy for enhancing digital viewership and revenue. While existing research has explored the efficacy of collaborations, few have looked at inequities in collaborations, particularly from the perspective of the supply and demand of attention. Leveraging 42,376 videos and 6,117,441 comments from YouTube (across 150 channels and 3 games), this study examines gender inequality in collaborative environments. Utilizing Shapley value, a tool from cooperative game theory, results reveal dominant in-group collaborations based on in-game affordances. However, audience responses are aligned across games, reflecting symmetric biases across the gaming communities, with comments focusing more on peripherals than actual gameplay for women. We find supply-side asymmetries exist along with demand-side symmetries. Our results engage with the larger literature on digital and online biases, highlighting how genre and affordances moderate gendered collaboration, the direction of inequality, and contributing a general framework to quantify synergy across collaborations.</description>

      <title>LLMs as Research Tools: A Large Scale Survey of Researchers' Usage and Perceptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has led many researchers to consider their usage for scientific work. Some have found benefits using LLMs to augment or automate aspects of their research pipeline, while others have urged caution due to risks and ethical concerns. Yet little work has sought to quantify and characterize how researchers use LLMs and why. We present the first large-scale survey of 816 verified research article authors to understand how the research community leverages and perceives LLMs as research tools. We examine participants' self-reported LLM usage, finding that 81% of researchers have already incorporated LLMs into different aspects of their research workflow. We also find that traditionally disadvantaged groups in academia (non-White, junior, and non-native English speaking researchers) report higher LLM usage and perceived benefits, suggesting potential for improved research equity. However, women, non-binary, and senior researchers have greater ethical concerns, potentially hindering adoption.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Misinformation Detection Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Misinformation is a complex societal issue, and mitigating solutions are difficult to create due to data deficiencies. To address this problem, we have curated the largest collection of (mis)information datasets in the literature, totaling 75. From these, we evaluated the quality of all of the 36 datasets that consist of statements or claims. We assess these datasets to identify those with solid foundations for empirical work and those with flaws that could result in misleading and non-generalizable results, such as insufficient label quality, spurious correlations, or political bias. We further provide state-of-the-art baselines on all these datasets, but show that regardless of label quality, categorical labels may no longer give an accurate evaluation of detection model performance. We discuss alternatives to mitigate this problem. Overall, this guide aims to provide a roadmap for obtaining higher quality data and conducting more effective evaluations, ultimately improving research in misinformation detection. All datasets and other artifacts are available at https://misinfo-datasets.complexdatalab.com/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In societies increasingly entangled with algorithms, our choices are constantly influenced and shaped by automated systems. This convergence highlights significant concerns for individual autonomy in the age of data-driven AI. It leads to pressing issues such as data-driven segregation, gaps in accountability for algorithmic decisions, and the infringement on essential human rights and values. Through this article, we introduce and explore the concept of algorithmic autonomy, examining what it means for individuals to have autonomy in the face of the pervasive impact of algorithms on our societies. We begin by outlining the data-driven characteristics of AI and its role in diminishing personal autonomy. We then explore the notion of algorithmic autonomy, drawing on existing research. Finally, we address important considerations, highlighting current challenges and directions for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agricultural landscapes are quite complex, especially in the Global South where fields are smaller, and agricultural practices are more varied. In this paper we report on our progress in digitizing the agricultural landscape (natural and man-made) in our study region of India. We use high resolution imagery and a UNet style segmentation model to generate the first of its kind national-scale multi-class panoptic segmentation output. Through this work we have been able to identify individual fields across 151.7M hectares, and delineating key features such as water resources and vegetation. We share how this output was validated by our team and externally by downstream users, including some sample use cases that can lead to targeted data driven decision making. We believe this dataset will contribute towards digitizing agriculture by generating the foundational baselayer.</description>

Abstract: Cultural evolution theory suggests that prestige bias (whereby individuals preferentially learn from prestigious figures) has played a key role in human ecological success. However, its impact within online environments remains unclear, particularly regarding whether reposts by prestigious individuals amplify diffusion more effectively than reposts by non-influential users. Here, we analyzed over 55 million posts and 520 million reposts on Twitter (currently X) to examine whether users with high influence scores (hg-index) more effectively amplified the reach of others' content. Our findings indicate that posts shared by influencers were more likely to be further shared compared to those shared by non-influencers. This effect persisted over time, especially in viral posts. Moreover, a small group of highly influential users accounted for approximately half of the information flow within repost cascades. These findings demonstrate a prestige bias in information diffusion within digital society, suggesting that cognitive biases shape content spread through reposting.</description>

      <title>Foundations for the psychological safety of human and autonomous vehicles interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical issue of psychological safety in the design and operation of autonomous vehicles, which are increasingly integrated with artificial intelligence technologies. While traditional safety standards focus primarily on physical safety, this paper emphasizes the psychological implications that arise from human interactions with autonomous vehicles, highlighting the importance of trust and perceived risk as significant factors influencing user acceptance. Through a review of existing safety techniques, the paper defines psychological safety in the context of autonomous vehicles, proposes a risk model to identify and assess psychological risks, and adopts a system-theoretic analysis method. The paper illustrates the potential psychological hazards using a scenario involving a family's experience with an autonomous vehicle, aiming to systematically evaluate situations that could lead to psychological harm. By establishing a framework that incorporates psychological safety alongside physical safety, the paper contributes to the broader discourse on the safe deployment of autonomous vehicle and aims to guide future developments in user-cantered design and regulatory practices.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Agent-Based Modeling of Campus Population Behaviors for Pandemic Response Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reports a case study of an application of high-resolution agent-based modeling and simulation to pandemic response planning on a university campus. In the summer of 2020, we were tasked with a COVID-19 pandemic response project to create a detailed behavioral simulation model of the entire campus population at Binghamton University. We conceptualized this problem as an agent migration process on a multilayer transportation network, in which each layer represented a different transportation mode. As no direct data were available about people's behaviors on campus, we collected as much indirect information as possible to inform the agents' behavioral rules. Each agent was assumed to move along the shortest path between two locations within each transportation layer and switch layers at a parking lot or a bus stop, along with several other behavioral assumptions. Using this model, we conducted simulations of the whole campus population behaviors on a typical weekday, involving more than 25,000 agents. We measured the frequency of close social contacts at each spatial location and identified several busy locations and corridors on campus that needed substantial behavioral intervention. Moreover, systematic simulations with varying population density revealed that the effect of population density reduction was nonlinear, and that reducing the population density to 40-45% would be optimal and sufficient to suppress disease spreading on campus. These results were reported to the university administration and utilized in the pandemic response planning, which led to successful outcomes.</description>

      <title>The Case for an Industrial Policy Approach to AI Sector of Pakistan for Growth and Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper argues for the strategic treatment of artificial intelligence as a key industry within broader industrial policy framework of Pakistan, underscoring the importance of aligning it with national goals such as economic resilience and preservation of autonomy. The paper starts with defining industrial policy as a set of targeted government interventions to shape specific sectors for strategic outcomes and argues for its application to AI in Pakistan due to its huge potential, the risks of unregulated adoption, and prevailing market inefficiencies. The paper conceptualizes AI as a layered ecosystem, comprising foundational infrastructure, core computing, development platforms, and service and product layers, supported by education, government policy, and research and development. The analysis highlights that AI sector of Pakistan is predominantly service oriented, with limited product innovation and dependence on foreign technologies, posing risks to economic independence, national security, and employment. To address these challenges, the paper recommends educational reforms, support for local AI product development, initiatives for indigenous cloud and hardware capabilities, and public-private collaborations on foundational models. Additionally, it advocates for public procurement policies and infrastructure incentives to foster local solutions and reduce reliance on foreign providers. This strategy aims to position Pakistan as a competitive, autonomous player in the global AI ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Energy Consumption Modelling for Electric Micromobility using an Open Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The escalating challenges of traffic congestion and environmental degradation underscore the critical importance of embracing E-Mobility solutions in urban spaces. In particular, micro E-Mobility tools such as E-scooters and E-bikes, play a pivotal role in this transition, offering sustainable alternatives for urban commuters. However, the energy consumption patterns for these tools are a critical aspect that impacts their effectiveness in real-world scenarios and is essential for trip planning and boosting user confidence in using these. To this effect, recent studies have utilised physical models customised for specific mobility tools and conditions, but these models struggle with generalization and effectiveness in real-world scenarios due to a notable absence of open datasets for thorough model evaluation and verification. To fill this gap, our work presents an open dataset, collected in Dublin, Ireland, specifically designed for energy modelling research related to E-Scooters and E-Bikes. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption modelling based on the dataset using a set of representative machine learning algorithms and compare their performance against the contemporary mathematical models as a baseline. Our results demonstrate a notable advantage for data-driven models in comparison to the corresponding mathematical models for estimating energy consumption. Specifically, data-driven models outperform physical models in accuracy by up to 83.83% for E-Bikes and 82.16% for E-Scooters based on an in-depth analysis of the dataset under certain assumptions.</description>

      <title>Mind Your Step (by Step): Chain-of-Thought can Reduce Performance on Tasks where Thinking Makes Humans Worse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has become a widely used strategy for working with large language and multimodal models. While CoT has been shown to improve performance across many tasks, determining the settings in which it is effective remains an ongoing effort. In particular, it is still an open question in what settings CoT systematically reduces model performance. In this paper, we seek to identify the characteristics of tasks where CoT reduces performance by drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, looking at cases where (i) verbal thinking or deliberation hurts performance in humans, and (ii) the constraints governing human performance generalize to language models. Three such cases are implicit statistical learning, visual recognition, and classifying with patterns containing exceptions. In extensive experiments across all three settings, we find that a diverse collection of state-of-the-art models exhibit significant drop-offs in performance (e.g., up to 36.3% absolute accuracy for OpenAI o1-preview compared to GPT-4o) when using inference-time reasoning compared to zero-shot counterparts. We also identify three tasks that satisfy condition (i) but not (ii), and find that while verbal thinking reduces human performance in these tasks, CoT retains or increases model performance. Overall, our results show that while there is not an exact parallel between the cognitive processes of models and those of humans, considering cases where thinking has negative consequences for human performance can help us identify settings where it negatively impacts models. By connecting the literature on human deliberation with evaluations of CoT, we offer a new tool that can be used in understanding the impact of prompt choices and inference-time reasoning.</description>
