      <title>PLATOSpec: a precise spectrograph in support of space missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming space missions that will characterize exoplanets, such as PLATO and Ariel, will collect huge amounts of data that will need to be complemented with ground-based observations. The aim of the PLATOSpec project is to perform science with an echelle spectrograph capable of measuring precise radial velocities. The main focus of the spectrograph will be to perform the initial screening and validation of exoplanetary candidates, in addition to study stellar variability. It will be possible to determine the physical properties of large exoplanets. The PLATOSpec blue-sensitive spectrograph, with a spectral range of 380 to 700\,nm and a resolving power of R=70,000, is installed on the 1.5-m telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory in Chile. Initial results show that the radial-velocity limit given by the wavelength calibration is about 2-3 m/s. Tests on bright F-K main-sequence standard stars reveal a scatter of about 5 m/s over a few hours. The scatter over a few months is slightly higher. We demonstrate the capabilities of PLATOSpec on the mass determination of WASP-79 b and the spin-orbit alignment of WASP-62\,b via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. We show its possible usage on variable star research as demonstrated on the false-positive exoplanetary candidate TIC 238060327, which is proven a binary star. Investigation of line-profile variations of the roAp star alpha Cir shows that PLATOSpec can also be used for the surface mapping. Finally, we present new results on the active star UY Pic in the PLATO southern field. Our results show that PLATOSpec is a versatile spectrograph with great precision.</description>

      <title>Very-Long Baseline Interferometry Imaging with Closure Invariants using Conditional Image Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image reconstruction in very-long baseline interferometry operates under severely sparse aperture coverage with calibration challenges from both the participating instruments and propagation medium, which introduce the risk of biases and artefacts. Interferometric closure invariants offers calibration-independent information on the true source morphology, but the inverse transformation from closure invariants to the source intensity distribution is an ill-posed problem. In this work, we present a generative deep learning approach to tackle the inverse problem of directly reconstructing images from their observed closure invariants. Trained in a supervised manner with simple shapes and the CIFAR-10 dataset, the resulting trained model achieves reduced chi-square data adherence scores of $\chi^2_{\rm CI} \lesssim 1$ and maximum normalised cross-correlation image fidelity scores of $\rho_{\rm NX} &gt; 0.9$ on tests of both trained and untrained morphologies, where $\rho_{\rm NX}=1$ denotes a perfect reconstruction. We also adapt our model for the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope total intensity analysis challenge. Our results on quantitative metrics are competitive to other state-of-the-art image reconstruction algorithms. As an algorithm that does not require finely hand-tuned hyperparameters, this method offers a relatively simple and reproducible calibration-independent imaging solution for very-long baseline interferometry, which ultimately enhances the reliability of sparse VLBI imaging results.</description>

      <title>CCAT: Optical Responsivity, Noise, and Readout Optimization of KIDs for Prime-Cam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Prime-Cam instrument of the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST) at the CCAT Observatory will conduct sensitive millimeter to submillimeter surveys for a range of astrophysical and cosmological sciences. Prime-Cam will use kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) sensitive to multiple frequency bands spanning 280--850 GHz. With over 100,000 sensors under development, these KID arrays will soon form the largest submillimeter focal plane ever built. With fixed microwave tones probing amplitude and phase modulations in the KIDs due to incoming radiation, challenges arise in determining the optimal readout settings, especially under varying atmospheric loading. Realizing the science goals of FYST requires operating the detectors at optimal performance and determining accurate responsivities, which depend on readout tone placement and power. To address these challenges, we present laboratory measurements of sample pixels from the 280 GHz TiN and Al arrays using a blackbody cold load to simulate observing conditions. These measurements probe detector responsivity and noise across varying optical loading, tone power, and tone placement, providing the foundation to guide in situ calibration and operation of the $&gt;$100,000 KIDs. We characterize detector sensitivity via the Noise Equivalent Power (NEP) as a function of readout tone power and placement, and measure the impact of detuning due to varying optical power on the NEP. Our test setup and methodology will inform the commissioning of Prime-Cam, in situ detector calibration procedures, the cadence of probe tone resetting, and potential design refinements for future arrays, supporting FYST's planned first light in 2026.</description>

      <title>Encapsulating Textual Contents into a MOC data Structure for Advanced Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The Multi-Order Coverage map (MOC) is a widely adopted standard promoted by the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) to support data sharing and interoperability within the Virtual Observatory (VO) ecosystem. This hierarchical data structure efficiently encodes and visualizes irregularly shaped regions of the sky, enabling applications such as cross-matching large astronomical catalogs. Aims. This study aims to explore potential enhancements to the MOC data structure by encapsulating textual descriptions and semantic embeddings into sky regions. Specifically, we introduce "Textual MOCs", in which textual content is encapsulated, and "Semantic MOCs" that transform textual content into semantic embeddings. These enhancements are designed to enable advanced operations such as similarity searches and complex queries and to integrate with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools. Method. We experimented with Textual MOCs by annotating detailed descriptions directly into the MOC sky regions, enriching the maps with contextual information suitable for interactive learning tools. For Semantic MOCs, we converted the textual content into semantic embeddings, numerical representations capturing textual meanings in multidimensional spaces, and stored them in high-dimensional vector databases optimized for efficient retrieval. Results. The implementation of Textual MOCs enhances user engagement by providing meaningful descriptions within sky regions. Semantic MOCs enable sophisticated query capabilities, such as similarity-based searches and context-aware data retrieval. Integration with multimodal generative AI systems allows for more accurate and contextually relevant interactions supporting both spatial, semantic and visual operations for advancing astronomical data analysis capabilities.</description>

      <title>Experimental tests of the calibration of high precision differential astrometry for HWO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many different scientific applications require sub-micro arcsecond precision astrometry, including researching rocky exoplanets in the vicinity of the Sun and studying dark matter. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is a promising candidate to carry an astrometric instrument because it provides a stable, space-based telescope with a large aperture, which allows faint sources and small displacements to be observed. This paper presents the characterization of an appropriate detector for an astrometric instrument: the 46Mpx Gigapyx from Pyxalis. Moreover it explains the implementation of a testbed enabling interferometric characterization of pixel positions. Finally, the paper introduces a method for calibrating the telescope's optical distortion. This method was implemented in simulation and tested thanks to an optical bench developed at IPAG in France.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent advances in the numerical modeling of turbulent flows and star formation. An overview of the most widely used simulation codes and their core capabilities is provided. We then examine methods for achieving the highest-resolution magnetohydrodynamical turbulence simulations to date, highlighting challenges related to numerical viscosity and resistivity. State-of-the-art approaches to modeling gravity and star formation are discussed in detail, including implementations of star particles and feedback from jets, winds, heating, ionization, and supernovae. We review the latest techniques for radiation hydrodynamics, including ray tracing, Monte Carlo, and moment methods, with comparisons between the flux-limited diffusion, moment-1, and variable Eddington tensor methods. The final chapter summarizes advances in cosmic-ray transport schemes, emphasizing their growing importance for connecting small-scale star formation physics with galaxy-scale evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Saturn's moon Enceladus is an exciting destination for future exploration missions due to the scientifically interesting geyser region located on its South pole. In this work, we compile the different types of science orbit configurations that have been proposed in the literature and present numerical methods to compute each of them in the Saturn-Enceladus circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). In addition, we explore the utility of the higher period dynamical structures found in the CR3BP. Figures of merit such as the observational properties and geometries for each family of orbits are presented. By providing a consistent analysis of potential Enceladus science orbits, this work can serve as a baseline for future mission designs.</description>

      <title>Energy calibration of LHAASO-KM2A using the cosmic ray Moon shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a precise measurement of the westward, rigidity-dependent shift of the Moon's shadow using three and a half years of cosmic-ray data collected by the Kilometer Square Array (KM2A) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). These measurements enable us to calibrate the detector energy response in the range 20-260 TeV, with results showing excellent agreement with the response derived from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the KM2A detector. We also measure a best-fit parameter $\epsilon = 0.015 \pm 0.08$, corresponding to a 95% confidence interval of [-14%, +17%] for the energy-scale estimation. This result establishes the exceptional accuracy of the KM2A-MC in simulating the detector's response within this energy range.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the reliability of machine learning for gravitational wave parameter estimation with attention-based models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a technique to enhance the reliability of gravitational wave parameter estimation results produced by machine learning. We develop two independent machine learning models based on the Vision Transformer to estimate effective spin and chirp mass from spectrograms of gravitational wave signals from binary black hole mergers. To enhance the reliability of these models, we utilize attention maps to visualize the areas our models focus on when making predictions. This approach enables demonstrating that both models perform parameter estimation based on physically meaningful information. Furthermore, by leveraging these attention maps, we demonstrate a method to quantify the impact of glitches on parameter estimation. We show that as the models focus more on glitches, the parameter estimation results become more strongly biased. This suggests that attention maps could potentially be used to distinguish between cases where the results produced by the machine learning model are reliable and cases where they are not.</description>

      <title>Electroluminescence and charge multiplication in liquid xenon with a VCC-like Microstrip Plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the first observation of electroluminescence and charge amplification with a Virtual Cathode Chamber (VCC) microstrips plate immersed in liquid xenon. Both were observed in an intense non-uniform electric field in the vicinity of 2-$\mu$m narrow anode strips deposited, with a 2~mm pitch, on a semiconductive glass substrate (S8900), with a cathode film on its backside. An initial light yield of $\sim$460 VUV photons per drifting electron was measured, which degraded within tens of minutes stabilizing at (27.0~$\pm$~3.1)~photons per electron. The electroluminescence was accompanied by electron multiplication with an estimated charge gain $&lt;$10. Further investigations are necessary to understand and mitigate the light yield degradation phenomenon. We expect other substrate materials, including VUV-transparent ones, to provide large stable photon yields, compatible with our model predictions. The VCC configuration has demonstrated great potential in single-phase noble-liquid detectors, particularly for dark-matter searches, neutrino physics and other fields.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes how intentional and unintentional radio emission from airplanes is recorded with the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland (RNO-G). We characterize the received signals and define a procedure to extract a clean set of impulsive signals. These signals are highly suitable for instrument calibration, also for future experiments. A set of signals is used to probe the timing precision of RNO-G in-situ, which is found to match expectations. We also discuss the impact of these signals on the ability to detect neutrinos with RNO-G.</description>

      <title>Space-based cm/kg-scale Laser Interferometer for Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The experimental verification of the quantum nature of gravity represents a milestone in quantum gravity research. Recently, interest has grown for testing it via gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE). Here, we propose a space-based interferometer inspired by the LISA Pathfinder (LPF). Our design employs two kg-scale gold-platinum test masses which, unlike in the LPF, are surrounded by a shield below 1 K and positioned side-by-side with a centimeter-scale separation. This configuration enables the detection of GIE through simultaneous measurements of differential and common-mode motions. To estimate the integration time required for GIE detection, we simulate quantum measurements of these modes, considering noise sources such as gas damping, black-body radiation, and cosmic-ray collisions. Our results show that GIE can be demonstrated with a few modifications to the LPF setup.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic reassessment of 5,062 high-Galactic latitude gamma-ray sources from the Fermi-LAT 4FGL-DR4 catalog using Firmamento, a web-based platform for multi-frequency source discovery and analysis. Our goal is to provide an independent evaluation of LAT gamma-ray source associations through alternative spectral and spatial methods that combine recent and legacy survey data, supplemented by human supervision of spectral energy distributions (SEDs), source morphology, flux variability, and template-based comparisons. Firmamento confirms the 4FGL-DR4 and 4LAC-DR3 counterparts or unassociated sources in 4,493 cases (88.8%), demonstrating the robustness of both approaches. Beyond this general agreement, we identify 421 new blazar counterparts among previously unassociated sources, thereby reducing the fraction of unidentified extragalactic Fermi-LAT sources from 25% to 17%. In addition, in 64 cases we find alternative blazar associations, while in 49 instances we do not confirm the 4FGL-DR4 association. For all confirmed blazar counterparts we provide homogeneous estimates of synchrotron peak frequency and peak flux using machine-learning and template-based methods; these agree with 4LAC-DR3 values in most cases, though significant discrepancies appear for a few dozen sources, often due to improved X-ray coverage. The primary outcome of this work is the 1st Firmamento LAT AGN table (1FLAT), made publicly available through the Firmamento platform (https://firmamento.nyuad.nyu.edu), where all related multi-wavelength data and images are available. The project involved extensive manual validation and benefited from the active participation of graduate and undergraduate students, highlighting the platform's value for both research and education.</description>
