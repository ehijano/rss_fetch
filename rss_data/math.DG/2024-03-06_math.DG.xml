      <title>Minimal Surface Equation and Bernstein Property on RCD spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $(X,d,m)$ is an RCD(K,N) space and $u \in W^{1,1}_{loc}(X)$ is a solution of the minimal surface equation, then $u$ is harmonic on its graph (which has a natural metric measure space structure). If K=0 this allows to obtain an Harnack inequality for $u$, which in turn implies the Bernstein property, meaning that any positive solution to the minimal surface equation must be constant. As an application, we obtain oscillation estimates and a Bernstein Theorem for minimal graphs in products $M \times \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a smooth manifold (possibly weighted and with boundary) with non-negative Ricci curvature</description>

      <title>Compact Einstein-type manifolds with parallel Ricci tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deduce a Bochner-type identity for compact gradient Einstein-type manifolds with boundary. As consequence, we are able to show a rigidity result for Einstein-type manifolds assuming the parallel Ricci curvature condition. Moreover, we provide a condition on the norm of the gradient of the potential function in order to classify such structures.</description>

      <title>Boundary Behavior of Compact Manifolds With Scalar Curvature Lower Bounds and Static Quasi-Local Mass of Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classic result of Shi and Tam states that a 2-sphere of positive Gauss and mean curvature bounding a compact 3-manifold with nonnegative scalar curvature, must have total mean curvature not greater than that of the isometric embedding into Euclidean 3-space, with equality only for domains in this reference manifold. We generalize this result to 2-tori of Guass curvature greater than $-1$, which bound a compact 3-manifold having scalar curvature not less than $-6$ and at least one other boundary component satisfying a 'trapping condition'. The conclusion is that the total weighted mean curvature is not greater than that of an isometric embedding into the Kottler manifold, with equality only for domains in this space. Examples are given to show that the assumption of a secondary boundary component cannot be removed. The result gives a positive mass theorem for the static Brown-York mass of tori, in analogy to the Shi-Tam positivity of the standard Brown-York mass, and represents the first such quasi-local mass positivity result for non-spherical surfaces. Furthermore, we prove a Penrose-type inequality in this setting.</description>

      <title>Long-time Ricci flow existence and topological rigidity from manifolds with pinched scale-invariant integral curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove long-time existence of the Ricci flow starting from complete manifolds with bounded curvature and scale-invariant integral curvature sufficiently pinched with respect to the inverse of its Sobolev constant. Moreover, if the curvature is sub-critical $L^p$ integrable, this flow converges locally smoothly to a limiting metric $g(\infty)$ on $M$ with $(M,g(\infty))$ isometric to the standard flat $\mathbb{R}^n$, which implies topological rigidity of $M$. This generalizes work of Chen, who proved analogous results for asymptotically flat manifolds. We also prove a long-time Ricci flow existence (and likewise topological rigidity) result for unbounded curvature initial data, assuming the initial data is a locally smooth limit of bounded curvature manifolds as described above.</description>

      <title>Concavity Properties of Solutions of Elliptic Equations under Conformal Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Dirichlet problem for the weighted Schr\"odinger operator \[-\Delta u +Vu = \lambda \rho u,\] where $\rho$ is a positive weighting function and $V$ is a potential. Such equations appear naturally in conformal geometry and in the composite membrane problem. Our primary goal is to establish concavity estimates for the principle eigenfunction with respect to conformal connections. Doing so, we obtain new bounds on the fundamental gap problem, which is the difference between the first and second eigenvalues. In particular, we partially resolve a conjecture of Nguyen, Stancu and Wei [IMRN 2022] on the fundamental gap of horoconvex domains. In addition, we obtain a power convexity estimate for solutions to the torsion problem in spherical geometry on convex domains which are not too large.</description>

      <title>Weighted floating functions and weighted functional affine surface areas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to introduce the new concept of weighted floating functions associated with log concave or $s$-concave functions. This leads to new notions of weighted functional affine surface areas. Their relation to more traditional versions of functional affine surface areas as well as to the classical affine surface areas for convex bodies is discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Higher form symmetries and orbifolds of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We undertake a detailed study of the gaugings of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory by its intrinsic charge conjugation 0-form and centre 1-form global symmetries, elucidating their higher algebraic and geometric structures, as well as the meaning of dual lower form symmetries. Our derivations of orbifold gauge theories make use of a combination of standard continuum path integral methods, networks of topological defects, and techniques from higher gauge theory. We provide a unified description of higher and lower form gauge fields for a $p$-form symmetry in the geometric setting of $p$-gerbes, and derive reverse orbifolds by the dual $(-1)$-form symmetries. We identify those orbifolds in which charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken, and relate the breaking to mixed anomalies involving $(-1)$-form symmetries. We extend these considerations to gaugings by the non-invertible 1-form symmetries of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory by introducing a notion of generalized $\theta$-angle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a well-known fact in Poisson geometry that reduction commutes with integration (of the associated integrable Lie algebroid). This is also valid for other types of geometries given by 2-dimensional closed forms. In this manuscript we extend this type of result to the particular case of cosymplectic groupoids, obtaining in particular the reduction of a central extension defined by a 2-IM form and a 1-IM form.</description>

      <title>Classification of compact manifolds with positive isotropic curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18154v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the following result: Let $(M,g_0)$ be a compact manifold of dimension $n\geq 12$ with positive isotropic curvature. Then $M$ is diffeomorphic to a spherical space form, or a quotient manifold of $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\times \mathbb{R}$ by a cocompact discrete subgroup of the isometry group of the round cylinder $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\times \mathbb{R}$, or a connected sum of a finite number of such manifolds. This extends previous works of Brendle and Chen-Tang-Zhu, and improves a work of Huang. The proof uses Ricci flow with surgery on compact orbifolds, with the help of the ambient isotopy uniqueness of closed tubular neighborhoods of compact suborbifolds.</description>

      <title>The rigidity of minimal Legendrian submanifolds in the Euclidean spheres via eigenvalues of fundamental matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the rigidity problem for compact minimal Legendrian submanifolds in the unit Euclidean spheres via eigenvalues of fundamental matrices, which measure the squared norms of the second fundamental form on all normal directions. By using Lu's inequality on the upper bound of the squared norm of Lie brackets of symmetric matrices, we establish an optimal pinching theorem for such submanifolds of all dimensions, giving a new characterization for the Calabi tori. This pinching condition can also be described by the eigenvalues of the Ricci curvature tensor. Moreover, when the third large eigenvalue of the fundamental matrix vanishes everywhere, we get an optimal rigidity theorem under a weaker pinching condition.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we are interested in metric spaces that satisfy a weak non-positive curvature condition in the sense that they admit a conical geodesic bicombing. We show that the analog of a question of Gromov about compactness properties of convex hulls has a negative answer in this setting. Specifically, we prove that there exists a complete metric space $X$ that admits a conical bicombing $\sigma$ such that $X$ has a finite subset whose closed $\sigma$-convex hull is not compact.</description>

      <title>Three Paths to Rational Curves with Rational Arc Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve the so far open problem of constructing all spatial rational curves with rational arc length functions. More precisely, we present three different methods for this construction. The first method adapts a recent approach of (Kalkan et al. 2022) to rational PH curves and requires solving a modestly sized system of linear equations. The second constructs the curve by imposing zero-residue conditions, thus extending ideas of previous papers by (Farouki and Sakkalis 2019) and the authors themselves (Schr\"ocker and \v{S}\'ir 2023). The third method generalizes the dual approach of (Pottmann 1995) from planar to spatial curves. The three methods share the same quaternion based representation in which not only the PH curve but also its arc length function are compactly expressed. We also present a new proof based on the quaternion polynomial factorization theory of the well known characterization of the Pythagorean quadruples.</description>

Abstract: This research comprehensively describes the transversally H-elliptic operators and investigates the index theorem of H-elliptic and transversally H-elliptic operators from the perspective of $KK$-theory, applying Kasparov's methodology. Moreover, the analysis methodically examines specific conditions, with a focus on the Fourier transform of the nilpotent group $C^{\ast}$-algebra. The findings demonstrate enhanced methods for analyzing the hypoellipticity of operators, presenting a robust framework for defining and understanding transversal H-ellipticity in a $KK$-theoretic context. This work provides a solid foundation for future research into the properties of differential operators in complex manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^d$ be a bounded Euclidean domain. According to the famous Weyl law, both its Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_k(\Omega)$ and its Neumann eigenvalue $\mu_k(\Omega)$ have the same leading asymptotics $w_k(\Omega)=C(d,\Omega)k^{2/d}$ as $k \to \infty$. G. P\'olya conjectured in 1954 that each Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_k(\Omega)$ is greater than $w_k(\Omega)$, while each Neumann eigenvalue $\mu_k(\Omega)$ is no more than $w_k(\Omega)$. In this paper we prove P\'olya's conjecture for thin products, i.e. domains of the form $(a\Omega_1) \times \Omega_2$, where $\Omega_1, \Omega_2$ are Euclidean domains, and $a$ is small enough. We also prove that the same inequalities hold if $\Omega_2$ is replaced by a Riemannian manifold, and thus get P\'olya's conjecture for a class of ``thin" Riemannian manifolds with boundary.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution in Random Polynomials and Systems of Random Holomorphic Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14631v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article addresses an equidistribution problem concerning the zeros of systems of random holomorphic sections of positive line bundles on compact K\"{a}hler manifolds and random polynomials on $\mathbb{C}^{m}$ in the setting of a compact subset. For random polynomials, we consider non-orthonormal bases and prove an equidistribution result which are more general than the previously acquired ones for non-discrete probability measures. More precisely, our result demonstrates that the equidistribution holds true even when the random coefficients in the basis representation are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and moreover, they are not constrained to any particular probability distribution function. For random holomorphic sections, by extending the concept of a sequence of asymptotically Bernstein-Markov measures introduced by Levenberg, Bloom and Bayraktar in their recent paper to the setting of holomorphic line bundles over compact K\"{a}hler manifolds, we derive a global equidistribution theorem related to the zeros of systems of random holomorphic sections for large tensor powers of a fixed line bundle for any codimension $k$. In both settings using the variance estimation technique in another study of the author with Bojnik plays an important role.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport on the Lie Group of Roto-translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The roto-translation group SE2 has been of active interest in image analysis due to methods that lift the image data to multi-orientation representations defined on this Lie group. This has led to impactful applications of crossing-preserving flows for image de-noising, geodesic tracking, and roto-translation equivariant deep learning. In this paper, we develop a computational framework for optimal transportation over Lie groups, with a special focus on SE2. We make several theoretical contributions (generalizable to matrix Lie groups) such as the non-optimality of group actions as transport maps, invariance and equivariance of optimal transport, and the quality of the entropic-regularized optimal transport plan using geodesic distance approximations. We develop a Sinkhorn like algorithm that can be efficiently implemented using fast and accurate distance approximations of the Lie group and GPU-friendly group convolutions. We report valuable advancements in the experiments on 1) image barycentric interpolation, 2) interpolation of planar orientation fields, and 3) Wasserstein gradient flows on SE2. We observe that our framework of lifting images to SE2 and optimal transport with left-invariant anisotropic metrics leads to equivariant transport along dominant contours and salient line structures in the image. This yields sharper and more meaningful interpolations compared to their counterparts on R^2</description>
