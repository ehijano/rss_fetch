      <title>Thermodynamics and shadow of Simpson-Visser black hole with phantom global monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and shadow of a non-rotating Simpson Visser black hole with a phantom global monopole. The model is governed by three parameters: the coupling constant $\xi$, the energy scale of symmetry breaking $\eta$, and the bounce parameter $a$, which jointly influence horizon structure and observational signatures. Using specific heat and free-energy analysis, we show that small-horizon configurations are locally thermodynamically stable but never globally favored. Analytical solutions of null geodesics reveal that the photon sphere radius depends on the bounce parameter $a$ and the energy scale of symmetry breaking $\eta$, while the critical impact parameter is still unaffected by $a$. Moreover, the photon sphere radius and critical impact parameter, showing that increasing $\eta$ enlarges both quantities for an ordinary global monopole, while reducing them in the phantom case. Our results highlight how the bounce parameter and phantom global monopole significantly alter the black hole's physical and geometric properties.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Holographic Dark Energy Models in $f(R,T^2)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the Renyi Holographic dark energy, Sharma-Mittal Holographic dark energy and Generalized Holographic dark energy models in the framework of $f(R,T^2)$ gravity, where $R$ denotes the Ricci scalar and $T^2$ represents the self-contraction of the stress-energy tensor. For this purpose we employed two horizons as infrared cut-offs, such as Hubble horizon and Ricci horizon. The analysis is conducted for a non-interacting scenario in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. By considering a specific form of this modified gravity, we reconstruct the corresponding gravitational models based on these selected dark energy formulations. Additionally, a stability analysis is performed for all cases and the evolution of the equation of state parameter is examined. Our finding indicates that the reconstructed $f(R,T^2)$ models effectively describe both the phantom and quintessence phases of cosmic evolution, aligning with the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. This study highlights the deep interconnections between holographic dark energy models and modified gravity theories, offering valuable insights into the large scale dynamics of the cosmos.</description>

      <title>Strong field gravitational lensing of particles by a black-bounce-Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational lensing of relativistic and nonrelativistic neutral massive particles in the black-bounce-Schwarzschild black hole spacetime is investigated in the strong deflection limit. Beginning with the explicit equations of motion of a massive particle in the regular spacetime, we achieve the equation of the particle sphere and thus the radius of the unstable timelike circular orbit. It is interesting to find that the particle sphere equation can reduce to the well-known photon sphere equation, when the particle's initial velocity is equal to the speed of light. We adopt the strong field limit approach to calculate the black-bounce-Schwarzschild deflection angle of the particle subsequently, and obtain the strong-deflection lensing observables of the relativistic images of a pointlike particle source. The observables mainly include the apparent angular particle sphere radius, the angular separation between the outermost relativistic image and the other ones which are packed together, and the ratio between the particle-flux magnification of the outermost image and that of the packed ones (or equivalently, their resulted magnitudelike difference). The velocity effects induced by the deviation of the initial velocity of the particle from light speed on the corresponding strong-field lensing observables of the images of a pointlike light source in the regular geometry, along with these on the strong deflection limit coefficients and the critical impact parameter of the lightlike case, are then formulated. Serving as an application of the results, we finally concentrate on evaluating the astronomical detectability of the velocity effects on the lensing observables and analyzing their dependence on the parameters, by modeling the Galactic supermassive black hole (i.e., Sgr A$^{\ast}$) as the lens.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravimagnetic dipole is an asymptotically flat, stationary, axisymmetric vacuum solution to Einstein's General Relativity describing two non-extreme black holes with equal masses and opposite NUT charges connected by a Misner string. The string tension's can be set to zero by choosing the black hole separation accordingly, yielding a stable system of oppositely rotating black holes at a fixed distance. Numerical simulations of massless particle geodesics reveal gravitational lensing effects for extended sources at infinity on the equatorial plane or on the vertical axis.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Dynamics in Extremal Black Holes: A Challenge to the Chaos Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate chaotic dynamics in extremal black holes by analyzing the motion of massless particles in both Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and Kerr geometries. Two complementary approaches (i) taking the extremal limit of non-extremal solutions and (ii) working directly in the extremal background, yield consistent results. We find that, contrary to naive extrapolation of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) chaos bound, the Lyapunov exponent remains positive even at zero temperature. For Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes, chaos diminishes but persists at extremality, while for Kerr black holes it strengthens with increasing spin. These results demonstrate that extremal black holes exhibit residual chaotic dynamics that violate the MSS bound, establishing them as qualitatively distinct dynamical phases of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the geometry and topology of the trapped photon region in the domain of outer communication of sub-extremal Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Sen spacetimes. Specifically, we show that its projection to the (co-)tangent bundle forms a five-dimensional submanifold with topology $SO(3)\times \mathbb{R}^2$ in each setup. The proof adapts the method of Cederbaum and Jahns for sub-extremal Kerr spacetime.</description>

      <title>A General Discussion on Photon Spheres in Different Categories of Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon spheres have attracted considerable interest in the studies of black holes and other astrophysical objects. For different categories of spacetimes (or gravitational sources), the existence of photon spheres and their distributions are dramatically influenced by the geometric and topological properties of spacetimes and characteristics of the corresponding gravitational fields. In this work, we carry out a geometric analysis on photon spheres for different categories of spacetime (including black hole spacetime, ultra-compact object's spacetime, regular spacetime, and naked singularity spacetime). Some universal properties and conclusions are obtained for these spacetimes. We mostly focus on the existence of photon spheres, the total number of photon spheres $n = n_{\text{stable}} + n_{\text{unstable}}$, the subtraction of stable photon sphere and unstable photon sphere $w = n_{\text{stable}} - n_{\text{unstable}}$ in different categories of spacetimes. These conclusions are derived solely from geometric properties of optical geometry of spacetimes, irrelevant to the specific spacetime metric forms. Besides, our results successfully recover some important theorems on photon spheres proposed in recent years.</description>

      <title>Impact of Higher-Order Modes on Eccentricity Measurement in Binary Black Hole Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the systematic biases in measuring orbital eccentricity for binary black hole (BBH) mergers that arise when higher-order modes (HOMs) of gravitational waves are neglected in waveform modeling. Using Bayesian inference with the state-of-the-art eccentric, spin-aligned, higher-mode effective-one-body model SEOBNRv5EHM, we reanalyze six previously suggested eccentric gravitational-wave events--GW190521, GW190620, GW190701, GW191109, GW200129, and GW200208\_222617. Comparing results with its dominant-mode-only counterpart SEOBNRv5E, we find no statistically significant HOM-induced bias in eccentricity for any of these events, including GW190521, whose eccentricity has been debated in the literature. To identify parameter regimes vulnerable to HOM omission, we perform a broad zero-noise injection campaign varying detector-frame total mass, mass ratio, eccentricity, inclination, and network SNR. We find that significant systematic biases ($\Delta_e/\sigma &gt; 1$) arise predominantly in systems with high total mass ($M^{\rm det}\gtrsim120M_\odot$), highly asymmetric mass ratios ($q \gtrsim 4$), near edge-on orientations ($\theta_\textrm{JN} \gtrsim 30^\circ$), and high SNRs ($\rho^N_\textrm{mf}\approx50$). Notably, for quasi-circular BBHs with $M^{\rm det}\gtrsim140M_\odot$, neglecting HOMs may lead to strong false-positive evidence for nonzero eccentricity. By contrast, for lower-mass systems ($M^{\rm det}\sim100 M_\odot$), HOM exclusion produces negligible eccentricity biases. Our results demonstrate that although current eccentric candidates are not impacted by HOM omission, future eccentricity measurements--particularly for massive, asymmetric, or edge-on systems--require HOM-inclusive waveforms to avoid substantial systematic errors.</description>

      <title>Gravitational effects on a dissipative two-level atom in the weak-field regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01715v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dissipative dynamics of a two-level atom in a weak gravitational field. Using the Feynman--Vernon influence functional formalism, we derive a quantum master equation describing the two-level atom interacting with a scalar field in a Newtonian gravitational field, and compute the energy dissipation rate of the atom. We find that the spontaneous emission rate (the dissipation rate in vacuum) is modified by the gravitational field. Specifically, this modification depends on the atom's dipole, the position of the atom relative to the source of the gravitational field, and the frequency of the scalar radiation emitted by the atom. Furthermore, we identify the parameter regimes in which the spontaneous emission rate is enhanced or suppressed by gravity. We also discuss how the modification arises from time dilation and dipole radiation in a weak gravitational field. These findings provide a theoretical basis for exploring gravitational effects in open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Maxwell electrodynamics with a Chern--Simons coupling to a dark sector top form sourced by domain walls. Electromagnetic fields which cross such domain walls exhibit optical activity. We outline the parameter space where the theory satisfies the observational bounds from domain wall nucleation rates and cosmic microwave background anisotropies. In this regime, the discretely evanescent dark energy walls can produce a polarization rotation of cosmic microwave background by $\Delta\vartheta \sim 10^{-3} ~{\rm radians}$.</description>

      <title>On the importance of radiation-era initial conditions for tensor perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conservation of super-horizon tensor fluctuations is crucial for connecting inflation to observations. Starting from first principles, recent works have found violations of this conservation if free-streaming radiation is produced during reheating. We show that the non-conservation is sensitive to the radiation initial state, and argue that the physical state should be affected by tensor perturbations that are already present during reheating. The deviation from super-horizon conservation is then negligible, recovering the standard result from kinetic theory. In contrast, a globally homogeneous and isotropic plasma state leads to a large suppression of tensor amplitudes. This difference between the local (physical) and global thermal equilibrium settles the discrepancy between the older and recent literature.</description>

      <title>A simple mechanism for the enhancement of the inflationary power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The background evolution in two-field inflation can feature two distinct stages, corresponding to the evolution along two successive field directions. When the second stage occurs at a significantly lower energy scale, the inflationary trajectory includes a sharp transition, accompanied by a series of rapid turns in field space. Fluctuations crossing the Hubble horizon during this turning phase can experience amplification by several orders of magnitude. This mechanism is very intuitive and can be implemented even in simple two-field models. It produces a peak in the scalar power spectrum that can lead to significant abundances of primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Propulsion Trades for a 2035-2040 Solar Gravitational Lens Mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar Gravitational Lens (SGL) enables multipixel imaging and spatially resolved spectroscopy of a nearby terrestrial exoplanet from heliocentric distances $z\simeq 650$-$900$ AU, where solar power is negligible and transportation largely sets time-to-first-science. Reaching 650 AU in 20 yr implies a ballistic lower bound $\bar v_r \simeq 32.5~{\rm AU/yr}\simeq 154$ km/s, motivating propulsion beyond chemical and gravity-assist-only options. We compare close-perihelion solar sailing, fission-powered nuclear electric propulsion (NEP), and Oberth-enabled hybrid injection using simple time-to-distance models that isolate the long outbound leg (i.e., excluding architecture-dependent inner-solar-system injection overhead). For solar sailing, $r_p=0.05$ AU requires $\sigma_{\rm tot}\simeq 4.9~\mathrm{g\,m^{-2}}$ for $v_\infty\simeq 105$ km/s and $\sigma_{\rm tot}\simeq 2.3~\mathrm{g\,m^{-2}}$ for $v_\infty\simeq 155$ km/s, placing sub-20 yr sail-only access in an ultra-low-areal-density, deep-perihelion survivability regime. For NEP, a constant-power stage closure shows that a $m_0=20$ t spacecraft with $m_{\rm pay}=800$ kg and $\eta=0.7$ reaches 650 AU in ~27-33 yr for $\alpha_{\rm tot}=10$-$20~\mathrm{kg\,kW_e^{-1}}$ (typical optima $P_e\simeq 0.18$-$0.30~\mathrm{MW_e}$, thrust of a few newtons). NEP-only sub-20 yr transfers require extremely aggressive assumptions ($\alpha_{\rm tot}\lesssim 3~\mathrm{kg\,kW_e^{-1}}$ and very-high-$I_{\rm sp}$, long-life EP), whereas hybrid architectures become plausible for $\alpha_{\rm tot}\sim 10$-$15~\mathrm{kg\,kW_e^{-1}}$ if an injection stage supplies $v_0\gtrsim 50$-70 km/s prior to NEP cruise. We map these requirements to technology readiness and identify system-level demonstrations needed by the early 2030s for a credible 2035--2040 start.</description>

      <title>Parametric Resonance and Backreaction Effects in Magnetogenesis from Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We take a more detailed look at the recently proposed magnetogenesis mechanism triggered by ultralight dark matter coupled to electromagnetism. The proposed mechanism made use of a tachyonic resonance channel which leads to the exponential amplification of infrared modes. Here, we first investigate a possible narrow band parametric resonance channel which can produce photons at higher frequencies. Secondly, we estimate the effects of back-reaction on terminating the resonance. We find that there is indeed a narrow resonance channel. It is characterized by a Floquet exponent which is slightly smaller than the corresponding exponent for the tachyonic resonance. However, there is a region of parameter space (corresponding to a very small coupling constant) for which the tachyonic resonance is ineffective. In this case, the narrow resonance will dominate, and it will still be sufficiently strong to generate the observed magnetic fields on cosmological scales. Our analytical treatment of the back-reaction effects considered here indicates that a fraction of order one of the initial dark matter density can flow into the gauge fields. Hence, our magnetogenesis scenario appears to be robust to back-reaction effects.</description>

      <title>Restoring Landauer's Principle for Unitarily Transformed Thermal Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landauer's principle, a cornerstone of quantum information and thermodynamics, appears to be violated when the thermal reservoir is replaced by a squeezed thermal state (STS). We introduce a formal extension of the principle to such unitarily transformed thermal states. By defining an effective Hamiltonian, we rigorously establish a generalized Landauer inequality, which naturally reduces to the standard case for an ordinary thermal reservoir as a special instance. The framework further yields a consistent definition of entropy production and a proof of its non-negativity. We illustrate its utility by studying an arbitrarily moving Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a quantum field initially prepared in the STS. Using perturbation theory, we compute the entropy production explicitly, confirming its positivity. As a result of the symmetry breaking induced by the unitary transformation, it depends on both the proper time interval and the absolute spacetime position. Our work resolves the apparent violation of Landauer's principle with STSs. It also provides a robust tool for analyzing quantum thermodynamics in non-equilibrium and relativistic settings, with potential implications for quantum thermal machines and information protocols.</description>

      <title>Emergent Hawking Radiation and Quantum Sensing in a Quenched Chiral Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence and detection of Hawking radiation (HR) in a 1D chiral spin chain model, where the gravitational collapse is simulated by a sudden quantum quench that triggers a horizon-inducing phase transition. While our previous work Jaiswal [2025] established that this model mimics BH formation conditions even when the Hoop conjecture is seemingly violated, we here focus on the resulting stationary radiation spectrum and its detectability. By mapping the spin chain dynamics to a Dirac fermion in a curved (1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime, we analyze the radiation using two complementary approaches: field-theoretic modes and operational quantum sensors. First, using localized Gaussian wave packets to model realistic detectors, we find that the radiation spectrum exhibits deviations from the ideal Planckian form, analogous to frequency-dependent greybody factors, while retaining robust Poissonian statistics that signal the loss of formation-scale information. Second, we introduce a qubit coupled to the chain as a stationary Unruh-DeWitt detector. We demonstrate that the qubit functions as a faithful quantum sensor of the Hawking temperature only in the weak-coupling regime, where its population dynamics are governed solely by the bath spectral density. In the strong-coupling limit, the probe thermalizes with the global environment, obscuring the horizon-induced thermal signature. These results provide a clear operational protocol for distinguishing genuine analog HR from environmental noise in quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing early universe evolution with gravitational waves from supercooled phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gravitational waves from supercooled cosmological first-order phase transitions. If such a transition is followed by inefficient reheating, the evolution history of the universe is modified by a period of early matter domination. This leaves an imprint on the predicted gravitational-wave spectra. Using Fisher analysis we show the parameter space in reach of upcoming gravitational wave observatories where reheating can be probed due to its impact on the stochastic background produced by the transition. We use both the simplified geometric parametrisation and the thermodynamical one explicitly including the decay rate of the field undergoing the transition as a parameter determining the spectrum. We show the expansion history following the transition can be probed provided the transition is very strong which is naturally realised in classically scale invariant models generically predicting supercooling. Moreover, in such a scenario the decay rate of the scalar undergoing the phase transition, a parameter most likely inaccessible to accelerators, can be determined through the spectrum analysis.</description>

      <title>Gravitational redshift of broadband relativistic quantum photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ linearized quantum gravity to study gravitational redshift of photons in the context of relativistic and quantum physics, where photons interact in flat spacetime with a classical massive body via graviton exchange. We find that gravitational redshift, as predicted by general relativity, occurs only in the case of localized photons with a well defined momentum that interact with a classical source of gravitons. On the contrary, photons initially prepared in states with nonclassical features, such as quantum coherence in the position degree of freedom, witness no well-defined redshift in general. Our work not only shows that gravitational redshift can be found in flat spacetime as a consequence of the interaction of quantum fields, but it also challenges the robustness of one of the most important predictions of general relativity, furthermore indicating that deviations from the theory can already be observed at low energies using highly nonclassical photonic states.</description>

      <title>Constraining a $f(R, L_m)$ Gravity Cosmological Model with Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a spatially flat FLRW cosmological model in the framework of modified gravity described by the function \( f(R, L_m) = \alpha R + L_m^\beta + \gamma \), where \( L_m \) is the matter Lagrangian density. The modified Friedmann equations yield the Hubble parameter as $ H(z) = H_0 \sqrt{(1 - \lambda) + \lambda (1 + z)^{3(1 + w)}},$
  with the parameters \( \lambda = \frac{\gamma}{6\alpha H_0^2} + 1 \) and \( w = \frac{\beta(n - 2) + 1}{2\beta - 1} \). Using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, we constrain the model parameters with recent observational data, including cosmic chronometers, the Pantheon+ Supernovae dataset, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) shift parameters. The best-fit values are found to be \( H_0 = 72.773^{+0.148}_{-0.152} \) km/s/Mpc, \( \lambda = 0.289^{+0.007}_{-0.007} \), and \( w = -0.002^{+0.002}_{-0.002} \), all quoted at the 1\(\sigma\) confidence level.This model predicts a transition redshift of \( z_t \approx 0.76 \) for the onset of cosmic acceleration and an estimated universe age of 13.21 Gyr. The higher inferred value of \( H_0 \) compared to the Planck 2018 result offers a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. Additionally, using \( \rho_0 = 0.534 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{g/cm}^3 \) and assuming \( n = 1 \), we derive the model constants as \( \beta = 1.00201 \), \( \alpha = 512247 \), and \( \gamma = -1.215 \times 10^{-29} \). We also evaluate the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to compare the model's performance with that of the standard \(\Lambda\)CDM model. The small BIC difference (\( \Delta \text{BIC} = 0.16 \)) indicates comparable statistical support for both models. Thus, the \( f(R, L_m) \) gravity scenario serves as a consistent and viable alternative to \(\Lambda\)CDM, potentially addressing open questions in late-time cosmology.</description>

      <title>QuGrav: Bringing gravitational waves to light with Qumodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose using qumodes, quantum bosonic modes, for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves via the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, where a gravitational wave resonantly converts into a single photon in a magnetized cavity. For an occupation number $n$ of the photon field in a qumode, the conversion probability is enhanced by a factor of $n+1$ due to Bose-Einstein statistics. Unlocking this increased sensitivity entails the ability to continuously prepare the qumode and perform non-demolition measurement on the qumode-qubit system within the qumode coherence time. Our results indicate that, at microwave frequencies and with existing technology, the proposed setup can attain sensitivities within 1.7 orders of magnitude of the cosmological bound. With anticipated near-future improvements, it has the potential to surpass this limit and pave the way for the first exploration of high-frequency cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds. At optical frequencies, it can enhance the sensitivity of current detectors by one order of magnitude. That further enhances their potential in reaching the single-graviton level.</description>

      <title>Reheating and relic gravitational waves as remedies for degeneracies of non-canonical natural inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, a natural non-canonical inflationary model based on a power-law Lagrangian is investigated. We analyze the scalar spectral index $n_{\rm s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of the model and identify their degeneracies with respect to the free parameters. Notably, $n_{\rm s}$ and $r$ show effective independence from the model parameters due to degeneracies in the slow-roll parameters that leads to unresolved parameter degeneracies. Employing the constraints on reheating parameters such as the reheating duration $N_{\rm{reh}}$, the reheating temperature $T_{\rm{reh}}$, and the equation of state parameter $\omega_{\rm{reh}}$, is found to be insufficient to fully break these degeneracies. However, the relic gravitational wave spectrum provides a way to break degeneracy with respect to the non-canonical parameter $\alpha$, degeneracy with respect to the potential parameter $f$ persist. Finally, we specify the allowed ranges for the inflationary duration $N$ and the parameter $\alpha$, in light of the latest observational data. These results highlight the role of relic gravitational waves in refining inflationary models and illustrate the challenges in fully resolving parameter degeneracies.</description>

Abstract: The gravimagnetic dipole spacetime consists of two counter-rotating black holes of equal mass connected by a Misner string. For a particular distance in between them, the string is tensionless with the black holes at equilibrium with each other.
  The geodesics of relativistic massive, or massless particles are considered, leading to the identification of circular rotation trajectories. The velocities of these trajectories are computed.</description>

Abstract: We study the nonlinear radial stability of boson stars with a solitonic potential across the entire parameter space, focusing especially on families of solutions that support ultracompact models on the perturbatively stable branch. Using a dimensional reduction of the CCZ4 formulation of numerical relativity, we dynamically evolve these models with both internal and external perturbations. We find in particular that there are perturbatively stable models with positive binding energy that do not effectively disperse even under explicit perturbations, challenging the conventional wisdom that negative binding energy is a necessary condition for the dynamical stability of boson stars and other compact objects.</description>

Abstract: Ultralight bosons can be excited around spinning black holes via black hole superradiance. These boson clouds may play an important role in the orbital evolution of binary black holes. In this work, we investigate the formation and evolution of common envelopes of ultralight boson clouds in comparable mass-ratio black hole binaries. We describe the cloud evolution using gravitational molecular eigenstates and analyze the possible level transitions during orbital decay, as well as the impact on orbital dynamics. We find that the cloud can generally lead to eccentricity growth. In particular, the eccentricity may vary significantly during level transition, leaving an eccentricity of ${\cal O}(0.1)$ within the detection band of ground-based gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Suppression of Mass Inflation in Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m Interiors via Wheeler-DeWitt Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a canonical quantization, the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, of the interior geometry of static and spherically symmetric black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ framework, focusing on Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m. The wave function of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole is set to be on-shell and exhibiting exponential damping away from the classical locus. Horizon boundary conditions for the wave function generate two regimes: a single inward mode from event horizon yields monotonic decay, while superpositions produce either a quantum bounce (single time arrow) or interference-driven annihilation-to-nothing (two time arrows). We show that these are generic features of static black hole interiors. Furthermore, the wave function of the Schwarzschild black hole, obtained as the charge-neutral limit of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole, is monotonically decaying and no longer unbounded. Moreover, this framework unifies classical and quantum interiors, suggests a quantum gravitational suppression to the mass inflation, and motivates extensions to Kerr and regular black holes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from two scalar fields unifying the dark sector with inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational-wave background predicted by a two-scalar-field cosmological model that aims to unify primordial inflation with the dark sector, namely late-time dark energy and dark matter, in a single and self-consistent theoretical framework. The model is constructed from an action inspired by several extensions of general relativity and string-inspired scenarios and features a non-minimal interaction between the two scalar fields, while both remain minimally coupled to gravity. In this context, we derive the gravitational-wave energy spectrum over wavelengths ranging from today's Hubble horizon to those at the end of inflation. We employ the continuous Bogoliubov coefficient formalism, originally introduced to describe particle creation in an expanding Universe, in analogy to the well-established mechanism of gravitational particle production and, in particular, generalized to gravitons. Using this method, which enables an accurate description of graviton creation across all cosmological epochs, we find that inflation provides the dominant gravitational-wave contribution, while subdominant features arise at the inflation-radiation, radiation-matter, and matter-dark energy transitions, i.e., epochs naturally encoded inside our scalar field picture. The resulting energy density spectrum is thus compared with the sensitivity curves of the planned next-generation ground- and space-based gravitational-wave observatories. The comparison identifies frequency bands where the predicted signal could be probed, providing those windows associated with potentially detectable signals, bounded by our analyses. Consequences of our recipe are thus compared with numerical outcomes and the corresponding physical properties discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Heisenberg-type lower bounds on spacelike hypersurfaces in general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01628v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum theory on curved backgrounds, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is usually discussed in terms of ensemble variances and flat-space commutators. Here we take a different, preparation-based viewpoint tailored to sharp position measurements on spacelike hypersurfaces in general relativity. A projective localization is modeled as a von Neumann-L\"uders projection onto a geodesic ball $B_\Sigma(r)$ of radius $r$ on a Cauchy slice $(\Sigma,h)$, with the post-measurement state described by Dirichlet data. Using DeWitt-type momentum operators adapted to an orthonormal frame, we construct a geometric, coordinate-invariant momentum standard deviation $\sigma_p$ and show that strict confinement to $B_\Sigma(r)$ enforces an intrinsic kinetic-energy floor. The lower bound is set by the first Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the ball, $\sigma_p \ge \hbar\sqrt{\lambda_1}$, and is manifestly invariant under changes of coordinates and foliation. A variance decomposition separates the contribution of the modulus $|\psi|$ from phase-gradient fluctuations and clarifies how the spectral geometry of $(\Sigma,h)$ controls momentum uncertainty. Assuming only minimal geometric information, weak mean-convexity of the boundary yields a universal, scale-invariant Heisenberg-type product bound, $\sigma_p r \ge \pi\hbar/2$, depending only on the proper radius $r$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gravitational microlensing of various static and spherically symmetric non-singular black holes (and horizonless, non-singular compact objects of similar size). For pointlike sources we extend the parametrized post-Newtonian lensing framework to fourth order, whereas for extended sources we develop a ray tracing approach via a simple radiative transfer model. Modelling non-relativistic proper motion of the lens in front of a background star we record the apparent brightness as a function of time, resulting in a photometric lightcurve. Taking the star radius to smaller values, our numerical results approach the theoretical predictions for point-like sources. Compared to the Schwarzschild metric in an otherwise unmodified lensing geometry, we find that non-singular black hole models (and their horizonless, non-singular counterparts) both at finite size and for point lenses tend to feature larger magnifications in microlensing lightcurves.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits and their gravitational waves in EMRIs: supermassive black hole affected by galactic dark matter halos</title>

Abstract: Periodic orbits exhibiting zoom-whirl behavior have become attractive topics for studying particle dynamics and gravitational wave emission in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). This study systematically investigates periodic orbits around black holes and their gravitational wave radiation in three dark matter halo environments: NFW, Beta, and Moore models. The dark matter distribution in these models can be effectively incorporated using two parameters -- the dark matter characteristic mass and halo characteristic radius. Our results reveal that for a larger dark matter mass and a smaller characteristic radius, the shapes of the periodic orbits and the corresponding gravitational waveforms show more significant deviations from the Schwarzschild case. As the halo characteristic radius increases, the orbital shapes and waveform characteristics gradually converge with the Schwarzschild black hole results. Furthermore, our results also suggest that the NFW and Beta models produce nearly indistinguishable results, while the Moore model shows distinct signatures compared with Beta/NFW models. These findings deepen our understanding of dark matter halo effects on periodic motions and gravitational wave signatures.

      <title>Finite Populations &amp; Finite Time: The Non-Gaussianity of a Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong evidence for an isotropic, Gaussian gravitational wave background (GWB) has been found by multiple pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The GWB is expected to be sourced by a finite population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) emitting in the PTA sensitivity band, and astrophysical inference of PTA data sets suggests a GWB signal that is at the higher end of GWB spectral amplitude estimates. However, current inference analyses make simplifying assumptions, such as modeling the GWB as Gaussian, assuming that all SMBHBs only emit at frequencies that are integer multiples of the total observing time, and ignoring the interference between the signals of different SMBHBs. In this paper, we build analytical and numerical models of an astrophysical GWB without the above approximations, and compare the statistical properties of its induced PTA signal to those of a signal produced by a Gaussian GWB. We show that finite population and windowing effects introduce non-Gaussianities in the PTA signal, which are currently unmodeled in PTA analyses.</description>

      <title>On the regularity of deformed extremal horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that extremal black holes can act as amplifiers of new physics, due to horizon instabilities that enhance the effects of ultraviolet corrections. In this paper, we revisit some of these claims and investigate the viability of a class of non-spherical extremal black holes. In particular, we revisit the regularity of perturbed extremal Reissner--Nordstr\"om AdS black holes showing that, while some certain components of the scalar stress energy tensor diverge, the backreaction remains finite. We also study geodesic completeness, identifying a simple geometric constraint which, if satisfied, ensures that null geodesics cross the horizon smoothly. This analysis suggests the existence of a broad class of spacetimes with regular non-spherical horizons.</description>

      <title>Geodesic structure of spacetime near singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geodesic flows emanating from an arbitrary point $\mathscr{P}$ in a manifold $\mathscr{M}$ carry important information about the geometric properties of $\mathscr{M}$. These flows are characterized by Synge's world function and van Vleck determinant - important bi-scalars that also characterize quantum description of physical systems in $\mathscr{M}$. If $\mathscr{P}$ is a regular point, these bi-scalars have well known expansions around their flat space expressions, quantifying \textit{local flatness} and equivalence principle. We show that, if $\mathscr{P}$ is a singular point, the scaling behavior of these bi-scalars changes drastically, capturing the non-trivial structure of geodesic flows near singularities. This yields remarkable insights into classical structure of spacetime singularities and provides useful tool to study their quantum structure.</description>

      <title>GWTC-4.0: Searches for Gravitational-Wave Lensing Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves can be gravitationally lensed by massive objects along their path. Depending on the lens mass and the lens--source geometry, this can lead to the observation of a single distorted signal or multiple repeated events with the same frequency evolution. We present the results for gravitational-wave lensing searches on the data from the first part of the fourth LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing run (O4a). We search for strongly lensed events in the newly acquired data by (1) searching for an overall phase shift present in an image formed at a saddle point of the lens potential, (2) looking for pairs of detected candidates with consistent frequency evolution, and (3) identifying sub-threshold counterpart candidates to the detected signals. Beyond strong lensing, we also look for lensing-induced distortions in all detected signals using an isolated point-mass model. We do not find evidence for strongly lensed gravitational-wave signals and use this result to constrain the rate of detectable strongly lensed events and the merger rate density of binary black holes at high redshift. In the search for single distorted lensed signals, we find one outlier: GW231123_135430, for which we report more detailed investigations. While this event is interesting, the associated waveform uncertainties make its interpretation complicated, and future observations of the populations of binary black holes and of gravitational lenses will help determine the probability that this event could be lensed.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Lorentz-Dirac Dynamics and Post-Newtonian Interaction of Radiating Point Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18637v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine classical radiation reaction by combining the covariant Lorentz--Dirac formulation, its Landau--Lifshitz (LL) order reduction, and a post-Newtonian (PN) Hamiltonian treatment of interacting and radiating charges. After reviewing the LL reduction and its removal of runaway and preacceleration behavior, we verify energy balance in several relativistic single-particle scenarios by demonstrating agreement between the LL Larmor power and the loss of mechanical energy. We then construct an N-body framework based on the conservative Darwin Hamiltonian supplemented with the leading 1.5PN radiation--reaction term. Numerical simulations of charge-neutral binary systems of both symmetric and asymmetric mass configurations show orbital decay, circularization, and monotonic Hamiltonian decrease consistent with dipole radiative losses. The resulting framework provides a simple analogue of gravitational PN radiation reaction and a tractable system for studying dissipative and potentially chaotic electromagnetic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cosmological redshift of a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole: Towards estimating the Hubble constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we estimate the parameters of several astrophysical black holes hosted at the core of active galactic nuclei by studying the kinematics of test objects in their accretion disk. First, we derive expressions for the redshift and blueshift of photons emitted by a massive particle circularly orbiting a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole, and detected by a distant receding observer. The frequency-shift depends on the mass and distance of the black hole, the orbital radius of the photon source, as well as the Hubble constant, directly relating these quantities to astrophysical observables, namely, the redshift and the angular position of the emitting particle on the sky. We apply for the first time this theoretical model, which accounts for the universe expansion through the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, to real astrophysical systems using megamaser galaxies within the Hubble flow, namely UGC 3789, NGC 5765b, NGC 6264, NGC 6323, and CGCG 074-064. Bayesian inference based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods is employed to estimate the mass-to-distance ratio, the product of the Hubble constant with the distance, and the black hole angular position. Additionally, by assuming a Gaussian prior on the Hubble constant, the mass, distance, and the Hubble constant are also estimated. Furthermore, we find that cosmic expansion is embedded in the gravitational contribution of the frequency-shift within this spacetime metric. Therefore, our results introduce a general relativistic framework that accounts for cosmic expansion and differs from the standard empirical Hubble law.</description>

      <title>Inverse Area Corrections to Black Hole Entropy Area Formula in F(R) Gravity and Gravitational Wave Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider corrections to the Bekenstein Hawking Area Formula for black hole entropy, which have inverse powers of the horizon area for very large horizon areas, for classical spherically symmetric black hole solutions of F(R) modified gravity theory, using the Wald formula for the entropy function with modifications suggested by Jacobson, Kang and Myers. Requiring that the coefficient of such corrections be absolutely consistent with gravitational wave observational results validating the Hawking Area Theorem for binary black hole coalescences, implies constraints on parameters of F(R) gravity. For the sake of comparison, we present a computation of inverse area corrections for quantum black holes in quantum general relativity, using the It from Bit approach of Wheeler modified by some tenets of Loop Quantum Gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the numerous evidence for large-scale cosmic isotropy violation with the advent of the `precision cosmology' era, we explore the possible advantages of extending the flat $\Lambda$CDM model to more general models in order to constrain anisotropies in the universe, otherwise absent in the standard model based on FLRW spacetime. Such extensions are offered by the topologically unique Thurston geometries, which are homogeneous but anisotropic spacetime models. In this work, we attempt to distinguish Thurston geometries from one another by introducing anisotropies via different scale factors in different directions, thereby introducing additional model parameters such as shear, eccentricity, curvature, and a preferred axis. We used the latest compilation of Pantheon+ \&amp; SH0ES Type Ia supernova data for deriving model constraints, and found mild evidence of large-scale isotropy violation.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic angles in Lorentzian length spaces and timelike curvature bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.09491v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the synthetic-geometric framework of Lorentzian (pre-)length spaces developed in Kunzinger and S\"amann (Ann. Glob. Anal. Geom. 54(3):399--447, 2018) we introduce a notion of a hyperbolic angle, an angle between timelike curves and related concepts like timelike tangent cone and exponential map. This provides valuable technical tools for the further development of the theory and paves the way for the main result of the article, which is the characterization of timelike curvature bounds (defined via triangle comparison) with an angle monotonicity condition. Further, we improve on a geodesic non-branching result for spaces with timelike curvature bounded below.</description>

      <title>UV stability of 1-loop radiative corrections in higher-derivative scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the theory of a higher-derivative (HD) real scalar field $\phi$ coupled to a complex scalar $\sigma$, the coupling of the $\phi$ and $\sigma$ being given by two types, $\lambda_{\sigma\phi}\sigma^\dagger \sigma\phi^{2}$ and $\xi_{\sigma\phi}\sigma^\dagger \sigma\left(\partial_{\mu}\phi\right)^{2}$. We evaluate $\phi$ one-loop corrections $\delta V(\sigma)$ to the effective potential of $\sigma$, both the contribution from the positive norm part of $\phi$ and that from the {\it negative norm part} (ghost). We show that $\delta V(\sigma_{\rm cl})$ at $\sigma_{\rm cl}\to \infty$, where $\sigma_{\rm cl}$ is a classical value of $\sigma$, is positive, implying the stability of $\delta V(\sigma_{\rm cl})$ by the HD 1-loop radiative corrections at high energy.</description>

      <title>Inference on inner galaxy structure via gravitational waves from supermassive binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background by pulsar-timing arrays indicates the presence of a population of supermassive black hole binaries. Although the observed spectrum generally matches predictions for orbital evolution driven by gravitational-wave emission in circular orbits, there is a preference for a spectral turnover at the lowest observed frequencies, which may point to substantial hardening during a transition from early environmental influences to later stages dominated by emission. In the vicinity of these binaries, the ejection of stars or dark matter particles through gravitational three-body slingshots efficiently extracts orbital energy, leading to a low-frequency turnover in the spectrum. Here we model how the gravitational-wave spectrum depends on the initial inner galactic profile before scouring by binary ejections while accounting for a range of initial binary eccentricities. By analysing the NANOGrav 15-year data, we find that a parsec-scale galactic-centre density of around $10^6 M_{\odot} \mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ is favoured across most of the parameter space, thus shedding light on the environmental effects that shape black hole evolution and the combined matter density near galaxy centres.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent deflection reconstruction: new technique to search for gravitational waves with the cosmic microwave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) passing through the Earth cause a correlated pattern of time-dependent deflections of the apparent position of astronomical sources. We build upon standard lensing reconstruction techniques to develop a new time-dependent quadratic estimator, providing a novel technique to search for the deflections produced by GWs using observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We find that the time-dependent deflection reconstruction is many orders of magnitude more sensitive than the ordinary static lensing estimator, and it can be employed with the data collected by existing and future CMB surveys, without requiring any modification to the experimental or survey design. We demonstrate that CMB surveys offer sensitivity to GWs across a broad frequency range: while the sensitivity will not be competitive over the frequency range covered by pulsar timing arrays, it does extend coverage to both lower and higher frequencies. Finally, we discuss how our methods can be extended to search for other time-varying signals, and also how it can be applied to surveys at other wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Harvesting Contextuality from the Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11773v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>A no-go theorem in bumblebee vector-tensor cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bumblebee models, a class of vector-tensor theories in which a vector field acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value that spontaneously breaks spacetime symmetries, are ubiquitous in the literature. By constructing the most general bumblebee action from all diffeomorphism-invariant marginal operators together with a general potential, aiming to cover all the bumblebee models studied in the literature, we perform a complete linear perturbation analysis on a spatially flat FLRW background. We show that for generic marginal couplings, the scalar sector propagates extra degrees of freedom beyond the single scalar expected for a massive vector. Enforcing the correct number of propagating modes in a cosmological setup forces degeneracy relations between the marginal couplings, which in turn completely fix the potential at the background level and render the remaining scalar infinitely strongly coupled already at linear order of perturbations. We establish a no-go theorem stating that the following conditions cannot be simultaneously satisfied: (i) the most general marginal action, (ii) a homogeneous and isotropic background, (iii) no extra propagating degrees of freedom around a spatially flat FLRW background, and (iv) healthy cosmological perturbations.</description>

      <title>Polar Mounds on Strangeon Stars: the Neutrino Emission from Ultraluminous X-ray Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs) serve as unique astrophysical laboratories, offering critical insights into accretion physics under extreme conditions, such as strong magnetic fields and super-Eddington accretion rates. Additionally, the nature of pulsars, i.e., the equation of state of supranuclear matter, is still a matter of intense debate, basing on either conventional neutron stars or strange stars. In this work, in order to differentiate the conjectured states of matter, we investigate accretion columns of ULXPs based on the strangeon-star (SS) model, focusing on the thermal mound at the column base. Accounting for Coulomb and strangeness barriers of SSs, we find that the mound can reach $0.7-0.95\,\rm km$ in height with temperatures above $10^9\, \rm K$, enabling substantial neutrino emission via electron-positron annihilation. At low accretion rates ($&lt; 10^{20}\, \rm g\,s^{-1}$), photons dominate the luminosity, while at higher rates ($&gt; 10^{21}\, \rm g\, s^{-1}$), photon trapping makes neutrino emission the main cooling channel, with total luminosity exceeding photon emission, which saturates near $10^{41}\, \rm erg\,s^{-1}$. Even though the predicted neutrino flux from the nearest system, Swift J0243.6$+$6124, lies well below the diffuse MeV background--implying that detectable emission would require substantially closer or more luminous sources--these results demonstrate the key role of the thermal mound and SS properties in accretion, providing a foundation for future ULXP studies and suggesting that neutrino observations could, in principle, offer a novel probe of SSs and extreme supranuclear matter.</description>

      <title>The steep redshift evolution of the hierarchical binary black hole merger rate may cause the $z$-$\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is growing evidence from gravitational-wave observations that some merging black holes are created from previous mergers. Using the prediction that these hierarchically-merged black holes have dimensionless spin magnitudes of $\chi \approx 0.69$, we identify a subpopulation in the gravitational-wave data consistent with a hierarchical-merger origin in dense star clusters. This subpopulation's primary mass distribution peaks at $17.0^{+18.3}_{-4.4},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, which is approximately twice as large as its secondary mass distribution's mode ($10.5^{+29.7}_{-4.7},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), and its spin tilt distribution is consistent with isotropy. Our inferred secondary mass distributions imply that isolated binary evolution may still be needed to explain the entirety of the $9\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak. Surprisingly, we find that the rate of hierarchical mergers may evolve more steeply with redshift than the rest of the population ($98.0\%$ credibility): the fraction of all binary black holes that are hierarchically formed at $z=0.1$ is $0.03^{+0.05}_{-0.02}$, compared to $0.09^{+0.11}_{-0.07}$ at $z=1$. This provides an explanation for the previously-discovered broadening of the effective spin distribution with redshift. Our results have implications for star cluster formation histories, as they suggest the potential existence of a high-redshift population of massive, compact clusters.</description>
