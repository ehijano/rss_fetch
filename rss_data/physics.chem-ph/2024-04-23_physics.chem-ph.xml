      <title>Reformulation of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory for Non-Perturbative Dynamics: The Rabi Oscillation Problem Resolved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rabi oscillations have long been thought to be out of reach in simulations using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), a prominent symptom of the failure of the adiabatic approximation for non-perturbative dynamics. We present a reformulation of TDDFT which requires response quantities only, thus enabling an adiabatic approximation to predict such dynamics accurately because the functional is evaluated on a domain much closer to the domain for which it was derived. Our reformulation applies to any real-time dynamics, redeeming TDDFT far from equilibrium. Examples of a resonantly-driven local excitation in a model He atom, and charge-transfer in the LiCN molecule are given.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing homolytic versus heterolytic bond dissociation of phenyl sulfonium cations with localized active space methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling chemical reactions with quantum chemical methods is challenging when the electronic structure varies significantly throughout the reaction, as well as when electronic excited states are involved. Multireference methods such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) can handle these multiconfigurational situations. However, even if the size of needed active space is affordable, in many cases the active space does not change consistently from reactant to product, causing discontinuities in the potential energy surface. The localized active space SCF (LASSCF) is a cheaper alternative to CASSCF for strongly correlated systems with weakly correlated fragments. The method is used for the first time to study a chemical reaction, namely the bond dissociation of a mono-, di-, and triphenylsulfonium cation. LASSCF calculations generate smooth potential energy scans more easily than the corresponding, more computationally expensive, CASSCF calculations, while predicting similar bond dissociation energies. Our calculations suggest a homolytic bond cleavage for di- and triphenylsulfonium, and a heterolytic pathway for monophenylsulfonium.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Collision-Induced Excitation and Quenching of Atomic Nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excited atomic nitrogen atoms play an important role in plasma formation in hypersonic shock-waves, as happens during spacecraft reentry and other high velocity vehicle applications. In this study, we have thoroughly studied collision induced excitation (CIE) associated with two colliding nitrogen atoms in the N(4S), N(2D) and N(2P) states at collisions energies up to 6 eV, using time-independent scattering calculations to determine cross sections and temperature-dependent rate coefficients. The calculations are based on potential curves and couplings determined in earlier MRCI calculations with large basis sets, and the results are in good agreement with experiment where comparisons are possible. To properly consider the spin-orbit coupling matrix, we have developed a scaling method for treating transitions between different fine-structure components with calculations that only require calculations with two coupled states, and with this we define accurate degeneracy factors for determining cross sections and rate coefficients that include all states. The results indicate that both spin-orbit and derivative coupling effects can play important roles in collisional excitation and quenching, and that although derivative coupling is always much stronger than spin-orbit, there are many transitions where only spin-orbit can contribute. As part of this, we identify two distinct pathways associated with N(2D) relaxation, including one Auger-like mechanism leading to 2N(2D) that could be important at high temperature.</description>

      <title>A community-led calibration of the Zr isotope Reference Materials: NIST candidate RM 8299 and SRM 3169</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the field of Zr stable isotopes is rapidly expanding from the study of mass-independent to that of mass-dependent isotope effects, a variety of Zr standards have appeared in the literature. While several of these standards have been proposed as the ideal isotope reference material (iRM) against which all data should be reported, none of them have been shown to meet the compositional and/or conflict-of-interest-free distribution requirements put forth by the community. To remedy this situation, we report on a community-led effort to develop and calibrate a scale defining iRM for Zr isotopes: NIST RM 8299. Developed in partnership with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) from the widely used SRM 3169 Zr Standard Solution, the candidate RM 8299 was calibrated through an inter-laboratory study involving three laboratories. Our data show that RM 8299 meets all requirements of an ideal iRM. It is an isotopically homogeneous, high-purity reference material, that is free of isotope anomalies, and whose composition is identical to that of a major geological reservoir (Ocean Island Basalts). Furthermore, RM 8299 will be curated and distributed by NIST, a neutral, conflict-of-interest free organization, and was produced in sufficient quantities to last multiple decades. We recommend that all Zr isotope data to be reported against RM 8299. Our results also show that SRM 3169 lots #130920 and #071226 have identical composition to RM 8299. Therefore, using RM 8299 as the scale defining iRM will enable direct comparison of all future data with the vast majority of the existing literature data, both for mass-independent and mass-dependent isotope effects. To facilitate conversion of d94/90Zr values reported against other Zr standards, we provide high-precision conversion factors to the RM 8299 scale obtained using the double-spike method.</description>

      <title>Electric Field Gradient Calculations for Ice VIII and IX using Polarizable Embedding: A Comparative Study on Classical Computers and Quantum Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test the performance of the Polarizable Embedding Variational Quantum Eigensolver Self-Consistent-Field (PE-VQE-SCF) model for computing electric field gradients with comparisons to conventional complete active space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) calculations and experimental results. We compute quadrupole coupling constants for ice VIII and ice IX. We find that the inclusion of the environment is crucial for obtaining results that match the experimental data. The calculations for ice VIII are within the experimental uncertainty for both CASSCF and VQE-SCF for oxygen and lie close to the experimental value for ice IX as well. With the VQE-SCF, which is based on an Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Problem-Tailored (ADAPT) ansatz, we find that the inclusion of the environment and the size of the different basis sets do not directly affect the gate counts. However, by including an explicit environment, the wavefunction and, therefore, the optimization problem becomes more complicated, which usually results in the need to include more operators from the operator pool, thereby increasing the depth of the circuit.</description>

      <title>Strong exciton-polariton correlations shape the many-body polariton dynamics in two-dimensional metal halide semiconductor microcavities: Competitive pathways for polariton condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polariton condensation relies on the massive occupation of the lowest-energy polariton state beyond a required critical density. The mechanisms driving both the occupation and depopulation of the lowest-energy polariton state all rely on multi-particle scattering, and its dynamics determine the extent to which condensates can form spontaneously. To pinpoint many-body processes hindering polariton condensation in two-dimensional metal-halide semiconductors, we examine the exciton-polariton dynamics in a Fabry-P\'erot microcavity over timescales involving the dynamics of multi-particle polariton ($\ll 1$\,ps) and exciton scattering processes ($\gg 1$\,ps). We find evidence of enhanced nonlinear exciton-exciton scattering in the microcavity compared to that in the semiconductor, and that the exciton reservoir mediates polariton scattering. We posit that the complex scattering landscape between the exciton reservoir and polaritons limits the formation of polariton condensates in two-dimensional metal-halide semiconductors, and we discuss the generality of our conclusions for materials systems in which the lattice mediates strong multi-particle correlations.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast nanocomposite scintillators based on Cd-enhanced CsPbCl3 nanocrystals in polymer matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP-NCs) embedded in polymer matrices are gaining traction for next-generation radiation detectors. While progress has been made on green-emitting CsPbBr3 NCs, scant attention has been given to the scintillation properties of CsPbCl3 NCs, which emit size-tunable UV-blue light matching the peak efficiency of ultrafast photodetectors. In this study, we explore the scintillation characteristics of CsPbCl3 NCs produced through a scalable method and treated with CdCl2. Spectroscopic, radiometric and theoretical analysis on both untreated and treated NCs uncover deep hole trap states due to surface undercoordinated chloride ions, eliminated by Pb to Cd substitution. This yields near-perfect efficiency and resistance to polyacrylate mass-polymerization. Radiation hardness tests demonstrate stability to high gamma doses while time-resolved experiments reveal ultrafast radioluminescence with an average lifetime as short as 210 ps. These findings enhance our comprehension of LHP NCs' scintillation properties, positioning CsPbCl3 as a promising alternative to conventional fast scintillators.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced Spin Centers in Photocatalytic Metal-Organic Framework UiO-66</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for the advanced photocatalytic active materials. These porous crystalline compounds have large active surface area and structural tunability, highly competitive with oxides, the well-established material class for the photocatalysis. However, due to their complex organic and coordination chemistry composition, photophysical mechanisms involved in the photocatalytic process in MOFs are still not well understood. Employing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, we investigate the fundamental processes of electron and hole generation, as well as capture events that lead to the formation of various radical species in UiO-66, an archetypical MOF photocatalyst. As a result, we detected a manifold of photoinduced electron spin centers, which we subsequently analyzed and identified with the help of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our findings provide new insights into the photo-induced charge transfer processes, which are the basis of photocatalytic activity in UiO-66. This sets the stage for further studies on photogenerated spin centers in this and similar MOF materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum study of the CH$_3^+$ photodissociation in full dimension Neural Networks potential energy surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CH$_3^+$, a cornerstone intermediate in interstellar chemistry, has recently been detected for the first time by the James Webb Space Telescope. The photodissociation of this ion is studied here. Accurate explicitly correlated multi-reference configuration interaction {\it ab initio} calculations are done, and full dimensional potential energy surfaces are developed for the three lower electronic states, with a fundamental invariant neural network method. The photodissociation cross section is calculated using a full dimensional quantum wave packet method, in heliocentric Radau coordinates. The wave packet is represented in angular and radial grids allowing to reduce the number of points physically accessible, requiring to push up the spurious states appearing when evaluating the angular kinetic terms, through a projection technique. The photodissociation spectra, when employed in astrochemical models to simulate the conditions of the Orion Bar, results in a lesser destruction of CH$_3^+$ compared to that obtained when utilizing the recommended values in the kinetic database for astrochemistry (KIDA).</description>

      <title>Effect of the presence of pinned particles on the structural parameters of a liquid and correlation between structure and dynamics at the local level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pinning particles at the equilibrium configuration of the liquid is expected not to affect the structure and any property that depends on the structure while slowing down the dynamics. This leads to a breakdown of the structure dynamics correlation. Here, we calculate two structural quantities, the pair excess entropy, $S_2$, and the mean field caging potential, the inverse of which is our structural order parameter (SOP). We show that when the pinned particles are treated the same way as the mobile particles, both $S_2$ and SOP of the mobile particles remain the same as that of the unpinned system, and the structure dynamics correlation decreases with an increase in pinning density, "c". However, when we treat the pinned particles as a different species, even if we consider that the structure does not change, the expression of $S_2$ and SOP changes. The microscopic expressions show that interaction between a pinned and mobile particle affects $S_2$ and SOP more than the interaction between two mobile particles. We show that a similar effect is also present in the calculation of the excess entropy and the primary reason for the well-known vanishing of the configurational entropy at high temperatures. We further show that contrary to common belief, the pinning process does change the structure. When these two effects are considered, both $S_2$ and SOP decrease with an increase in "c", and the correlation between the structural parameters and the dynamics continues even for higher values of "c".</description>

      <title>Enhancement of vibrationally assisted energy transfer by proximity to exceptional points, probed by fluorescence-detected vibrational spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emulation of energy transfer processes in natural systems on quantum platforms can further our understanding of complex dynamics in nature. One notable example is the demonstration of vibrationally assisted energy transfer (VAET) on a trapped-ion quantum emulator, which offers insights for the energetics of light harvesting. In this work, we expand the study of VAET simulation with trapped ions to a non-Hermitian quantum system comprising a $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetric chromophore dimer weakly coupled to a vibrational mode. We first characterize exceptional points (EPs) and non- Hermitian features of the excitation energy transfer processes in the absence of the vibration, finding a degenerate pair of second-order EPs. Exploring the non-Hermitian dynamics of the whole system including vibrations, we find that energy transfer accompanied by absorption of phonons from a vibrational mode can be significantly enhanced near such a degenerate EP. Our calculations reveal a unique spectral feature accompanying the coalescing of eigenstates and eigenenergies that provides a novel approach to probe the degenerate EP by fluorescence-detected vibrational spectroscopy. Enhancement of the VAET process near the EP is found to be due to maximal favorability of phonon absorption at the degenerate EP, enabling multiple simultaneous excitations. Our work on improving VAET processes in non-Hermitian quantum systems paves the way for leveraging non-Hermiticity in quantum dynamics related to excitation energy transfer.</description>

      <title>Critical assessment of $G_0W_0$ calculations for 2D materials: the example of monolayer MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials combine many fascinating properties that make them more interesting than their three-dimensional counterparts for a variety of applications. For example, 2D materials exhibit stronger electron-phonon and electron-hole interactions, and their energy gaps and effective carrier masses can be easily tuned. Surprisingly, published band gaps of several 2D materials obtained with the $GW$ approach, the state-of-the-art in electronic-structure calculations, are quite scattered. The details of these calculations, such as the underlying geometry, the starting point, the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling, and the treatment of the Coulomb potential can critically determine how accurate the results are. Taking monolayer MoS$_2$ as a representative material, we employ the linearized augmented planewave + local orbital method to systematically investigate how all these aspects affect the quality of $G_0W_0$ calculations, and also provide a summary of literature data. We conclude that the best overall agreement with experiments and coupled-cluster calculations is found for $G_0W_0$ results with HSE06 as a starting point including spin-orbit coupling, a truncated Coulomb potential, and an analytical treatment of the singularity at $q=0$.</description>

      <title>Transitions and Thermodynamics on Species Graphs of Chemical Reaction Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) exhibit complex dynamics governed by their underlying network structure. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to study the dynamics of CRNs by representing them on species graphs (S-graphs). By scaling concentrations by conservation laws, we obtain a graph representation of transitions compatible with the S-graph, which allows us to treat the dynamics in CRNs as transitions between chemicals. We also define thermodynamic-like quantities on the S-graph from the introduced transitions and investigate their properties, including the relationship between specieswise forces, activities, and conventional thermodynamic quantities. Remarkably, we demonstrate that this formulation can be developed for a class of irreversible CRNs, while for reversible CRNs, it is related to conventional thermodynamic quantities associated with reactions. The behavior of these specieswise quantities is numerically validated using an oscillating system (Brusselator). Our work provides a novel methodology for studying dynamics on S-graphs, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between the structure and dynamics of chemical reaction networks.</description>
