      <title>Optimizing and reducing stochastic resonance by noise color in globally coupled bistable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the collective signal response of two typical nonlinear dynamical models, the mean-field coupled overdamped bistable oscillators and the underdamped Duffing oscillators, with respect to both the additive Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise and the weak periodical stimulus. Based on the linear response theory, we theoretically derive the dependences of the ensemble signal response on the noise intensity and driving frequency of both systems. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that the noise color monotonically weakens the strength of stochastic resonance in the overdamped situation, but nonmonotonically strengthens it in the underdamped counterpart. Such a result goes against the conventional wisdom that the color of the additive noise impairs the magnitude of stochastic resonance. Finally, we perform the numerical integration to verify our theoretical results and discuss potential connections with the functional significance of 1/f noise.</description>

      <title>Monitoring microplastics in live reef-building corals with microscopic laser particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microplastics are an emerging threat for reef-building corals. However, the understanding of microplastic uptake into coral tissue and the long-term integration of microplastic into the coral skeleton remains limited due to the invasiveness of state-of-the-art methods for monitoring and localizing microplastic. Here, we exploit optical resonances to turn microplastics into microscopic laser particles. Their characteristic emission allows to track of microplastics in vivo and to perform simultaneous sensing of the microenvironment, shedding light on the internalization and transport pathways of single microplastic particles in corals.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced Extreme Events in Hodgkin-Huxley Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme events are rare, large-scale deviations from typical system behavior that can occur in nonlinear dynamical systems. In this study, we explore the emergence of extreme events within a network of identical stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with mean-field coupling. The neurons are exposed to uncorrelated noise, which introduces stochastic electrical fluctuations that influence their spiking activity. Analyzing the variations in the amplitude of the mean field, we observe a smooth transition from small-amplitude, out-of-sync activity to synchronized spiking activity as the coupling parameter increases, while an abrupt transition occurs with increasing noise intensity. However, beyond a certain threshold, the coupling abruptly suppresses the spiking activity of the network. Our analysis reveals that the influence of noise combined with neuronal coupling near the abrupt transitions can trigger cascades of synchronized spiking activity, identified as extreme events. The analysis of the entropy of the mean field allows us to detect the parameter region where these events occur. We characterize the statistics of these events and find that, as the network size increases, the parameter range where they occur decreases significantly. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms driving extreme events in neural networks and how noise and neural coupling shape collective behavior.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of chaotic dynamics in random modular networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a model of randomly connected neural populations and study its dynamics by means of the dynamical mean-field theory and simulations. Our analysis uncovers a rich phase diagram, featuring high- and low-dimensional chaotic phases, separated by a crossover region characterized by low values of the maximal Lyapunov exponent and participation ratio dimension, but with high values of the Lyapunov dimension that change significantly across the region. Counterintuitively, chaos can be attenuated by either adding noise to strongly modular connectivity or by introducing modularity into random connectivity. Extending the model to include a multilevel, hierarchical connectivity reveals that a loose balance between activities across levels drives the system towards the edge of chaos.</description>

      <title>Physics of droplet regulation in biological cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situations inside cells. This review discusses three general aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets posses complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo simulation framework for investigating the effect of inter-track coupling on H$_2$O$_2$ productions at ultra-high dose rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Lower production of H$_2$O$_2$ in water is a hallmark of ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) compared to the conventional dose rate (CDR). However, the current computational models based on the predicted yield of H$_2$O$_2$ are in opposite of the experimental data. Methods: We construct an analytical model for the rate equation in the production of H$_2$O$_2$ from \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals and use it as a guide to propose a hypothetical geometrical inhomogeneity in the configuration of particles in the FLASH-UHDR beams. We perform a series of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the track structures for a system of charged particles impinging the medium in the form of clusters and/or bunches. Results: We demonstrate the interplay of diffusion, reaction rates, and overlaps in track-spacing attribute to a lower yield of H$_2$O$_2$ at FLASH-UHDR vs. CDR. This trend is reversed if spacing among the tracks becomes larger than a critical value, with a length scale that is proportional to the diffusion length of \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals modulated by a rate of decay due to recombination with other species, available within a track, and the space among the tracks. The latter is substantial on the suppressing of the H$_2$O$_2$ population at FLASH-UHDR relative to CDR. Conclusions: Based on our analysis of the present work, at FLASH-UHDR, the lower yield in H$_2$O$_2$ can be interpreted as a signature of bunching the particles in beams of ionizing radiation. The beams enter the medium in closely packed clusters and form inhomogeneities in the track-structure distribution. Thus the MC simulations based on the assumption of uniformly distributed tracks are unable to explain the experimental data.</description>
