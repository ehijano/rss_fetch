      <title>On the Generation of Phononic Frequency Combs Using Defect Modes of Phononic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method for generating phononic frequency combs (PFCs) using defect-localized modes in a two-dimensional hexagonal phononic crystal. Localized vibration modes from a singular point defect produce evenly spaced spectral lines corresponding to PFCs. Numerical modelling reveals robust energy transfer under a single-tone drive, generating spectral sidebands. These results demonstrate defect engineering in phononic crystals as a tunable platform for PFC generation with significant applications in high-resolution sensing, timing, and quantum-acoustic technologies.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Photonic Crystal Bolometer with Ultra-Low Heat Capacity for Scalable Thermal Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed thermal imaging in the long-wave infrared (LWIR) is critical for applications from autonomous navigation to medical screening, yet existing uncooled detectors are fundamentally constrained. Resistive bolometers are limited by electronic noise and the parasitic thermal load of wired readouts, while state-of-the-art nanomechanical resonators require vacuum packaging to maintain the mechanical $Q$ needed for sensitivity, preventing simultaneous fast and high-sensitivity operation. Here, we introduce and demonstrate an uncooled thermal detector that addresses these challenges via an all-optical transduction mechanism. The heterogeneously integrated pixel is engineered for minimal thermal mass, combining pyrolytic carbon absorbers for broadband LWIR absorption, hollow zirconia structures for ultra-low-conductance thermal isolation -- leaving gas-mediated convection as the dominant tunable pathway -- and a silicon photonic crystal cavity that serves as a high-$Q$ optical thermometer. Operating at ambient temperature and pressure, we measure a specific detectivity of $1.1\times10^{7}$ Jones and a thermal time constant of $34~\mu \mathrm{s}$, corresponding to a speed that surpasses typical high-sensitivity uncooled technologies by an order of magnitude. While the demonstrated sensitivity is instrument-limited, our analysis shows that the device architecture itself supports a &gt;25-fold performance enhancement toward its fundamental thermorefractive-noise-limited value ($3.1\times10^{8}$ Jones). Crucially, because the optical readout is pressure-insensitive, the operating point can be tuned along the speed-sensitivity trade-off. We expect this architecture to provide a general route toward scalable, high-performance thermal imaging systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Multi-Objective Wave-Momentum Shaping in Scattering Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation forces and torques are key to manipulating objects with acoustic or electromagnetic waves. An important concept in this context is the Generalized Wigner-Smith (GWS) matrix, which has previously been primarily studied for optimizing radiation forces and torques on single objects embedded inside complex scattering environments. Here, we develop a unified scattering framework that rigorously establishes this connection for arbitrary inhomogeneous, lossless electromagnetic and acoustic media, as well as for controlling multiple objects individually. Variational identities relate parametric changes of the medium to perturbations of the scattering fields, from which the GWS matrix emerges as a natural generator of radiation forces and torques. For a single object, its extremal eigenstates yield maximal force or torque along a chosen direction; for multiple objects, the same framework defines Pareto-optimal compromises among competing objectives and reveals uncertainty relations for their simultaneous optimization. This establishes a comprehensive foundation towards collective and selective manipulation of objects in complex media.</description>

      <title>Scalable Synthesis of Large-Area WS2 Thin Films from Tungsten Precursors by Thermal CVD and Their Application in Schottky-Barrier Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional tungsten disulfide (WS2) is a promising semiconductor for next-generation optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices, but scalable routes to uniform, large-area films remain challenging. In this study, a systematic thermal chemical vapor deposition (T-CVD) strategy is presented to synthesize centimeter-scale WS2 thin films by sulfurizing tungsten (W) precursors in a controlled sulfur vapor environment. High-purity sputtered W thin films on SiO2/Si and W foils were sulfurized at temperatures between 400 and 1000 C, with Raman spectroscopy identifying 800 C as the optimal growth temperature. Under these conditions, the films exhibit the characteristic E12g (349.7 cm-1) and A1g (416.8 cm-1) modes with narrow full-width at half-maximum values, indicative of high crystallinity and controlled thickness. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy collectively validate the creation of stoichiometric, layered WS2 with significantly enhanced uniformity and diminished roughness when utilizing sputtered W thin films in contrast to W foils. Leveraging this optimized process, WS2 films grown on W foils were transferred onto target substrates, including indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass, using a PMMA-assisted wet-transfer method that preserves structural integrity over large areas. Schottky-barrier solar cells with an Au/WS2/ITO architecture fabricated from these films deliver a short-circuit current density of 7.91 mA cm-2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.495 V, and a power conversion efficiency of 1.45 percent. These results demonstrate that sulfurization of W thin films and foils via T-CVD provides a scalable, substrate-compatible platform for integrating WS2 into practical optoelectronic and low-cost photovoltaic technologies.</description>

      <title>Smart Traffic Systems: A Comprehensive Review of Recent Advancements, Technologies, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With an ever-growing urban population, the need for transportation is increasing at an alarming rate. Thus, the massive increase in the number of vehicles is creating traffic congestion which creates various environmental, societal, and economic problems. To tackle traffic-related issues, several Smart Traffic Systems (STS) have been proposed and implemented. As a result, a comprehensive review of STS has become necessary. The main objective of this paper is to provide an overview and a thorough review of the existing STSs in terms of various technological approaches, traffic detection technologies using different sensors, various networking/communication tools, and their pros and cons. The paper also provides information on major STS services. In addition, challenges related to modern STS are identified. Therefore, the taxonomy of STSs provided in this paper will aid researchers, urban planners, and policymakers to recognize and install the best-suited STSs for their settings.</description>

      <title>Photoionization current spectroscopy of individual silicon vacancies in silicon carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defect charge-state dynamics are central to both spin-photon interfaces and photoelectrical spin readout. Despite the significance of silicon vacancies (V1/V2) in silicon carbide (4H-SiC) for both applications, their ionization behavior has remained unclear because their lack of optical blinking prevents conventional charge-state analysis. Here, we employ photocurrent spectroscopy of individual defects to measure the wavelength dependence of their excitation and ionization cross-sections. We reveal that V1 and V2 exhibit similar ionization cross-sections that increase toward shorter wavelengths, while carbon vacancies dominate the more steeply increasing background photocurrent. These results indicate that V2 and its surrounding environment appear more robust than V1 under resonant excitation. We also identify wavelength regimes that optimize defect-origin photocurrent for photoelectrical spin readout relative to background contributions, which differ between single-defect and ensemble measurements. Our results establish photocurrent spectroscopy as a powerful complement to optical methods, advancing the development of defect-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Broadband Low-Frequency Near-Perfect Sound Absorber via Coupled Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple yet effective method for low-frequency broadband acoustic absorption. The absorber consists of two concentric space-coiling resonators with distinct resonance frequencies, with the inner resonator characterized by a low-quality factor (Q) and the outer resonator by a high Q factor. The coupling between the two resonators enables efficient broadband absorption within a deep-subwavelength range exceeding 15 times the structural thickness. Numerical simulations, theoretical analysis, and experimental measurements demonstrate that highly efficient (greater than 80 percent) low-frequency broadband absorption is achieved in the range of 198-315 Hz, as well as a 58 percent fractional bandwidth spanning 183-334 Hz. Furthermore, with the outer dimension fixed, adjusting the parameters of the internal resonators enables flexible tuning of the absorption band across a broad frequency range. This work presents a powerful design methodology that eliminates the need for traditional complex spatially arranged multi-resonator assemblies. By employing a single class of resonant units, thin and efficient broadband absorbers can be achieved, offering various application prospects in the field of low-frequency sound absorption.</description>

      <title>Precision Measurements of Higgs Hadronic Decay Modes at the FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expected precision at the FCC-ee on the product $\sigma\times\mathcal{B}(H\rightarrow b\bar{b}, c\bar{c},s\bar{s},gg)$ of Higgs boson production cross sections times branching ratios of hadronic decays is presented. This study provides the first comprehensive determination of all major hadronic Higgs decay modes in a combined fit at future $e^+ e^-$ colliders, using both Higgs-strahlung ($ZH$) and Vector boson fusion ($\nu\bar{\nu} H$) production processes, with a full treatment of interference effects in the $\nu\bar{\nu} jj$ final state. It assumes four identical IDEA detectors collecting $e^+e^-$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=240$ and $365\,$GeV. The combination of all channels across both energies, with full covariance between production and decay modes, yields a production cross-section times branching-ratio precision at the percent to per-mil level for the dominant hadronic final states ($b\bar{b}, c\bar{c},gg$). These results provide a comprehensive input to the determination of Higgs coupling projections at the FCC-ee, and they establish for the first time sensitivity to the rare decay $H\rightarrow s\bar{s}$, demonstrating that FCC-ee has the potential to provide evidence of the strange-quark Yukawa coupling.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale imaging of reduced forward bias at V-defects in green-emitting nitride LEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Record wall-plug efficiencies in long-wavelength, III-nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have recently been achieved through improvements in electrical efficiency in devices containing V-defects. Numerical modeling suggests this may be due to reduced barrier heights for charge injection in thinned, low-Indium quantum wells parallel to semi-polar V-defect facets. To test this proposition, a novel approach in which the tip of a scanning tunneling luminescence microscope as a local hole injector, is used to map the optoelectronic properties of commercial, green-emitting LED heterostructures around V-defects with nanoscale spatial resolution. A 1 V reduction in the forward bias necessary for current injection at V-defect rims is observed. This, combined with the observation of small (~10 meV) blue shifts in the locally emitted electroluminescence, unambiguously confirms the charge injection mechanism.</description>

      <title>A Continuum Macro-Model for Bistable Periodic Auxetic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A macro-constitutive model for the deformation response of periodic rotating bistable auxetic surfaces is developed. Focus is placed on isotropic surfaces made of bistable hexagonal cells composed of six triangular units with two stable equilibrium states. Adopting a variational formulation, the effective stress-strain response is derived from a free energy function expressed in terms of the invariants of the logarithmic strain. To address the mathematical ill-posedness and numerical artifacts--such as mesh sensitivity--arising from the double-well nature of the free energy, two regularization approaches are introduced: (i) a gradient-enhanced first invariant of the logarithmic strain, and (ii) an artificial material rate dependency. Although neither regularization guarantees solution uniqueness, the former mitigates mesh sensitivity, while the latter improves the convergence behavior of the nonlinear numerical scheme by promoting smooth temporal evolution of transition localization and enabling the system to overcome snap-backs induced by local non-proportional loading near transition fronts. The model is implemented using membrane/shell structural elements and plane stress continuum ones within the ABAQUS finite element suite. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed formulation and its implementation.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast propagation of magnon-polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The manipulation of magnetization lies at the heart of spintronic and magnonic technologies, with the ultimate performance of such systems limited by the velocity at which magnetic excitations can propagate. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast propagation of magnon-polaritons-hybrid quasiparticles arising from the coupling between spin waves and electromagnetic fields in thin pure, bismuth-, and gallium substituted yttrium iron garnet (YIG, Bi:YIG and Ga:YIG) films. Using time- and phase-resolved Brillouin light scattering microscopy and time-resolved scanning transmission microscopy, we show that magnon-polaritons can propagate faster than 100 km/s, nearly three orders of magnitude more than conventional spin waves, and can be observed at distances exceeding 40 micrometers in 20 nm thick films. Analytical modeling based on retarded Maxwell equations and Polder tensor formalism confirms the hybridized nature of the excitations and captures the nontrivial dispersion and attenuation profiles. Notably, the magnon-polaritons maintain high initial magnetization amplitudes and long decay lengths, enabling ultrafast manipulation of the magnetization far away from the excitation source. We show, that they can move domain walls or stabilize nonlinear magnetization processes. The unprecedentedly high propagation velocities make magnon-polaritons promising candidates for high-speed information transfer in future spin-based computing architectures, potentially overcoming long-standing group delay bottlenecks in magnonic logic circuits.</description>

      <title>A universal framework for nonlinear frequency combs under electro-optic modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear frequency combs, including electro-optic and Kerr combs, have become central platforms for chip-scale frequency synthesis. Recent breakthroughs in strong-coupling electro-optic modulation further expanded their accessible nonlinear dynamics, unlocking new phenomena and functionalities, but the underlying foundation remains largely unexplored. Here we establish a universal theoretical and experimental framework for nonlinear combs under arbitrary electro-optic modulation by introducing a general evolution equation (GEE) that transcends the mean-field Lugiato-Lefever equation. The GEE reduces to a discrete-time Integration Hamiltonian that provides a frequency-domain formalism unifying strong-coupling electro-optic modulation with photonic synthetic dimensions. Together with a band-wave correspondence linking modulation waveforms to synthetic band structures, the formalism enables programmable spectral control. We further show compatibility between Kerr nonlinearity and strong-coupling electro-optic modulation, highlighting their cooperative dynamics. Our work provides a foundational model for strong-coupling electro-optics in nonlinear combs, opening a route toward chip-integrated, microwave-programmable comb sources for metrology, spectroscopy, and emerging photonic technologies.</description>
