      <title>Thermomechanical properties of zero thermal expansion materials from theory and experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Origin and composition dependence of the anisotropic thermomechanical properties are elucidated for Ba1-xSrxZn2Si2O7 (BZS) solid solutions. The high-temperature phase of BZS shows negative thermal expansion (NTE) along one crystallographic axis and highly anisotropic elastic properties characterized by X-ray diffraction experiments and simulations at the density functional theory level. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations provide accurate predictions of the anisotropic thermal expansion in excellent agreement with experimental observations. The NTE considerably decreases with increasing Sr content x. This is connected with the composition dependence of the vibrational density of states (VDOS) and the anisotropic Gr\"uneisen parameters. The VDOS shifts to higher frequencies between 0-5 THz due to substitution of Ba with Sr. In the same frequency range, vibrational modes contributing most to the NTE are found. In addition, phonon calculations using the quasi-harmonic approximation revealed that the NTE is mainly connected with deformation of four-membered rings formed by SiO4 and ZnO4 tetrahedra. The thermomechanical and vibrational properties obtained in this work provide the basis for future studies facilitating the targeted design of BZS solid solutions as zero or negative thermal expansion material.</description>

      <title>Phase stability determination of negative thermal expansion silicates by theory and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials that exhibit zero thermal expansion have numerous applications, ranging from everyday ceramic hobs to telescope mirrors to devices in optics and micromechanics. These materials include glass ceramics containing crystal phases with negative thermal expansion in at least one crystallographic direction, such as Ba1-xSrxZn2-2yMg2ySi2O7 solid solutions. However, the volume increase associated with the martensitic phase transformation in these crystals often hinders their use as zero thermal expansion materials at operating temperatures near the transition temperature Tt. Here, an approach to rapidly predict Tt of such materials as a function of chemical composition based on a combination of density functional theory simulations and experiments has been developed and applied to Ba1-xSrxZn2-2yMg2ySi2O7. Its central element is the modeling of free energy as a function of temperature and chemical composition using a composition-dependent Debye model augmented by an empirical correction, which incorporates the effects of anharmonic lattice vibrations. This approach provides Tt predictions with an estimated uncertainty of about 100 K, which is similar to the accuracy of computationally much more demanding simulations of polymorphous phase transitions. In addition, this approach allows computationally efficient determination of the chemical compositions at which the Ba1-xSrxZn2-2yMg2ySi2O7 phase with the desired thermal properties will be formed during synthesis, facilitating the targeted design of zero thermal expansion materials.</description>

      <title>High-pressure characterization of Ag$_3$AuTe$_2$: Implications for strain-induced band tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent band structure calculations have suggested the potential for band tuning in a chiral semi-conductor, Ag$_3$AuTe$_2$, to zero upon application of negative strain. In this study, we report on the synthesis of polycrystalline Ag$_3$AuTe$_2$ and investigate its transport, optical properties, and pressure compatibility. Transport measurements reveal the semiconducting behavior of Ag$_3$AuTe$_2$ with high resistivity and an activation energy $E_a$ of 0.2 eV. The optical band gap determined by diffuse reflectance measurements is about three times wider than the experimental $E_a$. Despite the difference, both experimental gaps fall within the range of predicted band gaps by our first-principles DFT calculations employing the PBE and mBJ methods. Furthermore, our DFT simulations predict a progressive narrowing of the band gap under compressive strain, with a full closure expected at a strain of -4% relative to the lattice parameter. To evaluate the feasibility of gap tunability at such substantial strain, the high-pressure behavior of Ag$_3$AuTe$_2$ was investigated by $in$ $situ$ high-pressure X-ray diffraction up to 47 GPa. Mechanical compression beyond 4% of the lattice constant resulted in a pressure-induced structural transformation, indicating the potential for substantial gap modulation under extreme compression conditions.</description>

      <title>MXene's Surface Functionalization Patterns and Their Impacts on Magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) are a perspective group of materials with a broad palette of applications. Surface terminations are a product of the MXene preparation, and post-processing can also lead to partial coverage. Despite applicability and fundamental properties being driven by termination patterns, it is not fully clear, how they behave on MXene surfaces with various degrees of surface coverage. Here, as the first step, we used density functional theory to predict possible patterns in prototypic Ti$_2$C MXene, demonstrating the different behavior of the two most frequent terminal atoms, oxygen, and fluorine. Oxygen (with formal charge -2$e$) prefers a zigzag line both-side adsorption pattern on bare Ti$_2$C, attracting the next adsorbent to a minimal distance. Oxygen defects in fully O-terminated MXene tend to form similar zigzag line vacancy patterns. On the other hand, fluorine (with a formal charge of -1$e$) prefers one-side flake (island) adsorption on bare Ti$_2$C and a similar desorption style from fully fluorinated Ti$_2$C. MXene magnetic behavior is subsequently driven by the patterns, either compensating locally and holding the global magnetic state of the MXene until some limit (oxygen case) or gradually increasing total magnetism by summing of local effects (fluorine case). The systematic combinatoric study of Ti$_2$CT$_x$ with various coverages ($0 \leq x \leq 2$) of distinct terminal atoms T = O or F brings encouraging possibilities of tunable behavior of MXenes and provides useful guidance for its modeling towards electronic nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Possible Excitonic Insulating Phase in Quantum-Confined Sb Nanoflakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1960s, it was proposed that in small indirect band-gap materials, excitons can spontaneously form because the density of carriers is too low to screen the attractive Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes. The result is a novel strongly interacting insulating phase known as an excitonic insulator. Here we employ scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) to show that the enhanced Coulomb interaction in quantum-confined elemental Sb nanoflakes drives the system to the excitonic insulator state. The unique feature of the excitonic insulator, a charge density wave (CDW) without periodic lattice distortion, is directly observed. Furthermore, STS shows a gap induced by the CDW near the Fermi surface. Our observations suggest that the Sb(110) nanoflake is an excitonic insulator.</description>

      <title>Anomalously Strong Size Effect on Thermal Conductivity of Diamond Microparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamond has the known highest thermal conductivity of around \SI{2000}{\watt\per\meter\per\kelvin} and is therefore widely used for heat dissipation. In practical applications, synthetic diamond microparticles are usually assumed to have similar thermal conductivity to that of bulk diamond because the particle size is larger than theoretical phonon mean free path so that boundary scattering of heat-carrying phonons is absent. In this report, we find the thermal conductivity of diamond microparticles anomalously depends on their sizes. Thermal conductivity of diamond microparticles increases from \SI{400}{\watt\per\meter\per\kelvin} to \SI{2000}{\watt\per\meter\per\kelvin} with the size growing from \SI{20}{\micro\meter} to \SI{300}{\micro\meter}. We attribute the abnormally strong size effect to the long-range defects during the growth process based on analysis of point defects, dislocations, and thermal penetration depth dependence of thermal conductivity. Our results play a vital role in the design of diamond composites and in the improvement of thermal conductivity of synthetic diamonds.</description>

      <title>Machine learning to explore high-entropy alloys with desired enthalpy for room-temperature hydrogen storage: Prediction of density functional theory and experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe and high-density storage of hydrogen, for a clean-fuel economy, can be realized by hydride-forming materials, but these materials should be able to store hydrogen at room temperature. Some high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have recently been shown to reversibly store hydrogen at room temperature, but the design of HEAs with appropriate thermodynamics is still challenging. To explore HEAs with appropriate hydride formation enthalpy, this study employs machine learning (ML), in particular, Gaussian process regression (GPR) using four different kernels by training with 420 datum points collected from literature and curated here. The developed ML models are used to predict the formation enthalpy of hydrides for the TixZr2-xCrMnFeNi (x = 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5) system, which is not in the training set. The predicted values by ML are consistent with data from experiments and density functional theory (DFT). The present study thus introduces ML as a rapid and reliable approach for the design of HEAs with hydride formation enthalpies of -25 to -39 kJ/mol for hydrogen storage at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Investigation of a high-entropy oxide photocatalyst for hydrogen generation by first-principles calculations coupled with experiments: Significance of electronegativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy oxides (HEOs), containing at least five principal cations, have recently emerged as promising photocatalysts for hydrogen production via water splitting. Despite their high potential, the impact of the cation mixtures on photocatalytic activity remains poorly understood. This study investigates the high-entropy photocatalyst TiZrHfNbTaO11 using first-principles calculations combined with experimental methods to elucidate the effects of various elements on electronic structure and water splitting performance. The results indicate that the HEO exhibits a bandgap comparable to TiO2 polymorphs rutile, brookite and anatase. Cations with lower electronegativity, such as hafnium and zirconium, provide the strongest water adsorption energy, serving as active sites for water adsorption. Additionally, the co-presence of highly electronegative cations like niobium and tantalum adjacent to hafnium and zirconium enhances charge transfer to water molecules, improving splitting efficiency. These findings suggest novel strategies for designing high-entropy photocatalysts by synergistic incorporating cations with different electronegativities.</description>

      <title>DFT study of structural, electronic and optical properties of 2D MgO monolayer under bi-axial mechanical strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural, electronic, and dielectric (optical) properties of graphene-like 2D MgO monolayer have been explored through first-principles calculations under bi-axial tensile and compressive mechanical strain within a range of -10% to +10%. Our findings revealed that the pristine MgO monolayer is an indirect band gap semiconducting material and the semiconducting mature of MgO monolayer remains consistent under both compressive and tensile mechanical strain. This nature of MgO is confirmed through partial density of states (PDOS) as well as electronic band structure. PDOS exhibits the contribution of different atomic orbitals in bond formation and nature of bond, while band structure provides insight into electron transitions between energy levels of valance and conduction bands. All optical parameters (dielectric function, reflectivity, energy loss, refractive index, extinction coefficient and absorption) are plotted in an energy range 0-15 eV. Within this energy interval, MgO possesses the highest value of the refractive index (2.13) at 3.12 eV energy. Also, a detailed analysis of changes in the geometrical structure of MgO monolayer is provided.</description>

      <title>Adsorption of Mo and O at S-vacancy on ReS2 surface of ReS2/MoTe2 vdW heterointerface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applications like high density information storage, neuromorphic computing, nanophotonics, etc. require ultra-thin electronic devices which can be controlled with applied electric field. Of late, atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials and van der Waals (vdW) heterointerface of those have emerged as suitable candidates for such ultra-low power nanoelectric devices. In this work, employing density functional theory (DFT), the monolayer ReS2 / monolayer MoTe2 vdW heterostructure with Sulphur vacancy is studied to examine various ground state electronic properties. Changes in effective band gap owing to defect-induced states and modulation of the energy gap value with Molybdenum (Mo) and Oxygen (O) adsorption at the defect site are examined. Since two-dimensional (2D) material based nanoscaled devices exhibit promising switching between non-conducting and conducting states, determining the role of defect-induced states and the adsorption of atoms/molecules on surfaces is crucial. Here, a detailed theoretical study to determine surface properties and relative energetic stability of the vdW heterostructures is carried out. The charge re-distribution between the constituent layers is also analyzed by obtaining Electron Difference Density (EDD) for different heterointerfaces. Nonetheless, the efficacy of switching between non-conducting and conducting states is assessed based on adsorption energy of adatoms binding at the defect site.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale flow, permeability, and heat transport in low-carbon and traditional building materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permeability and heat transport through building materials ultimately dictates their insulatory performance over a buildings service lifetime. Experiments combining XCT with numerical modelling are an accepted method of studying pore scale processes and have been used extensively in the oil and gas industry to study highly complex reservoir rocks. However, despite the obvious similarities in structure and application, these techniques have not yet been widely adopted by the building and construction industry. An experimental investigation was performed on the pore structure of several building materials, including conventional, historic, and innovative, using XCT and direct numerical simulation. Six samples were imaged at between a 4 and 15 micron resolution inside a micro-CT scanner. The porosity and connectivity were extracted with the grain, throat, and pore size distributions using image analysis. The permeability, velocity, and thermal conductivity were then investigated using GeoChemFoam, our highly-versatile and open source numerical solver. It was found that each material had a unique, heterogeneous and sometimes multi-scale structure that had a large impact on the permeability and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, it was found that the method of including sub-resolution porosity directly effected these bulk property calculations for both parameters, especially in the materials with high structural heterogeneity. This is the first multi-scale study of structure, flow and heat transport on building materials and this workflow could easily be adapted to understand and improve designs in other industries that use porous materials such as fuel cells and batteries technology, lightweight materials and insulation, and semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Influence of deposition parameters on the plasmonic properties of gold nanoantennas fabricated by focused ion beam lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of plasmonic antennas is influenced by a variety of factors, including their size, shape, and material. Even minor changes in the deposition parameters during the thin film preparation process may have a significant impact on the dielectric function of the film, and thus on the plasmonic properties of the resulting antenna. In this work, we deposited gold thin films with thicknesses of 20 nm, 30 nm, and 40 nm at various deposition rates using an ion-beam-assisted deposition. We evaluate their morphology and crystallography by atomic force microscopy, X ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. Next, we examined the ease of fabricating plasmonic antennas using focused-ion-beam lithography. Finally, we evaluate their plasmonic properties by electron energy loss spectroscopy measurements of individual antennas. Our results show that the optimal gold thin film for plasmonic antenna fabrication of a thickness of 20 and 30 nm should be deposited at the deposition rate of around 0.1 nm/s. The thicker 40 nm film should be deposited at a higher deposition rate like 0.3 nm/s.</description>

      <title>Optical activity and phase transformations in {\gamma}/{\beta} Ga2O3 bilayers under annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) can be crystallized in several polymorphs exhibiting different physical properties. In this work, polymorphic structures consisting of the cubic defective spinel (gamma) film on the top of the monoclinic (beta) substrate were fabricated by disorder-induced ordering, known to be a practical way to stack these polymorphs together. Such bilayer structures were annealed to investigate the optical properties and phase transformations. Specifically, photoluminescence and diffuse reflectance spectroscopies were combined with transmission electron microscopy, Rutherford backscattering/channeling spectrometry and x-ray diffraction to monitor the evolutions. As a result we observe a two-stage annealing kinetics in gamma/beta Ga2O3 bilayers associated with the epitaxial gamma-to-beta regrowth at the interface at temperatures below 700 {\deg}C and a non-planar gamma-to-beta phase transformation starting at higher temperatures. Thus, the present data enhance understanding of the polymorphism in Ga2O3, interconnecting the phase transformation kinetics with the evolution of the optical properties.</description>

      <title>Direct, indirect, and self-trapped excitons in Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ is a representative halide double perovskite which exhibits promising photovoltaic and light-emitting properties, making it a candidate for next-generation solar cells and LED technologies. Here, we study various possible excited states of this material to understand its absorption and emission properties. We use Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) coupled with non-empirical hybrid functionals, specifically PBE0($\alpha$) and dielectric-dependent hybrids (DDH) to explore direct, indirect, and self-trapped excitons in this material. Based on comparison with experiment, we show that these methods can give excellent prediction of the absorption spectrum and that the fundamental band gap has been underestimated in previous computational studies. We connect the experimental photoluminescence signals at 1.9-2.0 eV to the emission from self-trapped excitons and electron polarons. Finally, we reveal a complex landscape with energetically competing direct, indirect, and self-trapped excitons in the material.</description>

      <title>Stacking-engineered ferroelectricty and multiferroic order in van der Waals magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials that exhibit spontaneous magnetization, polarization or strain (referred to as ferroics) have the potential to revolutionize nanotechnology by enhancing the multifunctionality of nanoscale devices. However, multiferroic order is difficult to achieve, requiring complicated coupling between electron and spin degrees of freedom. We propose a universal method to engineer multiferroics from van der Waals magnets by taking advantage of the fact that changing the stacking between 2D layers can break inversion symmetry, resulting in ferroelectricity and possibly magnetoelectric coupling. We illustrate this concept using first-principles calculations in bilayer NiI$_2$, which can be made ferroelectric upon rotating two adjacent layers by $180^{\circ}$ with respect to the bulk stacking. Furthermore, we discover a novel multiferroic order induced by interlayer charge transfer which couples the interlayer spin order and electronic polarization. Our approach is not only general but also systematic, and can enable the discovery of a wide variety of 2D multiferroics.</description>

      <title>Strain-Induced Changes of Electronic and Optical Properties of Zr-based MXenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zr-based MXenes recently attracted attention because of its experimental preparation showing temperature stability, mechanical strength, and promising energy, sensoric, and electrochemistry applications. However, necessary theoretical predictions at a precise/predictive level are complicated due to essential excitonic features and strong electron correlation (i.e., a necessity to go beyond standard density functional theory, DFT). Contrary to the prevailing focus on oxygen-terminated MXenes and standard predictions of other Zr-based MXenes as conductors, based on the hybrid DFT and GW many-body perturbational theory, we were able to find seven different semiconductors (five of them for their equilibrium geometry and two others under slight tensile biaxial strain) in the case of two- and three-layered Zr$_2$CT$_2$ and Zr$_3$C$_2$T$_2$ configurations with various terminations (T = O, F, S, Cl). We observed semiconductor-to-conductor transition induced by strain in the majority of such Zr-based MXenes at experimentally achievable strain range. Furthermore, using the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), we demonstrated that selected semiconducting Zr-based MXenes possess high optical absorption efficiency (20-30%) in the visible light range, underscoring their potential in photonic applications. The high sensitivity of Zr-based MXenes to external conditions and functionalization combined with the thermal stability make the materials promising for applications at operational temperatures in electronic and optical technologies.</description>

      <title>Data-efficient fine-tuning of foundational models for first-principles quality sublimation enthalpies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculating sublimation enthalpies of molecular crystal polymorphs is relevant to a wide range of technological applications. However, predicting these quantities at first-principles accuracy -- even with the aid of machine learning potentials -- is a challenge that requires sub-kJ/mol accuracy in the potential energy surface and finite-temperature sampling. We present an accurate and data-efficient protocol based on fine-tuning of the foundational MACE-MP-0 model and showcase its capabilities on sublimation enthalpies and physical properties of ice polymorphs. Our approach requires only a few tens of training structures to achieve sub-kJ/mol accuracy in the sublimation enthalpies and sub 1 % error in densities for polymorphs at finite temperature and pressure. Exploiting this data efficiency, we explore simulations of hexagonal ice at the random phase approximation level of theory at experimental temperatures and pressures, calculating its physical properties, like pair correlation function and density, with good agreement with experiments. Our approach provides a way forward for predicting the stability of molecular crystals at finite thermodynamic conditions with the accuracy of correlated electronic structure theory.</description>

      <title>BEAST DB: Grand-Canonical Database of Electrocatalyst Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present BEAST DB, an open-source database comprised of ab initio electrochemical data computed using grand-canonical density functional theory in implicit solvent at consistent calculation parameters. The database contains over 20,000 surface calculations and covers a broad set of heterogeneous catalyst materials and electrochemical reactions. Calculations were performed at self-consistent fixed potential as well as constant charge to facilitate comparisons to the computational hydrogen electrode. This article presents common use cases of the database to rationalize trends in catalyst activity, screen catalyst material spaces, understand elementary mechanistic steps, analyze electronic structure, and train machine learning models to predict higher fidelity properties. Users can interact graphically with the database by querying for individual calculations to gain granular understanding of reaction steps or by querying for an entire reaction pathway on a given material using an interactive reaction pathway tool. BEAST DB will be periodically updated, with planned future updates to include advanced electronic structure data, surface speciation studies, and greater reaction coverage.</description>

      <title>Static Subspace Approximation for Random Phase Approximation Correlation Energies: Implementation and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing theoretical understanding of complex reactions and processes at interfaces requires using methods that go beyond semilocal density functional theory to accurately describe the interactions between solvent, reactants and substrates. Methods based on many-body perturbation theory, such as the random phase approximation (RPA), have previously been limited due to their computational complexity. However, this is now a surmountable barrier due to the advances in computational power available, in particular through modern GPU-based supercomputers. In this work, we describe the implementation of RPA calculations within BerkeleyGW and show its favorable computational performance on large complex systems relevant for catalysis and electrochemistry applications. Our implementation builds off of the static subspace approximation which, by employing a compressed representation of the frequency dependent polarizability, enables the evaluation of the RPA correlation energy with significant acceleration and systematically controllable accuracy. We find that the computational cost of calculating the RPA correlation energy scales only linearly with system size for systems containing up to 50 thousand bands, and is expected to scale quadratically thereafter. We also show excellent strong scaling results across several supercomputers, demonstrating the performance and portability of this implementation.</description>

      <title>The manifestation of Fermi level oscillations in the magnetoresistance of HgTe quantum wells with a split spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations and magneto-intersubband oscillations of magnetoresistance of structures with single HgTe quantum wells with a width of (10-18) nm have been experimentally studied. The spectrum of the conduction band in these structures is split by the spin-orbit interaction. This leads to beats of the SdH oscillations and the appearance of low-frequency magneto-intersubband oscillations. The mutual position of the antinodes of the SdH oscillations and the maxima of the magneto-interband oscillations is unusual -- in low magnetic fields it is directly opposite to the predictions of the theory. Measurements in high magnetic fields, in which the relative amplitude of the SdH oscillations becomes greater than 0.2-0.3, show a change in the relative position of the antinodes of the SdH oscillations and the maxima of low-frequency oscillations. Numerical calculations and additional measurements at different temperatures show that the observed effects are due to oscillations of the Fermi level in the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional charge orders induced by oxygen vacancies on SrTiO$_3$(001)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas and low carrier density superconductivity in multiple SrTiO$_3$-based heterostructures has stimulated intense interest in the surface properties of SrTiO$_3$. The recent discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in the monolayer FeSe/SrTiO$_3$ aroused the upsurge and underscored the atomic precision probe of the surface structure. By performing atomically resolved cryogenic scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy characterization on dual-TiO$_{2}$-${\delta}$-terminated SrTiO$_3$(001) surfaces with ($\sqrt{13}$ $\times$ $\sqrt{13}$), c(4 $\times$ 2), mixed (2 $\times$ 1), and (2 $\times$ 2) reconstructions, we disclosed universally broken rotational symmetry and contrasting bias- and temperature-dependent electronic states for apical and equatorial oxygen sites. With the sequentially evolved surface reconstructions and simultaneously increasing equatorial oxygen vacancies, the surface anisotropy reduces, and the work function lowers. Intriguingly, unidirectional stripe orders appear on the c(4 $\times$ 2) surface, whereas local (4 $\times$ 4) order emerges and eventually forms long-range unidirectional c(4 $\times$ 4) charge order on the (2 $\times$ 2) surface. This work reveals robust unidirectional charge orders induced by oxygen vacancies due to strong and delicate electronic-lattice interaction under broken rotational symmetry, providing insights into understanding the complex behaviors in perovskite oxide-based heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Correlated Electronic Structure and Density-Wave Gap in Trilayer Nickelate La4Ni3O10</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of pressurized superconductivity at 80 K in La3Ni2O7 officially brings nickelates into the family of high-temperature superconductors, which gives rise to not only new insights but also mysteries in the strongly correlated superconductivity. More recently, the sibling compound La4Ni3O10 was also shown to be superconducting below about 25 K under pressure, further boosting the popularity of nickelates in the Ruddlesden-Popper phase. In this study, combining high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ab initio calculation, we systematically investigate the electronic structures of La4Ni3O10 at ambient pressure. We reveal a high resemblance of La4Ni3O10 with La3Ni2O7 in the orbital-dependent fermiology and electronic structure, suggesting a similar electronic correlation between the two compounds. The temperature-dependent measurements imply an orbital-dependent energy gap related to the density-wave transition in La4Ni3O10. By comparing the theoretical pressure-dependent electronic structure, clues about the superconducting high-pressure phase can be deduced from the ambient measurements, providing crucial information for deciphering the unconventional superconductivity in nickelates.</description>

      <title>A frustrated antipolar phase analogous to classical spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of magnetic frustration in classical spin systems was motivated by the prediction and discovery of classical spin liquid states. These uncommon magnetic phases are characterized by a massive degeneracy of their ground state implying a finite magnetic entropy at zero temperature. While the classical spin liquid state was originally predicted in the Ising triangular lattice antiferromagnet in 1950, this state has never been experimentally observed in any triangular magnets. We report here the discovery of an electric analogue of classical spin liquids on a triangular lattice of uniaxial electric dipoles in EuAl$_{12}$O$_{19}$. This new type of frustrated antipolar phase is characterized by a highly degenerate state at low temperature implying an absence of long-range antiferroelectric order, despite short range antipolar correlations. Its dynamics are governed by a thermally activated process, slowing down upon cooling towards a complete freezing at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Material and size dependent corrections to conductance quantization in anomalous Hall effect from anomaly inflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) systems, the Hall conductance is quantized and the corresponding effective topological theory of the system is the Chern-Simons theory. The conductance quantum is given by the universal constant $e^2/h$ -- the inverse von Klitzing constant -- that is independent of the bulk gap, as well as the size of the system. This picture relies on the assumption that the edge modes are sharply localized at the edge, i.e. they have zero width. We show that considering the physical case where the edge modes have finite localization length $b$, the effective action would not be topological in bulk direction anymore. Due to non-zero $b$ the conductance quantum will be corrected as $(1-\varepsilon)e^2/h$ where $\varepsilon$ encompasses the non-universal (i.e. material/sample dependent) part that is determined by the dimensionless ratios $\frac{gb}{\hbar v_F}$ and $\frac{b}{L}$ where $g,v_F,L$ are the bulk gap, Fermi velocity and sample length. To compute the non-universal correction $\varepsilon$ we use anomaly inflow framework according to which the bulk action produces the correct amount of anomaly inflow that would cancel the anomaly of the chiral edge modes. These corrections place limits on the precision of measurable quantization in units of the inverse von Klitzing constant for QAH systems with smaller sizes and/or smaller bulk gaps. Our result suggests that the failure of precision measurements to reproduce the exact conductance quantum $e^2/h$ is not an annoying sample quality issue, but it contains the quantitative physics of anomaly inflow that can be inferred by the systematic study of such corrections.</description>

Abstract: We prove that two formulas of the orbital magnetic susceptibility, namely, Koshino-Ando's formula and G\'{o}mes-Santos and Stauber's formula, are equivalent for the tight-binding models. The difference between these two formulas can be written in a form containing the surface terms arising from the momentum-space integration, and we show that the surface terms are exactly vanishing although the primitive functions are seemingly non-periodic with respect to the translation by the reciprocal lattice vector.</description>

      <title>Pick-up and assembling of chemically sensitive van der Waals heterostructures using dry cryogenic exfoliation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assembling atomic layers of van der Waals materials (vdW) combines the physics of two materials, offering opportunities for novel functional devices. Realization of this has been possible because of advancements in nanofabrication processes which often involve chemical processing of the materials under study; this can be detrimental to device performance. To address this issue, we have developed a modified micro-manipulator setup for cryogenic exfoliation, pick up, and transfer of vdW materials to assemble heterostructures. We use the glass transition of a polymer PDMS to cleave a flake into two, followed by its pick-up and drop to form pristine twisted junctions. To demonstrate the potential of the technique, we fabricated twisted heterostructure of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (BSCCO), a van der Waals high-temperature cuprate superconductor. We also employed this method to re-exfoliate NbSe$_2$ and make twisted heterostructure. Transport measurements of the fabricated devices indicate the high quality of the artificial twisted interface. In addition, we extend this cryogenic exfoliation method for other vdW materials, offering an effective way of assembling heterostructures and twisted junctions with pristine interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lablets are autonomous microscopic particles with programmable CMOS electronics that can control electrokinetic phenomena and electrochemical reactions in solution via actuator and sensor microelectrodes. In this paper, we describe the design and fabrication of optimized singulated lablets (CMOS3) with dimensions 140x140x50 micrometers carrying an integrated coplanar encapsulated supercapacitor as a rechargeable power supply. The lablets are designed to allow docking to one another or to a smart surface for interchange of energy, electronic information, and chemicals. The paper focusses on the digital and analog design of the lablets to allow significant programmable functionality in a microscopic footprint, including the control of autonomous actuation and sensing up to the level of being able to support a complete lablet self-reproduction life cycle, although experimentally this remains to be proven. The potential of lablets in autonomous sensing and control and for evolutionary experimentation are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Projected Augmented Wave (PAW) Method is based on generating a transform between the pseudo wavefunction and all electron wavefunction. For the accuracy of the method it is important that the local part of the transform (in each atomic sphere $\mathbf{R}$) be over a complete basis set (with deviations from completeness leading to corrections to the total energy not computed within current implementations of PAW). Here we show how to make this basis much closer to complete without significant additional computational work by allowing for multiple smooth pseudo wavefunction states to be mapped onto the same all electron wavefunction.</description>

      <title>High-order Van Hove singularities and their connection to flat bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flattening of single-particle band structures plays an important role in the quest for novel quantum states of matter due to the crucial role of interactions. Recent advances in theory and experiment made it possible to construct and tune systems with nearly flat bands, ranging from graphene multilayers and moire' materials to kagome' metals and ruthenates. While theoretical models predict exactly flat bands under certain ideal conditions, evidence was provided that these systems host high-order Van Hove points, i.e., points of high local band flatness and power-law divergence in energy of the density of states. In this review, we examine recent developments in engineering and realising such weakly dispersive bands. We focus on high-order Van Hove singularities and explore their connection to exactly flat bands. We provide classification schemes and discuss interaction effects. We also review experimental evidence for high-order Van Hove singularities and point out future research directions.</description>

      <title>Bridging electronic and classical density-functional theory using universal machine-learned functional approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of density-functional theory (DFT) is determined by the quality of the approximate functionals, such as exchange-correlation in electronic DFT and the excess functional in the classical DFT formalism of fluids. The exact functional is highly nonlocal for both electrons and fluids, yet most approximate functionals are semi-local or nonlocal in a limited weighted-density form. Machine-learned (ML) nonlocal density-functional approximations are promising in both electronic and classical DFT, but have so far employed disparate approaches with limited generality. Here, we formulate a universal approximation framework and training protocol for nonlocal ML functionals, combining features of equivariant convolutional neural networks and the weighted-density approximation. We prototype this approach for several 1D and quasi-1D problems and demonstrate that a functional with exactly the same hyperparameters achieves excellent accuracy for the hard-rod fluid, the inhomogeneous Ising model, the exact exchange functional for electrons, the electron kinetic energy functional for orbital-free DFT, as well as for liquid water with 1D inhomogeneities. These results lay the foundation for a universal ML approach to exact 3D functionals spanning electronic and classical DFT.</description>

      <title>Emergent Tetragonality in a Fundamentally Orthorhombic Material</title>

Abstract: Symmetry plays a key role in determining the physical properties of materials. By Neumann's principle, the properties of a material are invariant under the symmetry operations of the space group to which the material belongs. Continuous phase transitions are associated with a spontaneous reduction in symmetry. (For example, the onset of ferromagnetism spontaneously breaks time reversal symmetry.) Much less common are examples where proximity to a continuous phase transition leads to an increase in symmetry. Here, we find an emergent tetragonal symmetry close to an apparent charge density wave (CDW) bicritical point in a fundamentally orthorhombic material, ErTe$_3$, for which the CDW phase transitions are tuned via anisotropic strain. The underlying structure of the material remains orthorhombic for all applied strains, including at the bicritical point, due to a glide plane symmetry in the crystal structure. Nevertheless, the observation of a divergence in the anisotropy of the in-plane elastoresistivity reveals an emergent electronic tetragonality near the bicritical point.</description>

      <title>Mixing I and Br in Inorganic Perovskites: Atomistic Insights from Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>

Abstract: All-inorganic halide perovskites have received a lot of attention as attractive alternatives to overcome the stability issues of hybrid halide perovskites that are commonly associated with organic cations. To find a compromise between the optoelectronic properties of CsPbI$_{3}$ and CsPbBr$_{3}$, perovskites with CsPb(Br$_{\rm{x}}$I$_{\rm{1-x}}$)$_{3}$ mixed compositions are commonly used. An additional benefit is that, without sacrificing the optoelectronic properties for applications such as solar cells or LEDs, small amounts of Br in CsPbI$_{3}$ can prevent the inorganic perovskite from degrading to a photoinactive nonperovskite yellow phase. Despite indications that strain in the perovskite lattice plays a role in the stabilization of the material, a full understanding of such strain is lacking. Here we develop a reactive force field (ReaxFF) for perovskites starting from our previous work for CsPbI$_{3}$, we extend this force field to CsPbBr$_{3}$ and mixed CsPb(Br$_{\rm{x}}$I$_{\rm{1-x}}$)$_{3}$ compounds. This force field is used in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to study perovskite phase transitions and the internal ion dynamics associated with the phase transitions. We find that an increase of the Br content lowers the temperature at which the perovskite reaches a cubic structure. Specifically, by substituting Br for I, the smaller ionic radius of Br induces a strain in the lattice that changes the internal dynamics of the octahedra. Importantly, this effect propagates through the perovskite lattice ranging up to distances of 2 nm, explaining why small concentrations of Br in CsPb(Br$_{\rm{x}}$I$_{\rm{1-x}}$)$_{3}$ (x $\leq$ 1/4) have a significant impact on the phase stability of mixed halide perovskites.</description>

      <title>Solving Free Boundary Problems in Alloy Solidification under Universal Cooling Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kinetics of interfaces in alloy solidification pose a classic free boundary problem. This paper introduces an approach that amalgamates the distinctive characteristics of sharp and diffuse interface models. The motion of the diffuse interface is governed by the phase-field equation featuring a traveling wave function [I. Steinbach, Modell. Simul. Mater. Sci. Eng. 17(7), 073001 (2009)]. To emulate solute rejection in the sharp interface model, the concept of the middle-obstacle and the casting operation are employed. Moreover, the undercooling along the interface normal is flattened to minimize the impact of bulk undercooling in the interface and the associated effects, such as stretching and arc-length diffusion. Notably, the results for interface kinetics under both equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions closely approximate their analytical solutions, all achieved with artificially wide interfaces and comparatively low computational cost.</description>

      <title>Performance Assessment of Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials: Challenges and Directions for Materials' Surfaces</title>

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are one of the main techniques in the materials science toolbox, able to bridge ab initio accuracy with the computational efficiency of classical force fields. This allows simulations ranging from atoms, molecules, and biosystems, to solid and bulk materials, surfaces, nanomaterials, and their interfaces and complex interactions. A recent class of advanced MLIPs, which use equivariant representations and deep graph neural networks, is known as universal models. These models are proposed as foundational models suitable for any system, covering most elements from the periodic table. Current universal MLIPs (UIPs) have been trained with the largest consistent dataset available nowadays. However, these are composed mostly of bulk materials' DFT calculations. In this article, we assess the universality of all openly available UIPs, namely MACE, CHGNet, and M3GNet, in a representative task of generalization: calculation of surface energies. We find that the out-of-the-box foundational models have significant shortcomings in this task, with errors correlated to the total energy of surface simulations, having an out-of-domain distance from the training dataset. Our results show that while UIPs are an efficient starting point for fine-tuning specialized models, we envision the potential of increasing the coverage of the materials space towards universal training datasets for MLIPs.</description>

      <title>The influence of substantial intragranular orientation gradients on the micromechanical response of heavily-worked material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we employ high-energy X-ray characterization to examine the role of relatively large amounts of intragranular lattice misorientation -- present after many thermomechanical processes -- on the micromechanical response of Al-7085 with a modified T7452 temper. We utilize near-field high energy X-ray diffraction microscopy (HEDM) to measure three-dimensional (3D) spatial orientation fields, facilitated by a novel method that utilizes grain orientation envelopes measured using far-field HEDM to enable reconstruction of grains with intragranular orientation spreads greater than 20{\deg}. We then assess the consequences of consideration of intragranular orientation fields on the predicted deformation response of the sample through 3D micromechanical simulations of the forged Al-7085. We construct two virtual polycrystalline specimens for use in simulations: the first a faithful representation of the HEDM reconstruction, the second a microstructure with no intragranular misorientation (i.e., grain-averaged orientations). We find significant differences in the predicted deformation mechanism activation, distribution of stress, and distribution of plastic strain between simulations containing intragranular misorientation and those with grain-averaged orientations, indicating the necessity for consideration of intragranular orientation fields for accurate predictions. Further, the influence of elastic anisotropy is discussed, along with the effects of intragranular misorientation on fatigue life through the calculation and analysis of fatigue indicator parameters.</description>

      <title>Topological Weyl Altermagnetism in CrSb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets constitute a novel, third fundamental class of collinear magnetic ordered materials, alongside with ferro- and antiferromagnets. They share with conventional antiferromagnets the feature of a vanishing net magnetization. At the same time they show a spin-splitting of electronic bands, just as in ferromagnets, caused by the atomic exchange interaction. On the other hand, topology has recently revolutionized our understanding of condensed matter physics, introducing new phases of matter classified by intrinsic topological order. Here we connect the worlds of altermagnetism and topology, showing that the electronic structure of the altermagnet CrSb is topological and hosts a novel Weyl semimetallic state. Using high-resolution and spin angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe a large momentum-dependent spin-splitting in CrSb, reaching up to 1 eV, that induces altermagnetic Weyl nodes with an associated magnetic quantum number. At the surface we observe their spin-polarized topological Fermi-arcs. This establishes that in altermagnets the large energy scale intrinsic to the spin-splitting - orders of magnitude larger than the relativistic spin-orbit coupling - creates its own realm of robust electronic topology.</description>

      <title>High-field magnetoelectric coupling and successive magnetic transitions in Mn-doped polar antiferromagnet Ni3TeO6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the 3d transition metal ions doped polar Ni3TeO6, Mn-doped Ni3TeO6 has stimulated great interest due to its high magnetic ordering temperature and complex magnetic phases, but the mechanism of magnetoelectric (ME) coupling is far from understood. Herein we report our systematic investigation of the chemical control of magnetism, metamagnetic transition, and ME properties of Ni3-xMnxTeO6 single crystals in high magnetic field (H) up to 52 T. We present a previously unreported weak ferromagnetic behavior appeared in the ab plane below 9.5 K in addition to the incommensurate helical and commensurate collinear antiferromagnetic states. In the low-field region, a spin-flop type metamagnetic transition without any hysteresis occurs at Hc1 for H // c, while another metamagnetic transition accompanied with a change in electric polarization is observed at Hc2 in the high-field region both for H // c and H // ab above 30 K, which can be attributed to the sudden rotation of magnetic moments at Ni2 sites. The ME measurements reveal that a first-order ME effect is observed in the low-T and low-H regions, while a second-order ME coupling term appears above 30 K in the magnetic field range of Hc1 &lt; H &lt; Hc2 for H // c and H &lt; Hc2 for H // ab, both becoming significant with increasing temperature. Eventually, they are dominated by the second-order ME effect near the antiferromagnetic transition temperature. The present work demonstrates that Ni3-xMnxTeO6 is an exotic magnetoelectric material compared with Ni3TeO6 and its derivatives, thereby providing insights to better understand the magnetism and ME coupling in Ni3TeO6 and its derivatives.</description>

      <title>On Nirmala indices based entropy measures for the complex structure of ruthenium bipyridine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A numerical parameter, known as a topological index, is employed to represent the molecular structure of a compound by considering its graph-theoretical properties. In the study of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR), topological indices are used to predict the physicochemical properties of chemical compounds. Graph entropies have evolved as information-theoretic tools to investigate the structural information of a molecular graph. In this study, we compute the Nirmala index, the first and second inverse Nirmala index of the complex structure of ruthenium bipyridine, with the help of its M-polynomial. Furthermore, entropy measures for the complex structure of ruthenium bipyridine are computed using Shannon's entropy model. The comparison between the Nirmala indices and their associated entropy measures is presented through numerical computation. The correlation between the Nirmala indices and associated entropy measurements is then examined using a regression model. Finally, it is shown that the structural characteristics and properties of the complex structure of ruthenium bipyridine will be predicted by Nirmala indices-based entropy measures rather than the Nirmala indices.</description>

      <title>Duality and degeneracy lifting in two-dimensional electron liquids on SrTiO$_3$(001)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electron liquids (2DELs) have increasing technological relevance for ultrafast electronics and spintronics, yet significant gaps in their fundamental understanding are exemplified on the prototypical SrTiO$_3$. We correlate the exact SrTiO$_3$(001) surface structure with distinct 2DELs through combined microscopic angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and non-contact atomic force microscopy on truly bulk-terminated surfaces that alleviate structural uncertainties inherent to this long-studied system. The SrO termination is shown to develop a 2DEL following the creation of oxygen vacancies, unlike the intrinsically metallic TiO$_2$ termination. Differences in degeneracy of the 2DELs, that share the same band filling and identical band bending, are assigned to polar distortions of the Ti atoms in combination with spin order, supported with the extraction of fundamental electron-phonon coupling strength. These results not only resolve the ambiguities regarding 2DELs on SrTiO$_3$ thus far, but also pave the way to manipulating band filling and spin order in oxide 2DELs in general.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning of Part Similarity for Goal-Guided Accelerated Experiment Design in Metal Additive Manufacturing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal additive manufacturing is gaining broad interest and increased use in the industrial and academic fields. However, the quantification and commercialization of standard parts usually require extensive experiments and expensive post-characterization, which impedes the rapid development and adaptation of metal AM technologies. In this work, a similarity-based acceleration (S-acceleration) method for design of experiments is developed to reduce the time and costs associated with unveiling process-property (porosity defects) relationships during manufacturing. With S-acceleration, part semantic features from machine-setting parameters and physics-effects informed characteristics are explored for measuring mutual part similarities. A user-defined simplification rate of experiments is proposed to purposely remove redundant parts before conducting experiments printing without sacrificing information gain as original full factorial experiment design. This S-acceleration design of experiments is demonstrated on a Concept Laser M2 machine for the experimental plan of modeling relationships between process parameters and part porosity defects. The printed part has 2 mm diameter by 4 mm tall pin geometry considering variations in build location and orientation, laser settings and powder feedstock are held constant. In total, 242 parts are measured to create a ground truth data set of porosity levels by using X-ray tomography microscopy. The S-acceleration method is assessed for performance considering 40%, 50%, and 60% of user-defined experiment simplification rates. The repeated experiments are removed without ignoring the minority experiments outlier, assuring a similar process-property relation in the original experiment plan. The experiment number is significantly reduced based on part similarity with minimal compromise of model accuracy and obtained knowledge.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality with emergent symmetry in the extended Shastry-Sutherland model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the novel phenomena observed in the layered material $\rm SrCu_2(BO_3)_2$, the Shastry-Sutherland model (SSM) has been extensively studied as the minimal model for $\rm SrCu_2(BO_3)_2$. However, the nature of its quantum phase transition from the plaquette valence-bond solid (PVBS) to antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase is under fierce debate, posing a challenge to understand the underlying quantum criticality. Via the state-of-the-art tensor network simulations, we study the ground state of the SSM on large-scale size up to $20 \times 20$ sites. We identify the continuous transition nature accompanied by an emergent O(4) symmetry between the PVBS and AFM phase, which strongly suggests a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP). Furthermore, we map out the phase diagram of an extended SSM that can be continuously tuned to the SSM, which demonstrates the same DQCP phenomena along a whole critical line. Our results indicate a compelling scenario for understanding the origin of the proposed proximate DQCP in recent experiments of $\rm SrCu_2(BO_3)_2$.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking Superconductivity in CaSb$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12457v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CaSb$_2$ is a bulk superconductor and a topological semimetal, making it a great platform for realizing topological superconductivity. In this work, we investigate the superconducting upper and lower critical field anisotropy using magnetic susceptibility, and study the superconducting state using muon spin-relaxation. The temperature dependence of transverse-field relaxation rate can be fitted with a single-gap model or two-gap model. Zero-field relaxation shows little temperature dependence when the muon-spin is parallel to the $c*$-axis, while an increase in relaxation appears below 1 K when the muon-spin is parallel to the $ab$-plane. We conclude an $s+is$ order parameter considering the breaking of time-reversal symmetry (TRS), which originates from competing interband interactions between the three bands of CaSb$_2$. To explain the direction-dependent breaking of TRS we suggest loop currents developing in the plane of distorted square-net of Sb atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Qubits require a compromise between operation speed and coherence. Here, we demonstrate a compromise-free singlet-triplet (ST) qubit, where the qubit couples maximally to the driving field while simultaneously coupling minimally to the dominant noise sources. The qubit is implemented in a crystal-phase defined double-quantum dot in an InAs nanowire. Using a superconducting resonator, we measure the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) gap, the spin-photon coupling strength and the qubit decoherence rate as a function of the in-plane magnetic-field orientation. We demonstrate a spin qubit sweet spot maximizing the dipolar coupling and simultaneously minimizing the decoherence. Our theoretical description postulates phonons as the most likely dominant noise source. The compromise-free sweet spot originates from the SOI suggesting that it is not restricted to this material platform, but might find applications in any material with SOI. These findings pave the way for enhanced engineering of these nanomaterials for next-generation qubit technologies.</description>

Abstract: Polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes are widely used in biomaterials and nanotechnology to regulate surface properties and interactions. Here, we apply the electrostatic correlation augmented self-consistent field theory to investigate the interactions between opposing PE brushes in a mixture of 1:1 and 3:1 salt solutions. Our theory predicts hysteretic feature of the normal stress induced by strong ion correlations. In the presence of trivalent ions, the force profile is discontinuous: repulsive in the compression branch and adhesive in the separation branch. The molecular origin of the hysteretic force is the coexistence of two collapsed modes: two separated condensed layer on each surface in the compression and a single bundled condensed layer in the separation. With the systematic inclusion of ion correlations, our theory fully captures the hysteretic force, adhesive separation, ``jump-in'' and ``jump-out'' features, and the ``specific ion effect'', all in good agreement with the reported experimental results.</description>
