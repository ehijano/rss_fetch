      <title>Influence of temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity on the stability of atmospheric stratified fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of atmospheric stratified fluids is revisited to study the influence of the temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity due to thermal expansion in the Earth's lower atmosphere (with heights $0$ to $50$ km) under the action of gravity. Previous theory in the literature [Phys. Lett. A 480 (2023) 128990] is modified and advanced. It is found that the Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency associated with internal gravity waves is modified, leading to new instability conditions of vertically stratified fluids. The possibility of the onset of Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convective instability is also discussed, and the influences of the modified Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency and the density and temperature gradients on the instability growth rates are studied.</description>

      <title>Advances in Atom Interferometry and their Impacts on the Performance of Quantum Accelerometers On-board Future Satellite Gravity Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in cold atom interferometry have cleared the path for space applications of quantum inertial sensors, whose level of stability is expected to increase dramatically with the longer interrogation times accessible in space. In this study, a comprehensive in-orbit model is developed for a Mach-Zehnder-type cold-atom accelerometer. Performance tests are realized under different assumptions, and the impact of various sources of errors on instrument stability is evaluated. Current and future advances for space-based atom interferometry are discussed, and their impact on the performance of quantum sensors on-board satellite gravity missions is investigated in three different scenarios: state-of-the-art scenario, near-future (between the next 5 and 10 years) and far-future scenarios (between the next 10 to 20 years). We show that one can achieve a sensitivity level close to 5E-10 with the current state-of-the-art technology. We also estimate that in the near and far-future, atom interferometry in space is expected to achieve sensitivity levels of 1E-11 and 1E-12, respectively. A roadmap for improvements in atom interferometry is provided that would maximize the performance of future CAI accelerometers, considering their technical capabilities. Finally, the possibility and challenges of having ultra-sensitive atom interferometry in space for future space missions are discussed.</description>
