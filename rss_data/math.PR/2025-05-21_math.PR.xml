      <title>McKean-Vlasov equations and nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations with critical singular Lorentz kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence and conditional uniqueness in the Krylov class for SDEs with singular divergence-free drifts in the endpoint critical Lorentz space $L^infinity(0,T; L^{d,infinity}(\mathbb{R}^d))$, $d \geq 2$, which particularly includes the 2D Biot-Savart law. The uniqueness result is shown to be optimal in dimensions $d\geq 3$ by constructing different martingale solutions in the case of supercritical Lorentz drifts. As a consequence, the well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov equations and nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations with critical singular kernels is derived. In particular, this yields the uniqueness of the 2D vorticity Navier-Stokes equations even in certain supercritical-scaling spaces. Furthermore, we prove that the path laws of solutions to McKean-Vlasov equations with critical singular kernels form a nonlinear Markov process in the sense of McKean.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity for stochastic neural field equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the well-posedness and long-time behavior of a general continuum neural field model with Gaussian noise on possibly unbounded domains. In particular, we give conditions for the existence of invariant probability measures by restricting the solution flow to an invariant subspace with a nonlocal metric. Under the assumption of a sufficiently large decay parameter relative to the noise intensity, the growth of the connectivity kernel, and the Lipschitz regularity of the activation function, we establish exponential ergodicity and exponential mixing of the associated Markovian Feller semigroup and the uniqueness of the invariant measure with second moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give bounds for (central) moments for balanced P\'olya urns under very general conditions. In some cases, these bounds imply that moment convergence holds in earlier known results on asymptotic distribution. The results overlap with previously known results, but are here given more generally and with a simpler proof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the solution of the backward stochastic differential equation with terminal singularity has a Malliavin derivative, which is the limit of the derivative of the approximating sequence. We also provide the asymptotic behavior of this derivative close to the terminal time. We apply this result to the regularity of the related partial differential equation and to the sensitivity of the liquidation problem.</description>

      <title>Harmonic problems arising from continuous time random walks limit processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a universal method that identifies the (non-local) governing evolution equations for Continuous Time Random Walks' (CTRWs) limit processes. Given one of these processes, our method provides the form of a non-local operator, acting on space and time variables jointly, such that the (generalized) harmonic problem associated with it represents an evolution governing equation for this process. Then, the well-posedness of this problem must be established case by case. In this paper, we establish well-posedness when the process is a Feller process (on a general Polish space $E$) time-changed with the overshooting of a subordinator. Also, we will show how our method applies to several cases when the equation and its well-posedness are already known, hence unifying several different approaches in the literature.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Nonequilibrium Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that bootstrap methods based on the positivity of probability measures provide a systematic framework for studying both synchronous and asynchronous nonequilibrium stochastic processes on infinite lattices. First, we formulate linear programming problems that use positivity and invariance property of invariant measures to derive rigorous bounds on their expectation values. Second, for time evolution in asynchronous processes, we exploit the master equation along with positivity and initial conditions to construct linear and semidefinite programming problems that yield bounds on expectation values at both short and late times. We illustrate both approaches using two canonical examples: the contact process in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions, and the Domany-Kinzel model in both synchronous and asynchronous forms in 1+1 dimensions. Our bounds on invariant measures yield rigorous lower bounds on critical rates, while those on time evolutions provide two-sided bounds on the half-life of the infection density and the temporal correlation length in the subcritical phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the paper [12] introduces a derivative-free consensus-based particle method that finds the Nash equilibrium of non-convex multiplayer games, where it proves the global exponential convergence in the sense of mean-field law. This paper aims to address theoretical gaps in [12], specifically by providing a quantitative estimate of the mean-field limit with respect to the number of particles, as well as establishing the well-posedness of both the finite particle model and the corresponding mean-field dynamics.</description>

      <title>Merton model and Poisson process with Log Normal intensity function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study considers the Merton model with temporal correlation. We show the Merton model becomes Poisson process with the log-normal distributed intensity function in the limit. We discuss the relation between this model and Hawkes process. In this model we confirm the super-normal transition when the temporal correlation is power case. The phase transition is same as seen before the limit. We apply this model to the default portfolios and find that the power decay model provides better generalization performance for the long term data.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Quasi-Infinitely Divisible Distributions via Fourier Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on statistical inference for the class of quasi-infinitely divisible (QID) distributions, which was recently introduced by Lindner, Pan and Sato (2018). The paper presents a Fourier approach, based on the analogue of the L{\'e}vy-Khintchine theorem with a signed spectral measure. We prove that for some subclasses of QID distributions, the considered estimates have polynomial rates of convergence. This is a remarkable fact when compared to the logarithmic convergence rates of similar methods for infinitely divisible distributions, which cannot be improved in general. We demonstrate the numerical performance of the algorithm using simulated examples.</description>

      <title>The Koopmanization of controlled nonlinear It\^o stochastic differential systems and its comparison with the Carleman embedding: new results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopmanization embeds the bilinearization via the action of the infinitesimal stochastic Koopman operator on the observables associated with the controlled nonlinear It\^o stochastic differential system without explicit linearizations. The stochastic evolutions of controlled Markov processes assume the structure of controlled nonlinear It\^o stochastic differential equations. This paper sketches a Koopman operator framework for the filtering of the controlled nonlinear It\^o stochastic differential system. The major ingredients of this paper are the construction of the eigenfunctions, action of the infinitesimal stochastic Koopman operator, multi-dimensional It\^o differential rule and filtering concerning the controlled nonlinear It\^o stochastic differential system. In this paper, we illustrate the filtering in the Koopman setting for a polynomial system and compare with the filtering in the Carleman setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we have considered a uniform distribution on a regular polygon with $k$-sides for some $k\geq 3$ and the set of all its $k$ vertices as a conditional set. For the uniform distribution under the conditional set first, for all positive integers $n\geq k$, we obtain the conditional optimal sets of $n$-points and the $n$th conditional quantization errors, and then we calculate the conditional quantization dimension and the conditional quantization coefficient in the unconstrained scenario. Then, for the uniform distribution on the polygon taking the same conditional set, we investigate the conditional constrained optimal sets of $n$-points and the conditional constrained quantization errors for all $n \geq 6$, taking the constraint as the circumcircle, incircle, and then the different diagonals of the polygon.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations for Stochastic Evolution Equations in the Critical Variational Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16622v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the weak convergence approach, we prove the large deviation principle (LDP) for solutions to quasilinear stochastic evolution equations with small Gaussian noise in the critical variational setting, a recently developed general variational framework. No additional assumptions are made apart from those required for well-posedness. In particular, no monotonicity is required, nor a compact embedding in the Gelfand triple. Moreover, we allow for flexible growth of the diffusion coefficient, including gradient noise. This leads to numerous applications for which the LDP was not established yet, in particular equations on unbounded domains with gradient noise. Since our framework includes the 2D Navier-Stokes and Boussinesq equations with gradient noise and unbounded domains, our results resolve an open problem that has remained unsolved for over 15 years.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Fourier dimension, $\dim_F\mu$, of Mandelbrot multiplicative cascade measures $\mu$ on the $d$-dimensional unit cube. We show that if $\mu$ is the cascade measure generated by a sub-exponential random variable then \[\dim_F\mu=\min\{2,\dim_2\mu\}\,,\] where $\dim_2\mu$ is the correlation dimension of $\mu$ and it has an explicit formula.
  For cascades on the circle $S\subset\mathbb{R}^2$, we obtain \[\dim_F\mu\ge\frac{\dim_2\mu}{2+\dim_2\mu}\,.\]</description>

      <title>Convergence rate for random walk approximations of mean field BSDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the rate of convergence w.r.t.~a Wasserstein type distance for random walk approximations of mean field BSDEs. Our method does not use the particle method but instead a freezing technique. We extend results by Briand, Ch. Geiss, S. Geiss, and Labart [Bernoulli, 27(2) 2021] about the rate of convergence of a Donsker-type theorem for BSDEs from the classical setting to the mean field setting. In this connection the mean field setting leads to new phenomena and requires new techniques that should be of independent interest: The H\"older continuous terminal condition causes a singularity in time of the generator when seen as a generator in the non-mean field setting. To handle this singularity we introduce a concept of modified H\"older continuity by which we are able to achieve, up to a logarithmic term, the same polynomial approximation rates as in the classical non-mean field setting (in fact, already when approximating the Brownian motion itself a logarithmic term is necessary). Moreover, the exploited freezing technique of the mean field terms yields to the problem to handle the quantitative behavior of several different generators. Using BMO-techniques we obtain the rate of convergence for the integrated gradient process in the scale of Lorentz (type) spaces of exponential type.</description>

      <title>On the randomized Horn problem and the surface tension of hives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two nonincreasing $n$-tuples of real numbers $\lambda_n$, $\mu_n$, the Horn problem asks for a description of all nonincreasing $n$-tuples of real numbers $\nu_n$ such that there exist Hermitian matrices $X_n$, $Y_n$ and $Z_n$ respectively with these spectra such that $X_n + Y_n = Z_n$. There is also a randomized version of this problem where $X_n$ and $Y_n$ are sampled uniformly at random from orbits of Hermitian matrices arising from the conjugacy action by elements of the unitary group. One then asks for a description of the probability measure of the spectrum of the sum $Z_n$. Both the original Horn problem and its randomized version have solutions using the hives introduced by Knutson and Tao. In an asymptotic sense, as $n \rightarrow \infty$, large deviations for the randomized Horn problem were given by Narayanan and Sheffield in terms of the surface tension of hives. In this paper, we provide upper and lower bounds on this surface tension function. We also obtain a closed-form expression for the total entropy of a surface tension minimizing continuum hive with boundary conditions arising from GUE eigenspectra. Finally, we give several empirical results for random hives and lozenge tilings arising from an application of the octahedron recurrence for large $n$ and a numerical approximation of the surface tension function.</description>

Abstract: Using the coupling method introduced in \cite{Geiss:Ylinen:21}, we investigate regularity properties of stochastic differential equations, where we consider the Lipschitz case in $\R^d$ and allow for H\"older continuity of the diffusion coefficient of scalar valued stochastic differential equations. Two cases of the coupling method are of special interest: The uniform coupling to treat the Malliavin Sobolev space $\D_{1,2}$ and real interpolation spaces, and secondly a cut-off coupling to treat the $L_p$-variation of backward stochastic differential equations where the forward process is the investigated stochastic differential equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We confirm the conjecture posed by Gu\'edon, Hinrichs, Litvak, and Prochno in 2017 that $\mathbb{E}\|(a_{ij}g_{ij})_{i\le m, j\le n}\colon \ell_p^n \to \ell_q^m\|$ is comparable, up to constants depending only on $p$ and $q$, to \[ \max_i \|(a_{ij})_j\|_{p^*} +\max_j \|(a_{ij})_i\|_{q} +\mathbb{E} \max_{i,j} |a_{ij}g_{ij}| \] provided that $1\le p \le 2\le q \le \infty$. This was known before only in the case $p=1$ or $q=\infty$, and in the spectral case $p=2=q$. We also reprove the conjecture in the case $p=2=q$ without using spectral theory (which was employed in the previously known proof).</description>

      <title>Symplectic techniques for stochastic differential equations on reductive Lie groups with applications to Langevin diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how Langevin diffusions can be interpreted in the context of stochastic Hamiltonian systems with structure-preserving noise and dissipation on reductive Lie groups. Reductive Lie groups provide the setting in which the Lie group structure is compatible with Riemannian structures, via the existence of bi-invariant metrics. This structure allows for the explicit construction of Riemannian Brownian motion via symplectic techniques, which permits the study of Langevin diffusions with noise in the position coordinate as well as Langevin diffusions with noise in both momentum and position.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For certain natural families of topologies, we study continuity and stability of statistical properties of random walks on linear groups over local fields. We extend large deviation results known in the Archimedean case to non-Archimedean local fields and also demonstrate certain large deviation estimates for heavy tailed distributions unknown even in the Archimedean case. A key technical result, which may be of independent interest, establishes lower semi-continuity for the gap between the first and second Lyapunov exponents. As applications, we are able to obtain a key technical step towards a localization proof for heavy tailed Anderson models (the full proof appearing in a companion article), and show continuity/stability (taking the geometric data as input) of various statistical data associated to hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Moment Inequalities for Suprema of Gaussian Random Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $(X_t)_{t \in T}$ is a Gaussian process indexed by some arbitrary set $T:$ the random variable $\sup_{t \in T}{X_t}$ can be very intricate and bounding its expectation is a natural step towards understanding it. Sudakov-Fernique inequality allows to order expectations of suprema of such random processes: if $(X_t)_{t \in T},(Y_t)_{t \in T}$ are centered Gaussian random processes satisfying $\mathbb{E}[(X_t-X_s)^2] \leq \mathbb{E}[(Y_t-Y_s)^2]$ for all $t,s \in T,$ then $\mathbb{E}[\sup_{t \in T}{X_t}] \leq \mathbb{E}[\sup_{t \in T}{Y_t}].$ This work obtains similar results for higher moments under a slightly stronger condition than the one aforementioned.</description>

      <title>A General Reduction for High-Probability Analysis with General Light-Tailed Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a general reduction technique for analyzing learning algorithms that are subject to light-tailed (but not necessarily bounded) randomness, a scenario that is often the focus of theoretical analysis. We show that the analysis of such an algorithm can be reduced, in a black-box manner and with only a small loss in logarithmic factors, to an analysis of a simpler variant of the same algorithm that uses bounded random variables and is often easier to analyze. This approach simultaneously applies to any light-tailed randomization, including exponential, sub-Gaussian, and more general fast-decaying distributions, without needing to appeal to specialized concentration inequalities. Derivations of a generalized Azuma inequality, convergence bounds in stochastic optimization, and regret analysis in multi-armed bandits with general light-tailed randomization are provided to illustrate the technique.</description>

      <title>About the Moments of the Generalized Ulam Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05860v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given $\pi \in S_n$, let $Z_{n,k}(\pi)=\sum_{1\leq i_1&lt;\dots&lt;i_k\leq n} \mathbf{1}(\{ \pi_{i_1}&lt;\dots&lt;\pi_{i_k}\}$ denote the number of increasing subsequences of length $k$. Consider the "generalized Ulam problem," studying the distribution of $Z_{n,k}$ for general $k$ and $n$. For the 2nd moment, Ross Pinsky initiated a combinatorial study by considering a pair of subsequences $i^{(r)}_1&lt;\dots&lt;i^{(r)}_k$ for $r \in \{1,2\}$, and conditioning on the size of the intersection $j = |\{i_1^{(1)},\dots,i^{(1)}_k\} \cap \{i^{(2)}_1,\dots,i^{(2)}_k\}|$. We obtain the exact large deviation rate function for $\mathbf{E}[Z_{n,k} Z_{n,\ell}]$ in the asymptotic regime $k\sim \kappa n^{1/2}$, $\ell \sim \lambda n^{1/2}$ as $n \to \infty$, for $\kappa,\lambda \in (0,\infty)$. This uses multivariate generating function techniques, as found in the textbook of Pemantle and Wilson. The requisite generating function enumerates pairs of up-right paths in $d=2$, which both end at $(k,\ell)$ with a given number of intersections. We also evaluate the analogous generating function for pairs of $(+\boldsymbol{i},+\boldsymbol{j},+\boldsymbol{k})$ paths in $d=3$, which both end at $(k,\ell,m)$, which has some utility in calculating the 3rd moment. Finally, we consider a simpler problem involving partitions instead of permutations, where all moments are calculable and the replica symmetric ansatz can be stated if not proved.</description>

      <title>How Out-of-Distribution Detection Learning Theory Enhances Transformer: Learnability and Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12915v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers excel in natural language processing and computer vision tasks. However, they still face challenges in generalizing to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) datasets, i.e. data whose distribution differs from that seen during training. OOD detection aims to distinguish outliers while preserving in-distribution (ID) data performance. This paper introduces the OOD detection Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Theory for transformers, which establishes the conditions for data distribution and model configurations for the OOD detection learnability of transformers. It shows that outliers can be accurately represented and distinguished with sufficient data under conditions. The theoretical implications highlight the trade-off between theoretical principles and practical training paradigms. By examining this trade-off, we naturally derived the rationale for leveraging auxiliary outliers to enhance OOD detection. Our theory suggests that by penalizing the misclassification of outliers within the loss function and strategically generating soft synthetic outliers, one can robustly bolster the reliability of transformer networks. This approach yields a novel algorithm that ensures learnability and refines the decision boundaries between inliers and outliers. In practice, the algorithm consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various data formats.</description>

      <title>Nudging state-space models for Bayesian filtering under misspecified dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nudging is a popular algorithmic strategy in numerical filtering to deal with the problem of inference in high-dimensional dynamical systems. We demonstrate in this paper that general nudging techniques can also tackle another crucial statistical problem in filtering, namely the misspecification of the transition kernel. Specifically, we rely on the formulation of nudging as a general operation increasing the likelihood and prove analytically that, when applied carefully, nudging techniques implicitly define state-space models that have higher marginal likelihoods for a given (fixed) sequence of observations. This provides a theoretical justification of nudging techniques as data-informed algorithmic modifications of state-space models to obtain robust models under misspecified dynamics. To demonstrate the use of nudging, we provide numerical experiments on linear Gaussian state-space models and a stochastic Lorenz 63 model with misspecified dynamics and show that nudging offers a robust filtering strategy for these cases.</description>

      <title>Unified Stochastic Framework for Neural Network Quantization and Pruning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization and pruning are two essential techniques for compressing neural networks, yet they are often treated independently, with limited theoretical analysis connecting them. This paper introduces a unified framework for post-training quantization and pruning using stochastic path-following algorithms. Our approach builds on the Stochastic Path Following Quantization (SPFQ) method, extending its applicability to pruning and low-bit quantization, including challenging 1-bit regimes. By incorporating a scaling parameter and generalizing the stochastic operator, the proposed method achieves robust error correction and yields rigorous theoretical error bounds for both quantization and pruning as well as their combination.</description>

      <title>A new approach to locally adaptive polynomial regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive bandwidth selection is a fundamental challenge in nonparametric regression. This paper introduces a new bandwidth selection procedure inspired by the optimality criteria for $\ell_0$-penalized regression. Although similar in spirit to Lepski's method and its variants in selecting the largest interval satisfying an admissibility criterion, our approach stems from a distinct philosophy, utilizing criteria based on $\ell_2$-norms of interval projections rather than explicit point and variance estimates. We obtain non-asymptotic risk bounds for the local polynomial regression methods based on our bandwidth selection procedure which adapt (near-)optimally to the local H\"{o}lder exponent of the underlying regression function simultaneously at all points in its domain. Furthermore, we show that there is a single ideal choice of a global tuning parameter in each case under which the above-mentioned local adaptivity holds. The optimal risks of our methods derive from the properties of solutions to a new ``bandwidth selection equation'' which is of independent interest. We believe that the principles underlying our approach provide a new perspective to the classical yet ever relevant problem of locally adaptive nonparametric regression.</description>

      <title>Fractional interacting particle system: drift parameter estimation via Malliavin calculus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of estimating the drift parameter in a system of $N$ interacting particles driven by additive fractional Brownian motion of Hurst index \( H \geq 1/2 \). Considering continuous observation of the interacting particles over a fixed interval \([0, T]\), we examine the asymptotic regime as \( N \to \infty \). Our main tool is a random variable reminiscent of the least squares estimator but unobservable due to its reliance on the Skorohod integral. We demonstrate that this object is consistent and asymptotically normal by establishing a quantitative propagation of chaos for Malliavin derivatives, which holds for any \( H \in (0,1) \). Leveraging a connection between the divergence integral and the Young integral, we construct computable estimators of the drift parameter. These estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically Gaussian. Finally, a numerical study highlights the strong performance of the proposed estimators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08251v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of community recovery in geometrically-noised stochastic block models (SBM). This work presents two primary contributions: (1) Motif--Attention Spectral Operator (MASO), an attention-based spectral operator that improves upon traditional spectral methods; and (2) Iterative Geometric Denoising (GeoDe), a configurable denoising algorithm that boosts spectral clustering performance. We demonstrate that the fusion of GeoDe+MASO significantly outperforms existing community detection methods on noisy SBMs. Furthermore, we show that using GeoDe+MASO as a denoising step improves belief propagation's community recovery by 79.7% on the Amazon Metadata dataset.</description>

      <title>Agency Problems and Adversarial Bilevel Optimization under Uncertainty and Cyber Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an agency problem between a holding company and its subsidiary, exposed to cyber threats that affect the overall value of the subsidiary. The holding company seeks to design an optimal incentive scheme to mitigate these losses. In response, the subsidiary selects an optimal cybersecurity investment strategy, modeled through a stochastic epidemiological SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) framework. The cyber threat landscape is captured through an L-hop risk framework with two primary sources of risk: (i) internal risk propagation via the contagion parameters in the SIR model, and (ii) external cyberattacks from a malicious external hacker. The uncertainty and adversarial nature of the hacking lead to consider a robust stochastic control approach that allows for increased volatility and ambiguity induced by cyber incidents. The agency problem is formulated as a max-min bilevel stochastic control problem with accidents. First, we derive the incentive compatibility condition by reducing the subsidiary's optimal response to the solution of a second-order backward stochastic differential equation with jumps. Next, we demonstrate that the principal's problem can be equivalently reformulated as an integro-partial Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) equation. By extending the stochastic Perron's method to our setting, we show that the value function of the problem is the unique viscosity solution to the resulting integro-partial HJBI equation.</description>

      <title>Filtering in a hazard rate change-point model with financial and life-insurance applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a continuous-time filtering framework for estimating a hazard rate subject to an unobservable change-point. This framework arises naturally in both financial and insurance applications, where the default intensity of a firm or the mortality rate of an individual may experience a sudden jump at an unobservable time, representing, for instance, a shift in the firm's risk profile or a deterioration in an individual's health status. By employing a progressive enlargement of filtration, we integrate noisy observations of the hazard rate with default-related information. We characterise the filter, i.e. the conditional probability of the change-point given the information flow, as the unique strong solution to a stochastic differential equation driven by the innovation process enriched with the discontinuous component. A sensitivity analysis and a comparison of the filter's behaviour under various information structures are provided. Our framework further allows for the derivation of an explicit formula for the survival probability conditional on partial information. This result applies to the pricing of credit-sensitive financial instruments such as defaultable bonds, credit default swaps, and life insurance contracts. Finally, a numerical analysis illustrates how partial information leads to delayed adjustments in the estimation of the hazard rate and consequently to mispricing of credit-sensitive instruments when compared to a full-information setting.</description>
