      <title>Strict fixed point problem, stability results and retraction displacement condition for Picard operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to give strict fixed point principles for multivalued operators $T:X\rightarrow P(X)$ satisfying some contraction conditions of \'Ciri\' c and of \'Ciri\' c-Reich-Rus type. We are interested, under which conditions, the multi-valued operator has a unique strict fixed point and, additionally, when the sequence of its multi-valued iterates $(T^n(x))_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to this unique strict fixed point. Moreover, some stability properties, such as data dependence on operator perturbation, Ulam-Hyers stability, well-posedness in the sense of Reich and Zaslavski and Ostrowski property of the strict fixed point problem are established.</description>

      <title>On Moment-Entropy inequalities in the space of matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a series of works, Lutwak, Yang and Zhang established what could be called affine information theory, which is the study of moment-entropy and Fisher-information-type inequalities that are invariant with respect to affine transformations for random vectors. Their set of tools stemmed from sharp affine isoperimetric inequalities in the $L^p$ Brunn-Minkowski theory of convex geometry they had established. In this work, we generalize the affine information theory to the setting of matrices. These inequalities on the space of $n\times m$ matrices are induced by the interaction between $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its Euclidean structure and $\mathbb{R}^m$ equipped with a pseudo-norm.</description>

      <title>Frequently hypercyclic $C_0$-semigroups indexed with complex sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study frequent hypercyclicity for strongly continuous semigroups of operators $\left\{T_{t}\right\}_{t\in\Delta}$ indexed with complex sectors. We propose a revised and more natural definition of frequent hypercyclicity compared to the one in [Chaouchi et al.,2020]. Additionally, we establish a sufficient condition and a necessary condition for a $C_0$-semigroup $\{T_{t}\}_{t \in \Delta}$ to be frequently hypercyclic. Moreover, we derive a practical and applicable criterion for translation semigroups $\{T_{t}\}_{t \in \Delta}$ on $L^p_\rho(\Delta, \mathbb{K})$ spaces, expressed in terms of the integral of the weight function. As a result, we provide explicit examples of frequently hypercyclic translation semigroups on $L^{p}_{\rho}(\Delta, \mathbb{K})$. Lastly, we present a necessary condition on the weight function for the translation semigroups, under which it is demonstrated that Example I (i) [Chaouchi,2020] is not frequently hypercyclic under the revised definition.</description>

      <title>E-frames multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is dedicated to investigating some notions related to $E$-frames and multipliers. $E$-frames are a new generalization for the concept of frames for $\mathcal{H}$, where $E$ is an infinite invertible complex matrix mapping on $\bigoplus_{n=1}^{\infty}\mathcal{H}$. A Multiplier is an operator that combines (frame-like) analysis, multiplication with a fixed sequence, called the symbol, and synthesis. Firstly, we try to reintroduce the operators associated with $E$-frames in terms of the frame's analysis and synthesis operators, under certain conditions. Secondly, we define the notion of $E$-multiplier and investigate some results.</description>

      <title>Distributionally chaotic $C_0$-semigroups on complex sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore distributional chaos for $C_0$-semigroups of linear operators on Banach spaces whose index set is a sector in the complex plane. We establish the relationship between distributional sensitivity and distributional chaos by characterizing them in terms of distributionally (semi-)irregular vectors. Additionally, we provide conditions under which a $C_0$-semigroup admits a linear manifold of distributionally irregular vectors. Furthermore, we delve into the study of distributional chaos for the translation $C_0$-semigroup on weighted $L_p$-spaces with a complex sector as the index set. We obtain a sufficient condition for dense distributional chaos, expressed in terms of the weight. In particular, we construct an example of a translation $C_0$-semigroup with a complex sector index set that is Devaney chaotic but not distributionally chaotic.</description>

      <title>Distributional chaos for composition operators on $L^{p}$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distributional chaos of the composition operator $T_{\varphi}:f\mapsto f\circ\varphi$ on $L^{p}(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$, $1\leq p &lt;\infty$. We provide a characterization and practical sufficient conditions on $\varphi$ for $T_{\varphi}$ to be distributionally chaotic. Furthermore, we show that the existence of a dense set of distributionally irregular vectors implies the existence of a dense distributionally chaotic set, without any additional condition. We also provide a useful criterion for densely distributional chaos. Moreover, we characterize the weight sequences that ensure distributional chaos for bilateral backward shifts, unilateral backward shifts, bilateral forward shifts, and unilateral forward shifts on the weighted $\ell^{p}$-spaces $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{N},v)$ and $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{Z},v)$. As a consequence, we reveal the equivalence between distributional chaos and densely distributional chaos for backward shifts and forward shifts on $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{Z},v)$ without any additional condition. Finally, we characterize the composition operator $T_{\varphi}$ on $L^{p}(\mathbb{T},\mathcal{B},\lambda)$ induced by an automorphism $\varphi$ of the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$. We show that $T_{\varphi}$ is densely distributionally chaotic if and only if $\varphi$ has no fixed point in $\mathbb{D}$.</description>

      <title>A Family of Semi-norms in $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of non-negative real-valued functions on a $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$, i.e., for $0\leq \mu \leq 1,$ $$\|a\|_{\sigma_{\mu}}= \text{sup}\left\lbrace \sqrt{|f(a)|^2 \sigma_{\mu} f(a^*a)}: f\in \mathcal{A}', \, f(1)=\|f\|=1 \right\rbrace, \quad $$ where $a\in \mathcal{A}$ and $\sigma_{\mu}$ is an interpolation path of the symmetric mean $\sigma$. These functions are semi-norms as they satisfy the norm axioms, except for the triangle inequality. Special cases satisfying triangle inequality, and a complete equality characterization is also discussed. Various bounds and relationships will be established for this new family, with a connection to the existing literature in the algebra of all bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>The Quasicentral Modulus Associated with a Class of Nonself-similar Fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss an extension to Voiculescu's formula for the quasicentral modulus of a tuple of commuting, self-adjoint operators with spectral measure absolutely continuous with respect to a generalized Hausdorff measure. These Hausdorff measures are defined by gauge functions which are not power functions and are supported on nonself-similar fractals.</description>

      <title>On $L_p$ Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities for a general class of functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the $L_p$ version (for $p\geqslant 1$) of the dimensional Brunn-Minkowski inequality for the standard Gaussian measure $\gamma_n(\cdot)$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is shown. More precisely, we prove that for any $0$-symmetric convex sets with nonempty interior, any $p&gt;1$, and every $\lambda \in (0,1)$, \[ \gamma_n\bigl((1-\lambda)\cdot K+_p \lambda \cdot L\bigr)^{p/n} \geqslant (1-\lambda) \gamma_n(K)^{p/n} + \lambda \gamma_n(L)^{p/n}. \] Equality, for some $\lambda \in (0,1)$ and $p&gt;1$, holds if and only if $K=L$. This inequality turns out to be the $L_p$ extension of a celebrated result for the Minkowski sum (that is, for $p=1$) by Eskenazis and Moschidis (2021) on a problem by Gardner and Zvavitch (2010).
  Moreover, an $L_p$ Brunn-Minkowski type inequality is obtained for the classical Wills functional $\mathcal{W}(\cdot)$ of convex bodies.
  These results are derived as a consequence of a more general approach, which provides us with other remarkable examples of functionals satisfying $L_p$ Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities, such as different absolutely continuous measures with radially decreasing densities.</description>

      <title>On the eigenvalues and Fu\v{c}\'{\i}k spectrum of $p$-Laplace local and nonlocal operator with mixed interpolated Hardy term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we are concerned with the eigenvalue problem driven by the mixed local and nonlocal $p$-Laplacian operator having the interpolated Hardy term \begin{equation*} \mathcal{T}(u) :=- \Delta_p u + (- \Delta_p)^s u - \mu \frac{|u|^{p-2}u}{|x|^{p \theta}}, \end{equation*} where $0&lt;s&lt;1&lt;p&lt;N$, $\theta \in [s,1]$, and $\mu \in (0,\mu_0(\theta))$. First, we establish a mixed interpolated Hardy inequality and then show the existence of eigenvalues and their properties. We also investigate the Fu\v{c}\'{\i}k spectrum, the existence of the first nontrivial curve in the Fu\v{c}\'{\i}k spectrum, and prove some of its properties. Moreover, we study the shape optimization of the domain with respect to the first two eigenvalues, the regularity of the eigenfunctions, the Faber-Krahn inequality, and a variational characterization of the second eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>On general versions of the Petty projection inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Petty projection inequality is an affine isoperimetric inequality which constitutes a cornerstone in the affine geometry of convex bodies. By extending the polar projection body to an inter-dimensional operator, Petty's inequality was generalized to the so-called $(L_p,Q)$ setting, where $Q$ is an $m$-dimensional compact convex set. In this work, we further extend the $(L_p,Q)$ Petty projection inequality to the broader realm of rotationally invariant measures with concavity properties, namely, those with $\gamma$-concave density (for $\gamma\geq-1/nm$). Moreover, when $p=1$, and motivated by a contemporary empirical reinterpretation of Petty's result, we explore empirical analogues of this inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish refined versions of the Frobenius Theorem for non-involutive distributions and use these refinements to prove an unrectifiability result for Carnot-Carath\'{e}odory spaces. We also introduce a new class of metric spaces that extends the framework of Carnot-Carath\'{e}odory geometry and show that, within this class, Carnot-Carath\'{e}odory spaces are, in some sense, extremal. Our results provide new insights into the relationship between integrability, non-involutivity, and rectifiability in both classical and sub-Riemannian settings.</description>

      <title>The Einstein Relation on Metric Measure Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.07166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note is based on F. Burghart's master thesis at Stuttgart university from July 2018, supervised by Prof. Freiberg.
  We review the Einstein relation, which connects the Hausdorff, local walk and spectral dimensions on a space, in the abstract setting of a metric measure space equipped with a suitable operator. This requires some twists compared to the usual definitions from fractal geometry. The main result establishes the invariance of the three involved notions of fractal dimension under bi-Lipschitz continuous isomorphisms between mm-spaces and explains, more generally, how the transport of the analytic and stochastic structure behind the Einstein relation works. While any homeomorphism suffices for this transport of structure, non-Lipschitz maps distort the Hausdorff and the local walk dimension in different ways. To illustrate this, we take a look at H\"older regular transformations and how they influence the local walk dimension and describe the Einstein relation on graphs of fractional Brownian motions. We conclude by giving a short list of further questions that may help building a general theory of the Einstein relation.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study $ m $-isometric weighted shifts with operator weights (both unilateral and bilateral). We obtain a characterization of such shifts by polynomials with operator coefficients. The procedure of construction of all $ m $-isometric weighted shifts with positive weights is given. We answer the question when the weights of $ m $-isometric shifts are commuting. The completion problem for $ m $-isometric weighted shifts with operator weights is solved. We characterize $ m $-isometric bilateral shifts the adjoints of which are also $ m $-isometric. Several relevant examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz-free spaces and dual representations of group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}(M)$ be the Lipschitz-free space of a pointed metric space $M$. For every isometric continuous group action of $G$ on $M$, there is an induced continuous dual action on the weak-star compact unit ball $B_{\mathcal{F}(M)^*}$ of the dual space $\mathrm{Lip_0} (M)=\mathcal{F}(M)^*$. We study the question when a given abstract continuous action of $G$ on a topological space $X$ can be represented through a $G$-subspace of $B_{\mathcal{F}(M)^*}$. Two such natural examples are the so-called metric compactification (of isometric $G$-spaces) for a pointed metric space and the Gromov $G$-compactification of a bounded metric $G$-space. There are sufficiently many representations of compact $G$-spaces on Lipschitz-free spaces. One of the results asserts that for every bounded stable metric $G$-space $(M,d,\mathbf{0})$ the corresponding metric $G$-compactification $\widehat{M}$ is a weakly almost periodic $G$-flow.</description>

      <title>Toeplitz algebra of bounded symmetric domains: A quantum harmonic analysis approach via localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Toeplitz operators are norm dense in the Toeplitz algebra $\mathfrak{T}(L^\infty)$ over the weighted Bergman space $\mathcal{A}^2_\nu(\Omega)$ of a bounded symmetric domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n$. Our methods use representation theory, quantum harmonic analysis, and weakly-localized operators. Additionally, we note that the set of all $\alpha$-weakly-localized operators form a self-adjoint algebra, containing the set of all Toeplitz operators, whose norm closure coincides with the Toeplitz algebra.</description>

      <title>Embeddability of $\ell_p$-spaces into mixed-norm Lebesgue spaces in connection with the validity of vector-valued extensions of the Riesz--Fischer Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we compute, in terms of $r$ and $s$, the indices $p$ for which $\ell_p$ isomorphically embeds into the mixed-norm separable spaces $L_s(L_r)$, $\ell_s(L_r)$, $L_s(\ell_r)$ and $\ell_s(\ell_r)$. On the other hand, we use this information to move forward in the isomorphic classification of mixed-norm spaces. In particular, we tell apart the spaces $L_2(L_r)$ and $\ell_2(L_r)$, $r\not=2$.</description>

      <title>A Rockafellar-type theorem for non-traditional costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.13263v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we present a unified approach to the problem of existence of a potential for the optimal transport problem with respect to non-traditional cost functions, that is, costs that assume infinite values. We establish a new method that relies on proving solvability of a special (possibly infinite) family of linear inequalities. When the index set of this family is countable, we give a necessary and sufficient condition on the coefficients that assures the existence of a solution, and which, in the setting of transport theory, we call $c$-path-boundedness. In the case of an uncountable index set, one needs an additional assumption for solvability. We propose a sufficient condition in this case. We note that any set admitting a potential must be $c$-path-bounded, and this condition replaces $c$-cyclic monotonicity from the classical theory, i.e. when the cost is real-valued. Our method also gives a new and elementary proof for the classical results of Rockafellar, Rochet and R\"uschendorf.</description>

      <title>On Fock covariance for product systems and the reduced Hao-Ng isomorphism problem by discrete actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a characterisation of equivariant Fock covariant injective representations for product systems. We show that this characterisation coincides with Nica covariance for compactly aligned product systems over right LCM semigroups of Kwa\'{s}niewski and Larsen, and with the Toeplitz representations of a discrete monoid of Laca and Sehnem. By combining with the framework established by Katsoulis and Ramsey, we resolve the reduced Hao-Ng isomorphism problem for generalised gauge actions by discrete groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We offer new results and new directions in the study of operator-valued kernels and their factorizations. Our approach provides both more explicit realizations and new results, as well as new applications. These include: (i) an explicit covariance analysis for Hilbert space-valued Gaussian processes, (ii) optimization results for quantum gates (from quantum information), (iii) new results for positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), and (iv) a new approach/result in inverse problems for quantum measurements.</description>

      <title>Chernoff's product formula: Semigroup approximations with non-uniform time intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Often, when we consider the time evolution of a system, we resort to approximation: Instead of calculating the exact orbit, we divide the time interval in question into uniform segments. Chernoff's results in this direction provide us with a general approximation scheme. There are situations when we need to break the interval into uneven pieces. In this paper, we explore alternative conditions to the one found by Smolyanov et al. such that Chernoff's original result can be extended to unevenly distributed time intervals. Two applications concerning the foundations of quantum mechanics and the central limit theorem are presented.</description>

      <title>Key subgroups in the Polish group of all automorphisms of the rational circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending some results of a joint work with E. Glasner (2021) we continue to study the Polish group $G:=\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{Q}_0)$ of all circular order preserving permutations of $\mathbb{Q}_0$ with the pointwise topology, where $\mathbb{Q}_0$ is the rational discrete circle. We show that certain extremely amenable subgroups $H$ of $G:=\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{Q}_0)$ are inj-key (i.e., $H$ distinguishes weaker Hausdorff group topologies on $G$) but not co-minimal in $G$. This counterexample answers a question from a joint work with M. Shlossberg (2024) and is inspired by a question proposed by V. Pestov about Polish groups $G$ with metrizable universal minimal $G$-flow $M(G)$. It is an open problem to study Pestov's question in its full generality.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of L\'evy-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroups on $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of Markov semigroups associated with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes driven by L\'evy processes. These semigroups are generated by non-local, non-self-adjoint operators. In the special case where the driving L\'evy process is Brownian motion, one recovers the classical diffusion OU semigroup, whose spectral properties have been extensively studied over past few decades. Our main results establish that, under suitable conditions on the L\'evy process, the spectrum of the L\'evy-OU semigroup in the $L^p$-space weighted with the invariant distribution coincides with that of the diffusion OU semigroup. Furthermore, when the drift matrix $B$ is diagonalizable with real eigenvalues, we derive explicit formulas for eigenfunctions and co-eigenfunctions--an observation that, to the best of our knowledge, has not appeared in the literature. We also show that the multiplicities of the eigenvalues remain independent of the choice of the L\'evy process. A key ingredient in our approach is intertwining relationship: we prove that every L\'evy-OU semigroup is intertwined with a diffusion OU semigroup. Additionally, we examine the compactness properties of these semigroups and provide examples of non-compact L\'evy-OU semigroups.</description>
