      <title>ECC Analyzer: Extract Trading Signal from Earnings Conference Calls using Large Language Model for Stock Performance Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of financial analytics, leveraging unstructured data, such as earnings conference calls (ECCs), to forecast stock performance is a critical challenge that has attracted both academics and investors. While previous studies have used deep learning-based models to obtain a general view of ECCs, they often fail to capture detailed, complex information. Our study introduces a novel framework: \textbf{ECC Analyzer}, combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-modal techniques to extract richer, more predictive insights. The model begins by summarizing the transcript's structure and analyzing the speakers' mode and confidence level by detecting variations in tone and pitch for audio. This analysis helps investors form an overview perception of the ECCs. Moreover, this model uses the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based methods to meticulously extract the focuses that have a significant impact on stock performance from an expert's perspective, providing a more targeted analysis. The model goes a step further by enriching these extracted focuses with additional layers of analysis, such as sentiment and audio segment features. By integrating these insights, the ECC Analyzer performs multi-task predictions of stock performance, including volatility, value-at-risk (VaR), and return for different intervals. The results show that our model outperforms traditional analytic benchmarks, confirming the effectiveness of using advanced LLM techniques in financial analytics.</description>
