      <title>Polarized Neutral and Charged Current Semi-Inclusive Deep-Inelastic Scattering at NNLO in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semi-inclusive production of identified hadrons in deeply inelastic lepton scattering on polarized nucleons allows to probe the spin structure of the nucleon target in a more detailed level than through fully inclusive processes. We compute the NNLO QCD corrections to longitudinally polarized semi-inclusive deep inelastic processes mediated by electroweak neutral and charged currents. We present the first calculation of polarized electroweak structure functions in the Larin scheme up to NNLO. Additionally, we reformulate the finite scheme transformation to the $\overline{\textrm{MS}}$ scheme in a quark flavour basis and identify issues in its assignment to partonic channels in previous calculations. Using our results we perform a detailed phenomenological study of polarized cross sections and of single and double spin asymmetries. We observe large electroweak effects, which need to be included in precision studies of polarized observables.</description>

      <title>Minimal Majorana neutrino mass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of the Casas-Ibarra parametrization that applies to all possible Majorana neutrino mass models. This framework allows us to systematically identify minimal models, defined as those with the smallest number of free parameters. We further analyze the phenomenologically relevant combination of the Yukawa matrix, $y^\dagger y$, and show that in certain scenarios it exhibits an unexpected reduction in the number of free parameters, depending on just one real degree of freedom. Finally, the application of our results is illustrated in specific models, which can be tested or falsified due to their definite experimental predictions in heavy neutrino and charged lepton flavor violating decays.</description>

      <title>Chiral effects and Joule heating in hot and dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Initial states of dense matter with nonzero electron chiral imbalance could potentially give rise to strong magnetic fields through chiral plasma instability. Previous work indicated that unless chiral chemical potential is as large as the electron vector chemical potential, the growth of magnetic fields due to the instability is washed out by chirality flipping rate enabled by electron mass. We re-examine this claim in a broader range of parameters and find that at higher temperatures the hierarchy is reversed supporting a growing magnetic field for an initial electron chiral chemical potential much smaller than the electron vector chemical potential. Further, we identify a qualitatively new effect relevant for magnetized hot and dense medium where chiral magnetic effect (CME) sourced by density fluctuation acts as a powerful source of Joule heating. Remarkably, even modest chiral chemical potentials (keV) in such environment can deposit energy densities set by the QCD scale in a relatively short time of the order of a few milliseconds or seconds. We speculate how this mechanism makes CME-driven Joule heating a potentially critical ingredient in the dynamics of turbulent density fluctuation of supernovae and neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Neutrino backgrounds in matter-wave interferometry: implications for dark matter searches and beyond-Standard Model physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of neutrino-induced decoherence in macroscopic matter-wave interferometry experiments designed to search for dark matter and beyond-Standard Model physics. Our calculation includes contributions from the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B), solar neutrinos, and reactor antineutrinos, accounting for coherent scattering processes across nuclear, atomic, and macroscopic length scales. Within the Standard Model, we find negligible decoherence rates for planned experiments such as MAQRO ($s/\sigma_s \sim 10^{-27}$) and terrestrial interferometers like Pino ($s/\sigma_s \sim 10^{-22}$). However, these experiments achieve competitive sensitivity to beyond-Standard Model physics through light vector mediator interactions, with C$\nu$B constraining coupling products to $g_\nu g_n \lesssim 10^{-17}$ for $Z'$ masses below 1 eV. Our results provide a theoretical framework for interpreting matter-wave interferometry measurements in terms of neutrino interaction physics and for deriving constraints on BSM models from experimental data.</description>

      <title>Pion bremsstrahlung in the splitting function formalism and the dark photon production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the production of hypothetical vector portal mediators, dark photons $\gamma^\prime$, with masses in the range 0.4-3.5 GeV in the negatively charged pion-proton collisions $\pi^-p\rightarrow \gamma^\prime X$ via inelastic pion bremsstrahlung and QCD Drell-Yan-like process. In both cases we estimate the value of total dark photon production cross section and obtain the energy distribution for dark photons that could be produced in the NA64h experiment. We also present the mean energies of dark photons produced in the same way by the secondary pions with momenta typical for T2K, DUNE and SHiP experiments.</description>

      <title>Lepton polarization dependent angular observables and the polarization asymmetries in the four-fold $\Lambda_b \rightarrow \Lambda(\rightarrow N \pi) \ell^+\ell^-$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare decays mediated by flavor-changing neutral current processes, such as $b \to s \ell^{+}\ell^{-}$, provide powerful probes of the Standard Model and potential windows into new physics. Particularly, the angular observables in these exclusive decays are valuable because of their sensitivity to short-distance dynamics and their reduced dependence on hadronic uncertainties, which mainly arise from form factors. In this work, we analyze the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda(\to N\pi)\ell^{+}\ell^{-}$ (with $N\pi=\{p\pi^-,n\pi^0\}$) decay with polarized final-state lepton and derive the corresponding four-fold differential decay distributions. For the longitudinal, normal, and transverse polarization states, we systematically identify the additional angular coefficients that emerge relative to the unpolarized case. We find that the longitudinal polarization preserves the structure of the unpolarized distribution, while the normal and transverse polarizations introduce some new additional angular coefficients. The analytical expressions of all polarized and unpolarized angular coefficients are explicitly derived in terms of the helicity and transversity amplitudes. To compare the variation in the polarized and unpolarized angular observables, we have plotted them against the square of the momentum transfer $q^2$. Additionally, the Standard Model predictions of the polarization asymmetry observables are provided and their sensitivity to new physics is explored under different new physics scenarios. The obtained results, in the current study, for longitudinal and transverse polarization cases, provide a baseline for the lepton polarization dependent observables, which may serve as sensitive probes to test the Standard Model in these decays.</description>

      <title>Scaling properties of nuclear parton distributions in short-range-correlation motivated two-component parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide some critical remarks on the recently proposed two-component parametrization of nuclear parton distribution functions, which was motivated by the apparent correlation between the nuclear modifications of structure functions and nucleon-nucleon short-range correlation phenomena. This parametrization, we show, is invariant under a rescaling transformation of the involved abundance coefficients, which means that the global normalization of these coefficients cannot be meaningfully determined in a fit, and only their ratios should be studied for finding evidence of short-range-correlation type behavior at parton level. As we show, however, the current constraints for the nuclear-mass dependence of these coefficients allow also for interpretations different from short-range correlations. Nevertheless, this two-component parametrization exhibits a similar scaling relation for DIS structure functions as demonstrated in earlier works, and, as we demonstrate, yields testable predictions for structure-function and hard-process cross-section ratios. We also note on the non-trivial isospin dependence of the short-range-correlation motivated parametrization, which under proton-neutron pair dominance assumption can lead to charge-symmetry-violation resembling terms.</description>

      <title>ELENA: a software for fast and precise computation of first order phase transitions and gravitational waves production in particle physics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ELENA (EvaLuator of tunnElliNg Actions), an open-source Python package designed to compute the full evolution of first-order phase transitions in the early Universe generated by particle physics models, taking into account several refinements that go beyond commonly assumed simplifications. The core of ELENA is based on a vectorized implementation of the tunnelling potential formalism, which allows for a fast computation of the finite-temperature tunnelling action. This, in turn, enables the sampling of the full range of temperatures where two phases coexist and the use of integral expressions that track the complete evolution of the transition, providing a comprehensive picture of it. In addition, ELENA provides all the tools to compute the resulting stochastic gravitational waves spectrum, allowing for the full chain of computations - from the Lagrangian parameter inputs to the final gravitational waves spectrum - in a fast and self-contained implementation.</description>

      <title>The (3+1)-dimensional scalar field model analysis of beam spin asymmetry in the electroproduction of a scalar meson off a scalar target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore exclusive scalar meson electroproduction off a scalar target in the (3+1)-dimensional scalar field model. This model analysis is a straightforward extension of the previous (1+1)-dimensional model analysis presented in Phys. Rev. D \textbf{105}, 096014 (2022). In contrast to the (1+1)-dimensional model, the (3+1)-dimensional model allows us to compute the beam spin asymmetry (BSA), which is proportional to the imaginary part of the product of the two Compton form factors (CFFs) that appear in the hadronic current of the present scalar meson electroproduction process. We compute both real and imaginary parts of the CFFs and note that the BSA is detectable for $-t/Q^2 \gtrsim 0.1$ although it gets quite small in the kinematic region $-t/Q^2 \ll 0.1$ where the factorization of the generalized parton distribution (GPD) is attainable. We find the analytic forms of the leading twist GPD for the DGLAP and ERBL regions in the (3+1)-dimensional scalar field model, confirming its uniqueness independent of the hadronic current component. While we verify that the GPD sum rule for the total result of summing the DGLAP and ERBL regions holds for all components of the hadronic current, we note that the respective correspondence of the DGLAP and ERBL regions to the valence and non-valence parts of the electromagnetic form factor holds only for the light-front plus component of the hadronic current but not for any other components of the hadronic current. We discuss the polynomiality of the GPD up to the second moments and remark on accessible ranges of kinematics to measure the BSA and CFFs with respect to the future experimental efforts of extracting the leading-twist GPDs.</description>

      <title>$\bar{B}_{s,d}^{0} \to J/\psi \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ Decays in QCD Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the first LHCb searches for the rare $\bar{B}_{s,d}^{0} \to J/\psi\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ decays, we perform a detailed study of these processes within the QCD factorization formalism. Since the transverse size of the $J/\psi$ meson is small in the heavy quark mass limit, this formalism is generally expected to hold for these decays. We include both the leading- and the next-to-leading-order QCD corrections to the hard-scattering kernels, which are convoluted with the light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of the initial- and final-state hadrons. It is numerically found that, depending on the model parameters for the leading-twist $B$-meson LCDA, the maximum branching ratios of $\bar{B}_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ and $\bar{B}_{d}^{0} \to J/\psi\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$, integrated over the dimuon invariant mass squared $q^2$ from $1\,\mathrm{GeV}^2$ to $(m_{B_{s,d}}-m_{J/\psi})^2$, can reach, respectively, up to $2.21\times10^{-9}$ and $7.69\times10^{-11}$ at the leading order in $\alpha_s$. After incorporating the non-factorizable one-loop vertex corrections, these branching ratios are further reduced by about one order of magnitude, with $\mathcal{B}(\bar{B}_{s}^{0} \to J/\psi\mu^{+}\mu^{-})|_{q^2 \geq 1\,\mathrm{GeV}^2}=2.88\times10^{-10}$ and $\mathcal{B}(\bar{B}_{d}^{0} \to J/\psi\mu^{+}\mu^{-})|_{q^2 \geq 1\,\mathrm{GeV}^2}=1.07\times10^{-11}$. In addition, we have presented the dimuon invariant mass distributions of the individual and total helicity amplitudes squared, as well as the differential and integrated longitudinal polarization fractions of the $J/\psi$ meson, which could be probed by the future LHCb and Belle II experiments with more accumulated data.</description>

      <title>Study of spin states in vacuum pair production via the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general spin-resolved momentum distribution of electron-positron pairs produced in strong external fields is derived by combining the covariant spin projection operator and the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW) formalism. The result shows that the spin-resolved and helicity-resolved momentum distributions given in previous literature are actually two special cases of it. For any spin-direction unit vector, numerical investigations demonstrate that when the $z$-component of the unit vector vanishes, the number density of produced spin-up and spin-down particles is equal, while their momentum distributions have some asymmetry. For a nonzero $z$-component of the unit vector, there is a difference of $1-3$ orders of magnitude in the number density of spin-up and spin-down particles induced by angular momentum transfer in multiphoton absorption. Moreover, as the electric field strength increases and/or the field frequency decreases, the asymmetry between the spin-up and spin-down particle number density decreases rapidly. These results offer an approach to study general spin states in vacuum pair production, and enhance our understanding of angular momentum transfer from fields to matter in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing pair production with optimized chirped laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal chirped field for enhancing electron-positron (EP) pair production is explored using a quantum kinetic approach. First, the momentum spectrum and number density of EP pairs produced by Gaussian chirped fields are investigated. The results show that the momentum spectrum exhibits distinct interference patterns, while the number density grows monotonically with chirp parameters but oscillates with the carrier angular frequency. Moreover, the number density increases by four orders of magnitude compared to chirp-free fields. The results are further compared with those from four other chirped fields: frequency-modulated, linear, quadratic, and sinusoidal chirp. The analysis reveals that the maximum number density for sinusoidally chirped fields is the highest, followed by Gaussian, frequency-modulated, quadratically, and linearly chirped fields. This ranking also applies to the maximum enhancement factors for these chirped fields. Notably, the number density for sinusoidally chirped fields improves nine orders of magnitude compared to chirp-free fields. These results not only deepen our understanding of pair production in chirped fields but also provide significant optimization strategies for future vacuum pair production experiments.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of a Kinetic Higgs Portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenological consequences of non-minimal hidden sector interactions on observable correlations in the Higgs sector, mediated through the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric Higgs portal. Particular attention is given to non-standard momentum dependencies of the hidden sector scalar, which arise naturally in an effective field theory (EFT) framework. We demonstrate that perturbatively reliable constraints can be derived from four-top quark production data and precision measurements of Higgs couplings. These constraints are especially relevant in parameter regions where destructive interference suppresses invisible Higgs decays to light exotic scalars, keeping them within experimentally allowed limits. Finally, we discuss the implications of such hidden sector interactions for the thermal history of the universe. We show that non-standard momentum dependencies open up the Higgs portal to account for the observed dark matter relic abundance whilst evading current direct detection constraints. They can also be probed at the (HL-)LHC and, ultimately, at future lepton colliders such as a FCC-ee.</description>

      <title>Mass Varying Neutrino Oscillation in Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how matter density affects neutrino oscillations by considering a mass-varying neutrino scenario where the neutrino mass depends on a scalar field. This scalar field is non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant, causing its profile to be implicitly influenced by the surrounding matter distribution. Using data from solar neutrino experiments, we derive constraints on the model parameters, providing new insights into the properties of mass-varying neutrino within the Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor framework</description>

Abstract: In light of the recent measurement of the $\eta\to\pi^{0}\gamma\gamma$ decay by the KLOE-2 Collaboration, a previous analysis including vector- and scalar-meson exchange contributions using the VMD and L$\sigma$M frameworks, respectively, is extended in the present study to incorporate the effects of the $a_{2}(1320)$ tensor meson within a chiral context. Although the individual contribution of the $a_{2}$ is negligible, its destructive interference with the vector-meson resonances is found to be significant, representing approximately $18\%$ of the total signal and substantially affecting the diphoton invariant-mass distribution, especially at low $m_{\gamma\gamma}^{2}$ values. The total decay rate is calculated to be $\Gamma(\eta\to\pi^{0}\gamma\gamma)=0.154(22)$ eV, which corresponds to a branching ratio of ${\rm BR}(\eta\to\pi^{0}\gamma\gamma)=1.17(17)\times10^{-4}$. This result is approximately $5\sigma$ below the reported value of the PDG, $2.55(22)\times10^{-4}$, while it is in very good agreement with the KLOE-2 measurement, $0.98(11_{\rm stat})(14_{\rm syst})\times10^{-4}$. In contrast, the total contribution of the $a_{2}$ is found to be negligible in $\eta^{\prime}\to\pi^{0}\gamma\gamma$, as this process is completely dominated by the exchange of an on-shell $\omega$ vector resonance.</description>

      <title>Comparative insights into gluon and proton structure through parton distribution functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Study of parton distribution functions (PDFs) has led to a finer cognisance of the structure of partons in hadrons and the proton structure functions in deep inelastic scattering (DIS). PDFs are instrumental in predicting results for most of the hard-scattering processes measured at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, due to the non-perturbative nature of partons, calculation of parton distributions using perturbative QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics) cannot be done. The analysis of PDFs, therefore, needs a relentless effort. In this paper, we study a comparative approach of three global PDF sets, viz. CT14, MMHT2014 and NNPDF 4.0. Gluon distribution functions and proton structure functions have been evaluated in a wide range of momentum fraction \textit{x} and energy scale \textit{Q}; and plausible observations have been made.</description>

      <title>Gluon Condensation as a Unifying Mechanism for Special Spectra of Cosmic Gamma Rays and Low-Momentum Pion Enhancement at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding the internal structure of the proton is a fundamental challenge in physics. Historically, any new discovery about the proton has fuelled advances in several scientific fields. We have reported that gluons inside the proton accumulate near the critical momentum due to chaotic phenomena, forming gluon condensation. Surprisingly, the pion distribution predicted by this gluon distribution for the production of high-energy proton collisions could answer two puzzles in astronomy and high-energy physics. We find that during ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray collisions, gluon condensation may abruptly produce a large number of low-momentum pions, whose electromagnetic decays have the typical breakout properties appearing in various cosmic gamma-ray spectra. On the other hand, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is well below the cosmic ray energy scale, also shows weak but recognisable signs of gluon condensation, which had been mistaken for BEC pions. The connection between these two phenomena, which occur at different scales in the Universe, supports the existence of a new structure within the proton-gluon condensation.</description>

      <title>No Track left behind: Graph-based Vertexing for long-lived Particle Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstruction of displaced vertices is a cornerstone of both precision flavour physics and searches for long-lived particles (LLPs) at colliders. While existing vertexing algorithms are highly optimised for primary and short-lived secondary vertices, they face limitations when confronted with the large displacements and heterogeneous topologies characteristic of LLP decays. In this work we present a new approach to displaced vertex reconstruction combining an initialisation-free robust vertex fitter with a graph-based track clustering strategy. The algorithm is implemented as a self-contained Delphes module and can be straightforwardly integrated into existing detector cards, providing a turn-key tool for phenomenological studies. This plug-and-play functionality fills a gap left by public software frameworks, which either lack displaced-vertex capabilities or are not readily usable in fast-simulation environments. We validate our approach in an IDEA-like FCC-ee detector, using Higgs-strahlung $e^+e^- \to Zh$ with exotic $h\to NN$ decays as a benchmark process. We demonstrate excellent efficiency, resolution, and purity across a broad range of lifetimes, and derive model-independent projections for the FCC-ee sensitivity to exotic Higgs branching fractions.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative fluctuation effects of charged bosonic fields: A quark-diquark model study at nonzero density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the renormalization group flow of the scale-dependent effective potential of a quark-diquark model with full field dependence at nonzero chemical potential. This includes a discussion of approximations in relation to complex bosonic fields and the Silver-Blaze property. The resulting flow equation for the scale-dependent effective potential can in principle be solved down to the infrared limit. For our quark-diquark model, which may serve as a low-energy model for dense strong-interaction matter, we find that a competition between the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer singularity and bosonic fluctuations can trigger a first-order phase transition at low temperatures that turns into a second-order phase transition at a tricritical point as the temperature increases.</description>

      <title>CP violation in the hyperon decays $\Sigma\to N\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of $CP$ violation in hyperon transitions has a long history. In the early 2000s the HyperCP experiment made a major effort to seek $CP$-odd signals in the decay sequence $\Xi^-\to\Lambda \pi^-$ and $\Lambda\to p\pi^-$, which motivated more searches. Most recently the BESIII and LHCb Collaborations have acquired or improved the upper bounds on $CP$ violation in a variety of hyperon nonleptonic processes, including $\Sigma^+\to n\pi^+$ and $\Sigma^+\to p\pi^0$. These measurements have not reached the standard-model level yet, but have stimulated a renewed interest in $CP$-violating new physics in strange-quark decay beyond what is constrained by the parameters $\varepsilon$ and $\varepsilon^\prime$ from the kaon sector. In this paper, after updating the standard-model expectations for $CP$-odd observables in the modes $\Sigma^\pm\to N\pi$, we revisit new-physics scenarios that could enhance the corresponding quantities in $\Lambda\to N\pi$ and $\Xi\to\Lambda\pi$ and apply them to the $\Sigma^\pm$ modes. We find that the $CP$ asymmetries in the latter can be significantly increased over the standard-model expectations, at levels which may be tested in the ongoing BESIII experiment and in future endeavors such as PANDA and the Super Tau Charm Facility.</description>

      <title>Dark forces suppress structure growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: No experimental test precludes the possibility that the dark matter experiences forces beyond general relativity -- in fact, a variety of cosmic microwave background observations suggest greater late-time structure than predicted in the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model. We show that minimal models of scalar-mediated forces between dark matter particles do not enhance the growth of unbiased tracers of structure: weak lensing observables depend on the total density perturbation, for which the enhanced growth of the density contrast in the matter era is cancelled by the more rapid dilution of the background dark matter density. Moreover, the same background-level effects imply that scenarios compatible with CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies in fact suppress structure growth, as fixing the distance to last scattering requires a substantially increased density of dark energy. Though massive mediators undo these effects upon oscillating, they suppress structure even further because their gravitational impact as nonclustering subcomponents of matter outweighs the enhanced clustering strength of dark matter. We support these findings with analytic insight that clarifies the physical impact of dark forces and explains how primary CMB measurements calibrate the model's predictions for low-redshift observables. We discuss implications for neutrino mass limits and other cosmological anomalies, and we also consider how nonminimal extensions of the model might be engineered to enhance structure.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Thompson optical depth to the CMB from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first constraints on the electron optical depth to reionization, $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$, from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest alone for physically motivated reionization models that match the reionization's end-point, $z_{\rm{end}}$, required by the same astrophysical probe, and for symmetric reionization models with fixed duration, $\Delta z$, commonly adopted in CMB reionization analyses. Compared to traditional estimates from the latter, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest traces the ionization state of the IGM through its coupling with the thermal state. We find an explicit mapping between the two solving the chemistry and temperature evolution equations for hydrogen and helium. Our results yield $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$=$0.042^{+0.047}_{-0.02}$ (95% C.L) and $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$=$0.042^{+0.024}_{-0.015}$ for reionization models with $z_{\rm{end}}$ and $\Delta z$-fixed, respectively, disfavoring a high $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$=0.09 by 2.57$\sigma$ and 4.31$\sigma$. With mock Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data that mimics the precision of future larger quasar sample datasets, we would potentially obtain tighter $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$ constraints and exclude such a high $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$ with a higher significance, paving the way for novel constraints on the epoch of reionization from a large-scale structure probe independent of the CMB.</description>

      <title>Geodesics in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the motion of test particles in quantum-gravitational backgrounds by introducing the concept of q--desics, quantum-corrected analogs of classical geodesics. Unlike standard approaches that rely solely on the expectation value of the spacetime metric, our formulation is based on the expectation value of quantum operators, such as the the affine connection-operator. This allows us to capture richer geometric information. We derive the q--desic equation using both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods and apply it to spherically symmetric static backgrounds obtained from canonical quantum gravity. Exemplary results include, light-like radial motion and circular motion with quantum gravitational corrections far above the Planck scale.
  This framework provides a refined description of motion in quantum spacetimes and opens new directions for probing the interface between quantum gravity and classical general relativity.</description>

      <title>SN 2025coe: A Triple-Peaked Calcium-Strong Transient from A White-Dwarf Progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SN 2025coe is a calcium-strong transient located at an extremely large projected offset $\sim$39.3 kpc from the center of its host, the nearby early-type galaxy NGC 3277 at a distance of $\sim$25.5 Mpc. In this paper, we present multi-band photometric and spectroscopic observations spanning $\sim$100 days post-discovery. Its multi-band light curves display three distinct peaks: (1) an initial peak at $t \approx 1.6$ days attributed to shock cooling emission, (2) a secondary peak of $M_{R, \, peak} \approx$ $-$15.8 mag at $t \approx 10.2$ days powered by radioactive decay, and (3) a late-time bump at $t \approx 42.8$ days likely caused by ejecta-circumstellar material/clump interaction. Spectral evolution of SN 2025coe reveals a fast transition to the nebular phase within 2 months, where it exhibits an exceptionally high [Ca II]/[O I] ratio larger than 6. Modeling of the bolometric light curve suggests an ejecta mass of $M_{\rm ej} = 0.29^{+0.14}_{-0.15} \, M_{\odot}$, a $^{56}$Ni mass of $M_{\rm ^{56}Ni} = 2.4^{+0.06}_{-0.05} \times 10^{-2} M_{\odot}$, and a progenitor envelope with mass $M_e = 1.4^{+6.9}_{-1.2} \times 10^{-3} \, M_{\odot}$ and radius $R_e = 13.5^{+64.1}_{-11.1} \, R_{\odot}$. The tidal disruption of a hybrid HeCO white dwarf (WD) by a low-mass CO WD provides a natural explanation for the low ejecta mass, the small fraction of $^{56}$Ni, and the presence of an extended, low-mass envelope.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective field theories offer a powerful method to unify diverse models under a small set of control parameters, allowing systematic expansions around well-established theories. These techniques, developed in particle physics, were designed for experiments where the initial state - the vacuum before a scattering event - is as clean and isolated as possible. Besides colliders, realistic environments are often noisy and dissipative. The recognition of the limitations of traditional EFT techniques has, over the past decade, sparked intense progress at the interface of high-energy physics and condensed matter. These considerations motivate a new approach to gravitation and cosmology, one that models the gravitational sector as evolving in the presence of an unobservable medium. Open Effective Field Theories provide a systematic and controllable field-theoretic framework for modeling dissipation and noise in gravitation and cosmology. These notes aim to introduce this versatile toolkit, enabling model-agnostic assessments of how unknown environments shape our observational probes.</description>

      <title>Limiting the Parameter Space for Unstable eV-scale Neutrinos Using IceCube Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Letter extends a recent IceCube sterile neutrino search to include unstable sterile neutrinos within the context of a model termed 3+1+Decay, which expands upon the 3+1 model by introducing sterile neutrino decay to invisible particles with coupling constant $g^2$. The model is attractive since it reduces tension between oscillation experiments within the global fits and with constraints that come from cosmological observables. The analysis uses 10.7 years of up-going muon neutrino data with energy 500 GeV to 100 TeV and with improved reconstruction and modeling of systematics. The best-fit point is found to be $g^2 = 0$, $\sin^2(2\theta_{24}) = 0.16$, and $\Delta m^{2}_{41} = 3.5$ eV$^2$, in agreement with the recent 3+1 sterile neutrino search. Values of $g^2 \geq \pi$ are excluded at 95\% confidence level. This result substantially limits decay parameter space indicated by recent global fits, disfavoring the decay scenario.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Pop III.1 Protostars Powered by Dark Matter Annihilation. II. Dependence on WIMP Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid appearance of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at $z\gtrsim7$ requires efficient pathways to form massive black hole seeds. We investigate whether annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) can alter primordial (Pop III.1) protostellar evolution sufficiently to enable formation of such `heavy'' seeds. Using the one-dimensional Geneva stellar-evolution code (GENEC) with an implemented Gould single-scatter capture module, we compute a grid of protostellar evolution models covering ambient WIMP mass densities $\rho_\chi=10^{12}$-$10^{16}\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$, WIMP masses $m_\chi=30$-$3000\ \mathrm{GeV}$, spin-dependent cross sections $\sigma_{\rm SD}=10^{-42}$-$10^{-40}\ \mathrm{cm^2}$, and baryonic accretion rates $\dot{M_*}=(1-3)\times10^{-3}\, M_\odot \,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. We find a robust bifurcation of outcomes. For sufficiently high ambient dark matter density ($\rho_\chi\gtrsim5\times10^{14}\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$) and capture efficiency ($\sigma_{\rm SD}\gtrsim10^{-41}\ \mathrm{cm^2}$) WIMP annihilation supplies enough energy to inflate protostars onto extended, cool (Hayashi-track) configurations that dramatically suppress ionizing feedback and permit uninterrupted growth to $\sim10^{5}\,M_\odot$. Lighter WIMPs and larger $\sigma_{\rm SD}$ favour earlier and stronger annihilation support; heavier WIMPs delay the effect. For our fiducial case, WIMP masses $&lt;$3 TeV are essential for allowing growth to the supermassive regime, otherwise the protostar evolves to the compact, feedback-limited regime that results in `light'' seeds. These results indicate that, under plausible halo conditions, DM annihilation provides a viable channel for forming heavy black hole seeds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics that incorporate phase separation via spinodal decomposition. These equations consider surface effects between the two phases and are applicable for simulating intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions and binary neutron star mergers, where a first-order phase transition is expected. We solve these equations in the context of Bjorken flow, which offers the relevant geometric framework for ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Shadow of black holes with consistent thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum effects in general induce scale dependence in the coupling constants. We explore this possibility in gravity, with a scale-dependent Newton coupling. When applied to Kerr black holes with such a running coupling, the consistency of black hole thermodynamics requires that the Newton coupling have a specific dependence on the black hole parameters. In this work, we consider such a class of Newton couplings and look for the possible observational implications on the highly lensed images of the black holes. In addition to placing constraints on the parameter space of the model through the latest Sgr A* images, we find that the variations in the shape of shadows in a large portion of the parameter space can be qualitatively captured by a quantity solely defined by the event horizon. Most importantly, the consistency of thermodynamics suggests a lower bound on the shadow size, beyond which either horizon disappears, or the shadow cannot keep the standard D-shaped structure. The possibility that the black holes in this model could spin faster than the Kerr bound, and the physical implications of the resulting cuspy shadows, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Diffraction by Circular and Triangular Apertures as a Diagnostic Tool of Twisted Matter Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study diffraction of twisted matter waves (electrons and light ions carrying orbital angular momentum $\ell/\hbar=0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots$ by circular and triangular apertures. Within the scalar Kirchhoff-Fresnel framework, circular apertures preserve cylindrical symmetry and produce ringlike far-field profiles whose radii and widths depend on $|\ell|$ but are insensitive to its sign. In contrast, equilateral triangles break axial symmetry and yield structured patterns that encode both the magnitude and the sign of $\ell$. A transparent Fraunhofer mapping links detector coordinates to the Fourier plane, explaining the $(|\ell|+1)$-lobe rule and the sign-dependent rotation of the pattern. We validate these results for both ideal Bessel beams and localized Laguerre-Gaussian packets, and we cross-check them by split-step Fourier propagation of the time-dependent Schr"odinger equation. From these analyses we extract practical design rules (Fraunhofer distance, lattice pitch, detector sampling) relevant to OAM diagnostics with moderately relativistic electrons with $E_{\rm kin}\sim0.1$ to $5$ MeV and light ions with $E_{\rm kin}\sim0.1$ to $1$ MeV/u. Our results establish triangular diffraction as a simple, passive, and robust method for reading out the OAM content of structured quantum beams.</description>

      <title>Alleviating Cosmological Tensions with the Hadrosymmetric Twin Higgs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hadrosymmetric Twin Higgs (HTH) model provides a natural solution to the little hierarchy problem by incorporating all three generations of quarks in a twin sector. Unlike other Twin Higgs scenarios, such as the Mirror Twin Higgs (MTH), the HTH framework avoids introducing additional light states or radiation and thus remains consistent with stringent bounds on the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Its particle content and interactions also make it difficult to probe at colliders, highlighting the importance of cosmological tests. In this work, we study the cosmological implications of the HTH model, focusing on the persistent tensions in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the matter clustering amplitude ($\sigma_8$). Implementing the HTH sector in a Boltzmann code and confronting it with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and local $H_0$ measurements, we find that the scenario reduces the Hubble tension from more than $4\sigma$ to about $2.5\sigma$, while also alleviating the $\sigma_8$ discrepancy. These results demonstrate that the HTH framework not only addresses naturalness in particle physics but also offers a viable route to mitigating current cosmological tensions, thereby strengthening the link between fundamental theory and precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves sourced by Gauge Fields during Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the inflationary gravitational wave background induced by Abelian gauge fields generated by non-minimal kinetic and axial couplings to the inflaton. We show that the gravitational wave spectrum is scale invariant and derive its amplitude for generic gauge field coupling parameters, within the slow-roll approximation. We constrain the coupling values and the scale of inflation for which the induced gravitational wave background is observable, while ensuring that back-reaction on the inflationary dynamics remains negligible. We find that a sizeable axial coupling can boost this secondary gravitational wave signal above the standard inflationary background. In the course of our analysis, we also show how to analytically match tensor perturbations across an arbitrary number of eras with different equations of state.</description>

      <title>GW250114 reveals black hole horizon signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The horizon of a black hole, the "surface of no return," is characterized by its rotation frequency $\Omega_H$ and surface gravity $\kappa$. A striking signature is that any infalling object appears to orbit at $\Omega_H$ due to frame dragging, while its emitted signals decay exponentially at a rate set by $\kappa$ as a consequence of gravitational redshift. Recent theoretical work predicts that the merger phase of gravitational waves from binary black hole coalescences carries direct imprints of the remnant horizon's properties, via a "direct wave" component that (i) oscillates near $2\Omega_H$, reflecting the horizon's frame dragging and the quadrupole nature of the gravitational radiation, and (ii) decays at an increasing rate characterized by $\kappa$, with additional screening from the black hole's potential barrier. In this paper, we report observational evidence for the direct wave in GW250114 with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of $14.0^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ ($13.5^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$) in the LIGO Hanford (Livingston) detector. The measured properties are in full agreement with theoretical predictions. These findings establish a new observational channel to directly measure frame-dragging effects in black hole ergospheres and explore (near-)horizon physics in dynamical, strong-gravity regimes.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Acts: Quantifying Black Hole Formation with the DSNB Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) created by stellar core-collapses throughout cosmic history is on the verge of discovery, with SK-Gd showing early deviations from the background expectation and JUNO starting to take data. However, the interpretation of early DSNB data will face significant challenges due to degeneracies between astrophysical parameters and uncertainties in supernova neutrino modeling. We explore how complementary astronomical observations can break these degeneracies and, in this context, we investigate whether early DSNB observations can constrain invisible supernovae, which have no optical emission but are powerful neutrino sources before being swallowed by a forming black hole. Leveraging the differences in the spectra between invisible and visible supernovae, we estimate the sensitivity of 1) detecting the existence of invisible supernovae, and 2) determining the fraction of invisible supernovae. Finally, we discuss how these conclusions depend on the spectral parameters of the black hole-forming component.</description>

Abstract: Semi-inclusive hadron production in longitudinally polarized deep-inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering is a powerful tool for resolving the quark flavor decomposition of the proton's spin structure. We present the full next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to the coefficient functions of polarized semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) in analytical form, enabling the use of SIDIS measurements in precision studies of the proton spin structure. The numerical impact of these corrections is illustrated by a comparison with data of polarized single-inclusive hadron spectra from the DESY HERMES and CERN COMPASS experiments.</description>

Abstract: For the $N$-point energy correlator in the collinear limit, the largest projected angle $R$ in the large $N$ limit can be viewed as the radius of the jet that encompasses all the collinear core particles, while contributions from soft gluons to the radius are suppressed. We relate the $N$-point energy correlator in the large $N$ limit to the moments of the fragmentation functions to a jet, and, using previous work, we compare the difference between jets initiated by heavy quarks and light quarks. This comparison reveals the deadcone effect.</description>

      <title>Searching for a squark LSP of the first two families at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse relevant signals expected at the LHC for a squark of the first two families as the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The discussion is established in the framework of the $\mu\nu$SSM, where the presence of $R$-parity violating couplings involving right-handed neutrinos solves simultaneously the $\mu$-problem and the accommodation of neutrino masses and mixing angles. The squarks are pair produced and decay dominantly to a neutrino and a quark. They also have two sub-dominant three body decays to quark, Higgs and neutrino/charged lepton. The decays can be prompt or displaced, depending on the regions of the parameter space of the model. We focus the analyses on squarks of right up-type, right down-type, and left up-type; since squarks of left down-type cannot be the LSP because of D-term contributions. We compare the predictions of these scenarios with ATLAS and CMS searches for prompt and long-lived particles. To analyse the parameter space we sample the $\mu\nu$SSM for a squark LSP, paying special attention to reproduce the current experimental data on neutrino and Higgs physics, as well as flavour observables. Because of the contribution of squark-squark final states to the production cross section, the results depend on the squark family. In particular, for a right strange squark LSP, the lower limit on the mass is $1646$ GeV, corresponding to an upper limit on the decay length of $54.7$ mm, and for a right (left) scharm LSP, the limits are $1625$ ($1357$) GeV and $13.4$ ($1.9$) mm. However, the first family of squarks as LSP turns out to be excluded, unless the gluino is heavier than $7$ TeV, which produces a limit on the squark mass of $1800$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Flavour-Dependent Chemical Freeze-Out of Light Nuclei in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the production of light nuclei in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 7.7 - 200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV within a flavour-dependent freeze-out framework, assuming different flavoured hadrons undergo separate chemical freeze-out. Using the Thermal-FIST package, thermal parameters extracted from fits to various sets of hadron yields, including and excluding light nuclei, are used to calculate the ratios of the yields of light nuclei, namely, $d/p$, $\bar{d}/\bar{p}$, $t/p$, and $t/d$. A comparison with data from the STAR and ALICE collaborations shows that a sequential freeze-out scenario provides a better description of light nuclei yield ratios than the traditional single freeze-out approach. These results suggest the flavour-dependent chemical freeze-out for final state light-nuclei production persists in heavy-ion collisions at both RHIC and LHC energies.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic decays of $\Lambda^{+}_{c}$ in light-front quark model with nonvalence contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the exclusive semilpetonic decays of $\Lambda^{+}_{c}\to (\Lambda/n) \ell^{+} \nu_{\ell}~(\ell=e,\mu)$ within the standard model by using the light-front quark model (LFQM). The form factor behaviors are obtained from the effective treatment of nonvalence contributions in addition to the valence ones in the Drell-Yan-West frame due to the Bethe-Salpeter formalism. Based on these form factors, we find that the decay branching ratios of $\Lambda^{+}_{c}\to (\Lambda e^{+} \nu_{e},\,\Lambda \mu^{+} \nu_{e} ,\, n e^{+} \nu_{e},\, n \mu^{+} \nu_{e})$ are about $ (3.39,\,3.21,\,0.36,\,0.35)\%$ with the non-valence contributions, which are consistent with the recent experimental measurements at BESIII. Furthermore, we use the experimental data to fit the $\beta$ parameters in the baryonic distribution amplitudes under the LFQM, resulting in ($\beta_{\Lambda_{c}},\beta_{\Lambda}, \beta_{n})= (0.58\pm0.08, 0.52\pm0.08,0.44\pm0.04)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study general properties of confinement phase transitions in the early universe. An observable gravitational wave signal from such transitions requires significant supercooling. However, in almost all understood examples of confining gauge theories the degree of supercooling is too small to give interesting gravitational wave signals. We review and highlight the evidence why supercooling is not generic in confining gauge theories. The exceptions are Randall-Sundrum models which define a strongly coupled gauge theory holographically by a 5D gravitational theory. We construct a simple illustrative model of a 4D gauge theory inspired by features of the Randall-Sundrum model. It is a large-$N$ gauge theory in the conformal window coupled to a weakly coupled scalar field which undergoes a supercooled phase transition that breaks the conformal symmetry and triggers confinement. We show that there are interesting features in the gravitational wave spectra that can carry the imprint of the confining gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Hidden valley scenario sensitivity in the CMS muon endcap detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the sensitivity of the CMS search to displaced showers arising from the decays of long-lived particles in the muon system, within the framework of Hidden Valley scenarios. To establish our simulation setup, we employ a parameterization of Hidden Valley theory space and adopt a hybrid strategy where the lifetime is treated as a free parameter to provide model-independent Hidden Valley quark production cross-section upper limits. Our results indicate that the CMS search is broadly sensitive to variations in Hidden Valley parameters such as the overall scale and relevant mass ratios, while showing comparatively weak dependence on the number of Hidden Valley colors or flavors. The exact quantitative results we derive depend on the underlying hadronization model employed and thus, we urge caution in interpreting the results. Within these limitations, we also establish model-dependent limits on the maximum strength of the mediator coupling to Hidden Valley quarks. Our approach illustrates how one can move beyond simplified model strategies by employing a first-principles-inspired theory setup, while highlighting the theoretical uncertainties inherent in modeling Hidden Valley phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Effective ALP-Photon Coupling in External Magnetic Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We presented a complete calculation of the one-loop fermionic correction to the effective coupling between axion-like particles (ALPs) and photons within a constant, homogeneous magnetic field of arbitrary strength. This interaction, responsible for the Primakoff effect, is central to detecting axion-like particles in astrophysical settings and terrestrial experiments like helioscopes and haloscopes. Accurately predicting the interaction rate requires accounting for quantum corrections. Our work tackles this by employing magnetically field-dressed fermion propagators derived using Schwinger's proper time method and a systematic Lorentz decomposition using the Ritus basis. We evaluate the triangle loop diagram exactly, and compare it to approximations on field strength under specific assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light scalar or vector particles are among the most studied dark matter candidates. Yet, those are always described as scalar or vector fields. In this paper, we explore instead the embedding of the scalar particle in an antisymmetric rank-three tensor field, and the dark photon into an antisymmetric rank-two tensor field (a so-called Kalb-Ramond field), and construct minimal bases of effective interactions with Standard Model fields. Then, keeping phenomenological applications as our main objective, a number of theoretical aspects are clarified, in particular related to the impact of existing dualities among the corresponding free theories, and concerning their Stueckelberg representations. Besides, for the rank-two field, we present for the first time its full propagator, accounting for the possible presence of a pseudoscalar mass term. Thanks to these results, and with their different kinematics, gauge-invariant limits, and Lorentz properties, we show that these higher-form fields provide genuine alternative frameworks, with different couplings and expected signatures at low-energy or at colliders.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of pions, kaons and nucleons from dispersion relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational form factors of pions, kaons and the nucleons are investigated by employing modern dispersive techniques and chiral perturbation theory. We determine the gravitational form factors of pions and kaons, extending our analysis to explore the pion mass dependence of these form factors at several unphysical pion masses up to 391 MeV, for which lattice results exist for the meson-meson scattering phase shifts. We also review our analysis on the nucleon gravitational form factors at the physical pion mass, and then systematically calculate various three-dimensional spatial and two-dimensional transverse density distributions for the nucleons. These results provide new insights into the mass distribution inside nucleons. As a by-product, we match our dispersion relation results and those obtained from chiral perturbation theory with external gravitational source at the next-to-next-to-leading order, yielding values for the low-energy constants $c_8=-4.28_{-0.38}^{+0.37} ~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ and $c_9=-0.68_{-0.05}^{+0.06} ~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$. These results offer a robust benchmark for future experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Structure of the $\Omega^{-}(2012)$ with Hamiltonian Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the internal structure of the $\Omega(2012)^-$ by analyzing lattice QCD simulation and experimental data within Hamiltonian effective field theory, considering both $J^P = 1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$ assignments. The couplings to the dominant decay channel $\Xi \bar{K}$ and the near-threshold channel $\Xi(1530) \bar{K}$ are determined through the quark-pair-creation model. By studying the lattice QCD spectra in these two spin-parity scenarios, we extract the masses and widths of the resonances. We notice that the $J^P = 3/2^-$ resonance is consistent with the observed $\Omega(2012)^-$ while the recently reported $\Omega(2109)^-$ may be a $J^P = 1/2^-$ $\Omega$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00018v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a modular reconstruction of the transition generalized parton distribution (GPD) H_T(x,t) for the Delta(1232) resonance, based on digitized helicity amplitude data and dipole fits to A_1/2(Q^2). From the fitted amplitude, we extract a Sachs-like form factor F(t) and define a separable GPD model H_T(x, t) = h(x)F(t), with h(x) modeled as a normalized Beta-like profile. This factorized ansatz satisfies the GPD sum rule and enables a direct two-dimensional Fourier transform to construct transverse spatial distributions q(x,b). We analyze how longitudinal shaping modulates transverse localization, and quantify spatial features using statistical diagnostics including mean radius, skewness, and kurtosis. The framework is reproducible, data-driven, and applicable to other transition channels, providing a physically interpretable map from amplitude behavior to spatial structure.</description>

      <title>Energy Correlators in Semi-Inclusive Electron-Positron Annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate energy correlators in semi-inclusive electron-positron annihilation as precision probes of parton hadronization dynamics. Using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), we analyze the correlation patterns between the examined hadron and the rest of QCD radiations in both large-angle and small-angle limits, which establishes a direct correspondence with Transverse-Momentum-Dependent Fragmentation Functions (TMD FFs) and Fragmentation Energy Correlators (FECs). The two complementary regimes encode the transition from perturbative parton branching to nonperturbative confinement, enabling a unified description of hadron formation across all kinematic regimes. Using renormalization group evolution, we obtain joint N3LL/NNLL quantitative predictions for energy correlations both in the sudakov and jet fragmentation region (JFR). Our results demonstrate that semi-inclusive ECs provide direct, theoretically controlled access to QCD dynamics underlying hadronization, opening new avenues for precision studies at future lepton colliders.</description>

Abstract: We compute the twist-2 matching of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) helicity parton distribution and fragmentation functions at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) in QCD. This calculation entails the complete set of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) splitting functions govering the evolution of helicity-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs). Within TMD factorization framework, we quantify the impact of radiative corrections by completing the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N$^3$LL) prediction for lepton-hadron transverse momentum imbalance in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS). Our results provide the most precise theoretical input for probing the helicity structure and confined motion of quarks and gluons at future electron-ion collider (EIC).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) calculation of the twist-2 matching coefficients for transverse momentum dependent (TMD) quark transversity parton distribution and fragmentation functions in QCD. This matching relates the TMD quark transversity functions to their collinear counterparts in the large-transverse-momentum regime, and provides essential ingredients for precision TMD phenomenology involving transversely polarized beams. As part of our analysis, we also compute the complete set of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) DGLAP splitting functions governing the QCD evolution of collinear transversity distributions. These results extend the perturbative toolkit for spin-dependent observables and establish the transversity sector on the same theoretical footing as unpolarized and helicity distributions. Our findings enable high-precision extractions of transversity PDFs and facilitate improved theoretical predictions for azimuthal asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS), especially in light of forthcoming data from the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).</description>

      <title>Non-extensive NJL model study of QCD phase structure with chiral imbalance and strong magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the two-flavor NJL model with Tsallis non-extensive statistics, this work explores the QCD phase structure and thermodynamic properties under strong magnetic fields and chiral imbalance. The Tsallis parameter $q$ captures non-equilibrium effects relevant to heavy-ion collisions. Key findings reveal that the pseudocritical temperature $T_{\textrm{pc}} $ decreases with increasing $q$, indicating that non-equilibrium conditions promote chiral symmetry restoration at lower temperatures. The chiral chemical potential $\mu_5 $ significantly alters the magnetic response, with a transition from magnetic catalysis to inverse magnetic catalysis under certain conditions. For $q &gt; 1$, non-monotonic behavior of $T_{\textrm{pc}}$ with magnetic field $eB$ emerges. Pressure becomes anisotropic under strong $eB$, and the speed of sound exhibits a dip near $T_{\textrm{pc}}$, shifting to lower temperatures with larger $q$. These results highlight how non-extensive statistics, chiral imbalance, and magnetic fields collectively influence the QCD phase diagram and thermodynamic observables, offering insights for interpreting heavy-ion collision data.</description>

      <title>Slaying Axion-Like Particles via Gravitational Waves and Primordial Black Holes from Supercooled Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from density fluctuations due to supercooled phase transitions (PTs) triggered in an axion-like particle (ALP) model. We find that the mass of the PBHs is inversely correlated with the ALP decay constant $f_a$. For instance, for $f_a$ varying from ${\cal O}$(100 MeV) to ${\cal O}$($10^{12}$ GeV), the PBH mass varies between $(10^{3} - 10^{-24}) M_{\odot}$. We then identify the ALP parameter space where the PBH can account for the entire (or partial) dark matter fraction of the Universe, in a single (multi-component) dark matter scenario, with the ALP being the other dark matter candidate. The PBH parameter space ruled out by current cosmological and microlensing observations can thus be directly mapped onto the ALP parameter space, thus providing new bounds on ALPs, complementary to the laboratory and astrophysical ALP constraints. Similarly, depending on the ALP couplings to other Standard Model particles, the ALP constraints on $f_a$ can be translated into a lower bound on the PBH mass scale. Moreover, the supercooled PT leads to a potentially observable stochastic gravitational wave (GW) signal at future GW observatories, such as aLIGO, LISA and ET, that acts as another complementary probe of the ALPs, as well as of the PBH dark matter. Finally, we show that the recent NANOGrav signal of stochastic GW in the nHz frequency range can be explained in our model with $f_a\simeq (10~{\rm GeV}-1~{\rm TeV})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nucleation rate computations are of broad importance in particle physics and cosmology. Perturbative calculations are often used to compute the nucleation rate $\Gamma$, but these are incomplete. We perform nonperturbative lattice simulations of nucleation in a scalar field theory with a tree-level barrier, computing a final result extrapolated to the thermodynamic and continuum limits. Although the system in question should be well-described by a complete one-loop perturbative calculation, we find only qualitative agreement with the full perturbative result, with a 20% discrepancy in $|\log \Gamma|$. Our result motivates further testing of the current nucleation paradigm.</description>

      <title>The spectra of a radiative reprocessing outflow model for fast blue optical transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation reprocessing model, in which an optically-thick outflow absorbs the high-energy emission from a central source and re-emits in longer wavelengths, has been frequently invoked to explain some optically bright transients, such as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) whose progenitor and explosion mechanism are still unknown. Previous studies on this model did not take into account the frequency dependence of the opacity. We study the radiative reprocessing and calculate the UV-optical-NIR band spectra from a spherical outflow composed of pure hydrogen gas, for a time-dependent outflowing mass rate. Electron scattering and frequency-dependent bound-free, free-free opacities are considered. The spectrum deviates from the blackbody at NIR and UV frequencies; in particular, it has $\nu L_{\nu} \propto \nu^{1.5}$ at NIR frequencies, because at these frequencies the absorption optical depth from the outflow's outer edge to the so-called photon trapping radius is large and is frequency dependent. We apply our model to the proto-type FBOT AT2018cow by {the spectra} to the observed SED. The best-fit mass loss rate suggests that the total outflow mass in AT2018cow is $M_{\rm out} \approx 5.7^{+0.4}_{-0.4} \, M_{\odot}$. If that equals the total mass lost during an explosion, and if the progenitor is a blue supergiant (with a pre-explosion mass of $\sim 20 \, M_{\odot}$), then it will suggest that the central compact remnant mass is at least $\approx \, \rm{14 \, M_{\odot}}$. This would imply that the central remnant is a black hole.</description>

      <title>Increase of $n_s$ in regularized pole inflation &amp; Einstein-Cartan gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the regularization of the second order pole in the pole inflation can induce the increase of $n_s$, which may be important after the latest data release of cosmic microwave background (CMB) observation by Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Pole inflation is known to provide a unified description of attractor models that they can generate a flat plateau for inflation given a general potential. Recent ACT observation suggests that the constraint on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ at CMB scale may be shifted to a larger value than the predictions in the Starobinsky model, the Higgs inflation, and the $\alpha$-attractor model, which motivates us to consider the modification of the pole inflation. We find that if we regularize the second order pole in the kinetic term such that the kinetic term becomes regular for all field range, we can generally increase $n_s$ because the potential in the large field regime will be lifted. We have explicitly demonstrated that this type of regularized pole inflation can naturally arise from the Einstein-Cartan formalism, and the inflationary predictions are consistent with the latest ACT data without spoiling the success of the $\alpha$-attractor models.</description>

      <title>Tidal effects on primordial black hole capture in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of the capture of a primordial black hole (PBH) by a neutron star, accounting for the tidal perturbation from a nearby star or planet. For asteroid-mass PBHs, which could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe, a weakly bound post-capture orbit could be tidally disturbed to the point of preventing the PBH from settling in the neutron star and consuming it within a cosmologically short timescale. We show how this effect depends on environmental parameters and can weaken the proposed constraints based on observations of old neutron stars in high-density dark matter environments for PBH masses $\lesssim 10^{22}\,$g. We also provide approximate analytical formulae for the capture rates.</description>

      <title>Axion electrodynamics of Weyl superconductors with broken time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy effective description of Weyl semimetals is defined by the axion electrodynamics, which captures the effects arising due to the presence of nodes of opposite chirality in the electronic structure. Here we explore the magnetoelectric response of time-reversal breaking (TRB) Weyl superconductors in the London regime. The influence of the axion contribution leads to an increase in the London penetration depth$-$a behavior that can be anticipated by first considering the photon spectrum of a TRB Weyl semimetal. Moreover, we find that both the Meissner state and the vortex phase feature an interplay between the electric and magnetic fields. This leads to a nonvanishing electromagnetic angular momentum, which we calculate for a number of geometrical configurations.</description>

      <title>Fermionic S-matrix and cosmological correlators: T-violation at O(H)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Bunch-Davies (BD) and Unruh-de Witt (UdW) de Sitter S-matrices in the presence of spin-$1/2$ fermions. Building on recent work, this enables us to correlate the de Sitter S-matrix with cosmological correlators. We consider a finite-time version of the UdW S-matrix to study $O(H)$ corrections to some typical particle physics processes such as beta decay. Owing to the lack of time-reversal symmetry in the expanding Poincar\'e patch, we find signatures of intrinsic T-violation in polarized beta decay. The observable we study begins at $O(H)$. The possibility of T-violation was examined theoretically in the 1950's by Jackson, Treiman, and Wyld in flat space and has been probed more recently in the emiT experiment, with the purpose of examining fundamental T-violation coming from additional interactions in the Lagrangian. Our analysis places a lower bound on the intrinsic T-violation in the expanding Poincar\'e patch. At $O(H)$, we find both energy conserving and energy non-conserving contributions. Surprisingly, the energy-violating piece, in principle, can give large T-violation at fine-tuned values of the kinematical variables.</description>

      <title>Instability of regular planar black holes in four dimensions arising from an infinite sum of curvature corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In four-dimensional scalar-tensor theories derived via dimensional regularization with a conformal rescaling of the metric, we study the stability of planar black holes (BHs) whose horizons are described by two-dimensional compact Einstein spaces with vanishing curvature. By taking an infinite sum of Lovelock curvature invariants, it is possible to construct BH solutions whose metric components remain nonsingular at $r=0$, with a scalar-field derivative given by $\phi'(r)=1/r$, where $r$ is the radial coordinate. We show that such BH solutions suffer from a strong coupling problem, where the kinetic term of the even-parity scalar-field perturbation associated with the timelike coordinate vanishes everywhere. Moreover, we find that these BHs are subject to both ghost and Laplacian instabilities for odd-parity perturbations near $r=0$. Consequently, the presence of these pathological features rules out regular planar BHs with the scalar-field profile $\phi'(r)=1/r$ as physically viable and stable configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute template formulae of all four-loop $\beta$-functions and anomalous dimensions of arbitrary renormalisable quantum field theories with fermions and scalar fields in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme. Using these results, novel contributions to the $\beta$-functions of the Higgs and top coupling are extracted. We discuss how four loops present a challenge to dimensional continuation from four to three dimensions and propose a solution.</description>

      <title>Probing Nucleon-$\Omega_{\rm ccc}$Interaction via Lattice QCD at Physical Quark Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the S-wave interactions between the nucleon ($N$) and the triply charmed Omega baryon ($\Omega_{\mathrm{ccc}}$) using (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD with a physical pion mass ($m_\pi \simeq 137.1$ MeV) on a lattice volume $\simeq (8.1~\mathrm{fm})^3$. The charm quark is implemented with a relativistic heavy-quark action at its physical mass. Employing the time-dependent HAL QCD method, the $N$-$\Omega_{\mathrm{ccc}}$ potentials in the spin-1 ($^3\mathrm{S}_1$) and spin-2 ($^5\mathrm{S}_2$) channels are extracted. In both channels, overall attraction is found with the scattering parameters, $a_0 = 0.56(0.13)\left(^{+0.26}_{-0.03}\right)$ fm and $r_{\mathrm{eff}} = 1.60(0.05)\left(^{+0.04}_{-0.12}\right)$ fm for the $^3\mathrm{S}_1$ channel, and
  $a_0 = 0.38(0.12)\left(^{+0.25}_{-0.00}\right)$ fm and $r_{\mathrm{eff}} = 2.04(0.10)\left(^{+0.03}_{-0.22}\right)$ fm for the $^5\mathrm{S}_2$ channel, indicating the absence of a dibaryon bound state. The extracted potentials are further decomposed into spin-independent and spin-dependent components. The spin-independent potential is a dominant component and features a short-range attractive core and a long-range attractive tail, while the spin-dependent potential shows short-range attraction (repulsion) in the spin-1 (spin-2) channel. Qualitative comparisons with previous studies of the $N$-$J/\psi$ and $N$-$\Omega_{\rm{sss}}$ systems at $m_\pi \simeq 146$ MeV are provided, emphasizing the role of heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability arising from soft-gluon exchange between the nucleon and flavor-singlet hadrons. The charm quark mass dependence of the $N$-$\Omega_{\rm ccc}$ potential is investigated as well.</description>

      <title>Imprints of screened dark energy on nonlocal quantum correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed via their impact on non-local quantum correlations between entangled spin pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by General Relativity (GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedankenexperiment featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating their non-local correlations through spin observables associated to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging, our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through quantum non-locality.</description>
