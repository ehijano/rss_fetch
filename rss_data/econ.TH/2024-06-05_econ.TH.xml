      <title>Monotone Equilibrium Design for Matching Markets with Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study monotone equilibrium design by a planner who chooses an interval of reactions that receivers take before senders and receivers move in matching markets with signaling. In our nonlinear settings, surplus efficiency frontier is convex with decreasing-returns-to-scale information technology. The optimal reaction interval crucially depends on the ripple effect of its lower bound and the trade-off between matching inefficiency and signaling cost savings in the top pooling region generated by its upper bound. Our analysis generates cohesive market design results that integrate the literature on minimum wage, firm size distribution, and relative risk aversion.</description>

      <title>The Persuasion Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.11392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified duality approach to Bayesian persuasion. The optimal dual variable, interpreted as a price function on the state space, is shown to be a supergradient of the concave closure of the objective function at the prior belief. Strong duality holds when the objective function is Lipschitz continuous.
  When the objective depends on the posterior belief through a set of moments, the price function induces prices for posterior moments that solve the corresponding dual problem. Thus, our general approach unifies known results for one-dimensional moment persuasion, while yielding new results for the multi-dimensional case. In particular, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the optimality of convex-partitional signals, derive structural properties of solutions, and characterize the optimal persuasion scheme in the case when the state is two-dimensional and the objective is quadratic.</description>

      <title>Comparing experiments in discounted problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper compares statistical experiments in discounted problems, ranging from the simplest ones where the state is fixed and the flow of information exogenous to more complex ones, where the decision-maker controls the flow of information or the state changes over time.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Population Games: A Tractable Intersection of Mean-Field Games and Population Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.14662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many real-world large-scale decision problems, self-interested agents have individual dynamics and optimize their own long-term payoffs. Important examples include the competitive access to shared resources (e.g., roads, energy, or bandwidth) but also non-engineering domains like epidemic propagation and control. These problems are natural to model as mean-field games. Existing mathematical formulations of mean field games have had limited applicability in practice, since they require solving non-standard initial-terminal-value problems that are tractable only in limited special cases. In this letter, we propose a novel formulation, along with computational tools, for a practically relevant class of Dynamic Population Games (DPGs), which correspond to discrete-time, finite-state-and-action, stationary mean-field games. Our main contribution is a mathematical reduction of Stationary Nash Equilibria (SNE) in DPGs to standard Nash Equilibria (NE) in static population games. This reduction is leveraged to guarantee the existence of a SNE, develop an evolutionary dynamics-based SNE computation algorithm, and derive simple conditions that guarantee stability and uniqueness of the SNE. We provide two examples of applications: fair resource allocation with heterogeneous agents and control of epidemic propagation.

      <title>Voting power in the Council of the European Union: A comprehensive sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Council of the European Union (EU) is one of the main decision-making bodies of the EU. Many decisions require a qualified majority: the support of 55% of the member states (currently 15) that represent at least 65% of the total population. We investigate how the power distribution, based on the Shapley-Shubik index, and the proportion of winning coalitions change if these criteria are modified within reasonable bounds. The power of the two countries with about 4% of the total population each is found to be almost flat. The level of decisiveness decreases if the population criterion is above 68\% or the states criterion is at least 17. The proportion of winning coalitions can be increased from 13.2% to 20.8% (30.1%) such that the maximal relative change in the Shapley-Shubik indices remains below 3.5% (5.5%). Our results are indispensable to evaluate any proposal for reforming the qualified majority voting system.</description>

      <title>Voting with Partial Orders: The Plurality and Anti-Plurality Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Plurality rule for linear orders selects the alternatives most frequently appearing in the first position of those orders, while the Anti-Plurality rule selects the alternatives least often occurring in the final position. We explore extensions of these rules to partial orders, offering axiomatic characterizations for these extensions.</description>
