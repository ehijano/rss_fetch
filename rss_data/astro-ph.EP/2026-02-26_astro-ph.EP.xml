      <title>Rattle-and-Break: the Impact of Planetesimal Scattering on Super-Earth Resonant Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spacings of super-Earths in multi-transiting systems exhibit a distribution that is broad and mostly featureless, with the exception of notable excesses of planet pairs situated a few percent wide of first-order mean motion resonances (MMRs). In this work, we extend the so-called "breaking-the-chains" model to account for both of these characteristics. Assuming that super-Earths are settled into stable chains of resonances after disk-driven migration, we show that scattering a planetesimal population that contains only a few percent of a system's mass can reorganize primordial chains in remarkable ways. The planetesimal scattering "rattles" the chains by repelling adjacent planet pairs wide of their initial MMRs. Some chains remain rattled but otherwise intact and make up the observed excesses wide of MMRs. In other systems, however, this initial rattling sows the seeds of later orbital instabilities that break the chains entirely. If individual planetesimals' masses are of order a Pluto mass or so, the onset of these instabilities can occur tens or hundreds of Myr after birth, naturally explaining the apparent disappearance of near-resonant pairs on this timescale. The origin of such Pluto-mass debris is currently unknown.</description>

      <title>Formation of Water-rich Giant Planet Satellites at Decretion Disk Ice Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The volatile budgets of giant planet satellites are critical to unraveling the origin of their building blocks within the circumplanetary disks that hosted them. The Galilean moons Ganymede and Callisto, as well as the Saturnian moon Titan, are known to be anomalously water rich on the basis of their mean densities and interior models informed by gravity data from Galileo and Cassini, characterized by ice-to-rock ratios around unity. Here, we show that the water-ice sublimation line in a decreting circumplanetary disk lends itself to the formation of a water-rich solid reservoir, serving as a natural site for the birthplace of icy satellites. Fundamentally, this reflects how interior to the ice line, water vapor is advected outward, while beyond it, water ice drifts inward as pebbles. Using a semi-analytic model for dust and vapor evolution, we simulate vapor and ice accumulation at the ice line, showing that solids just beyond it achieve steady-state ice-to-rock ratios a factor of a few higher than elsewhere in the disk. For typical disk parameters, this ice buildup occurs within a timescale of a few thousand years. We propose this as a first-order process that explains, at least to some extent, the compositions of three aforementioned satellites. We explore the impact of uncertain turbulence parameters on our results, namely the turbulent Schmidt number and Shakura-Sunyaev alpha, before discussing them in the context of icy satellite D/H ratios. We conclude by evaluating alternative scenarios for explaining water-rich satellites, based on the conversion of CO to CH4, with water as a by-product.</description>

      <title>HATPI Pre-Perihelion Time-series Photometry of the Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HATPI is a recently commissioned time-domain facility at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile, that uses 64 wide-angle, 9.6 cm diameter lenses and back-illuminated CCDs, yielding a mosaic field-of-view of 7,100 square arcdegrees, observing the night sky at a cadence of 45 s and a spatial scale of 19.7 arcsec pixel$^{-1}$. In this paper, we present moving object time-series photometry with this facility, focusing on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. 3I/ATLAS was first robustly recovered by HATPI on the night of 2025 July 2 (one night after its discovery) at a Gaia $G$-band magnitude of $G = 17.796 \pm 0.082$ mag ($\pm 0.030$ mag systematic uncertainty). The comet then increased in brightness to $G = 14.071 \pm 0.073$ mag $\pm 0.030$ mag by 2025 Sep 13, after which it became unobservable by HATPI as it approached perihelion. Before 3I/ATLAS achieved a brightness of $G = 16.396 \pm 0.029$ mag $\pm 0.030$ mag on 2025 Aug 6, it could be detected when stacking all HATPI observations from a single night, while after this date it is sufficiently bright to detect in individual 45 s exposures. We do not detect evidence for significant short-time-scale variations in the brightness of 3I/ATLAS after Aug 6. Compared to other light curves in the literature, the HATPI photometry exhibits a somewhat steeper rise in brightness with decreasing heliocentric distance, $r_{H}$. The HATPI magnitudes are well-fit as a power law function of $r_{H}$, with an exponential index of $n = 5.167 \pm 0.095$, over the range $2.14$ AU $ &lt; r_{H} &lt; 4.44$ AU, compared to $n = 3.94 \pm 0.10$ when fitting together with other literature observations. We find that the phase function is constrained to $\beta = 0.0552 \pm 0.0032$ mag deg$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruptions of rubble piles: The case of Phobos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many small satellites in the Solar System have sub-synchronous orbits, meaning their orbits are decaying due to tidal dissipation. Unless they have substantial material strength, they will eventually tidally disrupt before reaching their planet's surface. We studied the fate of rubble-pile satellites as they migrate inward, with a particular focus on the case of Phobos. We used a combination of analytic estimates and numerical simulations to determine the failure mode and tidal disruption distance of a Phobos-like satellite, as a function of its shape and cohesive strength. Both analytically and numerically, we identify a regime for satellites with low cohesive strengths whereby their surface can be tidally stripped without undergoing internal failure. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that Phobos will be destroyed beyond 2 Mars radii if it has a bulk strength similar to those estimated for small bodies recently visited by spacecraft. Based on our results and some additional arguments, we suggest that previous studies on the fate of Phobos have overestimated its strength, and therefore underestimated its tidal disruption distance. We also speculate that if Phobos undergoes some tidal stripping, its ultimate fate may be determined by runaway collisional erosion rather than a pure tidal disruption. However, the ultimate tidal disruption distance for Phobos will depend on its unknown internal structure and bulk material properties, which will be constrained by JAXA's Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission and its IDEFIX rover. These results have implications for theories about the origin and evolution of the Martian moons and for tidal disruptions of other small, irregularly shaped satellites.</description>

      <title>Survival of Protoplanetary Disks in Upper Scorpius from Population Synthesis Models with External Photoevaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present population synthesis models of viscous protoplanetary disks subject to mild external far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation fields ($F_{\rm UV}=1\text{-}100\,$G$_0$). Our simulations focus on gas disk evolution, exploring stellar masses drawn from an Initial Mass Function and a range of initial disk conditions. We quantify the fraction of surviving disks across $10\,\mathrm{Myr}$ of evolution, track the evolution of gas disk mass and size, and compare our results with observations of protoplanetary disks in the Upper Scorpius region, including the ten targets studied by the AGE-PRO ALMA Large Program. We find that models combining viscous evolution with external photoevaporation yield disk lifetimes of $3\text{-}7\,\mathrm{Myr}$, consistent with observed dispersal timescales, particularly for $10^{-4} \leq \alpha \leq 10^{-2}$. Low-mass stars ($0.1\,$M$_\odot$) are more susceptible to disk dispersal due to their weaker gravitational binding, with their fraction among all surviving disks dropping from $76\%$ at birth to $51\%$ by $10\,\mathrm{Myr}$. The majority of the long-lived disks are those with low viscosity $\alpha &lt; 10^{-3.5}$ and initial characteristic radius $R_c &lt; 125\,\mathrm{AU}$, while the initial disk-to-star mass ratio does not play an important role. The median gas disk mass and radius of the surviving disks exhibit a sharp decline in the first $0.2\,\mathrm{Myr}$ of evolution, followed by a slight increase that reflects survivorship bias. We also explore correlations between gas disk mass and size vs. stellar mass and FUV strength. Our findings highlight the critical role of external photoevaporation in shaping disk populations even at moderate levels of FUV radiation fields.</description>

      <title>Exocometary physics: material release and tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22180v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite decades of observations, the physical processes governing mass loss from small bodies beyond our Solar System remain poorly constrained. These exocomets are often treated as analogs of Solar System comet, yet the stellar environments they inhabit spans a wide range in terms of luminosity, stellar winds, and evolutionary stage, leading to potentially very diverse physical behaviors. Within our Solar System, small bodies lose material through a range of mechanisms, including sublimation, desorption, impacts, and/or sputtering. Once released, the composition and dynamics of the ejecta are then altered by additional processes, such as dust sublimation, ionization, and radiation pressure. In extrasolar systems, these mechanisms unfold under vastly different radiative and plasma conditions, leading to a rich diversity of mass-loss pathways and observable signatures.
  This work reviews our understanding of the mechanisms driving mass loss from small bodies and the subsequent evolution of ejecta in diverse stellar environments. We compare the physical and chemical mechanisms that drive gas and dust production, and investigate how they scale with stellar luminosity, temperature, and activity. We then examine the processes that modify the composition of the ejecta (e.g., dust sublimation, dissociation, or ionisation) and its dynamics (e.g., radiation pressure or stellar winds). To illustrate how these processes vary across different stellar environments, we use four well-studied planetary systems as case studies: the Sun, $\beta$ Pictoris, AU Microscopii, and WD 1145+017. By exploring how cometary tails behave under such diverse conditions, this work provides a physical framework for interpreting exocometary activity and sheds light on why A-type stars, such as the famous $\beta$ Pictoris, are over-represented in the population of exocomet-hosting stars.</description>

      <title>A Path to an All-Sky Survey with Roman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep, space-based, all-sky near-infrared survey carried out with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope would constitute a foundational astronomical infrastructure for decades to come. In this white paper, we present a concrete and feasible path to imaging the entire sky at $\sim0.1''$ resolution, beginning with high-impact fields in Cycle 1 and scaling to ultra-wide coverage within the nominal mission. This first-epoch survey will reach $\mathrm{H}\sim25.5$ AB mag (5$\sigma$) and maximize synergies with contemporaneous observatories, while preserving substantial time for other ambitious Roman programs. We outline representative scheduling scenarios and an example Cycle 1 program that triples early Roman-LSST overlap and delivers high-value community data products such as LSST forced photometry, joint \textit{Gaia}-Roman astrometry, and catalogs of Galactic substructure, stong lenses, and other rare systems. The Cycle 1 program will lay the foundation for an eventual all-sky survey, while also delivering high-impact early science. We invite broad community participation in shaping and carrying out both the initial program and the long-term vision of an all-sky Roman survey.</description>

      <title>pythonradex: a fast Python re-implementation of RADEX with extended functionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common task in astronomical research is to estimate the physical parameters (temperature, mass, density etc.) of a gas by using observed line emission. This often requires a calculation of how the radiation propagates via emission and absorption (so-called radiative transfer). In radio and infrared astronomy, the Fortran code RADEX (van der Tak et al., 2007) is a popular tool to solve the non-LTE radiative transfer of a uniform medium in a simplified geometry. I present pythonradex, a Python re-implementation of RADEX. Written in Python, it provides an easy and intuitive user interface, improved performance as well as additional functionality not included in RADEX, such as continuum effects and overlapping lines. In addition, pythonradex provides a self-consistent computation of the total flux for all geometries, including spherical geometries.</description>

      <title>GEMS JWST: Transmission spectroscopy of TOI-5205b reveals significant stellar contamination and a metal-poor atmosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06966v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of transiting giant exoplanets ($R_p\gtrsim8\mathrm{~R_\oplus}$) around M dwarfs (GEMS) present an opportunity to investigate their atmospheric compositions and explore how such massive planets form around low-mass stars contrary to the prediction from formation models. We present the first transmission spectra of TOI-5205b, a short-period ($P=1.63~\mathrm{days}$) Jupiter-like planet ($M_p=1.08~\mathrm{M_J}$ and $R_p=0.94~\mathrm{R_J}$) orbiting an M4 dwarf ($M_\star=0.392~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, $R_\star=0.394~\mathrm{R_\odot}$). We obtained three transits using the PRISM mode of the JWST Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) spanning $0.6-5.3$ um. The data reveal significant stellar contamination that is evident in the light curves as spot-crossing events and in the transmission spectra as a larger transit depth at bluer wavelengths. Atmospheric retrievals demonstrate that stellar contamination from unocculted starspots and faculae is the dominant component of the transmission spectrum at wavelengths $\lambda\lesssim3.0$ um, reducing the sensitivity to the presence of clouds or hazes in our models and preventing detection of $\mathrm{H_2O}$. The wavelength coverage enabled a robust detection of $\mathrm{CH_4}$ and $\mathrm{H_2S}$, which have detectable molecular features between $3.0-5.0$ um. For both clear or cloudy atmospheres, Bayesian retrievals consistently favored an atmosphere with sub-solar metallicity ($3\sigma$ upper limit of $\log\mathrm{[M/H]}\lesssim-1.24$) and super-solar C/O ratio ($3\sigma$ lower limit of $\log\mathrm{[C/O]}\gtrsim0.09$), although this may partly be driven by the non-detection of water due to stellar contamination. Planetary interior models predict a bulk metallicity of 10--20\%, which is larger than the atmospheric metallicity and suggests that the interior of TOI-5205b is decoupled from its atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Observational imprints of tidal internal gravity wave dissipation in star-planet systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal interactions play a crucial role in the orbital evolution of close-in star-planet systems. There are numerous manifestations of tides, including planetary orbital migration, breaking resonant chains, tidal heating, orbital circularization, spin-orbit alignment, and stellar and planetary spin synchronization. In the present study, we focus on the dissipation of internal gravity waves within stars. We examine two mechanisms: wave breaking in stars with radiative cores and magnetic wave conversion in stars with convective cores. Applying tidal prescriptions modelling these processes, we demonstrate that the enhanced stellar rotation of both TOI-2458 and GJ 504 can be explained by the previous engulfment of a hot Jupiter caused by gravity wave damping. Furthermore, we show that the observed population of hot Jupiters can be divided into two distinct subsamples: those that are too young for gravity wave dissipation and those where it is ongoing. These subsamples exhibit qualitatively different orbital period distributions: young systems have a uniform distribution, while older systems show a steep decline at short orbital periods. Using a population synthesis approach, we successfully reproduce the main features of the older hot Jupiter sample based on the distribution of the younger systems. According to our estimates, up to 13% of the main-sequence stars within the mass range [0.7,1.5] $M_{\odot}$ that once hosted a hot Jupiter may have since engulfed it. Our results highlight the key role of internal gravity wave dissipation in shaping the orbital architectures of hot Jupiter systems.</description>

      <title>Cold and eccentric: a high-spectral resolution view of 51 Eri b with VLT/HiRISE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovered almost 10 years ago, the giant planet 51 Eridani b is one of the least separated (0.2 arcsec) and faintest (J = 19.74 mag) directly imaged exoplanets known to date. Its atmospheric properties have been thoroughly investigated through low- and medium-resolution spectroscopic observations, enabling robust characterization of the planet's bulk parameters. However, the planet's intrinsically high contrast renders high-resolution spectroscopic observations difficult, despite their potential to yield key measurements essential for a more comprehensive characterization. This study seeks to constrain the planet's radial velocity, enabling a full 3D orbital solution when integrated with previous measurements. We have obtained 4 high-contrast high-resolution (R = 140000) spectroscopic datasets of the planet, collected over a two-year interval with the HiRISE visitor instrument at the VLT to derive the planet's radial velocity. Using self-consistent models of atmosphere, we were able to derive the radial velocity of the planet at each of the 4 epochs. These radial velocity measurements were then used in combination with all existing relative astrometry in order to constrain the orbit of the planet. Our radial velocity measurements allow us to break the degeneracy along the line of sight, making it now possible the unambiguous interpretation of the phase curve of the companion. We further constrain the orbital parameters, particularly the eccentricity, for which we derive e = 0.55 (-0.07, +0.03). The relatively high eccentricity indicates that the system has experienced dynamical interactions induced by an external perturber. We place constraints on the mass and semi-major axis of a hypothetical, unseen outer planet capable of producing the observed high eccentricities.</description>

Abstract: We present high-precision measurements for HR~7672AB, composed of a Sun-like (G0V) star and an L~dwarf companion. Three nights of precise (70 cm/s) radial velocity (RV) asteroseismology with the Keck Planet Finder clearly detect 5-minute oscillations from the primary HR~7672A, and modeling of the frequency spectrum yields an asteroseismic age of $1.87\pm0.65$~Gyr. We also determine a gyrochronological age of $2.58\pm0.47$~Gyr, and we combine these two results for a final age of $2.26\pm0.40$~Gyr. In addition, we obtained new RVs for HR~7672A and new astrometry for the companion HR~7672B. From a joint orbit fit, we measured a dynamical mass of $1.111\pm0.017$~$\text{M}_\odot$ for HR~7672A and $75.39\pm0.67$~$\text{M}_{\text{Jup}}$ for HR~7672B. This places the companion near the stellar/substellar boundary and thus particularly sensitive to differences in model predictions. The joint precision in host star age (18\% uncertainty) and companion mass (0.9\% uncertainty) makes HR~7672AB an exceptional substellar benchmark. Combined with the companion's luminosity, we use these measurements to test predictions from six brown dwarf cooling models. The best agreement occurs with the Chabrier et al. (2023) models, which incorporate a new equation of state, resulting in predictions that agree within $&lt;$0.3$\sigma$ with all the observations. The other 5 sets of models agree at the 1--3$\sigma$ level depending on the particular test, and some models struggle to predict a sufficient low luminosity for HR~7672B at any age given its dynamical mass. We also detected a weak seismic signal in near-simultaneous TESS photometry of HR~7672A, with the resulting RV-to-photometry oscillation amplitude ratio consistent with solar values.</description>
