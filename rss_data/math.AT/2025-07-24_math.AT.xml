      <title>On tested Bousfield-Friedlander localizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a Bousfield-Friedlander localization with a set of test morphisms in the sense introduced by Bandklayder, Bergner, Griffiths, Johnson, and Santhanam can also be characterized as a left Bousfield localization at the set of test morphisms. This viewpoint enables us to establish a homogeneous model structure associated with any calculus arising from a Bousfield-Friedlander localization of this form. As a corollary, we show that homogeneous functors in discrete calculus coincide up to homotopy with those in Goodwillie calculus. Finally, we illustrate this framework by proving that the polynomial model structure of Weiss calculus is a particular instance of tested Bousfield-Friedlander localization.</description>

      <title>Obstruction theory for $A$-infinity bimodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an obstruction theory for the extension of truncated minimal $A$-infinity bimodule structures over truncated minimal $A$-infinity algebras. Obstructions live in far-away pages of a (truncated) fringed spectral sequence of Bousfield--Kan type. The second page of this spectral sequence is mostly given by a new cohomology theory associated to a pair consisting of a graded algebra and a graded bimodule over it. This new cohomology theory fits in a long exact sequence involving the Hochschild cohomology of the algebra and the self-extensions of the bimodule. We show that the second differential of this spectral sequence is given by the Gerstenhaber bracket with a bimodule analogue of the universal Massey product of a minimal $A$-infinity algebra. We also develop a closely-related obstruction theory for truncated minimal $A$-infinity bimodule structures over (the truncation of) a fixed minimal $A$-infinity algebra; the second page of the corresponding spectral sequence is now mostly given by the vector spaces of self-extensions of the underlying graded bimodule and the second differential is described analogously to the previous one. We also establish variants of the above for graded algebras and graded bimodules that are $d$-sparse, that is they are concentrated in degrees that are multiples of a fixed integer $d\geq1$. These obstruction theories are used to establish intrinsic formality and almost formality theorems for differential graded bimodules over differential graded algebras. Our results hold, more generally, in the context of graded operads with multiplication equipped with an associative operadic ideal, examples of which are the endomorphism operad of a graded algebra and the linear endomorphism operad of a pair consisting of a graded algebra and a graded bimodule over it.</description>

      <title>Spaces of homomorphisms, formality and Hochschild homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a discrete group. The topological category of finite dimensional unitary representations of $G$ is symmetric monoidal under direct sum and has an associated $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-space $\mathcal{K}^{\mathrm{def}}(G)$. We show that if $G$ and $A$ are finitely generated groups and $A$ is abelian, then $\mathcal{K}^{\mathrm{def}}(G\times A)\simeq \mathcal{K}^{\mathrm{def}}(G)\otimes \widehat{A}$ as $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-spaces, where $\widehat{A}$ is the Pontryagin dual of $A$. We deduce a homology stability result for the homomorphism varieties $\mathrm{Hom}(G\times \mathbb{Z}^r,U(n))$ using the local-to-global principle for homology stability of Kupers--Miller. For a finitely generated free group $F$ and a field $k$ of characteristic zero, we show that the singular $k$-chains in $\mathcal{K}^{\mathrm{def}}(F)$ are formal as an $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-$k$-algebra. Using this we describe the equivariant homology of $\mathrm{Hom}(F \times A,U(n))$ for every $n$ in terms of higher Hochschild homology of an explicitly determined commutative $k$-algebra. As an example we show that $\mathrm{Hom}(F\times \mathbb{Z}^r,U(2))$ is $U(2)$-equivariantly formal for every $r$ and we compute the Poincar{\'e} polynomial.</description>

      <title>Exactness, Cohomology, and Uniqueness in First-Order Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between the solvability of first-order differential equations and the topology of the underlying domain through the lens of de\,Rham cohomology. We analyze the conditions under which a closed 1-form associated with a first-order ODE admits a global potential, thereby reducing the problem to the exactness of differential forms. While it is well known that exactness is guaranteed on simply connected domains, we show that triviality of the first de\,Rham cohomology group is the more fundamental requirement for global integrability and uniqueness of solutions. In particular, we demonstrate that certain non-simply connected manifolds, such as the real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$, still support global solutions due to the vanishing of $H^1_{\text{dR}}$. By explicitly constructing examples on $\mathbb{RP}^2$ and comparing them with domains like $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{0\}$, we illustrate how topological obstructions manifest analytically as non-uniqueness or multi-valued behavior. We further discuss the correspondence between integrating factors and the trivialization of cohomology classes, drawing connections to classical symmetry methods and potential theory. This synthesis of geometric, topological, and analytic perspectives provides a unifying framework for understanding the global behavior of first-order ODEs beyond local existence theorems.</description>

      <title>On minimal shapes and isoperimetric constants in hyperbolic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We fully characterize the set of finite shapes with minimal perimeter on hyperbolic lattices given by regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane whose tiles are regular $p$-gons meeting at vertices of degree $q$, with $1/p+1/q&lt;\frac{1}{2}$. In particular, we prove that the ratio between the perimeter and the area (i.e., the number of vertices) of this set of minimal shapes converges to the isoperimetric constant computed in H\"aggstr\"om-Jonasson-Lyons. In fact, our balls which are constructed via layers and not combinatorial balls, will realize the isoperimetric constant for any fixed number of vertices.</description>
