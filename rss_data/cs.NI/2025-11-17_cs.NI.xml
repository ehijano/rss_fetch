      <title>Millimeter-Wave UAV Channel Model with Height-Dependent Path Loss and Shadowing in Urban Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) serving as Aerial Base Stations (ABSs) are expected to extend 6G millimeter-Wave (mmWave) coverage and improve link reliability in urban areas. However, UAV-based Air-to-Ground (A2G) channels are highly dependent on height and urban geometry. This paper proposes an ABS height-dependent mmWave channel model and investigates whether urban geometry, beyond the standard built-up parameters, significantly affects LoS probability (PLoS) and Large-Scale Fading (LSF). Using MATLAB ray tracing at 26 GHz, we simulate approximately 10K city realizations for four urban layouts that share identical built-up parameters but differ in their spatial organization. We extract elevation-based PLoS using a sigmoid model and derive height-dependent Path-Loss Exponents (PLEs) and shadow-fading trends using exponential fits. Results show that PLE for Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) decreases toward 2.5-3 at high altitudes, Line-of-Sight (LoS) PLE remains near 2, and shadow fading reduces with height. We also find that geometric layout introduces a modest but consistent change in PLE (+/- 0.2), even when built-up parameters are fixed. The proposed unified model aligns well with ray-tracing statistics and offers a practical, height-dependent LSF model suitable for ABS planning in complex urban scenarios.</description>

      <title>Advancing IoT System Dependability: A Deep Dive into Management and Operation Plane Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to enhance the dependability of large-scale IoT systems by separating the management and operation plane. We innovate the management plane to enforce overarching policies, such as safety norms, operation standards, and energy restrictions, and integrate multi-faceted management entities, including regulatory agencies and manufacturers, while the current IoT operational workflow remains unchanged. Central to the management plane is a meticulously designed, identity-independent policy framework that employs flexible descriptors rather than fixed identifiers, allowing for proactive deployment of overarching policies with adaptability to system changes. Our evaluation across three datasets indicates that the proposed framework can achieve near-optimal expressiveness and dependable policy enforcement.</description>

      <title>Use Cases, Metrics, and Challenges of Nomadic Non-Public Networks for the 6G Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless communication is evolving with the adoption of dynamic and self-organizing networks. They are expected to play a crucial role in shaping sixth-generation (6G) systems and the ongoing standardization process. The concept of non-public networks (NPNs) introduced in fifth-generation (5G) will be enhanced by nomadic non-public networks (NNPNs), extending mobility and adaptability beyond fixed locations. These networks help overcome the limitations of traditional static infrastructures, making them applicable to areas such as emergency response, transportation, agriculture, and others. This paper examines the transition from NPNs to NNPNs, highlighting key technical aspects such as network architecture, dynamic resource allocation, and wireless backhauling. Several use cases illustrate how NNPNs improve connectivity in environments where traditional networks are limited. Additionally, the study defines Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to evaluate NNPN applications and establishes a framework for categorizing them based on mobility and operational requirements. Despite their advantages, NNPNs introduce architectural, regulatory, and security challenges such as new approaches for handovers, spectrum policies or cross-border functionality, and trust mechanisms to maintain reliable operations. By identifying use cases, defining evaluation criteria, and addressing technical and regulatory challenges, this paper provides insights into integrating NNPNs into future 6G networks. These findings contribute to ongoing standardization efforts and emphasize the need for adaptable policies and network architectures to maximize the benefits of NNPNs in next-generation communication systems.</description>

      <title>SoK: Security Evaluation of Wi-Fi CSI Biometrics: Attacks, Metrics, and Systemic Weaknesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) has been repeatedly proposed as a biometric modality, often with reports of high accuracy and operational feasibility. However, the field lacks a consolidated understanding of its security properties, adversarial resilience, and methodological consistency. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) examines CSI-based biometric authentication through a security perspective, analyzing how existing work differs across sensing infrastructure, signal representations, feature pipelines, learning models, and evaluation methodologies. Our synthesis reveals systemic inconsistencies: reliance on aggregate accuracy metrics, limited reporting of FAR/FRR/EER, absence of per-user risk analysis, and scarce consideration of threat models or adversarial feasibility. We construct a unified evaluation framework to empirically expose these issues and demonstrate how security-relevant metrics, such as per-class EER, FCS, and the Gini Coefficient, uncover risk concentration that remains hidden under traditional reporting practices. Our analysis highlights concrete attack surfaces and shows how methodological choices materially influence vulnerability profiles, which include replay, geometric mimicry, and environmental perturbation. Based on these findings, we articulate the security boundaries of current CSI biometrics and provide guidelines for rigorous evaluation, reproducible experimentation, and future research directions. This SoK offers the security community a structured, evidence-driven reassessment of Wi-Fi CSI biometrics and their suitability as an authentication primitive.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous CACC Coexistence: Simulation, Analysis, and Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) algorithms for vehicle platooning has been extensively investigated, leading to a wide range of approaches with different requirements and performance. Most existing studies evaluate these algorithms under the assumption of homogeneous platoons, i.e., when all platoon members adopt the same CACC. However, market competition is likely to result in vehicles from different manufacturers implementing distinct CACCs. This raises fundamental questions about whether heterogeneous vehicles can safely cooperate within a platoon and what performance can be achieved. To date, these questions have received little attention, as heterogeneous platoons are difficult to model and analyze. In this work, we introduce the concept of mixed platoons, i.e., platoons made of vehicles running heterogeneous CACCs, and we study their performance through simulation-based experiments. We consider mixtures of three well-established CACCs from the literature. In the first part of the paper, we study a single mixed platoon in isolation to understand the microscopic effects on safety: we evaluate the performance of various CACC-mixtures across speed change and emergency braking scenarios. In the second part, we examine a high-density ring-road scenario to assess macroscopic impacts on safety, comfort, and traffic throughput, especially comparing throughput results with those obtained from vehicles controlled by a standard Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) or by human drivers. Our findings highlight that some combinations of CACCs can operate robustly and safely, while others exhibit critical limitations in safety, comfort, or efficiency. These results emphasize the need for careful system design and the development of theoretical frameworks for modeling heterogeneous platoons.</description>

      <title>CNN-Enabled Scheduling for Probabilistic Real-Time Guarantees in Industrial URLLC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks. We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a CNN-based dynamic priority prediction mechanism for improved interference coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static priorities, our approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network and graph coloring to adaptively assign link priorities based on real-time traffic, transmission opportunities, and network conditions. Assuming that first training phase is performed offline, our approach introduced minimal overhead, while enabling more efficient resource allocation, boosting network capacity, SINR, and schedulability. Simulation results show SINR gains of up to 113\%, 94\%, and 49\% over LDP across three network configurations, highlighting its effectiveness for complex URLLC scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Single-Chain Backscatter Tag for Multi-Sensor Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world sensing tasks require co-located, multi-modal measurements at a single site, typically a bundle of two to five sensors, for example, in plant stress sensing and blood pressure estimation. RF-backscatter devices have emerged as a low-power solution for sensing, yet existing backscatter tags support a single sensor. Placing several single-sensor tags at one site increases attachment footprint and induces mutual coupling between nearby tag antennas, thereby limiting practical deployment.
  We present MATRIX, a single-chain multi-sensor backscatter tag that concurrently supports multiple onboard sensors and multiplexes them as a composite voltage, then backscatters it through one analog modulation chain. Rather than time-division polling, which introduces inter-sensor sampling offsets, or frequency-division, which requires independent per-sensor modulation chains, MATRIX introduces a voltage-division multiplexing architecture in which each sensor value is encoded as a PWM waveform, carrying the measurement in its duty cycle and reserving the amplitude for multiplexing. To support reliable demultiplexing, MATRIX selects the voltage-division weights in a binary-weighted geometric progression so that every active-sensor set maps to a uniquely invertible, well-spaced composite voltage. The composite voltage is then converted into backscatter frequency shifts through a single modulation chain. At the receiver, MATRIX formulates demultiplexing as a Hidden Markov Model to recover per-sensor readings while tolerating analog hardware imperfections and multipath. MATRIX's ASIC design consumes 25.56uW. Detailed evaluation shows that the prototype, multiplexing five sensors, achieves 20 dB average signal reconstruction SNR at a 30 kHz sampling frequency; we further validate MATRIX with case studies in plant sensing, health monitoring, and microphone-based direction finding.</description>
