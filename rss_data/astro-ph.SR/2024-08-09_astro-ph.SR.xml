      <title>Signatures of mass segregation from competitive accretion and monolithic collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two main competing theories proposed to explain the formation of massive ($&gt;10$M$_\odot$) stars -- competitive accretion and monolithic core collapse -- make different observable predictions for the environment of the massive stars during, and immediately after, their formation. Proponents of competitive accretion have long predicted that the most massive stars should have a different spatial distribution to lower-mass stars, either through the stars being mass segregated, or being in areas of higher relative densities, or sitting deeper in gravitational potential wells. We test these predictions by analysing a suite of SPH simulations where star clusters form massive stars via competitive accretion with and without feedback. We find that the most massive stars have higher relative densities, and sit in deeper potential wells, only in simulations in which feedback is not present. When feedback is included, only half of the simulations have the massive stars residing in deeper potential wells, and there are no other distinguishing signals in their spatial distributions. Intriguingly, in our simple models for monolithic core collapse, the massive stars may also end up in deeper potential wells, because if massive cores fragment the stars are still massive, and dominate their local environs. We find no robust diagnostic test in the spatial distributions of massive stars that can distinguish their formation mechanisms, and so other predictions for distinguishing between competitive accretion and monolithic collapse are required.</description>

      <title>Case studies on pre-eruptive X-class flares using R-value in the lower solar atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The R-value is a measure of the strength of photospheric magnetic Polarity Inversion Lines (PILs) in Active Regions (ARs). This work investigates the possibility of a relation between R-value variations and the occurrence of X-class flares in ARs, not in the solar photosphere, as usual, but above it in regions, closer to where flares occur. The modus operandi is to extrapolate the Solar Dynamic Observatory's (SDO) Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetogram data up to a height of 3.24 Mm above the photosphere and then compute the R-value based on the extrapolated magnetic field. Recent studies have shown that certain flare-predictive parameters such as the horizontal gradient of the vertical magnetic field and magnetic helicity may improve flare prediction lead times significantly if studied at a specific height range above the photosphere, called the Optimal Height Range (OHR). Here we define the OHR as a collection of heights where a sudden but sustained increase in R-value is found. For the eight case studies discussed in this paper, our results indicate that it is possible for OHRs to exist in the low solar atmosphere (between 0.36 - 3.24 Mm), where R-value spikes occur 48-68 hrs before the first X-class flare of an emerging AR. The temporal evolution of R-value before the first X-class flare for an emerging AR is also found to be distinct from that of non-flaring ARs. For X-class flares associated with non-emerging ARs, an OHR could not be found.</description>

      <title>Variable, circularly polarized radio emission from the Young Stellar Object [BHB2007]-1: another ingredient of a unique system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The young stellar object [BHB2007]-1 has been extensively studied in the past at radio, millimeter, and infrared wavelengths. It shows a gap in the disk and previous observations claimed the possible emission from a forming sub-stellar object, in correspondence to the disk gap. Here, we analyze a set of 8 Karl Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations at 15 GHz and spread over a month. We infer a slowly variable emission from the star, with a $\sim 15 \text{-} 20\%$ circular polarization detected in two of the eight observations. The latter can be related to the magnetic fields in the system, while the unpolarized and moderately varying component can be indicative of free-free emission associated with jet induced shocks or interaction of the stellar wind with dense surrounding material. We discard any relevant short flaring activities when sampling the radio light curves down to 10 seconds and find no clear evidence of emission from the sub-stellar object inferred from past observations, although deeper observations could shed further light on this.</description>

      <title>Visibility Analysis of the Sun as Viewed from Multiple Spacecraft at the Sun-Earth Lagrange Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond the Sun-Earth line, spacecraft equipped with various solar telescopes are intended to be deployed at several different vantage points in the heliosphere to carry out coordinated, multi-view observations of the Sun and its dynamic activities. In this context, we investigate solar visibility by imaging instruments onboard the spacecraft orbiting the Sun-Earth Lagrange points L1, L4 and L5, respectively. An optimal arrival time for vertical periodic orbits stationed at L4 and L5 is determined based on geometric considerations that ensure maximum visibility of solar poles or higher latitudes per year. For a different set of orbits around the three Lagrange points (L1, L4 and L5), we calculate the visibility of the solar surface (i.e., observation days per year) as a function of the solar latitude. We also analyze where the solar limb viewed from one of the three Sun-Earth Lagrange points under consideration is projected onto the solar surface visible to the other two. This analysis particularly aims at determining the feasibility of studying solar eruptions, such as flares and coronal mass ejections, with coordinated observations of off-limb erupting coronal structures and their on-disk magnetic footpoints. In addition, visibility analysis of a feature (such as sunspots) on the solar surface is made for multiple spacecraft in various types of orbits with different inclinations to quantify the improvement in continuous tracking of the target feature for studying its long-term evolution from emergence, growth and to decay. A comprehensive comparison of observations from single (L1), double (L1 and L4) and multi-space missions (L1, L4 and L5) is carried out through our solar visibility analysis, and this may help us to design future space missions of constructing multiple solar observatories at the Sun-Earth Lagrange points.</description>

      <title>On the Response of the Transition Region and the Corona to Rapid Excursions in the Chromosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spicules are the thin hair/grass-like structures that are prominently observed at the chromospheric solar limb. It is believed that fibrils and rapid blueshifted and redshifted excursions (RBEs and RREs; collectively referred to as REs) correspond to on-disk counterparts of type I spicules and type II spicules, respectively. Our investigation focuses on observing the response of these REs alongside similar spectral features in the chromosphere, transition Region (TR), and corona, utilizing space-time plots derived from coordinated observations from Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope/H{\alpha}, Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and Solar Dynamics Observatory. Our analysis reveals upflowing REs, promptly reaching temperatures characteristic of the TR and corona, indicating a multi-thermal nature. Similarly, downflowing features exhibiting similar spectral signatures over the disk display plasma motion from the corona to chromospheric temperatures, demonstrating a multithermal nature. In addition to distinct upflows and downflows, we observe sequential upflow and downflow along the same path, depicting a distinctive parabolic trajectory in space-time plots of observations sampling TR and various coronal passbands. Similar to isolated upflows and downflows, these REs also exhibit a multi-thermal nature throughout their trajectory. Furthermore, our results reveal a more intricate motion of the REs in which both upflow and downflow coexist at the same spatial location. On a different note, our analysis, utilizing coordinated IRIS spectral observations, shows spatio-temporal redshifts/downflows in both the TR and chromosphere, suggesting that at least subsets of the strong redshifts/downflows observed in TR temperature spectra result from the return from the upper atmosphere flow of plasma in the form of bundles of spicules or features exhibiting similar spectra.</description>

      <title>A Multi-wavelength, Multi-epoch Monitoring Campaign of Accretion Variability in T Tauri Stars from the ODYSSEUS Survey. III. Optical Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs) are highly variable stars that possess gas- and dust-rich disks from which planets form. Much of their variability is driven by mass accretion from the surrounding disk, a process that is still not entirely understood. A multi-epoch optical spectral monitoring campaign of four CTTSs (TW Hya, RU Lup, BP Tau, and GM Aur) was conducted along with contemporaneous HST UV spectra and ground-based photometry in an effort to determine accretion characteristics and gauge variability in this sample. Using an accretion flow model, we find that the magnetospheric truncation radius varies between 2.5-5 R* across all of our observations. There is also significant variability in all emission lines studied, particularly Halpha, Hbeta, and Hgamma. Using previously established relationships between line luminosity and accretion, we find that, on average, most lines reproduce accretion rates consistent with accretion shock modeling of HST spectra to within 0.5 dex. Looking at individual contemporaneous observations, however, these relationships are less accurate, suggesting that variability trends differ from the trends of the population and that these empirical relationships should be used with caution in studies of variability.</description>

      <title>Flaring Activity for Low-Mass Stars in the $\beta$ Pictoris Moving Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar flares from K and M dwarfs release panchromatic radiation characterized by a significantly higher brightness temperature ($\sim$9-20 kK) than the star. The increased frequency of magnetic activity on young low-mass stars results in the energy released during flaring events becoming a notable contributor to the radiation environment. This study focuses on the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group (24 $\pm$ 3 Myr) for the analysis of young, low-mass star flaring rates within the framework of larger flare studies. The calibration of long-term optical flare statistics is crucial to updating flare activity-age relations and the interpretation of exoplanet atmosphere observations. Using the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group, we develop a modular flare extraction pipeline sensitive to low-mass stellar flares in observations from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. This pipeline is built to characterize flare properties of these stars such as total energy and cumulative flare rate. Consistent with previous studies, this sample (N=49) shows higher cumulative flare rates than early type and old field stars by at least an order of magnitude. Fitted flare frequency distributions for both early and late type M dwarfs show an average slope of $1.58 \pm 0.23$ with earlier stars flaring with lower or similar rates to late types. A typical member in this sample has daily ($\mathrm{\sim 1 \, d^{-1}}$ ) flares with TESS band energies of $10^{32} - 10^{33}$ ergs. The optical flare rates and energies for this group provide essential context into the co-evolution of host stars and associated planets.</description>

      <title>A Candidate Giant Planet Companion to the Massive, Young White Dwarf GALEX J071816.4+373139 Informs the Occurrence of Giant Planets Orbiting B Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that giant planet occurrence peaks for stars with $M_{\ast}~\approx~3~M_{\odot}$ at a value a factor of four higher than observed for solar-mass stars. This population of giant planets predicted to frequently orbit main sequence B stars at $a~\approx~10$ AU is difficult to characterize observationally while fusion persists in their host stars. Fortunately, stars with $M_{\ast}~\gtrsim~3~M_{\odot}$ sustain fusion for only a few hundred million years. By the time those stars become massive, young white dwarfs, any giant planets present would still be luminous as a consequence of their recent formation.
  From an initial sample of 3268 Gaia-identified massive, young white dwarfs, we use homogeneous Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) photometry to search for evidence of unresolved giant planets. For 30 systems, these IRAC data provide sensitivity to objects with $M~\lesssim~10~M_{\text{Jup}}$, and we identify one candidate with $M~\approx~4~M_{\text{Jup}}$ orbiting the white dwarf GALEX J071816.4+373139. Correcting for the possibility that some of the white dwarfs in our sample result from mergers, we find a giant planet occurrence $\eta_{\text{GP}}~=~0.11_{-0.07}^{+0.13}$ for stars with initial masses $M_{\ast}~\gtrsim~3~M_{\odot}$. Our occurrence inference is consistent with both the Doppler-inferred occurrence of giant planets orbiting $M_{\ast}~\approx~2~M_{\odot}$ giant stars and the theoretically predicted factor-of-four enhancement in the occurrence of giant planets orbiting $M_{\ast}~\approx~3~M_{\odot}$ stars relative to solar-mass stars. Future James Webb Space Telescope Near Infrared Camera observations of our sample would provide sensitivity to Saturn-mass planets and thereby a definitive estimate of the occurrence of giant planets orbiting stars with $M_{\ast}~\gtrsim~3~M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Circumstellar Interaction in the Ultraviolet Spectra of SN 2023ixf 14-66 Days After Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SN 2023ixf was discovered in M101 within a day of explosion and rapidly classified as a Type II supernova with flash features. Here we present ultraviolet (UV) spectra obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope 14, 19, 24, and 66 days after explosion. Interaction between the supernova ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM) is seen in the UV throughout our observations in the flux of the first three epochs and asymmetric MgII emission at day 66. We compare our observations to CMFGEN supernova models which include CSM interaction ($\dot{M}&lt;10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$/yr) and find that the power from CSM interaction is decreasing with time, from $L_{\rm sh}\approx5\times10^{42}$ erg/s at day 14 to $L_{sh}\approx1\times10^{40}$ erg/s at day 66. We examine the contribution of individual atomic species to the spectra at day 14 and 19, showing that the majority of the features are dominated by iron, nickel, magnesium, and chromium absorption in the ejecta. The UV spectral energy distribution of SN 2023ixf sits between that of supernovae which show no definitive signs of CSM interaction and those with persistent signatures assuming the same progenitor radius and metallicity. Finally, we show that the evolution and asymmetric shape of the MgII emission are not unique to SN 2023ixf. These observations add to the early measurements of dense, confined CSM interaction, tracing the mass-loss history of SN 2023ixf to $\sim33$ yr prior to explosion and the density profile to a radius of $\sim5.7\times10^{15}$ cm. They show the relatively short evolution from quiescent red supergiant wind to high mass loss.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Protoplanetary Disks Using the Keck/NIRC2 Vortex Coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of protoplanetary disks in the millimeter continuum have shown a variety of radial gaps, cavities, and spiral features. These substructures may be signposts for ongoing planet formation, and therefore these systems are promising targets for direct imaging planet searches in the near-infrared. To this end, we present results from a deep imaging survey in the $L'$-band (3.8 $\mu$m) with the Keck/NIRC2 vortex coronagraph to search for young planets in 43 disks with resolved features in the millimeter continuum or evidence for gaps/central cavities from their spectral energy distributions. Although we do not detect any new point sources, using the vortex coronagraph allows for high sensitivity to faint sources at small angular separations (down to ${\sim}$0$^{\prime\prime}$.1), allowing us to place strong upper limits on the masses of potential gas giant planets. We compare our mass sensitivities to the masses of planets derived using ALMA observations, and while we are sensitive to $\sim$1 M$_{Jup}$ planets in the gaps in some of our systems, we are generally not sensitive to planets of the masses expected from the ALMA observations. In addition to placing upper limits on the masses of gas giant planets that could be interacting with the dust in the disks to form the observed millimeter substructures, we are also able to map the micron-sized dust as seen in scattered light for 8 of these systems. Our large sample of systems also allows us to investigate limits on planetary accretion rates and disk viscosities.</description>

      <title>Higher-order effects in the dynamics of hierarchical triple systems. II. Second-order and dotriacontapole-order effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the long-term evolution of hierarchical triple systems in Newtonian gravity to second order in the quadrupolar perturbation parameter, and to sixth order in $\epsilon = a/A$, the ratio of the semimajor axes of the inner and outer orbits. We apply the ``two-timescale'' method from applied mathematics to the Lagrange Planetary Equations for the inner and outer orbits, in which each osculating orbit element is split into an orbit averaged part that evolves on the long perturbative timescale, and an ``average-free'' part that is oscillatory in the orbital timescales. Averages over the two orbital timescales are performed using the well-known secular approximation. We also incorporate perturbative corrections to the relation between time and the orbital phases. We place no restrictions on the masses, on the relative orbit inclinations or on the eccentricities, beyond the requirement that the quadrupolar parameter and $\epsilon$ both be small. The result is a complete set of long-timescale evolution equations for the averaged elements of the inner and outer orbits. At first order in perturbation theory, we obtain the dotriacontapole contributions explicitly at order $\epsilon^6$. At second order in perturbation theory, i.e. quadratic in the quadrupole perturbation amplitude, we find contributions that scale as $\epsilon^{9/2}$ (found in earlier work), $\epsilon^{5}$, $\epsilon^{11/2}$, and $\epsilon^{6}$. At first perturbative order and dotriacontapole order, the two averaged semimajor axes are constant in time (and we prove that this holds to arbitrary multipole orders); but at second perturbative order, beginning at $O( \epsilon^{5})$, they are no longer constant. Nevertheless we verify that the total averaged energy of the system is conserved, and we argue that this behavior is not incompatible with classical theorems on secular evolution of the semimajor axes.</description>

      <title>X-ray Polarimetry of X-ray Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation from X-ray pulsars (XRPs) was expected to be strongly linearly polarized owing to a large difference in their ordinary and extraordinary mode opacities. The launch of IXPE allowed us to check this prediction. IXPE observed a dozen X-ray pulsars, discovering pulse-phase dependent variation of the polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA). Although the PD showed rather erratic profiles resembling flux pulse dependence, the PA in most cases showed smooth variations consistent with the rotating vector model (RVM), which can be interpreted as a combined effect of vacuum birefringence and dipole magnetic field structure at a polarization-limiting (adiabatic) radius. Application of the RVM allowed us to determine XRP geometry and to confirm the free precession of the NS in Her X-1. Deviations from RVM in two bright transients led to the discovery of an unpulsed polarized emission likely produced by scattering off the accretion disk wind.</description>

      <title>TOI-2490b- The most eccentric brown dwarf transiting in the brown dwarf desert</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of the most eccentric transiting brown dwarf in the brown dwarf desert, TOI02490b. The brown dwarf desert is the lack of brown dwarfs around main sequence stars within $\sim3$~AU and is thought to be caused by differences in formation mechanisms between a star and planet. To date, only $\sim40$ transiting brown dwarfs have been confirmed. \systemt is a $73.6\pm2.4$ \mjupnospace, $1.00\pm0.02$ \rjup brown dwarf orbiting a $1.004_{-0.022}^{+0.031}$ \msunnospace, $1.105_{-0.012}^{+0.012}$ \rsun sun-like star on a 60.33~d orbit with an eccentricity of $0.77989\pm0.00049$. The discovery was detected within \tess sectors 5 (30 minute cadence) and 32 (2 minute and 20 second cadence). It was then confirmed with 31 radial velocity measurements with \feros by the WINE collaboration and photometric observations with the Next Generation Transit Survey. Stellar modelling of the host star estimates an age of $\sim8$~Gyr, which is supported by estimations from kinematics likely placing the object within the thin disc. However, this is not consistent with model brown dwarf isochrones for the system age suggesting an inflated radius. Only one other transiting brown dwarf with an eccentricity higher than 0.6 is currently known in the brown dwarf desert. Demographic studies of brown dwarfs have suggested such high eccentricity is indicative of stellar formation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Deriving the Topological Properties of the Magnetic Field of Coronal Mass Ejections from In Situ Measurements: Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are magnetized plasma systems with highly complex magnetic topology and evolution. Methods developed to assess their magnetic configuration have primarily focused on reconstructing three-dimensional representations from one-dimensional time series measurements taken in situ using techniques based on the "highly twisted magnetic flux rope" approximations. However, the magnetic fields of CMEs is know to have more complicated geometries. Their structure can be quantified using measures of field line topology, which have been primarily used for solar physics research. In this work, we introduce a novel technique of directly quantifying the various form of magnetic helicity within a CME in the interplanetary space using synthetic in situ measurements. We use a relatively simple three-dimensional simulation of a CME initiated with a highly-twisted flux rope. We find that a significant portion of the magnetic helicity near 1~au is contained in writhe and mutual helicity rather than just in twist. We discuss the implications of this finding for fitting and reconstruction techniques.</description>

      <title>LAMOST J1010+2358 is not a Pair-Instability Supernova Relic</title>

Abstract: The discovery of a star formed out of pair-instability supernova ejecta would have massive implications for the Population III star initial mass function and the existence of stars over 100 Msun, but none have yet been found. Recently, the star LAMOST J1010+2358 was claimed to be a star that formed out of gas enriched by a pair-instability supernova. We present a non-LTE abundance analysis of a new high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectrum of J1010+2358. We determined the carbon and aluminum abundances needed to definitively distinguish between enrichment by a pair-instability and core-collapse supernova. Our new analysis demonstrates that J1010+2358 does not have the unique abundance pattern of a a pair-instability supernova, but was instead enriched by the ejecta of a low mass core-collapse supernova. Thus, there are still no known stars displaying unambiguous signatures of pair-instability supernovae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves modulate the apparent frequencies of other periodic signals. Low-frequency gravitational waves could therefore be detected by observing frequency modulations in signals from higher-frequency sources, e.g., those from binary white dwarfs detected with the LISA gravitational-wave detector. We propose a concrete method to extract these modulations by coherently adding the cross-spectra of a large number of well-resolved quasi-monochromatic signals. We apply this method to the case of LISA, and find this method would enable the detection of background gravitational wave strain amplitudes of, e.g., $A\simeq10^{-10}$ at a frequency $F\simeq10^{-8}\,\rm Hz$, given current projections for the number and properties of Galactic binary white dwarfs and the sensitivity of the instrument. We also estimate (to within an order of magnitude) that this method could potentially compete with that of current Pulsar Timing Arrays when using signals from binary neutron stars such as those expected to be observed with proposed detectors like DECIGO. Our results show that gravitational-wave detectors could be sensitive at frequencies outside of their designed bandwidth using the same infrastructure, which has the potential to open up unexplored and otherwise inaccessible parts of the gravitational wave spectrum.</description>

      <title>Cygnus X-3 revealed as a Galactic ultraluminous X-ray source by IXPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accretion of matter by compact objects can be inhibited by radiation pressure if the luminosity exceeds the critical value, known as the Eddington limit. Discovery of ultraluminous X-ray sources has shown that accretion can proceed even when the apparent luminosity significantly exceeds this limit. High apparent luminosity might be produced thanks to geometric beaming of the radiation by an outflow. The outflow half-opening angle, which determines the amplification due to beaming, has never been robustly constrained. Using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer, we made the measurement of X-ray polarization in the Galactic X-ray binary Cyg X-3. We find high, over 20%, nearly energy-independent linear polarization, orthogonal to the direction of the radio ejections. These properties unambiguously indicate the presence of a collimating outflow in the X-ray binary Cyg~X-3 and constrain its half-opening angle, &lt;15 degrees. Thus, the source can be used as a laboratory for studying the super-critical accretion regime. This finding underscores the importance of X-ray polarimetry in advancing our understanding of accreting sources.</description>

      <title>Probing pre-supernova mass loss in double-peaked Type Ibc supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eruptive mass loss of massive stars prior to supernova (SN) explosion is key to understanding their evolution and end fate. An observational signature of pre-SN mass loss is the detection of an early, short-lived peak prior to the radioactive-powered peak in the lightcurve of the SN. This is usually attributed to the SN shock passing through an extended envelope or circumstellar medium (CSM). Such an early peak is common for double-peaked Type IIb SNe with an extended Hydrogen envelope but is uncommon for normal Type Ibc SNe with very compact progenitors. In this paper, we systematically study a sample of 14 double-peaked Type Ibc SNe out of 475 Type Ibc SNe detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility. The rate of these events is ~ 3-9 % of Type Ibc SNe. A strong correlation is seen between the peak brightness of the first and the second peak. We perform a holistic analysis of this sample's photometric and spectroscopic properties. We find that six SNe have ejecta mass less than 1.5 Msun. Based on the nebular spectra and lightcurve properties, we estimate that the progenitor masses for these are less than ~ 12 Msun. The rest have an ejecta mass &gt; 2.4 Msun and a higher progenitor mass. This sample suggests that the SNe with low progenitor masses undergo late-time binary mass transfer. Meanwhile, the SNe with higher progenitor masses are consistent with wave-driven mass loss or pulsation-pair instability-driven mass loss simulations.</description>

Abstract: The nuclear reaction network within the interior of the Sun is an efficient MeV physics factory, and can produce long-lived particles generic to dark sector models. In this work we consider the sensitivity of satellite instruments, primarily the RHESSI Spectrometer, that observe the Quiet Sun in the MeV regime where backgrounds are low. We find that Quiet Sun observations offer a powerful and complementary probe in regions of parameter space where the long-lived particle decay length is longer than the radius of the Sun, and shorter than the distance between the Sun and Earth. We comment on connections to recent model-building work on heavy neutral leptons coupled to neutrinos and high-quality axions from mirror symmetries.</description>

      <title>Imprints of massive black-hole binaries on neighbouring decihertz gravitational-wave sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most massive black holes in our Universe form binaries at the centre of merging galaxies. The recent evidence for a gravitational-wave (GW) background from pulsar timing may constitute the first observation that these supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) merge. Yet, the most massive SMBHBs are out of reach of interferometric {GW} detectors and are exceedingly difficult to resolve individually with pulsar timing. These limitations call for unexplored strategies to detect individual SMBHBs in the uncharted frequency band $\lesssim10^{-5}\,\rm Hz$ in order to establish their abundance and decipher the coevolution with their host galaxies. Here we show that SMBHBs imprint detectable long-term modulations on GWs from stellar-mass binaries residing in the same galaxy. We determine that proposed deci-Hz GW interferometers sensitive to numerous stellar-mass binaries could uncover modulations from $\sim\mathscr{O}(10^{-1}$ - $10^4)$ SMBHBs with masses $\sim\mathscr{O}(10^7$ - $10^8)\,\rm M_\odot$ out to redshift $z\sim3.5$. This offers a unique opportunity to map the population of SMBHBs through cosmic time, which might remain inaccessible otherwise.</description>

      <title>Updated kinematics of the Radcliffe Wave: non-synchronous, dipole-like vertical oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kinematic information of the Radcliffe Wave (RW) is essential for determining its existence and gaining insights into its origin and evolution. In this work, we present an accurate measurement of the vertical velocity ($V_Z$) of RW by incorporating the radial velocity (RV) measures through two methods, which is crucial but was neglected previously. First, the velocities are measured towards young stars, using their RV measurements from APOGEE-2 and proper motion measurements from Gaia DR3. Second, we combine RV measurements toward clouds with proper motion measurements of associated Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) to determine the vertical velocities of the clouds. The results reveal that the oscillations in $V_Z$ are not synchronous with the vertical coordinate $Z$, which differs from the conclusions of previous studies. Instead, we find a 5 km$\cdot$s$^{-1}$$\cdot$kpc$^{-1}$ gradient in $V_Z$ along the RW, exhibiting a dipole-like pattern. Consequently, the kinematic arrangement does not show a corresponding coherence with the spatial arrangement, bringing the Radcliffe Wave model into question.</description>

      <title>SN 2023zaw: an ultra-stripped, nickel-poor supernova from a low-mass progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SN 2023zaw $-$ a sub-luminous ($\mathrm{M_r} = -16.7$ mag) and rapidly-evolving supernova ($\mathrm{t_{1/2,r}} = 4.9$ days), with the lowest nickel mass ($\approx0.002$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) measured among all stripped-envelope supernovae discovered to date. The photospheric spectra are dominated by broad He I and Ca NIR emission lines with velocities of $\sim10\ 000 - 12\ 000$ $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. The late-time spectra show prominent narrow He I emission lines at $\sim$1000$\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, indicative of interaction with He-rich circumstellar material. SN 2023zaw is located in the spiral arm of a star-forming galaxy. We perform radiation-hydrodynamical and analytical modeling of the lightcurve by fitting with a combination of shock-cooling emission and nickel decay. The progenitor has a best-fit envelope mass of $\approx0.2$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and an envelope radius of $\approx50$ $\mathrm{R_\odot}$. The extremely low nickel mass and low ejecta mass ($\approx0.5$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) suggest an ultra-stripped SN, which originates from a mass-losing low mass He-star (ZAMS mass $&lt;$ 10 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) in a close binary system. This is a channel to form double neutron star systems, whose merger is detectable with LIGO. SN 2023zaw underscores the existence of a previously undiscovered population of extremely low nickel mass ($&lt; 0.005$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) stripped-envelope supernovae, which can be explored with deep and high-cadence transient surveys.</description>

      <title>Planet formation regulated by galactic-scale interstellar turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planet formation occurs over a few Myr within protoplanetary discs of dust and gas, which are often assumed to evolve in isolation. However, extended gaseous structures have been uncovered around many protoplanetary discs, suggestive of late-stage in-fall from the interstellar medium (ISM). To quantify the prevalence of late-stage in-fall, we apply an excursion set formalism to track the local density and relative velocity of the ISM over the disc lifetime. We then combine the theoretical Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion rate with a simple disc evolution model, anchoring stellar accretion time-scales to observational constraints. Disc lifetimes, masses, stellar accretion rates and gaseous outer radii as a function of stellar mass and age are remarkably well-reproduced by our simple model that includes only ISM accretion. We estimate $20{-}70$ percent of discs may be mostly composed of material accreted in the most recent half of their lifetime, suggesting disc properties are not a direct test of isolated evolution models. Our calculations indicate that BHL accretion can also supply sufficient energy to drive turbulence in the outer regions of protoplanetary discs with viscous $\alpha_\mathrm{SS} \sim 10^{-5}- 10^{-1}$, although we emphasise that angular momentum transport and particularly accretion onto the star may still be driven by internal processes. Our simple approach can be easily applied to semi-analytic models. Our results represent a compelling case for regulation of planet formation by large-scale turbulence, with broad consequences for planet formation theory. This possibility urgently motivates deep observational surveys to confirm or refute our findings.</description>

Abstract: The GLOSTAR survey studies star formation with the VLA and the Effelsberg 100m telescope in the Galactic plane (-2d&lt;l&lt;60d; |b|&lt;1d) and the Cygnus X region with unprecedented sensitivity in both flux density (~50uJy/beam) and the capability of detecting emission with angular scales in the range from 1" to the largest radio structures in the Galaxy.
  We provide a complete GLOSTAR-VLA D-configuration radio source catalog for the covered part of the Galactic disk. A catalog for the pilot region (28d&lt;l&lt;36d) has been published in a previous paper and here we present the complementary catalog for the area within 2d&lt;l&lt;28d, 36d&lt;l&lt;60d and |b|&lt;1d.
  Observations were taken with the VLA in a 4-8GHz band to image 100 degrees$^2$ of the inner Galactic disk at a reference frequency of 5.8GHz, using 260h of telescope time. We determined spectral indices inside the observed band and in the frequency range 1.4-5.8GHz by complementing our results with those from the THOR survey (1-2GHz).
  The final images have an angular resolution of 18" and an average sensitivity of 123uJy/beam. The sensitivity is better (~60uJy/beam) in areas free of extended emission. The Galactic disk catalog presented in this work, consists of 11211 radio sources. Of these, 1965 are known large-scale structure sources such as star-forming region complexes, well-known SNRs, SNR candidates or parts thereof. The remaining 9227 are discrete individual sources. Source parameters, namely flux densities, sizes, spectral indices, and classifications are reported. We identify 769 HII region candidates, 359 are newly classified as such. The mean value of spectral indices of 225 HII regions is 0.14$\pm$0.02, consistent with most of them emitting optically thin thermal radio emission. Combining our results with the previously published catalog of the pilot region, the final GLOSTAR-VLA D-configuration catalog contains 12981 radio sources.</description>

      <title>Pair-instability evolution and explosions in massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16113</link>

Abstract: Very massive stars are radiation pressure dominated. Before running out of viable nuclear fuel, they can reach a thermodynamic state where electron-positron pair-production robs them of radiation support, triggering their collapse. Thermonuclear explosion(s) in the core ensue. These have long been predicted to result in either repeated episodic mass loss (pulsational pair instability), which reduces the mass available to eventually form a black hole, or, if sufficient energy is generated, the complete unbinding of all stellar material in one single explosive episode (pair instability supernova), which leaves behind no black hole. Despite theoretical agreement among modelers, the wide variety of predicted signatures and the rarity of very high-mass stellar progenitors have so far resulted in a lack of observational confirmation. Nevertheless, because of the impact of pair instability evolution on black hole masses relevant to gravitational-wave astronomy, as well as the present and upcoming expanded capabilities of time-domain astronomy and high redshift spectroscopy, interest in these explosion remains high. We review the current understanding of pair instability evolution, with particular emphasis on the known uncertainties. We also summarize the existing claimed electromagnetic counterparts and discuss prospects for future direct and indirect searches.</description>
