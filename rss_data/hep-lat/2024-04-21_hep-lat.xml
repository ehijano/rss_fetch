      <title>Semileptonic $\Omega_{b}\rightarrow \Omega_{c}{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$ transition in full QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the semileptonic decay of $\Omega_b\to\Omega_c~{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$ in three lepton channels. To this end, we use QCD sum rule method in three point framework to calculate the form factors defining the matrix elements of these transitions. Having calculated the form factors as building blocks, we calculate the decay widths and branching fractions of the exclusive decays in all lepton channels and compare the results with other theoretical predictions. The obtained results for branching ratios and ratio of branching fractions at different leptonic channels may help experimental groups in their search for these weak decays. Comparison of the obtained results with possible future experimental data can be useful to check the order of consistency between the standard model theory predictions and data on the heavy baryon decays.</description>

      <title>Hadronic Spectrum in the Chiral Large $N_c$ Extension of Quantum Chromodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Quantum Chromodynamics in the chiral large $N_c$ limit which contains a left-handed Weyl fermion in the fundamental representation, a left-handed Weyl fermion in the two index antisymmetric representation and $(N_c-3)$ left-handed Weyl fermions in the antifundamental representation of the $SU(N_c)$ gauge group. We construct gauge singlet composite operators and study their masses and correlation functions at large $N_c$.
  It is shown that all hadron masses scale as $\sim N_c^0 n_q$ where $n_q$ is the number of constituent quarks in the hadron. In addition by simple gluon exchange considerations it is seen that scattering amplitudes between hadrons have the same $N_c$ scaling as the mass of the lightest hadron involved. This is the case provided the hadrons in the scattering amplitude share a sufficiently large number of constituent quarks.
  The chiral large $N_c$ extension also allows for other non-trivial processes. For instance we consider two different baryonium states that are unique to this extension and that decay via emissions of two- and three-quark hadrons. Also other non-trivial scattering processes are considered. Finally, we study composites made of a mix of left- and right-handed fields. We categorize multiple groups of hadrons within the full spectrum according to their flavor structure. Within these groups all $n$-point functions scale the same.</description>

      <title>Tetraquarks made of sufficiently unequal-mass heavy quarks are bound in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tetraquarks, bound states composed of two quarks and two antiquarks, have been the subject of intense study but are challenging to understand from first principles. We apply variational and Green's function Monte Carlo methods to compute tetraquark ground-state energies in potential nonrelativistic QCD using a wide range of color and spatial wavefunctions. We find no evidence for bound tetraquarks composed of equal-mass quarks and antiquarks. Conversely, we find clear evidence for the existence of bound tetraquarks for sufficiently unequal quark/antiquark mass ratios at all overall mass scales where our effective theory results are applicable. We predict the critical mass ratios for bound state formation and study tetraquark bound states' spatial and color structure at leading order and next-to-leading order in potential nonrelativistic QCD.</description>

      <title>On the two-loop penguin contributions to the Anomalous Dimensions of four-quark operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Next-to-Leading Order (two-loop) contributions to the Anomalous Dimensions of $\Delta F = 1$ four-quark operators in QCD. We devise a test for anomalous dimensions, that we regard as of general interest, and by means of which we detect a problem in the results available in the literature. Deconstructing the steps leading to the available result, we identify the source of the problem, which is related to the operator known as $Q_{11}$. We show how to fix the problem and provide the corrected anomalous dimensions. With the insight of our findings, we propose an alternative approach to the one used in the literature which does not suffer from the identified disease, and which confirms our corrected results. We assess the numerical impact of our corrections, which happens to be in the ballpark of $5\%$ in certain entries of the evolution matrix. Our results are important for the correct resummation of Next-to-Leading Logarithms in analyses of physics beyond the Standard Model in $\Delta F = 1$ processes, such as the decays of Kaons and $B$-mesons.</description>
