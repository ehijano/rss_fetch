      <title>Griffiths phases in structurally disordered CeRhSn: Experimental evidence and theoretical modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our report paves the way for insight into a structural disorder and its impact on the physical properties of strongly correlated electron systems (SCESs). In a critical regime, each perturbation, e.g., disorder due to structural defects or doping, can have a significant effect on the nature of the quantum macrostate of these materials. For a select group of SCESs, we have empirically documented the Griffiths singularity, as exemplified by CeRhSn, which exhibits non-Fermi-liquid characteristics in susceptibility and specific heat. Our numerical analysis has supported the Griffiths phase scenario for CeRhSn and has revealed that its dc magnetic susceptibility is strongly dependent on the size of inhomogeneous magnetic particles that form in these materials. In the presence of strong disorder, we have proposed a magnetic phase diagram for CeRhSn. The classical Griffiths phase has been identified in the temperature range below the onset temperature of $T_G$ ~ 220 K, while the quantum Griffiths phase with non-Fermi liquid behavior emerges below the quantum critical temperature of $T_Q$ ~ 6 K. The phase diagram developed in this study bears notable similarities to the scenario previously proposed by Vojta for magnetic quantum phase transitions in disordered metals.</description>

      <title>The Luttinger Count is the Homotopy not the Physical Charge: Generalized Anomalies Characterize Non-Fermi Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Luttinger-Ward functional can be formulated as an operator insertion in the path integral and hence can be thought of as a generalized symmetry. The key result is that the associated charge, always quantized, defines the homotopy, not the physical charge. The disconnect between the two arises from divergences in the functional or equivalently zeros of the single-particle Green function. Such divergences produce an anomaly of the triangle-diagram type. As a result of this anomaly, we are able to account for the various deviations\cite{rosch,dave,altshuler,osborne,l3,l5} of the Luttinger count from the particle density. As a consequence, non-Fermi liquids can be classified generally by the well known anomaly structures in particle physics. Charges descending from generalized symmetries, as in the divergence of the Luttinger-Ward functional, are inherently non-local, their key experimental signature.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Paramagnetic State of the Kagome Kondo Lattice Compound YbV$_6$Sn$_6$: a $^{51}$V Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ is a recently discovered kagome-lattice metal that orders at $T_{\rm N}\approx0.4$~K. Its layered structure combines a triangular Kondo lattice of Yb$^{3+}$ ions with vanadium-based kagome planes, which may host an interplay between strong correlations and band topology. We report a $^{51}$V nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of the paramagnetic state of YbV$_6$Sn$_6$. Detailed field-angular dependence of single-crystal NMR spectra determined the principal-axis directions of the electric field gradient tensor at the $^{51}$V sites, as well as their nuclear quadrupole frequency, $\nu_{\rm Q}$, and asymmetry parameter, $\eta$. The Knight shift, $K$, was measured for different field orientations, and the analysis of $K$ against magnetic susceptibility to extract anisotropic hyperfine couplings. Accurate spectral assignments further enabled measurements of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate, $1/T_1$, for both in-plane and out-of-plane field directions. The temperature dependence of $1/T_1$ shows that out-of-plane spin fluctuations are suppressed below $\sim$20~K, whereas in-plane fluctuations are markedly enhanced, which might be understood by thermal depopulation of the low-lying crystalline electric field excited state. The notable anisotropy in $1/T_1$ indicates that the paramagnetic state of YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ is strongly affected by in-plane spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid between biologically inspired and quantum inspired many-body states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks can represent very different sorts of functions, including complex quantum many-body states. Tensor networks can also represent these states, have more structure and are easier to optimize. However, they can be prohibitively costly computationally in two or higher dimensions. Here, we propose a generalization of the perceptron - the perceptrain - which borrows features from the two different formalisms. We construct variational many-body ansatz from a simple network of perceptrains. The network can be thought of as a neural network with a few distinct features inherited from tensor networks. These include efficient local optimization akin to the density matrix renormalization algorithm, instead of optimizing of all the parameters at once; the possibility to dynamically increase the number of parameters during the optimization; the possibility to compress the state to avoid overfitting; and a structure that remains quantum-inspired. We showcase the ansatz using a combination of Variational Monte-Carlo (VMC) and Green Function Monte-Carlo (GFMC) on a $10\times 10$ transverse field quantum Ising model with a long range $1/r^6$ antiferromagnetic interaction. The model corresponds to the Rydberg (cold) atoms platform proposed for quantum annealing. We consistently find a very high relative accuracy for the ground state energy, around $10^{-5}$ for VMC and $10^{-6}$ for GFMC in all regimes of parameters, including in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition. We used very small ranks ($\sim 2-5$) of perceptrains, as opposed to multiples of thousand used in matrix product states. The optimization of the energy was robust with respect to the choice of initial conditions and hyper-parameters, in contrast to a common experience when using neural network wave functions.</description>

      <title>Frustrated $J_1-J_2$ Diamond Lattice Antiferromagnet Co$_2$Ti$_3$O$_8$ with a Vacancy-ordered Spinel Structure Synthesized via a Topochemical Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metastable Co$_2$Ti$_3$O$_8$ was synthesized through a topochemical reaction using Li$_2$CoTi$_3$O$_8$ as the precursor, resulting in a vacancy-ordered spinel structure. Crystal structure analysis confirmed that Co ions selectively occupy the A-site, giving rise to a frustrated diamond lattice. Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements revealed antiferromagnetic order at 4.4 K, which is markedly suppressed compared to the negative Weiss temperature of ${\sim}-27$ K, indicating a high degree of frustration effects. Pulsed high-field magnetization measurements revealed a four-step successive magnetic phase transition, demonstrating that Co$_2$Ti$_3$O$_8$ is a promising candidate for a frustrated $J_1-J_2$ diamond lattice. Additionally, the $J_2/J_1$ ration estimated from the molecular field approximation suggests the possibility of a spiral ordered ground state. These observations highlight the potential of frustrated magnetism in ordered spinel structures to expand the material search space for quantum magnetism, including magnetic skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Tensor network method for real-space topology in quasicrystal Chern mosaics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing topological invariants in two-dimensional quasicrystals and super-moire matter is an exceptional open challenge, due to the absence of translational symmetry and the colossal number of sites inherent to these systems. Here, we establish a method to compute local topological invariants of exceptionally large systems using tensor networks, enabling the computation of invariants for Hamiltonians with hundreds of millions of sites, several orders of magnitude above the capabilities of conventional methodologies. Our approach leverages a tensor-network representation of the density matrix using a Chebyshev tensor network algorithm, enabling large-scale calculations of topological markers in quasicrystalline and moire systems. We demonstrate our methodology with two-dimensional quasicrystals featuring 8-fold and 10-fold rotational symmetries and mosaics of Chern phases. Our work establishes a powerful method to compute topological phases in exceptionally large-scale topological systems, establishing the required tool to rationalize generic super-moire and quasicrystalline topological matter.</description>

      <title>Landau-Ginzburg Paradigm of Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically ordered matter phases have been regarded as beyond the Landau-Ginzburg symmetry breaking paradigm of matter phases. Recent studies of anyon condensation in topological phases, however, may fit topological phases back in the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. To truly do so, we realized that the string-net model of topological phases is in fact an effective lattice gauge theory coupled with anyonic matter once two modifications are made: (1) We reinterpret anyons as matter fields coupled to lattice gauge fields, thus extending the HGW model to a genuine Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. (2) By explicitly incorporating the internal degrees of freedom of anyons, we construct an enlarged Hilbert space that supports well-defined gauge transformations and covariant coupling, restoring the analogy with conventional lattice gauge field theory. In this modified string-net model, topological phase transitions induced by anyon condensation and their consequent phenomena, such as order parameter fields, coherent states, Goldstone modes, and gapping gauge degrees of freedom, can be formulated exactly as Landau's effective theory of the Higgs mechanism. To facilitate the understanding, we also compare anyon condensation to/with the Higgs boson condensation in the electroweak theory and the Cooper pair condensation.</description>

      <title>A 2D-CFT Factory: Critical Lattice Models from Competing Anyon Condensation Processes in SymTO/SymTFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a ``CFT factory'' : a novel algorithm of methodically generating 2D lattice models that would flow to 2D conformal fixed points in the infrared. These 2D models are realised by giving critical boundary conditions to 3D topological orders (symTOs/symTFTs) described by string-net models, often called the strange correlators. We engineer these critical boundary conditions by introducing a commensurate amount of non-commuting anyon condensates. The non-invertible symmetries preserved at the critical point can be controlled by studying a novel ``refined condensation tree''. Our structured method generates an infinite family of critical lattice models, including the A-series minimal models, and uncovers previously unknown critical points. Notably, we find at least three novel critical points (c$\approx 1.3$, $1.8$, and $2.5$ respectively) preserving the Haagerup symmetries, in addition to recovering previously reported ones. The condensation tree, together with a generalised Kramers-Wannier duality, predicts precisely large swathes of phase boundaries, fixes almost completely the global phase diagram, and sieves out second order phase transitions. This is not only illustrated in well-known examples (such as the 8-vertex model related to the $A_5$ category) but also further verified with precision numerics, using our improved (non-invertible) symmetry-preserving tensor-network RG, in novel examples involving the Haagerup symmetries. We show that critical couplings can be precisely encoded in the categorical data (Frobenius algebras and quantum dimensions in unitary fusion categories), thus establishing a powerful, systematic route to discovering and potentially classifying new conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Spinless and spinful charge excitations in moir\'e Fractional Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractionally charged elementary excitations, the quasi-electron and quasi-hole, are one of the hallmarks of the fractional Chern insulator (FCI). In this work, we observe that spontaneous spin polarization in twisted MoTe$_2$ leads to multiple species of low-energy quasi-particles distinguished by their spin quantum numbers. We perform large-scale exact diagonalization (ED) calculations to investigate the nature of these excitations and develop a method to extract their fundamental energetic properties. Focusing on $\theta = 3.7^{\circ}$ and filling factor $\nu = -2/3$ relevant to recent experiments, we show that spin-preserving (spinless) charge excitations have smaller gap than spin-flipping (spinful) excitations both with and without band mixing. This result is in qualitative agreement with the measured magnetic field dependence of the transport gaps. Beyond the spinless and spinful quasi-particle gaps, we extract the full quasi-electron and quasi-hole ``band structure'' and find significant dispersion with emergent magnetic translation symmetry -- a fundamental departure from the immobile excitations of the quantum Hall fluid. Our results establish a framework for computing the properties of novel elementary excitations in FCIs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the spectral properties of the $4$-fermion Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with interaction sourced from a L\'evy Stable (fat-tailed) distribution. L\'evy random matrices are known to demonstrate non-ergodic behaviour through the emergence of a mobility edge. We study the eigenvalue distribution, focusing on long- and short-range correlations and extreme statistics. This model demonstrates a crossover from chaotic to integrable behaviour (in the spectral correlations) as the distribution becomes increasingly fat-tailed. We investigate this crossover through a hierarchical analysis of the eigenvalue spectrum, based on the multi-fractal hierarchy of the L\'evy Stable distribution. The crossover is explained in terms of a genuine many-body effect, distinct from the transition (controlled by a mobility edge) in the L\'evy random matrices. We conclude with comments on the model's solvability and discussion of possible models with exact transitions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement cost hierarchies in quantum fragmented mixed states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong symmetries enforce non-trivial quantum entanglement patterns on the stationary states of symmetric open quantum dynamics. Specifically, non-commuting conserved quantities lead to long-range quantum entanglement even for infinite temperature mixed states within fixed symmetry sectors. Leveraging the commutant algebra framework, we show that various bipartite entanglement measures for mixed states -- including exact and asymptotically-exact entanglement costs and squashed entanglement, which are generally intractable for a generic many-body mixed state -- can be computed for this class of states. In particular, we focus on strongly symmetric maximally mixed states arising from the Temperley-Lieb model, which features quantum Hilbert space fragmentation with exponentially large (in system size) non-Abelian commutants. We find that while both the logarithmic negativity and the `exact' entanglement cost for equal-size bipartitions scale with the volume of the system, the entanglement of formation, squashed entanglement, entanglement cost, and distillable entanglement exhibit subextensive scaling. We relate this separation in entanglement measures to a parametric difference between the entanglement cost of exact and asymptotically-exact state preparations, and infer this to be a consequence of a particular pattern of quantum Hilbert space fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Orbital-Selective Photodoping Melts Charge Order in Overdoped Bi-based Cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity in cuprates remains one of the enduring puzzles of condensed matter physics, with charge order (CO) playing a central yet elusive role, particularly in the overdoped regime. Here, we employ time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant X-ray scattering at a free-electron laser to probe the transient electronic density of states and ultrafast CO dynamics in overdoped (Bi,Pb)$_{2.12}$Sr$_{1.88}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$. We reveal a striking pump laser wavelength dependence - the 800 nm light fails to suppress CO, whereas the 400 nm light effectively melts it. This behavior originates from the fact that 400 nm photons can promote electrons from the Zhang-Rice singlet band to the upper Hubbard band or apical oxygen states, while 800 nm photons lack the energy to excite electrons across the charge-transfer gap. The CO recovery time ($\sim$3 ps) matches that of the underdoped cuprates, indicating universal electronic instability in the phase diagram. Additionally, melting overdoped CO requires an order-of-magnitude higher fluence highlighting the role of lattice interactions. Our findings demonstrate orbital-selective photodoping and provide a route to ultrafast control of emergent quantum phases in correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Derivation of a non-stoichiometric 1/1 quasicrystal approximant from a stoichiometric 2/1 quasicrystal approximant and maximization of magnetocaloric effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present research introduces a novel strategy for tuning magnetic properties by overcoming the compositional limitation of stoichiometric intermetallic compounds via extension of their stability into a new dimension within valence electron-per-atom (e/a) parameter space. Focusing on approximant crystals (ACs), a "double hetero-valent elemental substitution" is employed in a stoichiometric Ga-Pt-Gd 2/1 AC whereby e/a is lowered from 1.92 to 1.60. Through this approach a new family of stable Ga-based Tsai-type 1/1 ACs with exceptionally wide composition stability within e/a space is derived. Remarkably, magnetic ground state is altered from initially spin-glass to ferromagnetic (FM) with second order phase transition and mean-field-like critical behavior. More importantly, through this strategy, the isothermal magnetic entropy change enhanced significantly and reached a maximum value of -8.7 J/K mol-Gd under a 5 T magnetic field change, even comparable to leading rare-earth magnetocaloric materials including RCo2 phases. These findings demonstrate the high potential of a double hetero-valent elemental substitution for tailoring magnetic properties and magnetocaloric response in stoichiometric compounds, offering a new pathway for designing high-performance magnetic refrigeration materials even beyond the quasicrystals and ACs.</description>

      <title>Kondo effect under arbitrary spin-momentum locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kondo effect originates from the spin exchange scattering of itinerant electrons with a localized magnetic impurity. Here, we consider generalization of Weyl-type electrons with their spin locked on a spherical Fermi surface in an arbitrary way and study how such spin-momentum locking affects the Kondo effect. After introducing a suitable model Hamiltonian, a simple formula for the Kondo temperature is derived with the second-order perturbation theory, which proves to depend only on the spin averaged over the Fermi surface. In particular, the Kondo temperature is unaffected as long as the average spin vanishes, but decreases as the average spin increases in its magnitude, and eventually vanishes when the spin is completely polarized on the Fermi surface, illuminating the role of spin-momentum locking in the Kondo effect.</description>

      <title>Thermal avalanches in isolated many-body localized systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body localization is a profound phase of matter affecting the entire spectrum which emerges in the presence of disorder in interacting many-body systems. Recently, the stability of many-body localization has been challenged by the avalanche mechanism, in which a small thermal region can spread, destabilizing localization and leading to global thermalization of the system. A key unresolved question is the critical competition between the thermal region's influence and the disorder strength required to trigger such an avalanche. Here, we numerically investigate many-body localization stability in an isolated Heisenberg spin chain of size $L$ subjected to a disordered magnetic field. By embedding a tunable thermal region of size $P$, we analyze the system's behavior in both static and dynamical regimes using entanglement entropy and the gap ratio. Our study yields two main findings. Firstly, for strong disorder, the avalanche only occurs if the thermal region scales with system size, specifically when $P/L$ exceeds a threshold value. Secondly, at strong disorder, we identify an intermediate phase between many-body localization and ergodic behavior as $P$ increases. This intermediate phase leaves its finger print in both static and dynamic properties of the system and tends to vanish in the thermodynamic limit. Although our simulations are restricted to finite system sizes, the analysis suggests that these results hold in the thermodynamic limit for isolated many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Opposite pressure effects on magnetic phase transitions in NiBr2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NiBr2, similar to NiI2, exhibits the onset of collinear antiferromagnetism at a subroom temperature and, with further cooling, undergoes a transition to a helimagnetic ordering associated with multiferroic behavior. This work investigates the hydrostatic pressure effects on magnetic phase transitions in NiBr2. We measured isobaric temperature dependencies of AC magnetic susceptibility at various pressures up to 3 GPa. The experimental data are interpreted in conjunction with the results of theoretical calculations focused on pressure influence on the hierarchy of exchange interactions. Contrary to the NiI2 case, the phase transition to helimagnetism rapidly shifts to lower temperatures with increasing pressure. Similar to the NiI2, the Neel temperature increases with pressure. The rate of increase accelerates when the helimagnetic phase is suppressed by pressure. The ab initio calculations link these contrasting trends to pressure-enhanced magnetic exchange interactions. Similarly to the NiI2 case, the stabilization of the collinear AFM phase is driven primarily by the second-nearest interlayer coupling (j2'). Furthermore, the ratio of in-plane interactions makes helimagnetic order in NiBr2 much more volatile, which permits its suppression with already small pressures. These findings highlight the principal role of interlayer interactions in the distinct response of NiBr2 and NiI2 magnetic phases to external pressure.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Hubbard model on a graphene hexagon: Strengths of IQPE and noise constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers transformative potential for simulating real-world materials, providing a powerful platform to investigate complex quantum systems across quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. In this work, we leverage this capability to simulate the Hubbard model on a six-site graphene hexagon using Qiskit, employing the Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation (IQPE) and adiabatic evolution algorithms to determine its ground-state properties. Noiseless simulations yield accurate ground-state energies (GSEs), charge and spin densities, and correlation functions, all in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization, underscoring the precision and reliability of quantum simulation for strongly correlated electron systems. However, deploying IQPE and adiabatic evolution on today's noisy quantum hardware remains highly challenging. To examine these limitations, we utilize the Qiskit Aer simulator with a custom noise model tailored to the characteristics of IBM's real backend. This model includes realistic depolarizing gate errors, thermal relaxation, and readout noise, allowing us to explore how these factors degrade simulation accuracy. Preliminary hardware runs on IBM devices further expose discrepancies between simulated and real-world noise, emphasizing the gap between ideal and practical implementations. Overall, our results highlight the promise of quantum computing for simulating correlated quantum materials, while also revealing the significant challenges posed by hardware noise in achieving accurate and reliable physical predictions using current quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a technique to construct gapped lattice models using defects in topological field theory. We illustrate with 2+1 dimensional models, for example Chern-Simons theories. These models are local, though the state space is not necessarily a tensor product of vector spaces over the complex numbers. The Hamiltonian is a sum of commuting projections. We also give a topological field theory construction of Levin-Wen models.</description>

Abstract: We study charge fluctuations of a family of stochastic charged cellular automata away from the deterministic single-file limit and obtain the exact typical charge probability distributions, known to be anomalous, using hydrodynamics. The cellular automata considered are examples of linearly degenerate systems where two distinct mechanisms of diffusion, namely normal and convective diffusion, coexist. Our formalism, based on macroscopic fluctuation theory, allows us to describe current fluctuations stemming from these two diffusive processes, and we expect it to be applicable to generic linearly degenerate systems. The derived probability distributions match the exact microscopic result and numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: Determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) is a widely used unbiased numerical method for simulating strongly correlated electron systems. However, the update process in DQMC is often a bottleneck for its efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a generalized delay update scheme that can handle both onsite and extended interactions. Our delay update scheme can be implemented in both zero-temperature and finite-temperature versions of DQMC. We apply the delay update scheme to various strongly correlated electron models and evaluate its efficiency under different conditions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed delay update scheme significantly improves the efficiency of DQMC simulations, enable it to simulate larger system size.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the single-particle excitation spectra of a one-dimensional Hubbard model at half filling using an infinite matrix-product state and elucidate the discretized energy spectra emerging under the influence of a dc electric field. In a weak electric-field regime, we observe two kinds of spectral structures in the density of states. With increasing the electric-field strength, the discretized spectra, the period of which is proportional to the strength, become dominant, and the density of states exhibits the Wannier-Stark ladder in their spectra. In addition, we also simulate time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy using an ultrashort terahertz pump pulse that approximates a dc electric field. Our results represent a significant step forward in understanding the states in strongly correlated electron systems driven by a static electric field.</description>

      <title>Broken Symmetry in Ideal Chern Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations of the fractional anomalous quantum Hall effect in moir\'e materials have reignited the interest in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). The chiral limit in which analytic Landau level-like single-particle states form an ``ideal" Chern band and local interactions lead to Laughlin-like FCIs at $1/3$ filling, has been very useful for understanding these systems by relating them to the lowest Landau level. We show, however, that, even in the idealized chiral limit, a fluctuating quantum geometry is associated with strongly broken symmetries and a phenomenology very different from that of Landau levels. In particular, particle-hole symmetry is strongly violated and e.g. at $2/3$ filling an emergent interaction driven Fermi liquid state with no Landau level counterpart is energetically favoured. In fact, even the exact Laughlin-like zero modes at $1/3$ filling have a non-uniform density tracking the underlying quantum geometry. Switching to a Coulomb interaction, the ideal Chern band with electron filling of $1/4$ features trivial charge density wave states. Moreover, applying a particle-hole transformation reveals that the ideal Chern band with hole filling of $3/4$ supports a quantum anomalous Hall crystal with quantized Hall conductance of $e^2/h$. These phenomena have no direct lowest Landau level counterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals have a variety of intriguing physical properties, including topologically protected electronic states that coexist with conducting states. Possible exploitation of topologically protected states in a conducting material is promising for technological applications. Weyl semimetals that form in a noncentrosymmetric structure that also contain magnetic moments may host a variety of emergent phenomena that cannot be seen in magnetic, centrosymmetric Weyl materials. It can be difficult to distinguish definitively between a centrosymmetric structure and one of its noncentrosymmetric subgroups with standard powder X-ray diffractometers in cases where two atoms in the compound have nearly the same atomic number, as is the case for the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe. In these cases, a careful single-crystal neutron diffraction experiment with high-angle reflections provides complimentary information to X-ray diffraction and definitively resolves any ambiguity between centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric crystal structures. Single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements on the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe confirm that its structure is noncentrosymmetric, described by space group 109 $\left(I4_1md\right)$ rather than the centrosymmetric space group 141 $\left(I4_1/amd\right)$. There are many high-angle reflections in the data set that give clear, physically intuitive evidence that CeGaGe forms with $I4_1md$ symmetry since Bragg planes of these reflections can contain Ga with no Ge or vice versa, whereas the Bragg planes for a structure with $I4_1/amd$ symmetry would have a mix of Ga and Ge. Further, in some crystals we have studied, there is clear evidence for a structural transition from body-centered $I4_1md$ symmetry to primitive $P4_3$ and/or $P4_1$ symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing the state-of-the-art time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) algorithm, we compute the spectra of charge-neutral excitations in the $\nu=1/2$ (bosonic) \updated{ and $1/3$ (fermionic) fractional Chern insulator (FCI)} on the Haldane honeycomb lattice model. The magnetoroton visualized from the dynamic density structure factor acquires a minimum gap at finite momentum that can go soft with increasing interaction and give rise to a charge density wave (CDW) at the same wavevector. As the system approaches the FCI-to-CDW transition point, we observe a pronounced sharpening of the roton mode, suggesting that the magnetoroton behaves more like a quasiparticle as it softens. Notably, this occurs while the single-particle gap remains finite. Besides the magnetoroton at finite momentum, we also construct quadrupolar chiral operators in a discrete lattice and resolve the chiral graviton mode around the $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone. Furthermore, we show the different chiralities of the gravitons of FCIs with opposite-sign Hall conductance for the first time.</description>

Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons can form a coherent state at low temperatures akin to a BCS condensate. The resulting phase is known as the excitonic insulator and has superfluid properties. Here we theoretically study the excitonic insulator in a pair of recently proposed two-dimensional candidate materials with nontrivial band topology. Contrary to previous works, we include interaction channels that violate the individual electron and hole number conservations. These are on equal footing with the number-conserving processes due to the substantial overlap of Wannier orbitals of different bands, which cannot be exponentially localized due to the nontrivial Chern numbers of the latter. Their inclusion is crucial to determine the symmetry of the electron-hole pairing, and by performing mean-field calculations at nonzero temperatures we find that the order parameter in these systems is a chiral $d$-wave. We discuss the nontrivial topology of this unconventional state and discuss some properties of the associated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. In particular, we argue that here it becomes a smooth crossover and estimate the associated temperature to lie between 50 K and 75 K on realistic substrates, over an order of magnitude larger than in the number-conserving approximation where $s$-wave pairing is favored. Our results highlight the interplay between topology at the single-particle level and long-range interactions, motivating further research in systems where both phenomena coexist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the ideas behind the duality web to construct numerous conformal field theories mediating the phase transitions between various symmetry broken and topological phases. In particular we obtain the full field theory version of the Kennedy Tasaki transformation, mapping a gapless theory mediating a topological phase transition of symmetry protected topological orders to a standard symmetry breaking one in a 1+1 dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. When we consider all possible discrete gauging operations, we obtain bosonic and fermionic webs with 9 critical theories per web, each connecting 4 separate gapped phases, some of them topological. Bosonization maps the two webs into each other. In addition to discussing the multi-critical theory connecting the four gapped phases in each phase diagram, we discuss the partially gapped theories connecting two of those four. Some of these are gapless symmetry protected topological phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetotransport properties of the half-filled antiferromagnetic (AF) one-band Hubbard model under an external magnetic field using the single-site dynamical mean-field approximation (DMFT). Particular attention is paid to the mechanisms driving the magnetoresistivity behavior. We analyze the dependence of magnetoresistivity on temperature and the strength of the applied magnetic field, providing insights into the interplay between magnetic fluctuations and transport properties in AF systems.</description>

      <title>Ordering the topological order in the fractional quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the possible topological order/topological quantum field theory of different quantum Hall systems. Given the value of the Hall conductivity, we constrain the global symmetry of the low-energy theory and its anomaly. Specifically, the one-form global symmetry and its anomaly are presented as the organizing principle of these systems. This information is powerful enough to lead to a unique minimal topological order (or a small number of minimal topological orders). Almost all of the known experimentally discovered topological orders are these minimal theories. Since this work is interdisciplinary, we made a special effort to relate to people with different backgrounds by providing translations between different perspectives.</description>

      <title>Interface-induced collective phase transition in VO2-based bilayers studied by layer-selective spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the origin of collective electronic phase transitions induced at the heterointerface between monoclinic insulating (MI) VO2 and rutile metallic (RM) electron-doped VO2 layers using in situ soft x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SXPES) on nanoscale VO2/V0.99W0.01O2 (001)R bilayers. Thanks to the surface sensitivity of SXPES, we determined the changes in the electronic structure and V-V dimerization in each constituent layer separately. The layer-selective observation of the electronic and crystal structures in the upper VO2 layer of the bilayer indicates that the MI-phase VO2 layer undergoes a transition to the RM phase by forming the heterointerface. Detailed temperature-dependent measurements reveal that the RM-phase VO2 undergoes a transition to the MI phase with a decrease in temperature, as in the case of a VO2 single-layer film. Furthermore, during the temperature-induced phase transition in the VO2 layer, the spectra are well described by an in-plane phase separation of the RM and MI phases. These results suggest that the interface-induced transition from the MI to the RM phase in the VO2 layer of bilayers occurs as a collective phase transition derived from the static energy balance between the interfacial energy and the bulk free energies of the constituent layers.</description>

      <title>Absence of topological order in the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code which corresponds to the $U(1)$-symmetry enriched toric code with two distinct star sublattices. One can therefore tune from the limit of isolated stars to the uniform system. The uniform system has been conjectured to possess non-Abelian topological order based on quantum Monte Carlo simulations suggesting a non-trivial ground-state degeneracy depending on the compactification of the finite clusters. Here we show that these non-trivial properties can be naturally explained in the perturbative limit of isolated stars. Indeed, the compactification dependence of the ground-state degeneracy can be traced back to geometric constraints stemming from the plaquette operators. Further, the ground-state degeneracy is fully lifted in fourth-order degenerate perturbation theory giving rise to a non-topological phase with confined fracton excitations. These fractons are confined for small perturbations so that they cannot exist as single low-energy excitation in the thermodynamic limit but only as topologically trivially composite particles. However, the confinement scale is shown to be surprisingly large so that finite-size gaps are extremely small on finite clusters up to the uniform limit which is calculated explicitly by high-order series expansions. Our findings suggest that these gaps were not distinguished from finite-size effects by the recent quantum Monte Carlo simulation in the uniform limit. All our results therefore point towards the absence of topological order in the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code along the whole parameter axis.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Quantum Quenches of Conformal Field Theory with Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a method to calculate generic time-dependent correlation functions for inhomogeneous quantum quenches in (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) induced by sudden Hamiltonian deformations that modulate the energy density inhomogeneously. Our work particularly focuses on the effects of spatial boundaries, which have remained unresolved by previous analytical methods. For generic post-quench Hamiltonian, we develop a generic method to calculate the correlations by mirroring the system, which otherwise are Euclidean path integrals in complicated spacetime geometries difficult to calculate. On the other hand, for a special class of inhomogeneous post-quench Hamiltonians, including the M\"obius and sine-square-deformation Hamiltonians, we show that the quantum quenches exhibit simple boundary effects calculable from Euclidean path integrals in a straightforward strip spacetime geometry. Applying our method to the time evolution of entanglement entropy, we find that for generic cases, the entanglement entropy shows discontinuities (shockwave fronts) propagating from the boundaries.In contrast, such discontinuities are absent in cases with simple boundary effects. We verify that our generic CFT formula matches well with numerical calculations from free fermion tight-binding models for various quench scenarios.</description>

      <title>Three-body Fermi liquid corrections for an infinite-$U$ SU($N$) Anderson impurity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the three-body Fermi liquid effects in the SU($N$) Anderson impurity model in the strong interaction limit where the occupation number $N_d^{}$ of the impurity levels varies over the range of $0&lt;N_d^{}&lt;1$. The three-body correlation of impurity electrons contributes to the next-to-leading order terms of transport coefficients at low energies when the electron-hole symmetry, the time-reversal symmetries, or both are broken by external fields or potentials. Using the numerical renormalization group approach, we calculate the differential conductance and the nonlinear current noise through quantum dots, as well as the thermal conductivity of both quantum dots and magnetic alloys. Specifically, we focus on the SU(2) and SU(4) cases and demonstrate how the three-body contributions evolve in the limit of $U\to\infty$, across the $1/N$-filling Kondo regime and the valence fluctuation regime. Our results clarify how the three-body correlation affects low-energy transport, with a crucial dependence on the occupation number $N_d^{}$. We also show that the three-body correlation strongly couples with asymmetries in the tunnel couplings between quantum dots and reservoirs; in particular it significantly affects the nonlinear current through the quarter-filling Kondo state for $N=4$.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Markov length: a diagnostic for fault tolerance via mixed-state phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a correspondence between the fault-tolerance of local stabilizer codes experiencing measurement and physical errors and the mixed-state phases of decohered resource states in one higher dimension. Drawing from recent developments in mixed-state phases of matter, this motivates a diagnostic of fault-tolerance, which we refer to as the spacetime Markov length. This is a length scale determined by the decay of the (classical) conditional mutual information of repeated syndrome measurement outcomes in spacetime. The diagnostic is independent of the decoder, and its divergence signals the intrinsic breakdown of fault tolerance. As a byproduct, we find that decoherence may be useful for exposing transitions from higher-form symmetry-protected topological phases driven by both incoherent and coherent perturbations.</description>

      <title>Exchange-phase erasure in anyonic Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-particle interferometry is an important tool for extracting the exchange statistics of quantum particles. We theoretically investigate the prospects of such interferometry to probe the statistics of point-like anyonic excitations injected in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) setup based on a quantum point contact device in the fractional quantum Hall regime. We compute the standard HOM ratio, i.e., the ratio of tunneling noises for two- and one-particle injections, and find that for point-like anyons, it only depends on the temperature and the anyon scaling dimension. Importantly, the latter is not necessarily related to the exchange phase. In fact, we establish that the HOM ratio does not reveal the exchange phase of the injected anyons: For injection-time delays that are small compared to the thermal time scale, we find that the exchange phase accumulated due to time-domain braiding between injected and thermally activated anyons is erased due to two mutually canceling sub-processes. In contrast, for time delays large compared to the thermal time, only a single sub-process contributes to the braiding, but the accumulated phase is canceled in the HOM ratio. These findings suggest caution when interpreting HOM interferometry experiments with anyons and approaches beyond the standard HOM ratio are thus necessary to extract anyonic statistics with two-particle interferometry experiments.</description>

      <title>Signatures of three-dimensional photo-induced superconductivity in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical excitation of large-amplitude apical oxygen phonon oscillations has been shown to renormalize the electronic properties of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, inducing a superconducting-like optical response above equilibrium $T_C$. All of the evidence collected so far has been based on the changes of the THz frequency $c$-axis response. In these measurements, the capacitive interlayer coupling was seen to transform into a superconducting-like inductive response. This assignment was strengthened by recent measurements of ultrafast magnetic field expulsion. Here, we report the first experimental determination of the transient in-plane optical properties, which has so far been elusive due to the high equilibrium reflectivity and the need to evaluate minute changes in the optical response. We report the appearance of a photo-induced in-plane optical gap $2\Delta\simeq30$ cm$^{-1}$ and a divergent imaginary conductivity, both consistent with photo-induced superconductivity. A global fit to these data suggests that in- and out-of-plane electronic properties never completely equilibrate during the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian skin effects in two-dimensional electron systems at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liouvillian skin effects, manifested as the localization of Liouvillian eigenstates around the boundary, are distinctive features of non-Hermitian systems and are particularly notable for their impact on system dynamics. Despite their significance, Liouvillian skin effects have not been sufficiently explored in electron systems. In this work, we demonstrate that a two-dimensional electron system on a substrate exhibits $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Liouvillian skin effects due to the interplay among energy dissipations, spin-orbit coupling, and a transverse magnetic field. In addition, our analysis of the temperature dependence reveals that these Liouvillian skin effects become pronounced below the energy scale of band splitting induced by the spin-orbit coupling and the magnetic field. While our $\mathbb{Z}$ Liouvillian skin effect leads to charge accumulation under quench dynamics, its relaxation time is independent of the system size, in contrast to that of previously reported Liouvillian skin effects. This difference is attributed to the scale-free behavior of the localization length, which is analogous to non-Hermitian critical skin effects.</description>

      <title>Disturbing news about the $d=2+\epsilon$ expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM) in $d=2+\epsilon$ has long been conjectured to describe the same conformal field theory (CFT) as the Wilson-Fisher (WF) $O(N)$ fixed point obtained from the $\lambda(\phi^2)^2$ model in $d=4-\epsilon$. In this work, we put this conjecture into question, building on the recent observation [Jones (2024)] that the NLSM CFT possesses a protected operator with dimension $N-1$, which is instead absent in the WF $O(N)$ CFT. For $N=3$, we investigate the possibility of lifting this operator via multiplet recombination - the only known mechanism that could resolve this mismatch. We compute the anomalous dimension of the lightest operator that could participate in recombination, and find that it remains too heavy to allow for this scenario. This suggests that the NLSM $O(3)$ fixed point in $d=2+\epsilon$ is not continuously connected to the WF $O(3)$ CFT, and may instead describe an alternative universality class, such as the hedgehog-suppressed critical point, corresponding to the N\'eel-VBS phase transition in $3$D. We also discuss how to generalize this analysis to $N&gt;3$.</description>
