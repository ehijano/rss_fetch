      <title>Perspective: Floquet engineering topological states from effective models towards realistic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With significant advances in classifying and cataloguing topological matter, the focus of topological physics has shifted towards quantum control, particularly the creation and manipulation of topological phases of matter. Floquet engineering, the concept of tailoring a system by periodic fields, offers a powerful tool to manipulate electronic properties of condensed systems, and even to create exotic non-equilibrium topological states that are impossibly present in equilibrium scenarios. In this perspective, we give a brief review of recent progress in theoretical investigations of Floquet engineering topological states from effective models towards realistic materials. We show that light irradiation can realize various desired topological states through the introduction of symmetry breaking, such as first- and higher-order Weyl fermions, quadrupole topological insulator with periodic driving and disorder, quantum anomalous Hall effects with a tunable Chern number, as well as beyond. Moreover, based on first-principles calculations and Floquet theorem, we show several realistic material candidates proposed as potential hosts for promising Floquet topological states, facilitating their verification in experiments. We believe that our perspective on Floquet engineering of topological states will advance further studies of rich exotic light-induced phenomena in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Personalized and uncertainty-aware coronary hemodynamics simulations: From Bayesian estimation to improved multi-fidelity uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of coronary hemodynamics have improved non-invasive clinical risk stratification and treatment outcomes for coronary artery disease, compared to relying on anatomical imaging alone. However, simulations typically use empirical approaches to distribute total coronary flow amongst the arteries in the coronary tree. This ignores patient variability, the presence of disease, and other clinical factors. Further, uncertainty in the clinical data often remains unaccounted for in the modeling pipeline. We present an end-to-end uncertainty-aware pipeline to (1) personalize coronary flow simulations by incorporating branch-specific coronary flows as well as cardiac function; and (2) predict clinical and biomechanical quantities of interest with improved precision, while accounting for uncertainty in the clinical data. We assimilate patient-specific measurements of myocardial blood flow from CT myocardial perfusion imaging to estimate branch-specific coronary flows. We use adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the joint posterior distributions of model parameters with simulated noise in the clinical data. Additionally, we determine the posterior predictive distribution for relevant quantities of interest using a new approach combining multi-fidelity Monte Carlo estimation with non-linear, data-driven dimensionality reduction. Our framework recapitulates clinically measured cardiac function as well as branch-specific coronary flows under measurement uncertainty. We substantially shrink the confidence intervals for estimated quantities of interest compared to single-fidelity and state-of-the-art multi-fidelity Monte Carlo methods. This is especially true for quantities that showed limited correlation between the low- and high-fidelity model predictions. Moreover, the proposed estimators are significantly cheaper to compute for a specified confidence level or variance.</description>

      <title>Review and Novel Formulae for Transmittance and Reflectance of Wedged Thin Films on absorbing Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historically, spectroscopic techniques have been essential for studying the optical properties of thin solid films. However, existing formulae for both normal transmission and reflection spectroscopy often rely on simplified theoretical assumptions, which may not accurately align with real-world conditions. For instance, it is common to assume (1) that the thin solid layers are deposited on completely transparent thick substrates and (2) that the film surface forms a specular plane with a relatively small wedge angle. While recent studies have addressed these assumptions separately, this work presents an integrated framework that eliminates both assumptions simultaneously. In addition, the current work presents a deep review of various formulae from the literature, each with their corresponding levels of complexity. Our review analysis highlights a critical trade-off between computational complexity and expression accuracy, where the newly developed formulae offer enhanced accuracy at the expense of increased computational time. Our user-friendly code, which includes several classical transmittance and reflectance formulae from the literature and our newly proposed expressions, is publicly available in both Python and Matlab at this link.</description>

      <title>Data-driven 2D stationary quantum droplets and wave propagations in the amended GP equation with two potentials via deep neural networks learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a systematic deep learning approach to solve two-dimensional (2D) stationary quantum droplets (QDs) and investigate their wave propagation in the 2D amended Gross-Pitaevskii equation with Lee-Huang-Yang correction and two kinds of potentials. Firstly, we use the initial-value iterative neural network (IINN) algorithm for 2D stationary quantum droplets of stationary equations. Then the learned stationary QDs are used as the initial value conditions for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to explore their evolutions in the some space-time region. Especially, we consider two types of potentials, one is the 2D quadruple-well Gaussian potential and the other is the PT-symmetric HO-Gaussian potential, which lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking and the generation of multi-component QDs. The used deep learning method can also be applied to study wave propagations of other nonlinear physical models.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Applications to Computational Plasma Physics and Reduced-Order Plasma Modeling: A Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) provides a broad spectrum of tools and architectures that enable the transformation of data from simulations and experiments into useful and explainable science, thereby augmenting domain knowledge. Furthermore, ML-enhanced numerical modelling can revamp scientific computing for real-world complex engineering systems, creating unique opportunities to examine the operation of the technologies in detail and automate their optimization and control. In recent years, ML applications have seen significant growth across various scientific domains, particularly in fluid mechanics, where ML has shown great promise in enhancing computational modeling of fluid flows. In contrast, ML applications in numerical plasma physics research remain relatively limited in scope and extent. Despite this, the close relationship between fluid mechanics and plasma physics presents a valuable opportunity to create a roadmap for transferring ML advances in fluid flow modeling to computational plasma physics. This Perspective aims to outline such a roadmap. We begin by discussing some general fundamental aspects of ML, including the various categories of ML algorithms and the different types of problems that can be solved with the help of ML. With regard to each problem type, we then present specific examples from the use of ML in computational fluid dynamics, reviewing several insightful prior efforts. We also review recent ML applications in plasma physics for each problem type. The paper discusses promising future directions and development pathways for ML in plasma modelling within the different application areas. Additionally, we point out prominent challenges that must be addressed to realize ML's full potential in computational plasma physics, including the need for cost-effective high-fidelity simulation tools for extensive data generation.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-size particles in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fluid-solid interaction of suspensions of Kolmogorov-size spherical particles moving in homogeneous isotropic turbulence at a microscale Reynolds number of $Re_\lambda \approx 140$. Two volume fractions are considered, $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-3}$, and the solid-to-fluid density ratio is set to $5$ and $100$. We present a comparison between interface-resolved (PR-DNS) and one-way-coupled point-particle (PP-DNS) direct numerical simulations. We find that the modulated energy spectrum shows the classical $-5/3$ Kolmogorov scaling in the inertial range of scales and a $-4$ scaling at smaller scales, with the latter resulting from a balance between the energy injected by the particles and the viscous dissipation, in an otherwise smooth flow. An analysis of the small-scale flow topology shows that the particles mainly favour events with axial strain and vortex compression. The dynamics of the particles and their collective motion studied for PR-DNS are used to assess the validity of the PP-DNS. We find that the PP-DNS predicts fairly well both the Lagrangian and Eulerian statistics of the particles motion for the low-density case, while some discrepancies are observed for the high-density case. Also, the PP-DNS is found to underpredict the level of clustering of the suspension compared to the PR-DNS, with a larger difference for the high-density case.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Finite Sampling Error in Quantum Krylov Subspace Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the realm of early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC), quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization (QKSD) has recently emerged as a promising quantum algorithm for the approximate Hamiltonian diagonalization through projection onto the quantum Krylov subspace. However, the application of this algorithm often entails solving an ill-conditioned generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) associated with an erroneous matrix pair, which can cause significant distortion to the solution. Because EFTQC assumes error correction albeit on a small scale, errors in the matrices are predominant due to finite sampling error. This work focuses on quantifying the sampling error within the measurement of matrix element of projected Hamiltonian by considering two measurement approaches based on the Hamiltonian decompositions: linear combination of unitaries and diagonalizable fragments. Furthermore, we propose two measurement strategies to minimize the sampling error with a given budget for quantum circuit repetitions: the shifting technique and coefficient splitting. The shifting technique removes redundant parts from the Hamiltonian that annihilate one of the bra or ket states. The coefficient splitting method optimizes the allocation of each common term that can be measured in different circuits. Numerical experiments with electronic structures of small molecules demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies, showing a reduction in sampling costs by a factor of 20-500.</description>

      <title>A Partition Function Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple estimator that allows to calculate the absolute value of a system's partition function from a finite sampling of its canonical ensemble. The estimator utilizes a volume correction term to compensate the effect that the finite sampling cannot cover the whole configuration space. As a proof of concept, the estimator is applied to calculate the partition function for several model systems, and the results are compared with the numerically exact solutions. Excellent agreement is found, demonstrating that a solution for an efficient calculation of partition functions is possible.</description>

      <title>Pinning control of chimera states in systems with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the mechanisms behind synchronization phenomena is of paramount importance in nonlinear science. In particular, chimera states, patterns in which order and disorder coexist simultaneously, continue to puzzle scholars, due to their elusive nature. Recently, it has been shown that higher-order interactions greatly promote the onset of chimera states, which are easier to found and more resilient when the system units interact in group. In this work, we show that the higher-order framework is fertile not only for the emergence of chimera states, but also for their control. Via pinning control, a technique consisting in applying a forcing to a subset of the nodes, we are able to trigger the emergence of chimera states with only a small fraction of controlled nodes, at striking contrast with the case without higher-order interactions. We show that our setting is robust for different higher-order topologies and types of pinning control and, finally, we give a heuristic interpretation of the results via phase reduction theory. Our numerical and theoretical results provide further understanding on how higher-order interactions shape nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nevanlinna Analytic Continuation for Migdal-Eliashberg Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a method to reconstruct real-frequency properties from analytically continued causal Green's functions within the framework of Migdal-Eliashberg (ME) theory for superconductivity. ME theory involves solving a set of coupled equations self-consistently in imaginary frequency space, but to obtain experimentally measurable properties like the spectral function and quasiparticle density of states, it is necessary to perform an analytic continuation to real frequency space. Traditionally, the ME Green's function is decomposed into three fundamental complex functions, which are analytically continued independently. However, these functions do not possess the causal properties of Green's functions, complicating or even preventing the application of standard methods such as Maximum Entropy. Our approach overcomes these challenges, enabling the use of various analytic continuation techniques that were previously impractical. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by combining it with Nevanlinna analytic continuation to achieve accurate real-frequency results for ME theory, which are directly comparable to experimental data, with applications highlighted for the superconductors MgB$_2$ and LaBeH$_8$.</description>

      <title>Doping-Induced Enhancement of Hydrogen Evolution at MoS2 Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rate theory and DFT calculations of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on MoS2 with Co, Ni and Pt impurities show the significance of dihydrogen (H2*) complex where both hydrogen atoms are interacting with the surface. Stabilization of such a complex affects the competing Volmer-Heyrovsky (direct H2 release) and Volmer-Tafel (H2* intermediate) pathways. The resulting evolution proceeds with a very small overpotential for all dopants ($\eta$ = 0.1 to 0.2 V) at 25% edge substitution, significantly reduced from the already low $\eta$ = 0.27 V for the undoped edge. At full edge substitution, Co-MoS2 remains highly active ($\eta$ = 0.18 V) while Ni- and Pt-MoS2 are deactivated ($\eta$ = 0.4 to 0.5 V) due to unfavorable interaction with H2*. Instead of the single S-vacancy, the site of intrinsic activity in the basal plane was found to be the undercoordinated central Mo-atom in threefold S-vacancy configurations, enabling hydrogen evolution with $\eta$ = 0.52 V via a H2* intermediate. The impurity atoms interact favorably with the intrinsic sulfur vacancies on the basal plane, stabilizing but simultaneously deactivating the triple vacancy configuration. The calculated shifts in overpotential are consistent with reported measurements, and the dependence on doping level may explain variations in experimental observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence is a complex physical process that emerges in multiple areas of modern physics, and in ionized environments such as interstellar gas, the magnetic field can be dynamically important. However, the exact function of the magnetic field in the ionized gas remains unclear. We use the $M_{\rm A} = \sqrt{E_{\rm k}/E_B}
  $ to describe the importance of the magnetic field measured to the turbulent motion, and reveal diverse ways of mutual interaction. At low $M_{\rm A}$ (magnetic regime), the magnetic field is well-described as force-free. Despite the strong magnetic field, the motion of gas does not stay aligned with the magnetic field. At the regime of intermediate $M_{\rm A}$ (magnetic-kinetic transition regime), the velocity field and the magnetic field exhibit the highest degree of alignment, which is likely the result of a rapid relaxation. At high $M_{\rm A}$ (kinetic regime), both the magnetic field and the velocity field are irregular, with no alignment. We find observational counterparts to these regimes in observations of interstellar gas. The results highlight the diverse behavior of gas in MHD turbulence and guide future interpretations of the role of the magnetic field in astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Slope of Magnetic Field-Density Relation as An Indicator of Magnetic Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic field is a fundamental force in nature that regulates the formation of stars in the universe. Despite decades of efforts, a reliable assessment of the importance of the magnetic fields in star formation relations remains missing. In star-formation research, our acknowledgment of the importance of magnetic field is best summarized by the Cruther+ 2010 B-rho relation. The relation is either interpreted as proof of the importance of a magnetic field in the collapse, or the result of self-similar collapse where the role of the magnetic is secondary to gravity. Using simulations, we find a fundamental relation, ${\cal M}_{\rm A}$-k$_{B-\rho}$(slope of $B-\rho$ relation) relation. This fundamental B-$\rho$-slope relation enables one to measure the Alfv\'enic Mach number, a direct indicator of the importance of the magnetic field, using the distribution of data in the B-$\rho$ plane. It allows us to drive the following empirical $B-\rho$ relation \begin{equation}
  \frac{B}{B_c} = {\rm exp}\left(\left(\frac{\gamma}{{\cal K}}\right)^{-1}\left( \frac{\rho}{\rho_c}\right)^\frac{\gamma}{{\cal K}}\right)\nonumber, \end{equation} which offers an excellent fit to the Cruther et al. data, where we assume ${\cal M}_{\rm A}-\rho$ relation. The foundational ${\cal M}_{\rm A}-{\rm k}_{B-\rho}$ relation provides an independent way to measure the importance of magnetic field against the kinematic motion using multiple magnetic field measurements. Our approach offers a new interpretation of Cruther+2010, where a gradual decrease in the importance of B at higher densities is implied.</description>

      <title>Symmetry based efficient simulation of dissipative quantum many-body dynamics in subwavelength quantum emitter arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient method to numerically simulate the dissipative dynamics of large numbers of quantum emitters in ordered arrays in the presence of long-range dipole-dipole interactions mediated by the vacuum electromagnetic field. Using the spatial symmetries of the system, we rewrite the equations of motion in a collective spin basis and subsequently apply a higher-order cumulant expansion for the collective operators. By truncating the subradiant collective modes with a heavily suppressed decay rate and keeping only the effect from the radiating collective modes, we reduce the numerical complexity significantly. This allows to efficiently compute the dissipative dynamics of the observables of interest for a linear, ring-shaped and planar arrays of quantum emitters. In particular, we characterize the excited population, the total photon emission rate and the second order intensity correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau =0)$, which are challenging to compute for large systems with traditional cumulant expansion methods based on the individual spins.</description>

      <title>Configurational entropy and stability conditions of fermion and boson stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a remarkable study by M. Gleiser and N. Jiang (Phys. Rev. D {\bf 92}, 044046, 2015), the authors demonstrated that the stability regions of neutron stars, within the framework of the simple Fermi gas model, and self-gravitating configurations of complex scalar field (boson stars) with various self couplings, obtained through traditional perturbation methods, correlates with critical points of the configurational entropy with an accuracy of a few percent. Recently, P. Koliogiannis \textit{et al.} (Phys. Rev. D {\bf 107}, 044069 2023) found that while the minimization of the configurational entropy generally anticipates qualitatively the stability point for neutron stars and quark stars, this approach lacks universal validity. In this work, we aim to further elucidate this issue by seeking to reconcile these seemingly contradictory findings. Specifically, we calculate the configurational entropy of bosonic and fermionic systems, described by interacting Fermi and Boson gases, respectively, that form compact objects stabilized by gravity. We investigate whether the minimization of configurational entropy coincides with the stability point of the corresponding compact objects. Our results indicate a strong correlation between the stability points predicted by configurational entropy and those obtained through traditional methods, with the accuracy of this correlation showing a slight dependence on the interaction strength. Consequently, the stability of compact objects, composed of components obeying Fermi or Boson statistics, can alternatively be assessed using the concept of configurational entropy.</description>

      <title>Segregation in binary mixture with differential contraction among active rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell cortex contraction is essential for shaping cells, enabling movement, ensuring proper division, maintaining tissue integrity, guiding development, and responding to mechanical signals - all critical for the life and health of multicellular organisms. Differential contractions in cell membranes, particularly when cells of different types interact, play a crucial role in the emergence of segregation. In this study, we introduce a model where rings composed of active particles interact through differential membrane contraction within a specified cutoff distance. We demonstrate that segregation arises solely from differential contraction, with the activity of the rings functioning similarly to an effective temperature. Additionally, we observed that segregation involves cluster fusion-diffusion process. However, the decay exponent of the segregation parameter we found is close to $\lambda \sim -1/3$, which differs from the $\lambda \sim -1/4$ predicted by previous theoretical approaches and simulations.</description>

      <title>Ab initio uncertainty quantification in scattering analysis of microscopy</title>

Abstract: Estimating parameters from data is a fundamental problem, customarily done by minimizing a loss function between a model and observed statistics. In scattering-based analysis, researchers often employ their domain expertise to select a specific range of wave vectors for analysis, a choice that can vary depending on the specific case. We introduce another paradigm that defines a probabilistic generative model from the beginning of data processing and propagates the uncertainty for parameter estimation, termed the ab initio uncertainty quantification (AIUQ). As an illustrative example, we demonstrate this approach with differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) that extracts dynamical information through Fourier analysis at a selected range of wave vectors. We first show that the conventional way of estimation in DDM is equivalent to fitting a temporal variogram in the reciprocal space using a latent factor model. Then we derive the maximum marginal likelihood estimator, which optimally weighs the information at all wave vectors, therefore eliminating the need to select the range of wave vectors. Furthermore, we substantially reduce the computational cost by utilizing the generalized Schur algorithm for Toeplitz covariances without approximation. Simulated studies validate that AIUQ improves estimation accuracy and enables model selection with automated analysis. The utility of AIUQ is also demonstrated by three distinct sets of experiments: first in an isotropic Newtonian fluid, pushing limits of optically dense systems compared to multiple particle tracking; next in a system undergoing a sol-gel transition, automating the determination of gelling points and critical exponent; and lastly, in discerning anisotropic diffusive behavior of colloids in a liquid crystal. These outcomes collectively underscore AIUQ's versatility to capture system dynamics in an efficient and automated manner.</description>

Abstract: The recently reported compactified hyperboloidal method has found wide use in the numerical computation of quasinormal modes, with implications for fields as diverse as gravitational physics and optics. We extend this intrinsically relativistic method into the non-relativistic domain, demonstrating its use to calculate the quasinormal modes of the Schr\"odinger equation and solve related bound-state problems. We also describe how to further generalize this method, offering a perspective on the importance of non-relativistic quasinormal modes for the programme of black hole spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov n-Widths for Multitask Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) Methods: Towards Robust Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) as a means of solving partial differential equations (PDE) has garnered much attention in the Computational Science and Engineering (CS&amp;E) world. This topic encompasses a broad array of methods and models aimed at solving a single or a collection of PDE problems, called multitask learning. PIML is characterized by the incorporation of physical laws into the training process of machine learning models in lieu of large data when solving PDE problems. Despite the overall success of this collection of methods, it remains incredibly difficult to analyze, benchmark, and generally compare one approach to another. Using Kolmogorov n-widths as a measure of effectiveness of approximating functions, we judiciously apply this metric in the comparison of various multitask PIML architectures. We compute lower accuracy bounds and analyze the model's learned basis functions on various PDE problems. This is the first objective metric for comparing multitask PIML architectures and helps remove uncertainty in model validation from selective sampling and overfitting. We also identify avenues of improvement for model architectures, such as the choice of activation function, which can drastically affect model generalization to "worst-case" scenarios, which is not observed when reporting task-specific errors. We also incorporate this metric into the optimization process through regularization, which improves the models' generalizability over the multitask PDE problem.</description>

      <title>Low-resolution descriptions of model neural activity reveal hidden features and underlying system properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analysis of complex systems such as neural networks is made particularly difficult by the overwhelming number of their interacting components. In the absence of prior knowledge, identifying a small but informative subset of network nodes on which the analysis should focus is a rather challenging task. In this work, we address this problem in the context of a Hopfield model, which is observed through the lenses of low-resolution representations, or decimation mappings, consisting of subgroups of its neurons. The optimal, most informative mappings of the network are defined through a recently developed methodology, the mapping entropy optimisation workflow (MEOW), which performs an unsupervised analysis of the states sampled by the network and identifies those subgroups of spins whose configuration distribution is closest to that of the full, high-resolution model. Which neurons are retained in an optimal mapping is found to critically depend on the properties of the interaction matrix of the network and the level of detail employed to describe the system; by these means, it is thus possible to extract quantitative insight about the underlying properties of the high-resolution model through the analysis of its optimal low-resolution representations. These results show a tight and potentially fruitful relation between the level of detail at which the network is inspected and the type and amount of information that can be gathered from it, and showcase the MEOW approach as a practical, enabling tool for the study of complex systems.</description>

      <title>A feasible dose-volume estimation of radiotherapy treatment with optimal transport using a concept for transportation of Ricci-flat time-varying dose-volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In radiotherapy, the dose-volume histogram (DVH) curve is an important means of evaluating the clinical feasibility of tumor control and side effects in normal organs against actual treatment. Fractionation, distributing the amounts of irradiation, is used to enhance the treatment effectiveness of tumor control and mitigation of normal tissue damage. Therefore, dose and volume receive time-varying effects per fractional treatment event. However, the difficulty of DVH superimposition of different situations prevents evaluation of the total DVH despite different shapes and receiving dose distributions of organs in each fraction. However, an actual evaluation is determined traditionally by the initial treatment plan because of summation difficulty. Mathematically, this difficulty can be regarded as a kind of optimal transport of DVH. For this study, we introduced DVH transportation on the curvilinear orthogonal space with respect to arbitrary time ($T$), time-varying dose ($D$), and time-varying volume ($V$), which was designated as the TDV space embedded in the Riemannian manifold.Transportation in the TDV space should satisfy the following: (a) the metrics between dose and volume must be equivalent for any fractions and (b) the cumulative characteristic of DVH must hold irrespective of the lapse of time. With consideration of the Ricci-flat condition for the $D$-direction and $V$-direction, we obtained the probability density distribution, which is described by Poisson's equation with radial diffusion process toward $T$. This geometrical requirement and transportation equation rigorously provided the feasible total DVH.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Based Construction of Molecular Potential and Its Application in Exploring the Deep-Lying-Orbital Effect in High-Order Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating soft-Coulomb-type (SC) molecular potential within single-active-electron approximation (SAE) is essential since it allows solving time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations with fewer computational resources compared to other multielectron methods. The current available SC potentials can accurately reproduce the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which is sufficient for analyzing nonlinear effects in laser-molecule interactions like high-order harmonic generation (HHG). However, recent discoveries of significant effects of deep-lying molecular orbitals call for more precise potentials to analyze them. In this study, we present a fast and accurate method based on machine learning to construct SC potentials that simultaneously reproduce various molecular features, including energies, symmetries, and dipole moments of HOMO, HOMO-1, and HOMO-2. We use this ML model to create SC SAE potentials of the HCN molecule and then comprehensively analyze the fingerprints of lower-lying orbitals in HHG spectra emitted during the H-CN stretching. Our findings reveal that HOMO-1 plays a role in forming the second HHG plateau. Additionally, as the H-C distance increases, the plateau structure and the smoothness of HHG spectra are altered due to the redistribution of orbital electron density. These results are in line with other experimental and theoretical studies. Lastly, the machine learning approach using deconvolution and convolution neural networks in the present study is so general that it can be applied to construct molecular potential for other molecules and molecular dynamic processes.</description>
