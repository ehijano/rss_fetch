      <title>A cycle with a "short" period in the phenomenological model of a single neuron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the relay version of the generalized Hutchinson's equation as a phenomenological model of an isolated neuron. After an exponential substitution, the equation takes the form of a differential-difference equation with a piecewise-constant right-hand side. In the work of A. Yu. Kolesov and others, this equation was studied with a negative continuous initial function, and the existence and orbital stability of a periodic solution with a period longer than the delay were proven. In the present work, all possible solutions with continuous on the interval of the delay length initial functions, containing no more than two zeros, are constructed. It is proven that the equation has a periodically unstable solution, the period of which is shorter than the delay.</description>

      <title>On the intertwining map between Coulomb and hyperbolic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a unitary operator between Hilbert spaces of generalized eigenfunctions of Coulomb operators and the Laplace-Beltrami operator of hyperbolic space that intertwines their respective Poisson operators on $L^2(\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$. The constructed operator generalizes Fock's unitary transformation, originally defined between the discrete spectra of the attractive Coulomb operator and the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the sphere, to the setting of continuous spectra. Among other connections, this map explains why the scattering matrices are the same in these two different settings, and it also provides an explicit formula for the Poisson operator of the Coulomb Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>No Infinite Spin for Partial Collisions converging to isolated CC on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The infinite spin problem is a problem concerning the rotational behavior of total collision orbits in the $n$-body problem. The question makes also sense for partial collision. When a~cluster of bodies tends to a (partial) collision, then its normalized shape curve tends to the set of normalized central configurations, which in the planar case has $SO(2)$ symmetry. This leaves a possibility that the normalized shape curve tends to the circle obtained by rotation of some central configuration instead of a particular point on it. This is the \emph{infinite spin problem}. We show that it is not possible if the limiting circle is isolated from other connected components of set of normalized central configuration. Our approach extends the method from recent work for total collision by Moeckel and Montgomery, which was based on combination of the center manifold theorem with {\L}ojasiewicz inequality. To that we add a shadowing result for pseudo-orbits near normally hyperbolic manifold and careful estimates on the influence of other bodies on the cluster of colliding bodies.</description>

      <title>A priori bounds for geodesic diameter. Part III. A Sobolev-Poincar\'e inequality and applications to a variety of geometric variational problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:1709.05504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a novel type of Sobolev-Poincar\'e inequality (for generalised weakly differentiable functions on varifolds), we establish a finite upper bound of the geodesic diameter of generalised compact connected surfaces-with-boundary of arbitrary dimension in Euclidean space in terms of the mean curvatures of the surface and its boundary. Our varifold setting includes smooth immersions, surfaces with finite Willmore energy, two-convex hypersurfaces in level-set mean curvature flow, integral currents with prescribed mean curvature vector, area minimising integral chains with coefficients in a complete normed commutative group, varifold solutions to Plateau's problem furnished by min-max methods or by Brakke flow, and compact sets solving Plateau problems based on \v{C}ech homology. Due to the generally inevitable presence of singularities, path-connectedness was previously known neither for the class of varifolds (even in the absence of boundary) nor for the solutions to the Plateau problems considered.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic models and meromorphic functions in dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.07637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we describe the construction of logarithmic models for germs of plane singular analytic foliations, both real and complex. A logarithmic model is a germ of closed meromorphic 1-form with simple poles produced upon some specified geometric data: the structure of dicritical (non-invariant) components in the exceptional divisor of its reduction of singularities, a prescribed finite set of separatrices - invariant analytic branches at the origin - and Camacho-Sad indices with respect to these separatrices. As an application, we use logarithmic models in order to construct real and complex germs of meromorphic functions with a given indeterminacy structure and prescribed sets of zeroes and poles. Also, in the real case, logarithmic models are used in order to build germs of analytic vector fields with a given Bendixson's sectorial decomposition of a neighborhood of $0 \in \mathbb{R}^{2}$ into hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic sectors. This is carried out in the specific case where all trajectories accumulating to the origin are contained in analytic curves. As a consequence, we can produce real meromorphic functions with a prescribed sectorial decomposition.</description>

      <title>Supercongruences via Beukers' method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, using modular forms F. Beukers posed a unified method that can deal with a large number of supercongruences involving binomial coefficients and Ap\'ery-like numbers. In this paper, we use Beukers' method to prove some conjectures of the first author concerning the congruences for $$\sum_{k=0}^{(p-1)/2}\frac{\binom{2k}k^3}{m^k}, \ \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{\binom{2k}k^2\binom{4k}{2k}}{m^k}, \ \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{\binom{2k}k\binom{3k}k\binom{6k}{3k}}{m^k}, \ \sum_{n=0}^{p-1}\frac{V_n}{m^n},\ \sum_{n=0}^{p-1}\frac{T_n}{m^n},\ \sum_{n=0}^{p-1}\frac{D_n}{m^n} $$ and $\sum_{n=0}^{p-1}(-1)^nA_n$ modulo $p^3$, where $p$ is an odd prime representable by some suitable binary quadratic form, $m$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, $V_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{2k}k^2\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}^2$, $T_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk^2\binom{2k}n^2$, $D_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk^2\binom{2k}k\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}$ and $A_n$ is the Ap\'ery number given by $A_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk^2\binom{n+k}k^2$.</description>
