      <title>Electrically Programmable Pixelated Graphene-Integrated Plasmonic Metasurfaces for Coherent Mid-Infrared Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active metasurfaces have recently emerged as compact, lightweight, and efficient platforms for dynamic control of electromagnetic fields and optical responses. However, the complexities associated with their post-fabrication tunability significantly hinder their widespread applications, especially for the mid-infrared range due to material scarcity and design intricacy. Here, we experimentally demonstrate highly dynamic, pixelated modulations of coherent mid-infrared emission based on an electrically programmable plasmonic metasurface integrated with graphene field effect transistors (Gr-FETs). The ultrabroad infrared transparency of graphene allows for free-form control over plasmonic meta-atoms, thus achieving coherent mid-infrared states across a broad range of wavelengths and polarizations. The spatial temperature modulation generated by Gr-FETs is effectively synergized with the emissivity control by the localized surface plasmon polaritons from gold nanoantennas. This integrated temperature-emissivity modulation of metasurfaces is systematically extended to form a pixelated 2D array, envisioning new approaches toward scalable 2D electrical wiring for densely packed, independently controlled pixels.</description>

      <title>Si Metasurface Supporting Multiple Quasi-BICs for Degenerate Four-Wave Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs) enable high field enhancement with narrow-linewidth resonances in the visible and near-infrared ranges. The resonance emerges when distorting the meta-atom's geometry away from a symmetry-protected BIC condition and, usually, a given design can sustain one or two of these states. In this work, we introduce a silicon-on-silica metasurface that simultaneously supports up to four qBIC resonances in the near-infrared region. This is achieved by combining multiple symmetry-breaking distortions on an elliptical cylinder array. By pumping two of these resonances, the nonlinear process of degenerate four-wave mixing is experimentally realized. By comparing the nonlinear response with that of an unpatterned silicon film, the near-field enhancement inside the nanostructured dielectric is revealed. The presented results demonstrate independent geometric control of multiple qBICs and their interaction trough wave mixing processes, opening new research pathways in nanophotonics, with potential applications in information multiplexing, multi-wavelength sensing and nonlinear imaging.</description>

      <title>Topological valley plasmons in twisted monolayer-double graphene moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In topological photonics, artificial photonic structures are constructed for realizing nontrivial unidirectional propagation of photonic information. On the other hand, moir\'e superlattices are emerging as an important avenue for engineering quantum materials with novel properties. In this paper, we combine these two aspects and demonstrate theoretically that moir\'e superlattices of small-angle twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene provide a natural platform for valley protected plasmons. Particularly, a complete plasmonic bandgap appears stemming from the distinct optical conductivities of the ABA and ABC stacked triangular domains. Moreover, the plasmonic crystals exhibit nonzero valley Chern numbers and unidirectional transport of plasmonic edge states protected from inter-valley scattering is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study the synchronization of chaos generated by semiconductor lasers in a cascade injection configuration, i.e., a tunable master laser is used to generate chaos by optical injection in a transmitter laser that injects light into a receiver laser. Chaos synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver lasers is achieved with a correlation coefficient of 90 % for a measurement bandwidth up to 35 GHz. Two parameter regions of good synchronization are found, corresponding to the alignment of the oscillation frequencies of the receiver laser with either the transmitter laser or the master laser.</description>

      <title>Theoretical demonstration of mode transmission in ZGP-based micrometer waveguide platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Birefringence phase-matching based \c{hi}(2) ZnGeP2 (ZGP) waveguide platform has been recently reported for excellent mid-infrared laser generation. Here, a detailed theoretical characterization of mode transmission taking waveguide anisotropy and substrate material absorption into account in a micrometer ZGP waveguide platform (ZGP-on-SiO2) is conducted. Benefited from high-index contrast between ZGP and substrate (SiO2/Air), Transverse electric and magnetic (TM and TE) mode transmission loss at interested wavelengths range of 2 - 12 {\mu}m is calculated to be less than 4 dB/cm and 1.5 dB/cm, respectively, in the designed ZGP waveguide. Notably, non-obvious oscillation of mode transmission loss versus phase-matching angles is observed, which is different from that in the previously reported weakly guided anisotropic waveguide. A vital phenomenon named mode crossing at some wavelengths in TM polarization is also exhibited in our waveguide platforms, which jeopardizes waveguide performances and could be avoided by changing the phase-matching angle in practice. This work provides a significant indication of ZGP waveguide design optimization in future and also exhibits extendibility to other birefringent crystal waveguide platforms.</description>

      <title>Gas pressure manipulation of exciton states in monolayer WS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, thin film optoelectronic devices based on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have made significant progress. However, the sensitivity of the exciton states to environmental change presents challenges for device applications. This work reports on the evolution of photo-induced exciton states in monolayer WS2 in a chamber with low gas pressure. It elucidates the physical mechanism of the transition between neutral and charged excitons. At 222 mTorr, the transition rate between excitons includes two components, 0.09 s-1 and 1.68 s-1, respectively. Based on this phenomenon, we have developed a pressure-tuning method for exciton manipulation, allowing a tuning range of approximately 40% in exciton weight. We also demonstrate that the intensity of neutral exciton emission from monolayer WS2 follows a power-law distribution concerning gas pressure, indicating a highly sensitive pressure dependence. This work presents a non-destructive and highly sensitive method for exciton conversion through in-situ manipulation. It highlights the potential development of monolayer WS2 in pressure sensing and explains the impact of environmental factors on product quality in photovoltaic devices.</description>

      <title>Directionally Tunable Co- and Counter-Propagating Photon Pairs from a Nonlinear Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear metasurfaces have recently been established as a new platform for generating photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion. While for classical harmonic generation in metasurfaces a high level of control over all degrees of freedom of light has been reached, this capability is yet to be developed for photon pair generation. In this work, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate for the first time precise control of the emission angle of photon pairs generated from a nonlinear metasurface. Our measurements show angularly tunable pair-generation with high coincidence-to-accidental ratio for both co- and counter-propagating emission. The underlying principle is the transverse phase-matching of guided-mode resonances with strong angular dispersion in a nonlinear lithium niobate metagrating. We provide a straightforward design strategy for photon pair generation in such a device and find very good agreement between the calculations and experimental results. Here we use all-optical emission angle tuning by means of the pump wavelength, however the principle could be extended to modulation via the electro-optic effect in lithium niobate. In sum, this work provides an important addition to the toolset of sub-wavelength thickness photon pair sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel photonic neural network using photonic crystal fibers, leveraging femtosecond pulse supercontinuum generation for optical computing. Investigating its efficacy across machine learning tasks, we uncover the crucial impact of nonlinear pulse propagation dynamics on network performance. Our findings show that octave-spanning supercontinuum generation results in loss of dataset variety due to many-to-one mapping, and optimal performance requires balancing optical nonlinearity. This study offers guidance for designing energy-efficient and high-performance photonic neural network architectures by explaining the interplay between nonlinear dynamics and optical computing.</description>

      <title>Focusing Surface Acoustic Waves with a Plasmonic Hypersonic Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanoantennas have proven to be efficient transducers of electromagnetic to mechanical energy and vice versa. The sudden thermal expansion of these structures after an ultrafast optical pulsed excitation leads to the emission of hypersonic acoustic waves to the supporting substrate, which can be detected by another antenna that acts as a high-sensitive mechanical probe due to the strong modulation of its optical response. Sophisticated fabrication techniques, together with the implementation of numerical simulations, have allowed the engineering of nanostructures for the controlled directional generation and detection of high-frequency acoustic phonons at the nanoscale, with many potential applications in telecommunications, sensing, mechanical switching, and energy transport. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a nanoscale acoustic lens comprised of 11 gold nanodisks whose collective oscillation gives rise to an interference pattern that results in a diffraction-limited surface acoustic beam of about 340 nm width, with an amplitude contrast of 60%. Via spatially decoupled pump-probe experiments, we were able to map the radiated acoustic energy in the proximity of the focal area, obtaining a very good agreement with the continuum elastic theory.</description>

      <title>Generative deep learning-enabled ultra-large field-of-view lens-free imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in high-throughput biomedical applications necessitate real-time, large field-of-view (FOV) imaging capabilities. Conventional lens-free imaging (LFI) systems, while addressing the limitations of physical lenses, have been constrained by dynamic, hard-to-model optical fields, resulting in a limited one-shot FOV of approximately 20 $mm^2$. This restriction has been a major bottleneck in applications like live-cell imaging and automation of microfluidic systems for biomedical research. Here, we present a deep-learning(DL)-based imaging framework -- GenLFI -- leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) for holographic image reconstruction. We demonstrate that GenLFI can achieve a real-time FOV over 550 $mm^2$, surpassing the current LFI system by more than 20-fold, and even larger than the world's largest confocal microscope by 1.76 times. The resolution is at the sub-pixel level of 5.52 $\mu m$, without the need for a shifting light source. The unsupervised learning-based reconstruction does not require optical field modeling, making imaging dynamic 3D samples (e.g., droplet-based microfluidics and 3D cell models) in complex optical fields possible. This GenLFI framework unlocks the potential of LFI systems, offering a robust tool to tackle new frontiers in high-throughput biomedical applications such as drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Topological Protection of Optical Skyrmions through Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental realizations of optical Skyrmions through the techniques of structured light have opened the doors to a completely new way of representing data in electromagnetic fields, namely its topology. Apart from potentially enhancing the bandwidth of optical systems, the intrinsically discrete nature of the topological number allows Skyrmions to naturally interface with the digital world. However, investigations into the topological protection of optical Skyrmions through various media remain limited to date. Here, we rigorously define the optical Skyrmion and establish a framework that can be used to analyze the effects of complex media on the topology of Skyrmion fields. Using this framework, we provide simple criteria for spatially varying retarders, diattenuators, depolarizers, and combinations of the former under which topological protection is guaranteed. We then present experimental results validating the robustness of the Skyrmion number against corrupting media and discuss ways of extending the optical Skyrmion to more general settings. We believe that the work presented in this paper provides a theoretical underpinning for the use of Skyrmions in practical applications ranging from optical communications to photonic computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a high current interest for novel plasmonic platforms and materials able to extend their applicability into the ultraviolet (UV) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the UV it is possible to explore spectral properties of biomolecules with small cross section in the visible spectral range. However, most used metals in plasmonics have their resonances at wavelengths &gt; 350 nm. Aluminum and rhodium are two interesting candidate materials for UV plasmonics, and in this work we developed a simple and low-cost preparation of functional substrates based on nanoporous aluminum decorated with rhodium nanoparticles. We demonstrate that these functionalized nanoporous metal films can be exploited as plasmonic materials suitable for enhanced UV Raman spectroscopy</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present research, we demonstrate the usage of plasmonic effects in thin film structures to control magnetic topological textures, specifically skyrmions and skyrmioniums. We investigate numerically the generation and alteration of these topological structures caused by hemisphere gold nanoparticle placed over a magnetic layer coated with a dielectric material. The electromagnetic and photothermal models are used to clarify the processes of producing heat and absorption, and the results were implemented in micromagnetic formalism to reveal the dynamics of magnetization under various conditions. Our findings demonstrate the significance of the laser pulse duration and the contact area between nanoparticles and the underlying magnetic layer in forming topological textures. In particular, we show how to generate a single skyrmion, multiple skyrmions, and skyrmioniums, and how to dynamically transition between these states. These results highlight the possibility of manipulating magnetic textures by using plasmonic effects, which presents significant opportunities for spintronics and non-conventional computer applications.</description>

      <title>Dual orthogonally-polarized lasing assisted by imaginary Fermi arcs in organic microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The polarization control of micro/nano lasers is an important topic in nanophotonics. Up to now, the simultaneous generation of two distinguishable orthogonally-polarized lasing modes from a single organic microlaser remains a critical challenge. Here, we demonstrate simultaneously orthogonally-polarized dual lasing from a microcavity filled with an organic single crystal exhibiting selective strong coupling. We show that the non-Hermiticity due to polarization-dependent losses leads to the formation of real and imaginary Fermi arcs with exceptional points. Simultaneous orthogonally-polarized lasing becomes possible thanks to the eigenstate mixing by the photonic spin-orbit coupling at the imaginary Fermi arcs. Our work provides a novel way to develop linearly-polarized lasers and paves the way for the future fundamental research in topological photonics, non-Hermitian optics, and other fields.</description>

      <title>Novel Signatures of Radiation Reaction in Electron-Laser Sidescattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate novel signatures of radiation reaction via the angular deflection of an electron beam colliding at 90 degrees with an intense laser pulse. Due to the radiation reaction effect, the electrons can be deflected towards the beam axis for plane wave backgrounds, which is not possible in the absence of radiation reaction effects. The magnitude and size of the deflection angle can be controlled by tailoring the laser pulse shapes. The effect is first derived analytically using the Landau-Lifshitz equation, which allows to determine the important scaling behavior with laser intensity and particle energy. We then move on to full scale 3D Monte Carlo simulations to verify the effect is observable with present day laser technology. We investigate the opportunities for an indirect observation of laser depletion in such side scattering scenarios.</description>

      <title>Phonon pseudoangular momentum in $\alpha$-MoO$_3$</title>

Abstract: In recent studies, it has been discovered that phonons can carry angular momentum, leading to a series of investigations into systems with 3-fold rotation symmetry. However, for systems with 2-fold screw rotational symmetry, such as $\alpha$-MoO$_3$, there has been no relevant discussion. In this paper, we investigated the pseudoangular momentum of phonons in crystals with 2-fold screw rotational symmetry. Taking $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ as an example, we explain the selection rules in circularly polarized Raman experiments resulting from pseudoangular momentum conservation, providing important guidance for experiments. This study of pseudoangular momentum in $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ opens up a new degree of freedom for its potential applications, expanding into new application domains.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Nanoresonators for Bell State Generation</title>

Abstract: Entangled photon states are a fundamental resource for optical quantum technologies and investigating the fundamental predictions of quantum mechanics. Up to now such states are mainly generated in macroscopic nonlinear optical systems with elaborately tailored optical properties. In this theoretical work, we extend the understanding on the generation of entangled photonic states towards the nanoscale regime, by investigating the fundamental properties of photon-pair-generation in sub-wavelength nonlinear nanoresonators. Taking materials with Zinc-Blende structure as example, we reveal that such systems can naturally generate various polarization-entangled Bell states over a very broad range of wavelengths and emission directions, with little to no engineering needed. Interestingly, we uncover different regimes of operation, where polarization-entangled photons can be generated with dependence on or complete independence from the pumping wavelength and polarization, and the modal content of the nanoresonator. Our work also shows the potential of nonlinear nanoresonators as miniaturized sources of biphoton states with highly complex and tunable properties.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared computational temporal ghost imaging</title>

Abstract: Ghost imaging in the time domain allows for reconstructing fast temporal objects using a slow photodetector. The technique involves correlating random or pre-programmed probing temporal intensity patterns with the integrated signal measured after modulation by the temporal object. However, the implementation of temporal ghost imaging necessitates ultrafast detectors or modulators for measuring or pre-programming the probing intensity patterns, which is not universally available in all spectral regions especially in the mid-infrared range. Here, we demonstrate a frequency downconversion temporal ghost imaging scheme that enables to extend the operation regime to arbitrary wavelengths regions where fast modulators and detectors are not available. The approach modulates a signal with temporal intensity patterns in the near-infrared and transfers the patterns to an idler via difference-frequency generation at the wavelength of the temporal object to be retrieved. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate temporal ghost imaging in the mid-infrared. The scheme is flexible and introduces new possibilities for scan-free pump-probe imaging and the study of ultrafast dynamics in spectral regions where ultrafast modulation or detection is challenging such as the mid-infrared and THz regions.</description>

      <title>Simulation of diffraction and scattering using the Wigner Distribution Function</title>

Abstract: X-ray phase-contrast imaging enhances soft tissue visualization by leveraging the phase shift of X-rays passing through materials. It permits to minimize radiation exposure due to high contrast, as well as high resolution imaging limited by the wavelength of the X-rays. Phase retrieval extracts the phase shift computationally, but simulated images fail to recreate low-frequency noise observed in experimental images. To this end, we propose a new method to simulate phase contrast images using the Wigner Distribution Function. This permits the simulation of wave and particle effects simultaneously and simulates images photon by photon. Here, we give a first demonstration of the method by simulating the Gaussian double-slit experiment. It has the potential for realistic simulation of low-dose imaging.</description>

      <title>Bright and dark states of light: The quantum origin of classical interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.05512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical theory asserts that several electromagnetic waves cannot interact with matter if they interfere destructively to zero, whereas quantum mechanics predicts a nontrivial light-matter dynamics even when the average electric field vanishes. Here we show that in quantum optics classical interference emerges from collective bright and dark states of light, \textit{i.e.}, entangled superpositions of multi-mode photon-number states. This makes it possible to explain wave interference using the particle description of light and the superposition principle for linear systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch band theory of generalized eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Waves in a variety of fields in physics, such as mechanics, optics, spintronics, and nonlinear systems, obey generalized eigenvalue equations. To study non-Hermitian physics of those systems, in this paper, we construct a non-Bloch band theory of generalized eigenvalue problems. Specifically, we show that eigenvalues of a transfer matrix lead to a certain condition imposed on the generalized Brillouin zone, which allows us to develop a theory to calculate the continuum bands. As a concrete example, we examine the non-Hermitian skin effect of photonic crystals composed of chiral metamaterials by invoking our theoretical framework. When the medium has circularly polarized eigenmodes, we find that each eigenmode localizes at either of the edges, depending on whether it is left- or right-circularly polarized. In contrast, when the medium only has linearly polarized eigenmodes, every eigenmode localizes to the edge of the same side independent of its polarization. We demonstrate that the localization lengths of those eigenmodes can be determined from the chiral parameters and eigenfrequencies of the photonic crystal.</description>
