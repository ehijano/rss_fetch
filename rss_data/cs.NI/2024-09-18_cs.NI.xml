      <title>Resilient UAVs Location Sharing Service Based on Information Freshness and Opportunistic Deliveries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been recognized as a versatile platform for a wide range of services. During the flight, these vehicles must avoid collisions to operate safely. In this way, they demand to keep spatial awareness, i.e., to know others in their coverage area. However, mobility and positioning aspects hamper building UAV network infrastructure to support reliable basic services. Thus, such vehicles call for a location service with up-to-date information resilient to false location injection threats. This work proposes FlySafe, a resilient UAVs location sharing service that employs opportunistic approaches to deliver UAVs' location. FlySafe takes into account the freshness of UAVs' location to maintain their spatial awareness. Further, it counts on the age of the UAV's location information to trigger device discovery. Simulation results showed that FlySafe achieved spatial awareness up to 94.15% of UAV operations, being resilient to~false locations injected in the network. Moreover, the accuracy in device discovery achieved 94.53% with a location error of less than 2 m.</description>

      <title>Dynamic DAG-Application Scheduling for Multi-Tier Edge Computing in Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge computing is deemed a promising technique to execute latency-sensitive applications by offloading computation-intensive tasks to edge servers. Extensive research has been conducted in the field of end-device to edge server task offloading for several goals, including latency minimization, energy optimization, and resource optimization. However, few of them consider our mobile computing devices (smartphones, tablets, and laptops) to be edge devices. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-tier edge computing framework, which we refer to as M-TEC, that aims to optimize latency, reduce the probability of failure, and optimize cost while accounting for the sporadic failure of personally owned devices and the changing network conditions. We conduct experiments with a real testbed and a real commercial CBRS 4G network, and the results indicate that M-TEC is capable of reducing the end-to-end latency of applications by at least 8\% compared to the best baseline under a variety of network conditions, while providing reliable performance at an affordable cost.</description>

      <title>LoRa Communication for Agriculture 4.0: Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of smart agriculture leverages the Internet of Things (IoT) to revolutionize farming practices. This paper investigates the transformative potential of Long Range (LoRa) technology as a key enabler of long-range wireless communication for agricultural IoT systems. By reviewing existing literature, we identify a gap in research specifically focused on LoRa's prospects and challenges from a communication perspective in smart agriculture. We delve into the details of LoRa-based agricultural networks, covering network architecture design, Physical Layer (PHY) considerations tailored to the agricultural environment, and channel modeling techniques that account for soil characteristics. The paper further explores relaying and routing mechanisms that address the challenges of extending network coverage and optimizing data transmission in vast agricultural landscapes. Transitioning to practical aspects, we discuss sensor deployment strategies and energy management techniques, offering insights for real-world deployments. A comparative analysis of LoRa with other wireless communication technologies employed in agricultural IoT applications highlights its strengths and weaknesses in this context. Furthermore, the paper outlines several future research directions to leverage the potential of LoRa-based agriculture 4.0. These include advancements in channel modeling for diverse farming environments, novel relay routing algorithms, integrating emerging sensor technologies like hyper-spectral imaging and drone-based sensing, on-device Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, and sustainable solutions. This survey can guide researchers, technologists, and practitioners to understand, implement, and propel smart agriculture initiatives using LoRa technology.</description>

      <title>Designing Reliable Virtualized Radio Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As virtualization of Radio Access Networks (RAN) gains momentum, understanding the impact of hardware and software disaggregation on resiliency becomes critical to meet the high availability requirements of mobile networks. Our paper presents an analytical model, using continuous time Markov chains, to study the impact of virtualization and disaggregation on RAN availability. Our evaluation, assuming typical parameter value ranges for failure and recovery rates, points to containerized platform reliability as a constraint on vRAN availability. We also find that with active-passive replication, increasing hardware replication factor beyond 2 may not bring any benefits unless failover times are reduced. We also compare the reliability of centralized and distributed virtualized central units.</description>

      <title>Micro-orchestration of RAN functions accelerated in FPGA SoC devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides a vision on how to tackle the underutilization of compute resources in FPGA SoC devices used across 5G and edge computing infrastructures. A first step towards this end is the implementation of a resource management layer able to migrate and scale functions in such devices, based on context events. This layer sets the basis to design a hierarchical data-driven micro-orchestrator in charge of providing the lifecycle management of functions in FPGA SoC devices. In the O-RAN context, the micro-orchestrator is foreseen to take the form of an xApp/rApp tandem trained with RAN traffic and context data.</description>

      <title>Fast and Post-Quantum Authentication for Real-time Next Generation Networks with Bloom Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale next-generation networked systems like smart grids and vehicular networks facilitate extensive automation and autonomy through real-time communication of sensitive messages. Digital signatures are vital for such applications since they offer scalable broadcast authentication with non-repudiation. Yet, even conventional secure signatures (e.g., ECDSA, RSA) introduce significant cryptographic delays that can disrupt the safety of such delay-aware systems. With the rise of quantum computers breaking conventional intractability problems, these traditional cryptosystems must be replaced with post-quantum (PQ) secure ones. However, PQ-secure signatures are significantly costlier than their conventional counterparts, vastly exacerbating delay hurdles for real-time applications.
  We propose a new signature called Time Valid Probabilistic Data Structure HORS (TVPD-HORS) that achieves significantly lower end-to-end delay with a tunable PQ-security for real-time applications. We harness special probabilistic data structures as an efficient one-way function at the heart of our novelty, thereby vastly fastening HORS as a primitive for NIST PQ cryptography standards. TVPD-HORS permits tunable and fast processing for varying input sizes via One-hash Bloom Filter, excelling in time valid cases, wherein authentication with shorter security parameters is used for short-lived yet safety-critical messages. We show that TVPD-HORS verification is 2.7x and 5x faster than HORS in high-security and time valid settings, respectively. TVPD-HORS key generation is also faster, with a similar signing speed to HORS. Moreover, TVPD-HORS can increase the speed of HORS variants over a magnitude of time. These features make TVPD-HORS an ideal primitive to raise high-speed time valid versions of PQ-safe standards like XMSS and SPHINCS+, paving the way for real-time authentication of next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Machine Learning-Enabled Optimization for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces-Aided 6G Networks: From Reinforcement Learning to Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) becomes a promising technique for 6G networks by reshaping signal propagation in smart radio environments. However, it also leads to significant complexity for network management due to the large number of elements and dedicated phase-shift optimization. In this work, we provide an overview of machine learning (ML)-enabled optimization for RIS-aided 6G networks. In particular, we focus on various reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, e.g., deep Q-learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, transfer reinforcement learning, hierarchical reinforcement learning, and offline reinforcement learning. Different from existing studies, this work further discusses how large language models (LLMs) can be combined with RL to handle network optimization problems. It shows that LLM offers new opportunities to enhance the capabilities of RL algorithms in terms of generalization, reward function design, multi-modal information processing, etc. Finally, we identify the future challenges and directions of ML-enabled optimization for RIS-aided 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Design Optimization of NOMA Aided Multi-STAR-RIS for Indoor Environments: A Convex Approximation Imitated Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enables multiple users to share the same frequency band, and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) provides 360-degree full-space coverage, optimizing both transmission and reflection for improved network performance and dynamic control of the indoor environment. However, deploying STAR-RIS indoors presents challenges in interference mitigation, power consumption, and real-time configuration. In this work, a novel network architecture utilizing multiple access points (APs), STAR-RISs, and NOMA is proposed for indoor communication. To address these, we formulate an optimization problem involving user assignment, access point (AP) beamforming, and STAR-RIS phase control. A decomposition approach is used to solve the complex problem efficiently, employing a many-to-one matching algorithm for user-AP assignment and K-means clustering for resource management. Additionally, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) is leveraged to optimize the control of the STAR-RIS. Within the proposed MADRL framework, a novel approach is introduced in which each decision variable acts as an independent agent, enabling collaborative learning and decision making. The MADRL framework is enhanced by incorporating convex approximation (CA), which accelerates policy learning through suboptimal solutions from successive convex approximation (SCA), leading to faster adaptation and convergence. Simulations demonstrate significant improvements in network utility compared to baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Infiltrating the Sky: Data Delay and Overflow Attacks in Earth Observation Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Earth Observation (EO) satellites have changed the way we monitor Earth. Acting like moving cameras, EO satellites are formed in constellations with different missions and priorities, and capture vast data that needs to be transmitted to the ground for processing. However, EO satellites have very limited downlink communication capability, limited by transmission bandwidth, number and location of ground stations, and small transmission windows due to high velocity satellite movement. To optimize resource utilization, EO constellations are expected to share communication spectrum and ground stations for maximum communication efficiency.
  In this paper, we investigate a new attack surface exposed by resource competition in EO constellations, targeting the delay or drop of Earth monitoring data using legitimate EO services. Specifically, an attacker can inject high-priority requests to temporarily preempt low-priority data transmission windows. Furthermore, we show that by utilizing predictable satellite dynamics, an attacker can intelligently target critical data from low-priority satellites, either delaying its delivery or irreversibly dropping the data. We formulate two attacks, the data delay attack and the data overflow attack, design algorithms to assist attackers in devising attack strategies, and analyze their feasibility or optimality in typical scenarios. We then conduct trace-driven simulations using real-world satellite images and orbit data to evaluate the success probability of launching these attacks under realistic satellite communication settings. We also discuss possible defenses against these attacks.</description>

      <title>Resources on the Move for Smart City: A Disruptive Perspective on the Grand Convergence of Sensing, Communications, Computing, Storage, and Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most commonly seen things on streets in any city are vehicles. However, most of them are used to transport people or goods. What if they also carry resources and capabilities for sensing, communications, computing, storage, and intelligence (SCCSI)? We will have a web of sensors to monitor the city, a network of powerful communicators to transport data around, a grid of computing power to conduct data analytics and machine learning (ML), a network of distributed storage to buffer/cache data/job for optimization, and a set of movable AI/ML toolboxes made available for specialized smart applications. This perspective article presents how to leverage SCCSI-empowered vehicles to design such a service network, simply called SCCSI network, to help build a smart city with a cost-effective and sustainable solution. It showcases how multi-dimensional technologies, namely, sensing, communications, computing, storage, and intelligence, converge to a unifying technology to solve grand challenges for resource demands from emerging large-scale applications. Thus, with SCCSI-empowered vehicles on the ground, over the air, and on the sea, SCCSI network can make resources and capabilities on the move, practically pushing SCCSI services to the edge! We hope this article serves as a spark to stimulate more disruptive thinking to address grand challenges of paramount importance.</description>

      <title>Age of $k$-out-of-$n$ Systems on a Gossip Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider information update systems on a gossip network, which consists of a single source and $n$ receiver nodes. The source encrypts the information into $n$ distinct keys with version stamps, sending a unique key to each node. For decoding the information in a $k$-out-of-$n$ system, each receiver node requires at least $k+1$ different keys with the same version, shared over peer-to-peer connections. Each node determines $k$ based on a given function, ensuring that as $k$ increases, the precision of the decoded information also increases. We consider two different schemes: a memory scheme (in which the nodes keep the source's current and previous encrypted messages) and a memoryless scheme (in which the nodes are allowed to only keep the source's current message). We measure the ''timeliness'' of information updates by using the $k$-keys version age of information. Our work focuses on determining closed-form expressions for the time average age of information in a heterogeneous random graph under both with memory and memoryless schemes.</description>

      <title>J\"ager: Automated Telephone Call Traceback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02839v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsolicited telephone calls that facilitate fraud or unlawful telemarketing continue to overwhelm network users and the regulators who prosecute them. The first step in prosecuting phone abuse is traceback -- identifying the call originator. This fundamental investigative task currently requires hours of manual effort per call. In this paper, we introduce J\"ager, a distributed secure call traceback system. J\"ager can trace a call in a few seconds, even with partial deployment, while cryptographically preserving the privacy of call parties, carrier trade secrets like peers and call volume, and limiting the threat of bulk analysis. We establish definitions and requirements of secure traceback, then develop a suite of protocols that meet these requirements using witness encryption, oblivious pseudorandom functions, and group signatures. We prove these protocols secure in the universal composibility framework. We then demonstrate that J\"ager has low compute and bandwidth costs per call, and these costs scale linearly with call volume. J\"ager provides an efficient, secure, privacy-preserving system to revolutionize telephone abuse investigation with minimal costs to operators.</description>
