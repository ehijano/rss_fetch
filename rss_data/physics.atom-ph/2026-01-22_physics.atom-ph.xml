      <title>Light propagation in atomic stratified media: breakdown of the transfer-matrix method at high density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transfer-matrix method is a standard approach to wave propagation in stratified media. With the advent of cold-atom-based quantum and photonic technologies, several experiments and many proposals consider light propagation in one-dimensional optical lattices, using the transfer matrices as the main tool for the simulation. Here, we study the validity of this method by comparing its results to the microscopic coupled-dipole model, which is exact in the linear-optics regime. We show that the transfer-matrix method works very well at low density, even for thin disordered slices, and breaks down at high density because the dipole-dipole interaction induces a collective response from the atoms such that the properties of one layer are influenced by the others. We determine the boundary values of atomic densities for which this method is still applicable for describing experiments. Our findings are relevant for experimental realizations using ultra-cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Precision measurement of the ground-state hyperfine constant for $^9Be^+$ in a linear Paul trap via magnetically insensitive hyperfine transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct measurements of the ground-state magnetically insensitive hyperfine transition |F=2,mF=0&gt;-&gt;|F=1,mF=0&gt; of $^9Be^+$ ions have been performed using microwave-driven state transfer. The $^9Be^+$ ions are confined and laser-cooled in a linear Paul trap, forming a Coulomb crystal. The transition frequencies have been measured over a magnetic field range of $ \pm 0.5 mT $ centered at zero magnetic field, and the acquired data were fitted accounting for the high-order Zeeman effect. The hyperfine constant A is determined to be -625.008840(35) MHz, achieving a relative precision of $ 5.6 \times 10^{-8}$.</description>

      <title>Bending strain induced thermal conductivity suppression in freestanding BaTiO3 and SrTiO3 membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Freestanding perovskite oxide membranes provide a novel platform for elastic strain engineering, enabling the manipulation of phonon transport free from substrate clamping. In this work, we investigate the thermal transport properties of strontium titanate (SrTiO3) and barium titanate (BaTiO3) membranes subjected to self-formed crease induced inhomogeneous strain. By integrating spatially resolved Frequency-Domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR) with micro-Raman spectroscopy, we observe a sharp, localized suppression of thermal conductivity (k) in high-curvature regions. Specifically, k is reduced from 4.43 to 3.62 W/(m K) in SrTiO3 and from 2.27 to 1.81 W/(m K) in BaTiO3 at the crease centers, directly correlating with the local strain distribution. First-principles calculations reveal that, unlike uniform strain, the symmetry breaking induced by strain gradients significantly broadens phonon dispersion and enhances scattering rates. These findings not only elucidate the microscopic mechanisms governing phonon-strain coupling but also demonstrate the potential of inhomogeneous strain fields as a potent tool for designing dynamic solid-state thermal switches and active thermal management devices.</description>

      <title>Phase projection errors in rf-driven optically pumped magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the phase relationship between the oscillating (rf) excitation field and the detected (light) power modulation in scalar rf-driven optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs), in particular in the $M_x$ configuration. While the static dependence of the demodulation phase on the direction of the external static magnetic field vector can be largely mitigated by aligning the oscillating rf field along the light propagation direction, we demonstrate that a dynamic (transient) phase response arises under magnetic field tilts. We analytically solve the corresponding modified Bloch equation and confirm agreement with experimental observations obtained using an $M_x$ magnetometer incorporating a paraffin-coated Cs vapor cell. The results reveal fundamental limitations of $M_x$ magnetometers regarding response time and accuracy, in particular when employed with active electronic feedback, such as a phase-locked loop. Therefore, this work is highly relevant to important magnetometry applications where the direction of the quasi-static magnetic field of interest is unknown \textit{a priori} or varies over time, or in measurements requiring a large detection bandwidth. Such conditions are encountered in applications such as geomagnetic surveying, particularly with mobile platforms.</description>

      <title>Creation of ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the creation of optically trapped ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules in a mixture of 23Na and 87Rb atoms. With loss spectroscopy and binding energy measurements, we systematically characterize the interspecies p-wave Feshbach resonances near 284 G. Leveraging this understanding, we use magneto-association to form p-wave NaRb Feshbach molecules, producing both pure samples and mixtures of molecules in different angular momentum states. Additionally, we investigate the inelastic loss of these molecules, primarily influenced by atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collisions. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing tunable p-wave interactions in heteronuclear ultracold systems and provide a foundation for exploring non-zero angular momentum molecules.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and far-from-equilibrium equation of state of Bogoliubov waves in Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15163v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bogoliubov waves are fundamental excitations of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). They emerge from a perturbed ground state and interact nonlinearly, triggering turbulent cascades. Here, we study turbulent BECs theoretically and numerically using the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii model and its associated wave-kinetic equations. We derive a new Kolmogorov-like stationary spectrum for short Bogoliubov waves and find a complete analytical expression for the spectrum in the long-wave acoustic regime. We then use our predictions to explain the BEC equation of state reported in [Dora et al. Nature 620,521 (2023)], and to suggest new experimental settings.</description>
