      <title>Isometries of the class of ball-bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the surjective isometries, with respect to the Hausdorff distance, of the class of bodies given by intersections of Euclidean unit balls. We show that any such isometry is given by the composition of a rigid motion with either the identity or the c-duality mapping, which maps a body in this class to the intersection of Euclidean unit balls centered at points in the body.</description>

      <title>A full classification of the isometries of the class of ball-bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complementing our previous results, we give a classification of all isometries (not necessarily surjective) of the metric space consisting of ball-bodies, endowed with the Hausdorff metric. "Ball bodies" are convex bodies which are intersections of translates of the Euclidean unit ball. We show that any such isometry is either a rigid motion, or a rigid motion composed with the c-duality mapping. In particular, any isometry on this metric space has to be surjective.</description>

      <title>Planar lattices and equilateral odd-gons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a planar integral lattice $L$, let $\nu(L)$ denote the square-free part of the integer $D(L)^2$, where $D(L)$ stands for the area of a fundamental parallelogram of $L$. For each odd integer $n$ with $3 \leq n&lt;29$, a planar lattice $L$ contains an equilateral $n$-gon if and only if $L$ is similar to an integral lattice $L'$ such that $\nu(L')\equiv 3 \pmod 4$ and the largest prime factor $p$ of $\nu(L')$ satisfies $p \leq n$. Moreover, such $L$ contains a convex equilateral $n$-gon, which answers a problem posed by Maehara.</description>

      <title>Software for the Thompson and Funk Polygonal Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metric spaces defined within convex polygons, such as the Thompson, Funk, reverse Funk, and Hilbert metrics, are subjects of recent exploration and study in computational geometry. This paper contributes an educational piece of software for understanding these unique geometries while also providing a tool to support their research. We provide dynamic software for manipulating the Funk, reverse Funk, and Thompson balls in convex polygonal domains. Additionally, we provide a visualization program for traversing the Hilbert polygonal geometry.</description>

      <title>Derivations and Sobolev functions on extended metric-measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the first-order differential calculus over extended metric-topological measure spaces. The latter are quartets $\mathbb X=(X,\tau,{\sf d},\mathfrak m)$, given by an extended metric space $(X,{\sf d})$ together with a weaker topology $\tau$ (satisfying suitable compatibility conditions) and a finite Radon measure $\mathfrak m$ on $(X,\tau)$. The class of extended metric-topological measure spaces encompasses all metric measure spaces and many infinite-dimensional metric-measure structures, such as abstract Wiener spaces. In this framework, we study the following classes of objects:
  - The Banach algebra ${\rm Lip}_b(X,\tau,{\sf d})$ of bounded $\tau$-continuous ${\sf d}$-Lipschitz functions on $X$.
  - Several notions of Lipschitz derivations on $X$, defined in duality with ${\rm Lip}_b(X,\tau,{\sf d})$.
  - The metric Sobolev space $W^{1,p}(\mathbb X)$, defined in duality with Lipschitz derivations on $X$.
  Inter alia, we generalise both Weaver's and Di Marino's theories of Lipschitz derivations to the extended setting, and we discuss their connections. We also introduce a Sobolev space $W^{1,p}(\mathbb X)$ via an integration-by-parts formula, along the lines of Di Marino's notion of Sobolev space, and we prove its equivalence with other approaches, studied in the extended setting by Ambrosio, Erbar and Savar\'{e}. En route, we obtain some results of independent interest, among which are:
  - A Lipschitz-constant-preserving extension result for $\tau$-continuous ${\sf d}$-Lipschitz functions.
  - A novel and rather robust strategy for proving the equivalence of Sobolev-type spaces defined via an integration-by-parts formula and those obtained with a relaxation procedure.
  - A new description of an isometric predual of the metric Sobolev space $W^{1,p}(\mathbb X)$.</description>

      <title>Deep sections of the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a non-negative number $t$ and a hyperplane $H$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose distance to the center of the hypercube $[0,1]^d$ is $t$. If $t$ is equal to $0$ and $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of $[0,1]^d$, it is known that the $(d-1)$-dimensional volume of $H\cap[0,1]^d$ is a strictly increasing function of $d$ when $d$ is at least $3$. The study of the monotonicity of this volume is extended for $t$ up to above $1/2$ and, when $d$ is large enough, for every non-negative $t$. In particular, a range for $t$ is identified such that this volume is a strictly decreasing function of $d$ over the positive integers. The local extremality of the $(d-1)$-dimensional volume of $H\cap[0,1]^d$ when $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of either $[0,1]^d$ or a lower dimensional face is also determined for the same values of $t$. It is shown for instance that when $t$ is above an explicit constant and $d$ is large enough, this volume is always strictly locally maximal when $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of $[0,1]^d$. A precise estimate for the convergence rate of the Eulerian numbers to their limit Gaussian behavior is provided along the way.</description>

      <title>On the total surface area of potato packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if we fill without gaps a bag with infinitely many potatoes, in such a way that they touch each other in few points, then the total surface area of the potatoes must be infinite. In this context potatoes are measurable subsets of the Euclidean space, the bag is any open set of the same space. As we show, this result also holds in the general context of doubling (even locally) metric measure spaces satisfying Poincar\'e inequality, in particular in smooth Riemannian manifolds and even in some sub-Riemannian spaces.</description>

      <title>On The Heine-Borel Property and Minimum Enclosing Balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we contribute a proof that minimum radius balls over metric spaces with the Heine-Borel property are always LP type. Additionally, we prove that weak metric spaces, those without symmetry, also have this property if we fix the direction in which we take their distances from the centers of the balls. We use this to prove that the minimum radius ball problem is LP type in the Hilbert and Thompson metrics and Funk weak metric. In doing so, we contribute a proof that the topology induced by the Thompson metric coincides with the Hilbert. We provide explicit primitives for computing the minimum radius ball in the Hilbert metric.</description>
