      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently completed SubMIT platform is a small set of servers that provide interactive access to substantial data samples at high speeds, enabling sophisticated data analyses with very fast turnaround times. Additionally, it seamlessly integrates massive processing resources for large-scale tasks by connecting to a set of powerful batch processing systems. It serves as an ideal prototype for an Analysis Facility tailored to meet the demanding data and computational requirements anticipated during the High-Luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider. The key features that make this facility so powerful include highly optimized data access with a minimum of 100Gbps networking per server, a large managed NVMe storage system, and a substantial spinning-disk Ceph file system. The platform integrates a diverse set of high multicore CPU machines for tasks benefiting from the multithreading and GPU resources for example for neural network training. SubMIT also provides and supports a flexible environment for users to manage their own software needs for example by using containers. This article describes the facility, its users, and a few complementary, generic and real-life analyses that are used to benchmark its various capabilities.</description>

      <title>NELM: Modern Open-Source Software for Multipurpose Impedance Spectra Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has become an advanced experimental technique with a wide range of applications: from simple passive circuits diagnostics to semiconductor high-end device development and breakthrough technologies in bio-sensing. Although hardware for EIS today is well developed, the EIS analysis software is mainly custom, old fashioned, i.e. it is limited by features, does not utilize the progress in the modern computer science and hardware, and is usually implemented in close-source code or written on outdated programming languages, which causes slow progress in field of the EIS and complicates researchers attempts of development in EIS autonomous devices, such as implants. In this article, we introduce a free and open-sourced MatLab/GNU Octave package for EIS analysis called NELM, which provides powerful equipment tools for matching experimental impedance data with theoretical equivalent circuits. Our software has an user friendly interface and supports different formats of input data, fitting programs, and impedance models. In addition, we have developed NELM with implementation of the latest progress in computation science such as symbolic calculations, parallel computing, and artificial intelligence. The abilities of NELM were validated by its applications in the different fields of science, such as semiconductor studies, bioimpedance and electrochemestry, which demonstrated high-efficiency of the proposed software package and showed that it is a promising tool for solving actual problems in electronic industry, biosensorics, and healthcare technologies.</description>

      <title>Using Diffusion Models to do Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent surge in machine learning (ML) methods for geophysical modeling has raised the question of how these same ML methods might be applied to data assimilation (DA). We focus on diffusion modeling (a form of generative artificial intelligence) and on systems that can perform the entire DA, rather than on ML-based tools that are used within an otherwise conventional DA system. We explain that there are (at least) three different types of diffusion-based DA systems and we show in detail that the three systems differ in the type of posterior distribution they target for sampling. The different posterior distributions correspond to different priors and\slash or likelihoods, which in turn results in different types of training data sets, different computational requirements and different qualities of their state estimates. We discuss the implications of these findings for the use of diffusion modeling in DA.</description>

      <title>Classification of Hoyle State Decay Branches in Active Target Time Projection Chamber using Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multi-class convolutional neural network (CNN) model has been developed using Keras deep learning library in Python for image-based classification of $^{12}$C Hoyle state decay branches from tracking information, recorded by Saha Active Target Time Projection Chamber, SAT-TPC (currently under development). The nuclear events, produced by the 30 MeV $\alpha$-particle beam in the SAT-TPC, filled with Ar + CO$_2$ (90:10) gas mixture at atmospheric pressure, have been considered for training and validation of the models. The elastic scattering and Hoyle state sequential and direct decay events in the interaction of $\alpha$-particle with $^{40}$Ar, $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O nuclei have been generated through Monte-Carlo simulation. The three-dimensional tracks, produced by the scattering and decay products through primary ionization of gaseous medium, have been simulated with Geant4. The primary tracks, distributed on the beam-plane, have been convoluted with electron diffusion, obtained with Magboltz, to produce the final tracking information. The classification performance of the proposed model for different readout segmentation schemes of the SAT-TPC has been discussed.</description>

      <title>Random Hyperbolic Graphs with Arbitrary Mesoscale Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world networks exhibit universal structural properties such as sparsity, small-worldness, heterogeneous degree distributions, high clustering, and community structures. Geometric network models, particularly Random Hyperbolic Graphs (RHGs), effectively capture many of these features by embedding nodes in a latent similarity space. However, networks are often characterized by specific connectivity patterns between groups of nodes -- i.e. communities -- that are not geometric, in the sense that the dissimilarity between groups do not obey the triangle inequality. Structuring connections only based on the interplay of similarity and popularity thus poses fundamental limitations on the mesoscale structure of the networks that RHGs can generate. To address this limitation, we introduce the Random Hyperbolic Block Model (RHBM), which extends RHGs by incorporating block structures within a maximum-entropy framework. We demonstrate the advantages of the RHBM through synthetic network analyses, highlighting its ability to preserve community structures where purely geometric models fail. Our findings emphasize the importance of latent geometry in network modeling while addressing its limitations in controlling mesoscale mixing patterns.</description>

      <title>Reentrant localization in a quasiperiodic chain with correlated hopping sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic systems are known to exhibit localization transitions in low dimensions, wherein all electronic states become localized beyond a critical disorder strength. Interestingly, recent studies have uncovered a reentrant localization (RL) phenomenon: upon further increasing the quasiperiodic disorder strength beyond the localization threshold, a subset of previously localized states can become delocalized again within a specific parameter window. While RL transitions have been primarily explored in systems with simple periodic modulations, such as dimerized or long-range hopping integrals, the impact of more intricate or correlated hopping structures on RL behavior remains largely elusive. In this work, we investigate the localization behavior in a one-dimensional lattice featuring staggered, correlated on-site potentials following the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model, along with off-diagonal hopping modulations structured according to quasiperiodic Fibonacci and Bronze Mean sequences. By systematically analyzing the fractal dimension, inverse participation ratio, and normalized participation ratio, we demonstrate the occurrence of RL transitions induced purely by the interplay between quasiperiodic on-site disorder and correlated hopping. Our findings highlight the crucial role of underlying structural correlations in governing localization-delocalization transitions in low-dimensional quasiperiodic systems, where the correlated disorder manifests in both diagonal and off-diagonal terms.</description>

      <title>XENONnT WIMP Search: Signal &amp; Background Modeling and Statistical Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The XENONnT experiment searches for weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter scattering off a xenon nucleus. In particular, XENONnT uses a dual-phase time projection chamber with a 5.9-tonne liquid xenon target, detecting both scintillation and ionization signals to reconstruct the energy, position, and type of recoil. A blind search for nuclear recoil WIMPs with an exposure of 1.1 tonne-years (4.18 t fiducial mass) yielded no signal excess over background expectations, from which competitive exclusion limits were derived on WIMP-nucleon elastic scatter cross sections, for WIMP masses ranging from 6 GeV/$c^2$ up to the TeV/$c^2$ scale. This work details the modeling and statistical methods employed in this search. By means of calibration data, we model the detector response, which is then used to derive background and signal models. The construction and validation of these models is discussed, alongside additional purely data-driven backgrounds. We also describe the statistical inference framework, including the definition of the likelihood function and the construction of confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>On the dynamical evolution of randomness Part A: Random experiments as dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, Bernoulli's Law of Large Numbers, also known as the Golden theorem, has been extended to study the relations between empirical probability and empirical randomness of an otherwise random experiment. Using the example of a coin toss and a dice role, some interesting results are drawn. Analytically and using numerical computations, empirical randomness of each outcome has been shown to increase by \textit{ chance}, which itself depends on the growth rate of empirical probabilities. The analyses presented in this work, apart form depicting the nature of flow of random experiments in repetitions, also present dynamical behaviours of the random experiment, and experimental and simulation-based verifications of the mathematical analyses. It also presents an appreciation of the beauty of Bernoulli's Golden theorem and its applications by extension.</description>

      <title>Evidence of equilibrium dynamics in human social networks evolving in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11635v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do networks of relationships evolve over time? We analyse a dataset tracking the social interactions of 900 individuals over four years. Despite continuous shifts in individual relationships, the macroscopic structural properties of the network remain stable, fluctuating within predictable bounds. We connect this stability to the concept of equilibrium in statistical physics. Specifically, we demonstrate that the probabilities governing network dynamics are stationary over time, and key features like degree, edge, and triangle abundances align with theoretical predictions from equilibrium dynamics. Moreover, the dynamics satisfies the detailed balance condition. Remarkably, equilibrium persists despite constant turnover as people join, leave, and change connections. This suggests that equilibrium arises not from specific individuals but from the balancing act of human needs, cognitive limits, and social pressures. Practically, this equilibrium simplifies data collection, supports methods relying on single network snapshots (like Exponential Random Graph Models), and aids in designing interventions for social challenges. Theoretically, it offers new insights into collective human behaviour, revealing how emergent properties of complex social systems can be captured by simple mathematical models.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation and Dosimetric Analysis of Gold Nanoparticles (AuNPs) in Breast Tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise radiation delivery is critical for effective radiotherapy, and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have emerged as promising tools to enhance local dose deposition while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue. In this study, the PENELOPE Monte Carlo code was used to investigate the dosimetry of AuNPs under different conditions and models. The Dose Enhancement Ratio (DER) was studied in water and breast tissue with spherical shapes and in agreement with previously published results. To further analyse the physical interactions of the particles around the AuNP, a Phase Space File (PSF) in a volume around the AuNPs was created. This showed that larger AuNPs lead to increased doses, as expected, yielding DER values exceeding 100 times. Finally, results reveal that in the volume surrounding the AuNP, 80% of emitted electrons originate from photoelectric absorption, leading to Auger electron emission cascades which were analysed in detail. It was also possible to establish a direct relation between number of secondaries and the particle volumes. The Local Effect Model (LEM) was used to determine survival curves in AuNPs of different sizes at different gold concentrations. The last part of this work consisted in analysing a distribution of AuNPs within a flattened cell typical of clonogenic assays where a log-normal distribution of dose was observed. This led to the development of a new, mechanistic, Local Effect Model which, if further validated, can have further applications in-vitro and in-silico.</description>
