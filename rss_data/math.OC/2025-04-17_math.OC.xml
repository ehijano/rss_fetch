      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This monograph presents a comprehensive analysis of the technological foundations of management decision-making in the reconstruction of complex gas pipeline systems. The study addresses the challenges posed by the aging infrastructure of gas supply networks and explores advanced strategies to improve their reliability, efficiency, and automation. Particular attention is given to the reconstruction of pipelines with various configurations linear, looped, and parallel systems under non-stationary gas flow conditions. The proposed models and methodologies offer solutions for optimizing operational parameters, improving emergency valve response, and ensuring uninterrupted gas supply through advanced management systems and data-driven decision support tools. Emphasis is placed on the integration of modern technologies, system theory, and feedback mechanisms in the design and operation of reconstructed pipeline systems. This work is intended for engineers, system designers, and researchers in the fields of gas supply, systems engineering, and energy infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Adaptive and various learning-based algorithm for supply chain network equilibrium problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel nonlinear programming model to capture the equilibrium state of complex supply chain networks. The model, equivalent to a variational inequality model, relaxes traditional strict assumptions to accommodate real-world complexities, such as nonlinear, non-convex, and non-smooth relationships between production, consumption, and pricing. To efficiently solve this challenging problem, we introduce a novel heuristic algorithm, the adaptive and various learning-based algorithm (AVLA), inspired by group learning behaviors. AVLA simulates individual learning processes within different subgroups at various stages, employing a success history-based parameter adaptation mechanism to reduce manual tuning. Extensive computational experiments on 29 benchmark problems and 5 supply chain networks demonstrate AVLA's superior performance compared to 19 state of the art algorithms. AVLA consistently achieves the best results in terms of both average and best objective function values, making it a powerful tool for addressing complex supply chain network equilibrium problems.</description>

      <title>Sub-optimality of the Separation Principle for Quadratic Control from Bilinear Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of controlling a linear dynamical system from bilinear observations with minimal quadratic cost. Despite the similarity of this problem to standard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, we show that when the observation model is bilinear, neither does the Separation Principle hold, nor is the optimal controller affine in the estimated state. Moreover, the cost-to-go is non-convex in the control input. Hence, finding an analytical expression for the optimal feedback controller is difficult in general. Under certain settings, we show that the standard LQG controller locally maximizes the cost instead of minimizing it. Furthermore, the optimal controllers (derived analytically) are not unique and are nonlinear in the estimated state. We also introduce a notion of input-dependent observability and derive conditions under which the Kalman filter covariance remains bounded. We illustrate our theoretical results through numerical experiments in multiple synthetic settings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the optimal transportation problem on a globally hyperbolic spacetime with a cost function $c$, which corresponds to the optimal transportation problem on a complete Riemannian manifold where the cost function is given by the squared Riemannian distance. Building upon methods of weak KAM theory, we will establish the existence of $C_{loc}^{1,1}$ optimal pairs for the dual optimal transport problem for probability measures along displacement interpolations.</description>

      <title>Traffic Adaptive Moving-window Service Patrolling for Real-time Incident Management during High-impact Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the Traffic Adaptive Moving-window Patrolling Algorithm (TAMPA), designed to improve real-time incident management during major events like sports tournaments and concerts. Such events significantly stress transportation networks, requiring efficient and adaptive patrol solutions. TAMPA integrates predictive traffic modeling and real-time complaint estimation, dynamically optimizing patrol deployment. Using dynamic programming, the algorithm continuously adjusts patrol strategies within short planning windows, effectively balancing immediate response and efficient routing. Leveraging the Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality, TAMPA detects significant shifts in complaint patterns, triggering proactive adjustments in patrol routes. Theoretical analyses ensure performance remains closely aligned with optimal solutions. Simulation results from an urban traffic network demonstrate TAMPA's superior performance, showing improvements of approximately 87.5\% over stationary methods and 114.2\% over random strategies. Future work includes enhancing adaptability and incorporating digital twin technology for improved predictive accuracy, particularly relevant for events like the 2026 FIFA World Cup at MetLife Stadium.</description>

      <title>Approximating a matrix as the square of a skew-symmetric matrix, with application to estimating angular velocity from acceleration data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the problem of finding the best approximation of a real square matrix by a matrix that can be represented as the square of a real, skew-symmetric matrix. This problem is important in the design of robust numerical algorithms aimed at estimating rigid body kinematics from multiple accelerometer measurements. We give a constructive proof for the existence of a best approximant in the Frobenius norm. We demonstrate the construction with some small examples, and we showcase the practical importance of this work to the problem of determining the angular velocity of a rotating rigid body from its acceleration measurements.</description>

      <title>The Pontryagin Maximum Principle for Training Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel batch sequential quadratic Hamiltonian (bSQH) algorithm for training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with $L^0$-based regularization is presented. This methodology is based on a discrete-time Pontryagin maximum principle (PMP). It uses forward and backward sweeps together with the layerwise approximate maximization of an augmented Hamiltonian function, where the augmentation parameter is chosen adaptively.
  A technique for determining this augmentation parameter is proposed, and the loss-reduction and convergence properties of the bSQH algorithm are analysed theoretically and validated numerically. Results of numerical experiments in the context of image classification with a sparsity enforcing $L^0$-based regularizer demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in full-batch and mini-batch modes.</description>

      <title>Design and Continuation of Nonlinear Teardrop Hovering Formation along the Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short communication is devoted to the design and continuation of a teardrop hovering formation along the Near Rectilinear Halo orbit and provides further insights into future on-orbit services in the cislunar space. First, we extend the concept of the teardrop hovering formation to scenarios along the Near Rectilinear Halo orbit in the Earth-Moon circular restricted three-body problem. Then, we develop two methods for designing these formations based on the nonlinear model for relative motion. The first method addresses the design of the teardrop hovering formations with relatively short revisit distances, while the second method continues hovering trajectories from short to longer revisit distances. In particular, new continuation method is developed to meet the design requirements of this new scenario. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods, and a near-natural teardrop hovering formation is achieved by considering the dynamical properties near the NRHO. Comparisons between design results obtained using linear and nonlinear models further strengthen the necessity of using the nonlinear model.</description>

      <title>On projection mappings and the gradient projection method on hyperbolic space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents several new properties of the intrinsic $\kappa$-projection into $\kappa$-hyperbolically convex sets of $\kappa$-hyperbolic space forms, along with closed-form formulas for the intrinsic $\kappa$-projection into specific $\kappa$-hyperbolically convex sets. It also discusses the relationship between the intrinsic $\kappa$-projection, the Euclidean orthogonal projection, and the Lorentz projection. These properties lay the groundwork for analyzing the gradient projection method and hold importance in their own right. Additionally, new properties of the gradient projection method to solve constrained optimization problems in $\kappa$-hyperbolic space forms are established, considering both constant and backtracking step sizes in the analysis. It is shown that every accumulation point of the sequence generated by the method for both step sizes is a stationary point for the given problem. Additionally, an iteration complexity bound is provided that upper bounds the number of iterations needed to achieve a suitable measure of stationarity for both step sizes. Finally, the properties of the constrained Fermat-Weber problem are explored, demonstrating that the sequence generated by the gradient projection method converges to its unique solution. Numerical experiments on solving the Fermat-Weber problem are presented, illustrating the theoretical findings and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the candidate optimal paths for a Dubins vehicle on a sphere are analytically derived. In particular, the arc angles for segments in $CGC$, $CCC$, $CCCC$, and $CCCCC$ paths, which have previously been shown to be optimal depending on the turning radius $r$ of the vehicle by Kumar \textit{et al.}, are analytically derived. The derived expressions are used for the implementation provided in https://github.com/DeepakPrakashKumar/Motion-planning-on-sphere.</description>

      <title>Initial Condition Independent Stabilisability of Switched Affine Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that a switched affine system is stabilisable independently of the initial condition, i.e. there exists an asymptotically stabilising switching function which is the same for all initial conditions, if and only if there exists a stable convex combination of the sub-system matrices. This result was proven by constructing a stabilising switching function of unbounded switching frequency. The current paper proves that there exists a switching function with bounded switching frequency which stabilises a switched affine system independent of its initial condition.</description>

      <title>Curvilinear Mask Optimization for Inverse Lithography Based on B-splines and Delaunay Triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel gradient-based method to optimize curvilinear masks in optical lithography. The mask pattern is represented by periodic B-spline curves. We apply Delaunay triangulation to discretize the domains circled by the spline curves. Subsequently, we establish an explicit relationship between the integral points and the control points of the boundary spline curve. Based on the relationship, we derive explicit formulas of the gradient of the optimization objective function with respect to the coordinates of the control points. Then we propose an inverse lithography algorithm to optimize the curvilinear mask pattern. Finally, the results of the numerical experiments demonstrate the feasibility and extensive adaptability of our method.</description>

      <title>Efficient identification of linear, parameter-varying, and nonlinear systems with noise models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general system identification procedure capable of estimating of a broad spectrum of state-space dynamical models, including linear time-invariant (LTI), linear parameter-varying} (LPV), and nonlinear (NL) dynamics, along with rather general classes of noise models. Similar to the LTI case, we show that for this general class of model structures, including the NL case, the model dynamics can be separated into a deterministic process and a stochastic noise part, allowing to seamlessly tune the complexity of the combined model both in terms of nonlinearity and noise modeling. We parameterize the involved nonlinear functional relations by means of artificial neural-networks (ANNs), although alternative parametric nonlinear mappings can also be used. To estimate the resulting model structures, we optimize a prediction-error-based criterion using an efficient combination of a constrained quasi-Newton approach and automatic differentiation, achieving training times in the order of seconds compared to existing state-of-the-art ANN methods which may require hours for models of similar complexity. We formally establish the consistency guarantees for the proposed approach and demonstrate its superior estimation accuracy and computational efficiency on several benchmark LTI, LPV, and NL system identification problems.</description>

      <title>Sustainable cooperation on the hybrid pollution-control game with heterogeneous players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a hybrid pollution-control differential game with two farsighted players and one myopic player. Both the seasonal regime shifts in the state dynamics and the players' heterogeneous preferences are introduced into the model. The strategies under cooperative, noncooperative and partially cooperative scenarios are obtained by utilizing the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Under all feasible coalition structures, the convergence of the state variable is proved. A new sustainably--cooperative optimality principle is proposed according to the coalition structures, which belongs to the imputation set. The prerequisite for the existence of time-consistency in the sustainably-cooperative optimality principle is explicitly obtained. The seasonal imputation distribution procedure (IDP) is designed to maintain the time-consistentcy (dynamic stability) of cooperation over time.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Controller For Simultaneous Spacecraft Attitude Tracking And Reaction Wheel Fault Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attitude control of a spacecraft is integral to achieving mission success. However, failures in actuators such as reaction wheels are detrimental and can often lead to an early end of mission. We propose a Lyapunov-based adaptive controller that can estimate and compensate for reaction wheels degradation simultaneously. The controller incorporates an adaptive update control law with a gradient-based term and an integral concurrent learning term that collects input-output data for online estimation of uncertain parameters. The proposed controller guarantees attitude tracking and its performance is tested through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Effects of Organic vs. Conventional Farming on Aquifer Water Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes water quality dynamics and aquifer recharge through irrigated agriculture, contributing to the literature on Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) amidst growing water scarcity. We develop two optimal control models-- a linear and a non-linear extension of (Martin and Stahn, 2013) --that incorporate the impact of fertilizers on aquifer water quality, distinguishing between organic and conventional farming practices. The linear model applies a constant rebate mechanism, whereas the non-linear model employs a concave rebate scheme. Our results show that, depending on climate change scenarios, fertilizer-induced food price discounts, and pollution levels, a socially optimal equilibrium in fertilizer use can be attained. Policy implications are discussed, emphasizing the trade-off between environmental sustainability and social welfare.</description>

      <title>A simple algorithm for the simple bilevel programming (SBP) problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we intend to develop a simple and implementable algorithm for minimizing a convex function over the solution set of another convex optimization problem. Such a problem is often referred to as a simple bilevel programming (SBP) problem. One of the key features of our algorithm is that we make no assumption on the diferentiability of the upper level objective, though we will assume that the lower level objective is smooth. Another key feature of the algorithm is that it does not assume that the lower level objective has a Lipschitz gradient, which is a standard assumption in most of the well-known algorithms for this class of problems. We present the convergence analysis and also some numerical experiments demonstrating the efectiveness of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Feature Selection for Data-driven Explainable Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical optimization, although often leading to NP-hard models, is now capable of solving even large-scale instances within reasonable time. However, the primary focus is often placed solely on optimality. This implies that while obtained solutions are globally optimal, they are frequently not comprehensible to humans, in particular when obtained by black-box routines. In contrast, explainability is a standard requirement for results in Artificial Intelligence, but it is rarely considered in optimization yet. There are only a few studies that aim to find solutions that are both of high quality and explainable. In recent work, explainability for optimization was defined in a data-driven manner: a solution is considered explainable if it closely resembles solutions that have been used in the past under similar circumstances. To this end, it is crucial to identify a preferably small subset of features from a presumably large set that can be used to explain a solution. In mathematical optimization, feature selection has received little attention yet. In this work, we formally define the feature selection problem for explainable optimization and prove that its decision version is NP-complete. We introduce mathematical models for optimized feature selection. As their global solution requires significant computation time with modern mixed-integer linear solvers, we employ local heuristics. Our computational study using data that reflect real-world scenarios demonstrates that the problem can be solved practically efficiently for instances of reasonable size.</description>

      <title>On resolution of L1-norm minimization via a two-metric adaptive projection method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-metric projection method is a simple yet elegant algorithm proposed by Bertsekas
  to address bound/box-constrained optimization problems. The algorithm's low per-iteration
  cost and potential for using Hessian information make it a favorable computation method
  for this problem class. Inspired by this algorithm, we propose a two-metric adaptive projection
  method for solving the $\ell_1$-norm regularization problem that inherits these advantages. We demonstrate that the method is theoretically sound -
  it has global convergence. Furthermore, it is capable of manifold identification and has
  superlinear convergence rate under the error bound condition and strict complementarity.
  Therefore, given sparsity in the solution, the method enjoys superfast convergence in iteration
  while maintaining scalability, making it desirable for large-scale problems. We also equip
  the algorithm with competitive complexity to solve nonconvex problems. Numerical experiments
  are conducted to illustrate the advantages of this algorithm implied by the theory compared
  to other competitive methods, especially in large-scale scenarios. In contrast to the original two-metric projection method, our algorithm directly solves the $\ell_1$-norm minimization problem without resorting to the intermediate reformulation as a bound-constrained problem, so it circumvents the issue of numerical instability.</description>

      <title>Provably Safe Control for Constrained Nonlinear Systems with Bounded Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world control applications, actuator constraints and output constraints (specifically in tracking problems) are inherent and critical to ensuring safe and reliable operation. However, generally, control strategies often neglect these physical limitations, leading to potential instability, degraded performance, or even system failure when deployed on real-world systems. This paper addresses the control design problem for a class of nonlinear systems under both actuator saturation and output constraints. First, a smooth asymmetric saturation model (a more generic representative of practical scenarios) is proposed to model actuator saturation, which ensures that the control inputs always remain confined within a predefined set to ensure safety. Based on the proposed model, we develop a nonlinear control framework that guarantees output tracking while ensuring that system output remains confined to the predefined set. Later, we integrate this design with the constrained output tracking control problem, wherein we show that the system output tracks its desired trajectory by simultaneously satisfying input and output constraints. The global stabilization of the tracking error is achieved in the presence of input constraints, while semi-global stabilization is achieved in the presence of both input and output constraints. Additionally, we rigorously establish the boundedness of all closed-loop signals under the proposed design. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in handling asymmetric constraints while achieving desirable tracking performance.</description>

      <title>Achieving Tighter Finite-Time Rates for Heterogeneous Federated Stochastic Approximation under Markovian Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by collaborative reinforcement learning (RL) and optimization with time-correlated data, we study a generic federated stochastic approximation problem involving $M$ agents, where each agent is characterized by an agent-specific (potentially nonlinear) local operator. The goal is for the agents to communicate intermittently via a server to find the root of the average of the agents' local operators. The generality of our setting stems from allowing for (i) Markovian data at each agent and (ii) heterogeneity in the roots of the agents' local operators. The limited recent work that has accounted for both these features in a federated setting fails to guarantee convergence to the desired point or to show any benefit of collaboration; furthermore, they rely on projection steps in their algorithms to guarantee bounded iterates. Our work overcomes each of these limitations. We develop a novel algorithm titled \texttt{FedHSA}, and prove that it guarantees convergence to the correct point, while enjoying an $M$-fold linear speedup in sample-complexity due to collaboration. To our knowledge, \emph{this is the first finite-time result of its kind}, and establishing it (without relying on a projection step) entails a fairly intricate argument that accounts for the interplay between complex temporal correlations due to Markovian sampling, multiple local steps to save communication, and the drift-effects induced by heterogeneous local operators. Our results have implications for a broad class of heterogeneous federated RL problems (e.g., policy evaluation and control) with function approximation, where the agents' Markov decision processes can differ in their probability transition kernels and reward functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel algorithm for reachability analysis of nonlinear discrete-time systems. The proposed method combines constrained zonotopes (CZs) with polyhedral relaxations of factorable representations of nonlinear functions to propagate CZs through nonlinear functions, which is normally done using conservative linearization techniques. The new propagation method provides better approximations than those resulting from linearization procedures, leading to significant improvements in the computation of reachable sets in comparison to other CZ methods from the literature. Numerical examples highlight the advantages of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Optimal SVI-Weighted PSPS Decisions with Decision-Dependent Outage Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) are a pre-emptive strategy to mitigate the wildfires caused by power system malfunction. System operators implement PSPS to balance wildfire mitigation efforts through de-energization of transmission lines against the risk of widespread blackouts modeled with load shedding.
  Existing approaches do not incorporate decision-dependent wildfire-driven failure probabilities, as modeling outage scenario probabilities requires incorporating high-order polynomial terms in the objective. This paper uses distribution shaping to develop an efficient MILP problem representation of the distributionally robust PSPS problem. Building upon the author's prior work, the wildfire risk of operating a transmission line is a function of the probability of a wildfire-driven outage and its subsequent expected impact in acres burned.
  A day-ahead unit commitment and line de-energization PSPS framework is used to assess the trade-off between total cost and wildfire risk at different levels of distributional robustness, parameterized by a level of distributional dissimilarity $\kappa$. We perform simulations on the IEEE RTS 24-bus test system.</description>

      <title>FedCanon: Non-Convex Composite Federated Learning with Efficient Proximal Operation on Heterogeneous Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composite federated learning offers a general framework for solving machine learning problems with additional regularization terms. However, many existing methods require clients to perform multiple proximal operations to handle non-smooth terms and their performance are often susceptible to data heterogeneity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel composite federated learning algorithm called \textbf{FedCanon}, designed to solve the optimization problems comprising a possibly non-convex loss function and a weakly convex, potentially non-smooth regularization term. By decoupling proximal mappings from local updates, FedCanon requires only a single proximal evaluation on the server per iteration, thereby reducing the overall proximal computation cost. It also introduces control variables that incorporate global gradient information into client updates, which helps mitigate the effects of data heterogeneity. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that FedCanon achieves sublinear convergence rates under general non-convex settings and linear convergence under the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition, without relying on bounded heterogeneity assumptions. Experiments demonstrate that FedCanon outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly under heterogeneous data distributions.</description>

      <title>Optimal flock formation induced by agent heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of flocking in biological systems has identified conditions for self-organized collective behavior, inspiring the development of decentralized strategies to coordinate the dynamics of swarms of drones and other autonomous vehicles. Previous research has focused primarily on the role of the time-varying interaction network among agents while assuming that the agents themselves are identical or nearly identical. Here, we depart from this conventional assumption to investigate how inter-individual differences between agents affect the stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We show that flocks of agents with optimally assigned heterogeneous parameters significantly outperform their homogeneous counterparts, achieving 20-40% faster convergence to desired formations across various control tasks. These tasks include target tracking, flock formation, and obstacle maneuvering. In systems with communication delays, heterogeneity can enable convergence even when flocking is unstable for identical agents. Our results challenge existing paradigms in multi-agent control and establish system disorder as an adaptive, distributed mechanism to promote collective behavior in flocking dynamics.</description>

      <title>Riemannian optimization using three different metrics for Hermitian PSD fixed-rank constraints: an extended version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.07830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For smooth optimization problems with a Hermitian positive semi-definite fixed-rank constraint, we consider three existing approaches including the simple Burer--Monteiro method, and Riemannian optimization over quotient geometry and the embedded geometry. These three methods can be all represented via quotient geometry with three Riemannian metrics $g^i(\cdot, \cdot)$ $(i=1,2,3)$. By taking the nonlinear conjugate gradient method (CG) as an example, we show that CG in the factor-based Burer--Monteiro approach is equivalent to Riemannian CG on the quotient geometry with the Bures-Wasserstein metric $g^1$. Riemannian CG on the quotient geometry with the metric $g^3$ is equivalent to Riemannian CG on the embedded geometry. For comparing the three approaches, we analyze the condition number of the Riemannian Hessian near the minimizer under the three different metrics. Under certain assumptions, the condition number from the Bures-Wasserstein metric $g^1$ is significantly different from the other two metrics.
  Numerical experiments show that the Burer--Monteiro CG method has obviously slower asymptotic convergence rate when the minimizer is rank deficient, which is consistent with the condition number analysis.</description>

      <title>On the convergence result of the gradient-push algorithm on directed graphs with constant stepsize</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed optimization has recieved a lot of interest due to its wide applications in various fields. It consists of multiple agents that connected by a graph and optimize a total cost in a collaborative way. Often in the applications, the graph of the agents is given by a directed graph. The gradient-push algorithm is a fundamental method for distributed optimization for which the agents are connected by a directed graph. Despite of its wide usage in the literatures, its convergence property has not been established well for the important case that the stepsize is constant and the domain is the entire space. This work proves that the gradient-push algorithm with stepsize $\alpha&gt;0$ converges exponentially fast to an $O(\alpha)$-neighborhood of the optimizer if the stepsize $\alpha$ is less than a specific value. For the result, we assume that each cost is smooth and the total cost is strongly convex. Numerical experiments are provided to support the theoretical convergence result. \textcolor{black}{We also present a numerical test showing that the gradient-push algorithm may approach a small neighborhood of the minimizer faster than the Push-DIGing algorithm which is a variant of the gradient-push algorithm involving the communication of the gradient informations of the agents.</description>

Abstract: We characterize the Schr\"odinger bridge problems by a family of Mckean-Vlasov stochastic control problems with no terminal time distribution constraint. In doing so, we use the theory of Hilbert space embeddings of probability measures and then describe the constraint as penalty terms defined by the maximum mean discrepancy in the control problems. A sequence of the probability laws of the state processes resulting from $\epsilon$-optimal controls converges to a unique solution of the Schr\"odinger's problem under mild conditions on given initial and terminal time distributions and an underlying diffusion process. We propose a neural SDE based deep learning algorithm for the Mckean-Vlasov stochastic control problems. Several numerical experiments validate our methods.</description>

Abstract: We observe that the characteristic polynomial of a linearly perturbed semidefinite matrix can be used to give the convergence rate of alternating projections for the positive semidefinite cone and a line. As a consequence, we show that such alternating projections converge at $O(k^{-1/2})$, independently of the singularity degree. A sufficient condition for the linear convergence is also obtained. Our method directly analyzes the defining equation for an alternating projection sequence and does not use error bounds.</description>

      <title>MIP-DD: A Delta Debugger for Mixed Integer Programming Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19770v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent performance improvements in mixed-integer programming (MIP) have been accompanied by a significantly increased complexity of the codes of MIP solvers, which poses challenges in fixing implementation errors. In this paper, we introduce MIP-DD, a solver-independent tool, which to the best of our knowledge is the first open-source delta debugger for MIP. Delta debugging is a hypothesis-trial-result approach to isolate the cause of a solver failure. MIP-DD simplifies MIP instances while maintaining the undesired behavior. Preliminary versions already supported and motivated fixes for many bugs in the SCIP releases 8.0.1 to 8.1.1. In these versions, MIP-DD successfully contributed to 24 out of all 51 documented MIP-related bugfixes even for some long-known issues. In selected case studies we highlight that instances triggering fundamental bugs in SCIP can typically be reduced to a few variables and constraints in less than an hour. This makes it significantly easier to manually trace and check the solution process on the resulting simplified instances. A promising future application of MIP-DD is the analysis of performance bottlenecks, which could very well benefit from simple adversarial instances.</description>

      <title>Debunking the Speed-Fidelity Trade-Off: Speeding-up Large-Scale Energy Models while Keeping Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy system models are essential for planning and supporting the energy transition. However, increasing temporal, spatial, and sectoral resolutions have led to large-scale linear programming (LP) models that are often (over)simplified to remain computationally tractable-frequently at the expense of model fidelity. This paper challenges the common belief that LP formulations cannot be improved without sacrificing their accuracy. Inspired by graph theory, we propose to model energy systems using energy assets (vertices), as a single building-block, and flows to connect between them. This reduces the need for additional components such as nodes and connections. The resulting formulation is more compact, without sacrificing accuracy, and leverages the inherent graph structure of energy systems. To evaluate performance, we implemented and compared four common modelling approaches varying in their use of building blocks and flow representations. We conducted experiments using TulipaEnergyModel.jl and applied them to a multi-sector case study with varying problem sizes. Results show that our single-building-block (1BB-1F) approach reduces variables and constraints by 26 and 35 percentage, respectively, and achieves a 1.27 times average speedup in solving time without any loss in model fidelity. The speedup increases with problem size, making this approach particularly advantageous for large-scale models. Our findings demonstrate that not all LPs are equal in quality and that better reformulations can lead to substantial computational benefits. This paper also aims to raise awareness of model quality considerations in energy system optimisation and promote more efficient formulations without compromising fidelity.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient HOT algorithm for solving the optimal transport (OT) problems with finite supports. We particularly focus on an efficient implementation of the HOT algorithm for the case where the supports are in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with ground distances calculated by $L_2^2$-norm. Specifically, we design a Halpern accelerating algorithm to solve the equivalent reduced model of the discrete OT problem. Moreover, we derive a novel procedure to solve the involved linear systems in the HOT algorithm in linear time complexity. Consequently, we can obtain an $\varepsilon$-approximate solution to the optimal transport problem with $M$ supports in $O(M^{1.5}/\varepsilon)$ flops, which significantly improves the best-known computational complexity. We further propose an efficient procedure to recover an optimal transport plan for the original OT problem based on a solution to the reduced model, thereby overcoming the limitations of the reduced OT model in applications that require the transport plan. We implement the HOT algorithm in PyTorch and extensive numerical results show the superior performance of the HOT algorithm compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms for solving the OT problems.</description>

      <title>Approximate controllability for 2D Euler equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate controllability of the Euler equations is investigated by means of a finite set of actuators. It is proven that approximate controllability holds if we can find a saturating subset of actuators. The notion of saturating set is relaxed when compared to previous literature, still being a sufficient condition for approximate controllability. The result holds for general bounded two-dimensional spatial domains with smooth boundary. An example of a saturating set is given in the case the spatial domain is the unit disk.</description>

      <title>Decentralized projected Riemannian stochastic recursive momentum method for nonconvex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies decentralized optimization over a compact submanifold within a communication network of $n$ nodes, where each node possesses a smooth non-convex local cost function, and the goal is to jointly minimize the sum of these local costs. We focus particularly on the online setting, where local data is processed in real-time as it streams in, without the need for full data storage. We propose a decentralized projected Riemannian stochastic recursive momentum (DPRSRM) method that employs local hybrid stochastic gradient estimators and uses the network to track the global gradient. DPRSRM achieves an oracle complexity of \(\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-\frac{3}{2}})\), outperforming existing methods that have at most \(\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})\) complexity. Our method requires only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ gradient evaluations per iteration for each local node and does not require restarting with a large batch gradient. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods compared to state-of-the-art ones through numerical experiments on principal component analysis problems and low-rank matrix completion.</description>

      <title>Discrete lossless convexification for pointing constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete Lossless Convexification (DLCvx) formulates a convex relaxation for a specific class of discrete-time non-convex optimal control problems. It establishes sufficient conditions under which the solution of the relaxed problem satisfies the original non-convex constraints at specified time grid points. Furthermore, it provides an upper bound on the number of time grid points where these sufficient conditions may not hold, and thus the original constraints could be violated. This paper extends DLCvx to problems with control pointing constraints. Additionally, it introduces a novel DLCvx formulation for mixed-integer optimal control problems in which the control is either inactive or constrained within an annular sector. This formulation broadens the feasible space for problems with pointing constraints. A numerical example is provided to illustrate its application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present a modified variant of the Dai-Liao spectral conjugate gradient method, developed through an analysis of eigenvalues and inspired by a modified secant condition. We show that the proposed method is globally convergent for general nonlinear functions under standard assumptions. By incorporating the new secant condition and a quasi-Newton direction, we introduce updated spectral parameters. These changes ensure that the resulting search direction satisfies the sufficient descent property without relying on any line search. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm performs better than several existing methods in terms of convergence speed and computational efficiency. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated through an application in signal processing.</description>

      <title>A spectral Levenberg-Marquardt-Deflation method for multiple solutions of semilinear elliptic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many nonlinear differential equations arising from practical problems may permit nontrivial multiple solutions relevant to applications, and these multiple solutions are helpful to deeply understand these practical problems and to improve some applications. Developing an efficient numerical method for finding multiple solutions is very necessary due to the nonlinearity and multiple solutions of these equations. Moreover, providing an efficient iteration plays an important role in successfully obtaining multiple solutions with fast and stable convergence. In the current paper, an efficient algorithm for finding multiple solutions of semilinear elliptic systems is proposed, where the trust region Levenberg-Marquardt method is firstly used to iterate the resulted nonlinear algebraic system. When the nonlinear term in these equations has only the first derivative, our algorithm can efficiently find multiple solutions as well. Several numerical experiments are tested to show the efficiency of our algorithm, and some solutions which have not been shown in the literature are also found and shown.</description>

      <title>Scheduling problem of aircrafts on a same runway and dual runways</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the scheduling problems of landing and takeoff aircraft on a same runway and on dual runways are addressed. In contrast to the approaches based on mixed-integer optimization models in existing works, our approach focuses on the minimum separation times between aircraft by introducing some necessary assumptions and new concepts including relevance, breakpoint aircraft, path and class-monotonically-decreasing sequence. Four scheduling problems are discussed including landing scheduling problem, takeoff scheduling problem, and mixed landing and takeoff scheduling problems on a same runway and on dual runways with the consideration of conversions between different aircraft sequences in typical scenarios. Two real-time optimal algorithms are proposed for the four scheduling problems by fully exploiting the combinations of different classes of aircraft, and necessary definitions, lemmas and theorems are presented for the optimal convergence of the algorithms. Numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. In particular, when $100$ aircraft are considered, by using the algorithm in this paper, the optimal solution can be obtained in less than $5$ seconds, while by using the CPLEX software to solve the mix-integer optimization model, the optimal solution cannot be obtained within $1$ hour.</description>

      <title>A novel numerical method tailored for unconstrained optimization problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unconstrained optimization problems become more common in scientific computing and engineering applications with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, and numerical methods for solving them more quickly and efficiently have been getting more attention and research. Moreover, an efficient method to minimize all kinds of objective functions is urgently needed, especially the nonsmooth objective function. Therefore, in the current paper, we focus on proposing a novel numerical method tailored for unconstrained optimization problems whether the objective function is smooth or not. To be specific, based on the variational procedure to refine the gradient and Hessian matrix approximations, an efficient quadratic model with $2n$ constrained conditions is established. Moreover, to improve the computational efficiency, a simplified model with 2 constrained conditions is also proposed, where the gradient and Hessian matrix can be explicitly updated, and the corresponding boundedness of the remaining $2n-2$ constrained conditions is derived. On the other hand, the novel numerical method is summarized, and approximation results on derivative information are also analyzed and shown. Numerical experiments involving smooth, derivative blasting, and non-smooth problems are tested, demonstrating its feasibility and efficiency. Compared with existing methods, our proposed method can efficiently solve smooth and non-smooth unconstrained optimization problems for the first time, and it is very easy to program the code, indicating that our proposed method not also has great application prospects, but is also very meaningful to explore practical complex engineering and scientific problems.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Regret Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) is a popular framework for decision-making under uncertainty, but its adversarial nature can lead to overly conservative solutions. To address this, we study ex-ante Distributionally Robust Regret Optimization (DRRO), focusing on Wasserstein-based ambiguity sets which are popular due to their links to regularization and machine learning. We provide a systematic analysis of Wasserstein DRRO, paralleling known results for Wasserstein DRO. Under smoothness and regularity conditions, we show that Wasserstein DRRO coincides with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) up to first-order terms, and exactly so in convex quadratic settings. We revisit the Wasserstein DRRO newsvendor problem, where the loss is the maximum of two linear functions of demand and decision. Extending [25], we show that the regret can be computed by maximizing two one-dimensional concave functions. For more general loss functions involving the maximum of multiple linear terms in multivariate random variables and decision vectors, we prove that computing the regret and thus also the DRRO policy is NP-hard. We then propose a convex relaxation for these more general Wasserstein DRRO problems and demonstrate its strong empirical performance. Finally, we provide an upper bound on the optimality gap of our relaxation and show it improves over recent alternatives.</description>

      <title>Designing optimal subsidy schemes and recycling plans for sustainable treatment of construction and demolition waste</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: More than 10 billion tons of construction and demolition waste (CW) are generated globally each year, exerting a significant impact on the environment. In the CW recycling process, the government and the carrier are the two primary stakeholders. The carrier is responsible for transporting CW from production sites to backfill sites or processing facilities, with a primary focus on transport efficiency and revenue. Meanwhile, the government aims to minimize pollution from the recycling system, which is influenced by transport modes, shipment distances, and the processing methods used for CW. This paper develops a bi-objective, bi-level optimization model to address these challenges. The upper-level model is a linear programming model that optimizes the government's subsidy scheme, while the lower-level model is a minimum-cost flow model that optimizes the carrier's recycling plan. A hybrid heuristic solution method is proposed to tackle the problem's complexity. A case study in Chengdu, China, demonstrates the computational efficiency of the model and its small solution gap. With an optimized subsidy scheme and recycling plan, pollution can be reduced by over 29.29% through a relatively small investment in subsidies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Block Majorization Minimization method with Extrapolation (BMMe) for solving a class of multi-convex optimization problems. The extrapolation parameters of BMMe are updated using a novel adaptive update rule. By showing that block majorization minimization can be reformulated as a block mirror descent method, with the Bregman divergence adaptively updated at each iteration, we establish subsequential convergence for BMMe. We use this method to design efficient algorithms to tackle nonnegative matrix factorization problems with the $\beta$-divergences ($\beta$-NMF) for $\beta\in [1,2]$. These algorithms, which are multiplicative updates with extrapolation, benefit from our novel results that offer convergence guarantees. We also empirically illustrate the significant acceleration of BMMe for $\beta$-NMF through extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>Future Aware Safe Active Learning of Time Varying Systems using Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental exploration of high-cost systems with safety constraints, common in engineering applications, is a challenging endeavor. Data-driven models offer a promising solution, but acquiring the requisite data remains expensive and is potentially unsafe. Safe active learning techniques prove essential, enabling the learning of high-quality models with minimal expensive data points and high safety. This paper introduces a safe active learning framework tailored for time-varying systems, addressing drift, seasonal changes, and complexities due to dynamic behavior. The proposed Time-aware Integrated Mean Squared Prediction Error (T-IMSPE) method minimizes posterior variance over current and future states, optimizing information gathering also in the time domain. Empirical results highlight T-IMSPE's advantages in model quality through toy and real-world examples. State of the art Gaussian processes are compatible with T-IMSPE. Our theoretical contributions include a clear delineation which Gaussian process kernels, domains, and weighting measures are suitable for T-IMSPE and even beyond for its non-time aware predecessor IMSPE.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal control of L\'evy tax processes with bailouts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider controlling the paths of a spectrally negative L\'evy process by two means: the subtraction of `taxes' when the process is at an all-time maximum, and the addition of `bailouts' which keep the value of the process above zero. We solve the corresponding stochastic optimal control problem of maximising the expected present value of the difference between taxes received and cost of bailouts given. Our class of taxation controls is larger than has been considered up till now in the literature and makes the problem truly two-dimensional rather than one-dimensional. Along the way, we define and characterise a large class of controlled L\'evy processes to which the optimal solution belongs, which extends a known result for perturbed Brownian motions to the case of a general L\'evy process with no positive jumps.</description>

Abstract: Active learning enhances the performance of machine learning methods, particularly in semi-supervised cases, by judiciously selecting a limited number of unlabeled data points for labeling, with the goal of improving the performance of an underlying classifier. In this work, we introduce the Multiclass Active Learning with Auction Dynamics on Graphs (MALADY) framework which leverages the auction dynamics algorithm on similarity graphs for efficient active learning. In particular, we generalize the auction dynamics algorithm on similarity graphs for semi-supervised learning in [24] to incorporate a more general optimization functional. Moreover, we introduce a novel active learning acquisition function that uses the dual variable of the auction algorithm to measure the uncertainty in the classifier to prioritize queries near the decision boundaries between different classes. Lastly, using experiments on classification tasks, we evaluate the performance of our proposed method and show that it exceeds that of comparison algorithms.</description>

      <title>Score as Action: Fine-Tuning Diffusion Generative Models by Continuous-time Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which aligns a diffusion model with input prompt, has become a crucial step in building reliable generative AI models. Most works in this area use a discrete-time formulation, which is prone to induced errors, and often not applicable to models with higher-order/black-box solvers. The objective of this study is to develop a disciplined approach to fine-tune diffusion models using continuous-time RL, formulated as a stochastic control problem with a reward function that aligns the end result (terminal state) with input prompt. The key idea is to treat score matching as controls or actions, and thereby making connections to policy optimization and regularization in continuous-time RL. To carry out this idea, we lay out a new policy optimization framework for continuous-time RL, and illustrate its potential in enhancing the value networks design space via leveraging the structural property of diffusion models. We validate the advantages of our method by experiments in downstream tasks of fine-tuning large-scale Text2Image models of Stable Diffusion v1.5.</description>

Abstract: Multiple solutions are common in various non-convex problems arising from industrial and scientific computing. Nonetheless, understanding the nontrivial solutions' qualitative properties seems limited, partially due to the lack of efficient and reliable numerical methods. In this paper, we design a dedicated numerical method to explore these nontrivial solutions further. We first design an improved adaptive orthogonal basis deflation method by combining the adaptive orthogonal basis method with a bisection-deflation algorithm. We then apply the proposed new method to study the impact of domain changes on multiple solutions of certain nonlinear elliptic equations. When the domain varies from a circular disk to an elliptical disk, the corresponding functional value changes dramatically for some particular solutions, which indicates that these nontrivial solutions in the circular domain may become unstable in the elliptical domain. Moreover, several theoretical results on multiple solutions in existing literature are verified. For the nonlinear Sine-Gordon equation with parameter $\lambda$, nontrivial solutions are found for $\lambda &gt; \lambda_2$, here $\lambda_2$ is the second eigenvalue of the corresponding linear eigenvalue problem. For the singularly perturbed Ginzburg-Landau equation, highly concentrated solutions are numerically found which suggests that their convergent limit is a delta function when the perturbation parameter goes to zero</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a robust adaptive learning Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for linear systems with parametric uncertainties and additive disturbances performing iterative tasks. The approach iteratively refines the parameter estimates using set membership estimation. Performance enhancement over iterations is achieved by learning the terminal cost from data. Safety is enforced using a terminal set, which is also learned iteratively. The proposed method guarantees recursive feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and a robust bound on the closed-loop cost. Numerical simulations on a mass-spring-damper system demonstrate improved computational efficiency and control performance compared to an existing robust adaptive MPC approach.</description>
