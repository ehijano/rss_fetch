      <title>Pairing interaction from Demons in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the recently observed "demon" mode, a 3D acoustic plasmon, in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ with an emphasis on evaluating its role for the pairing interactions in this superconductor. The demon mode is a low-energy electronic excitation, and it has been suggested that it could contribute to a reduced Coulomb repulsion and even a possible attractive interaction between electrons. In this study, we explicitly calculate the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction for Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ by using a renormalized tight-binding band structure and the random phase approximation for the dielectric function. Although the focus here is on Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, this material is considered mainly as a prototype system, having an observed demon mode, and our results should be considered as a guide for application to other systems. Our calculations show that there are regions in ($\mathbf{q}$, $\omega$) space where the Coulomb interaction becomes attractive. We find that, although the demon mode is not capable of producing a total attractive electron pairing interaction in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, it does contribute to a significant reduction in the Coulomb repulsion at the relevant pairing energy scale.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Band Structure in a Kagome Superconductor Cs(V1-xCrx)3Sb5: Toward Universal Understanding of CDW and Superconducting Phase Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) exhibit a characteristic superconducting and charge-density wave (CDW) phase diagram upon carrier doping and chemical substitution. However, the key electronic states responsible for such a phase diagram have yet to be clarified. Here we report a systematic micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) study of Cs(V1-xCrx)3Sb5 as a function of Cr content x, where Cr substitution causes monotonic reduction of superconducting and CDW transition temperatures. We found that the V-derived bands forming saddle points at the M point and Dirac nodes along high-symmetry cuts show an energy shift due to electron doping by Cr substitution, whereas the Sb-derived electron band at the Gamma point remains almost unchanged, signifying an orbital-selective band shift. We also found that band doubling associated with the emergence of three-dimensional CDW identified at x = 0 vanishes at x = 0.25, in line with the disappearance of CDW. A comparison of band diagrams among Ti-, Nb-, and Cr-substituted Cs(V1-xCrx)3Sb5 suggests the importance to simultaneously take into account the two saddle points at the M point and their proximity to the Fermi energy, to understand the complex phase diagram against carrier doping and chemical pressure.</description>

      <title>Origin of anomalous magnetotransport in kagome superconductors AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ (A=K,Rb,Cs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple anomalous features in electronic spectra of metals with kagome lattice structure -- van Hove singularities, Dirac points, and flat bands -- imply that materials containing this structural motif may lie at a nexus of topological and correlated electron physics. Due to the prospects of such exceptional electronic behavior, the recent discovery of superconductivity coexisting with charge-density wave (CDW) order in the layered kagome metals AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ (A=K,Rb,Cs) has attracted considerable attention. Notably, these kagome metals express unconventional magnetotransport behavior, including a linear-in-H diagonal resistivity at low fields, and an even more peculiar, nonmonotonic sign-changing behavior of the Hall resistivity, which has been speculated to arise from a chiral CDW. We argue here that this unusual magnetotransport derives not from such unconventional phenomena, but rather from the unique fermiology of the AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ materials. Specifically, it is caused by a large, concave hexagonal Fermi surface sheet formed in the close proximity to the van Hove singularities, which is backfolded into a small hexagonal sheet and two large triangular sheets in the CDW state. We introduce a model of the electronic structure of these Fermi surface sheets that allows for a full analytical treatment within Boltzmann kinetic theory and that enables semi-quantitative fits of our transport data. Specifically, we find that the anomalous magnetotransport behavior is caused by the confluence of strong reduction of the Fermi velocity near the van Hove singularities located near the vertices of the hexagonal sheet and sharp corners in Fermi surface generated by the CDW reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Inducing superconductivity in quantum anomalous Hall regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfacing the quantum anomalous Hall insulator with a conventional superconductor is known to be a promising manner for realizing a topological superconductor, which has been continuously pursued for years. Such a proximity route depends to a great extent on the control of the delicate interfacial coupling of the two constituents. However, a recent experiment reported the failure to reproduce such a topological superconductor, which is ascribed to the negligence of the electrical short by the superconductor in the theoretical proposal. Here, we reproduce this topological superconductor with attention to the interface control. The resulted conductance matrix under a wide magnetic field range agrees with the fingerprint of this topological superconductor. This allows us to develop a phase diagram that unveils three regions parameterized by various coupling limits, which not only supports the feasibility to fabricate the topological superconductor by proximity but also fully explains the origin of the previous debate. The present work provides a comprehensible guide on fabricating the topological superconductor.</description>

      <title>Spin-Triplet Superconductivity Induced by All-In-All-Out Spin Fluctuation in Pyrochlore Electronic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the symmetry of superconductivity around the All-In-All-Out (AIAO) spin ordered phase in a nearly half-filled pyrochlore electronic system. The electronic system is described by the Hubbard model with an anti-symmetric spin-orbit coupling. The AIAO spin ordered state is formed by arranging tetrahedral hedgehog spin-clusters uniformly in the lattice system, where 12 types of spin-clusters are allowed in a unit cell. All spin-cluster susceptibilities are calculated within the random phase approximation with respect to the onsite electron interaction. It is shown that, for the negative spin-orbit coupling coefficient, the AIAO spin-cluster susceptibility diverges at q=0, while other types of spin-cluster susceptibilities are not developed and are structureless. By calculating the superconducting transition mediated by AIAO spin fluctuation, it is found that a spin-triplet superconductivity appears, while there is no signal of superconducting transition for the spin-singlet one. We suggest that the spin-triplet superconductivity appears around the AIAO spin ordered phase in the pyrochlore lattice.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory for electron-phonon coupling in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene -- whether phonon-driven or electron-driven -- remains unresolved. The answer to this question is hindered by the absence of a quantitative and efficient model for electron-phonon coupling (EPC). In this work, we develop a first-principles-based microscopic theory to calculate EPC in twisted bilayer graphene for arbitrary twist angles without needing a periodic moir\'e supercell. We adopt a momentum-space model for the electronic and phonon structures and quantify the EPC using generalized Eliashberg-McMillan theory for superconductivity without an adiabatic approximation. Using this framework, we find that the EPC is significantly enhanced near the magic angle, and drops abruptly for larger twist angles. We show that the EPC strength of a phonon corresponds to the modification of the moir\'e potential. In particular, we identify several $\Gamma$-phonon branches that contribute most significantly to the EPC, including one layer breathing mode, three layer shearing modes, and one chiral mode. These phonons should be experimentally detectable via Raman spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution in superconducting resonators: effect of pair-breaking photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many superconducting devices rely on the finite gap in the excitation spectrum of a superconductor: thanks to this gap, at temperatures much smaller than the critical one the number of excitations (quasiparticles) that can impact the device's behavior is exponentially small. Nevertheless, experiments at low temperature usually find a finite, non-negligible density of quasiparticles whose origin has been attributed to various non-equilibrium phenomena. Here, we investigate the role of photons with energy exceeding the pair-breaking threshold $2\Delta$ as a possible source for these quasiparticles in superconducting resonators. Modeling the interacting system of quasiparticles, phonons, sub-gap and pair-breaking photons using a kinetic equation approach, we find analytical expressions for the quasiparticles' density and their energy distribution. Applying our theory to measurements of quality factor as function of temperature and for various readout powers, we find they could be explained by assuming a small number of photons above the pair-breaking threshold. We also show that frequency shift data can give evidence of quasiparticle heating.</description>

      <title>Linear spectroscopy of collective modes and the gap structure in two-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider optical response in multi-band, multi-layer two-dimensional superconductors. Within a simple model, we show that linear response to AC gating can detect collective modes of the condensate, such as Leggett and clapping modes. We show how trigonal warping of the superconducting order parameter can help facilitate detection of clapping modes. Taking rhombohedral trilayer graphene as an example, we consider several possible pairing mechanisms and show that all-electronic mechanisms may produce in-gap clapping modes. These modes, if present, should be detectable in the absorption of microwaves applied via the gate electrodes, which are necessary to enable superconductivity in this and many other settings; their detection would constitute strong evidence for unconventional pairing. Lastly, we show that absorption at frequencies above the superconducting gap $2 |\Delta|$ also contains a wealth of information about the gap structure. Our results suggest that linear spectroscopy can be a powerful tool for the characterization of unconventional two-dimensional superconductors.</description>
