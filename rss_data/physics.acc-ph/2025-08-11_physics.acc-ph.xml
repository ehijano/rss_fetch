      <title>AI-driven neutrino diagnostics and radiation-hard beam instrumentation for next-generation neutrino experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) at Fermilab will deliver a high-intensity, multi-megawatt neutrino beam to the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), enabling precision tests of the three-neutrino paradigm, CP violation searches, neutrino mass ordering determination, and supernova neutrino studies. In order to accelerate DUNE's physics reach and ensure robust beam operations, we propose an integrated AI-driven framework with real-time diagnostics and radiation-hardened instrumentation. A physics-informed digital twin is at the heart of this Real-Time Beam Integrity Monitor. By reconstructing pion phase space from muon profiles and exploiting magnetic horn optic linearity, it enables spill-by-spill beam correction and flux stabilization. By using this approach, flux-related systematics could be reduced from 5\% to 1\%, potentially accelerating the discovery of CP violations by four to six years. Complementing this, a US-Japan R\&amp;D effort will deploy a LGAD-based muon monitor in the NuMI beamline. Time of Flight (ToF) measurements can be acquired with picosecond precision using this radiation-hard system, enhancing sensitivity to horn chromatic effects. Simulations confirm strong responses to these effects. Machine learning models can predict beam quality and horn current with sub-percent accuracy. This scalable, AI-enabled strategy improves beam fidelity and reduces systematics, transforming high-power accelerator operations.</description>

      <title>Beam-Beam Fields with Full Six-Dimensional Coupling: Theory and Computational Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a generalized theoretical framework for calculating beam-beam fields induced by a Gaussian beam with full six-dimensional coupling. We also develop computational techniques for evaluating these fields. A case study based on the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) electron storage ring illustrates the practical application of the framework. Our results suggest that the standard slice model for the beam-beam kick can significantly underestimate the longitudinal field. The proposed theory may provide a foundation for developing improved simulation models and guiding future design studies.</description>

      <title>Start-To-End Simulations of a Compact, Linac-Based Positron Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slow positrons are increasingly important to the study of material surfaces. For these kinds of studies, the positrons must have low emittance and relatively high brightness. Unfortunately, fast positron sources like radioactive capsules or linac driven sources have broad energy and angular spread, which make them difficult to capture and use. Moderators are materials that produce slow, mono-energetic positrons from a fast positron beam. Since their efficiencies are typically less than $10^{-3}$ slow $e^+$ per fast $e^+$, research into how to maximize efficiency is of great interest. Previous work has shown that using a linac, one can decelerate the fast positron beam in order to greatly increase moderation efficiency. We present here start-to-end simulations using G4beamline to model a 100 MeV electron beam incident upon a Tungsten target, focused by an adiabatic matching device, and decelerated by a 1.3 GHz, 5-cell pillbox cavity. We show that by decelerating the positrons after their creation we can increase the number of positrons under 500 keV by 15 times, translating to a 16.3 times improvement in moderation efficiency, and therefore leading to a brighter positron source.</description>

      <title>Laser Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy of Thorium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-lying Rydberg and autoionizing (AI) states of thorium (Th) have been studied via resonance laser ionization spectroscopy at both TRIUMF Canada's particle accelerator centre and Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL). Multiple Rydberg series converging to the ionization potential (IP) were observed via different stepwise laser excitation schemes and were assigned to be the $6d^27s (^4F_{3/2})$ $np$, $nd$, and $nf$ series. Analysis of these series enabled the determination of the IP to be 50868.735(54) cm$^{-1}$, which improved the precision by two orders of magnitude over the current adopted NIST value of 50867(2) cm$^{-1}$. Additionally, four AI Rydberg series were identified and assigned to $nf$ and $nd$ series converging to the $6d^27s$ $^4F_{5/2}$ and $6d^27s$ $^2D_{3/2}$ metastable states of Th$^+$. The measured energies of the Rydberg and AI Rydberg states are reported, and observed perturbations within the series are discussed.</description>

      <title>Analytical and Numerical Studies of Dark Current in Radiofrequency Structures for Short-Pulse High-Gradient Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-gradient acceleration is a key research area that could enable compact linear accelerators for future colliders, light sources, and other applications. In the pursuit of high-gradient operation, RF breakdown limits the attainable accelerating gradient in normal-conducting RF structures. Recent experiments at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator suggest a promising approach: using short RF pulses with durations of a few nanoseconds. Experimental studies show that these O(1 ns) RF pulses can mitigate breakdown limitations, resulting in higher gradients. For example, an electric field of nearly 400 MV/m was achieved in an X-band photoemission gun driven by 6-ns-long RF pulses, with rapid RF conditioning and low dark current observed. Despite these promising results, the short-pulse regime remains an under-explored parameter space, and RF breakdown physics under nanosecond-long pulses requires further investigation. In this paper, we present analytical and numerical simulations of dark current dynamics in accelerating cavities operating in the short-pulse regime. We study breakdown-associated processes spanning different time scales, including field emission, multipacting, and plasma formation, using simulations of the X-band photogun cavities. The results reveal the advantages of using short RF pulses to reduce dark current and mitigate RF breakdown, offering a path toward a new class of compact accelerators with enhanced performance and reduced susceptibility to breakdown.</description>
