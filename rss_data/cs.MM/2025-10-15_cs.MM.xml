      <title>Human-in-the-Loop Bandwidth Estimation for Quality of Experience Optimization in Real-Time Video Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of experience (QoE) delivered by video conferencing systems is significantly influenced by accurately estimating the time-varying available bandwidth between the sender and receiver. Bandwidth estimation for real-time communications remains an open challenge due to rapidly evolving network architectures, increasingly complex protocol stacks, and the difficulty of defining QoE metrics that reliably improve user experience. In this work, we propose a deployed, human-in-the-loop, data-driven framework for bandwidth estimation to address these challenges. Our approach begins with training objective QoE reward models derived from subjective user evaluations to measure audio and video quality in real-time video conferencing systems. Subsequently, we collect roughly $1$M network traces with objective QoE rewards from real-world Microsoft Teams calls to curate a bandwidth estimation training dataset. We then introduce a novel distributional offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to train a neural-network-based bandwidth estimator aimed at improving QoE for users. Our real-world A/B test demonstrates that the proposed approach reduces the subjective poor call ratio by $11.41\%$ compared to the baseline bandwidth estimator. Furthermore, the proposed offline RL algorithm is benchmarked on D4RL tasks to demonstrate its generalization beyond bandwidth estimation.</description>

      <title>M3ST-DTI: A multi-task learning model for drug-target interactions based on multi-modal features and multi-stage alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target interactions (DTI) is pivotal in drug discovery. However, existing approaches often fail to capture deep intra-modal feature interactions or achieve effective cross-modal alignment, limiting predictive performance and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose M3ST-DTI, a multi-task learning model that enables multi-stage integration and alignment of multi modal features for DTI prediction. M3ST-DTI incorporates three types of features-textual, structural, and functional and enhances intra-modal representations using self-attention mechanisms and a hybrid pooling graph attention module. For early-stage feature alignment and fusion, the model in tegrates MCA with Gram loss as a structural constraint. In the later stage, a BCA module captures fine-grained interactions between drugs and targets within each modality, while a deep orthogonal fusion module mitigates feature redundancy.Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that M3ST-DTI consistently outperforms state-of-the art methods across diverse metrics</description>

      <title>SeeingSounds: Learning Audio-to-Visual Alignment via Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SeeingSounds, a lightweight and modular framework for audio-to-image generation that leverages the interplay between audio, language, and vision-without requiring any paired audio-visual data or training on visual generative models. Rather than treating audio as a substitute for text or relying solely on audio-to-text mappings, our method performs dual alignment: audio is projected into a semantic language space via a frozen language encoder, and, contextually grounded into the visual domain using a vision-language model. This approach, inspired by cognitive neuroscience, reflects the natural cross-modal associations observed in human perception. The model operates on frozen diffusion backbones and trains only lightweight adapters, enabling efficient and scalable learning. Moreover, it supports fine-grained and interpretable control through procedural text prompt generation, where audio transformations (e.g., volume or pitch shifts) translate into descriptive prompts (e.g., "a distant thunder") that guide visual outputs. Extensive experiments across standard benchmarks confirm that SeeingSounds outperforms existing methods in both zero-shot and supervised settings, establishing a new state of the art in controllable audio-to-visual generation.</description>

      <title>Audio-Guided Visual Perception for Audio-Visual Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Embodied Navigation aims to enable agents to autonomously navigate to sound sources in unknown 3D environments using auditory cues. While current AVN methods excel on in-distribution sound sources, they exhibit poor cross-source generalization: navigation success rates plummet and search paths become excessively long when agents encounter unheard sounds or unseen environments. This limitation stems from the lack of explicit alignment mechanisms between auditory signals and corresponding visual regions. Policies tend to memorize spurious \enquote{acoustic fingerprint-scenario} correlations during training, leading to blind exploration when exposed to novel sound sources. To address this, we propose the AGVP framework, which transforms sound from policy-memorable acoustic fingerprint cues into spatial guidance. The framework first extracts global auditory context via audio self-attention, then uses this context as queries to guide visual feature attention, highlighting sound-source-related regions at the feature level. Subsequent temporal modeling and policy optimization are then performed. This design, centered on interpretable cross-modal alignment and region reweighting, reduces dependency on specific acoustic fingerprints. Experimental results demonstrate that AGVP improves both navigation efficiency and robustness while achieving superior cross-scenario generalization on previously unheard sounds.</description>

      <title>Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings -- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration -- achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder design and its impact on VLM performance.</description>

      <title>LiteVPNet: A Lightweight Network for Video Encoding Control in Quality-Critical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, video workflows in the cinema production ecosystem have presented new use cases for video streaming technology. These new workflows, e.g. in On-set Virtual Production, present the challenge of requiring precise quality control and energy efficiency. Existing approaches to transcoding often fall short of these requirements, either due to a lack of quality control or computational overhead. To fill this gap, we present a lightweight neural network (LiteVPNet) for accurately predicting Quantisation Parameters for NVENC AV1 encoders that achieve a specified VMAF score. We use low-complexity features, including bitstream characteristics, video complexity measures, and CLIP-based semantic embeddings. Our results demonstrate that LiteVPNet achieves mean VMAF errors below 1.2 points across a wide range of quality targets. Notably, LiteVPNet achieves VMAF errors within 2 points for over 87% of our test corpus, c.f. approx 61% with state-of-the-art methods. LiteVPNet's performance across various quality regions highlights its applicability for enhancing high-value content transport and streaming for more energy-efficient, high-quality media experiences.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Reducing AV1 Decoder Complexity and Energy Consumption via Encoder Parameter Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of advanced video codecs such as AV1 is often hindered by their high decoding complexity, posing a challenge for battery-constrained devices. While encoders can be configured to produce bitstreams that are decoder-friendly, estimating the decoding complexity and energy overhead for a given video is non-trivial. In this study, we systematically analyse the impact of disabling various coding tools and adjusting coding parameters in two AV1 encoders, libaom-av1 and SVT-AV1. Using system-level energy measurement tools like RAPL (Running Average Power Limit), Intel SoC Watch (integrated with VTune profiler), we quantify the resulting trade-offs between decoding complexity, energy consumption, and compression efficiency for decoding a bitstream. Our results demonstrate that specific encoder configurations can substantially reduce decoding complexity with minimal perceptual quality degradation. For libaom-av1, disabling CDEF, an in-loop filter gives us a mean reduction in decoding cycles by 10%. For SVT-AV1, using the in-built, fast-decode=2 preset achieves a more substantial 24% reduction in decoding cycles. These findings provide strategies for content providers to lower the energy footprint of AV1 video streaming.</description>

      <title>Omni-Captioner: Data Pipeline, Models, and Benchmark for Omni Detailed Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-grained perception of multimodal information is critical for advancing human-AI interaction. With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni Language Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in parallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer understanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe fine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a systematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the perspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an inherent "co-growth" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To address this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline integrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally hallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective, we train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed perception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the cascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on MMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and delivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed captioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and achieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the video-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni detailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for detailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable, efficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality detailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such detailed captions.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust and Realible Multimodal Misinformation Recognition with Incomplete Modality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Misinformation Recognition has become an urgent task with the emergence of huge multimodal fake content on social media platforms. Previous studies mainly focus on complex feature extraction and fusion to learn discriminative information from multimodal content. However, in real-world applications, multimedia news may naturally lose some information during dissemination, resulting in modality incompleteness, which is detrimental to the generalization and robustness of existing models. To this end, we propose a novel generic and robust multimodal fusion strategy, termed Multi-expert Modality-incomplete Learning Network (MMLNet), which is simple yet effective. It consists of three key steps: (1) Multi-Expert Collaborative Reasoning to compensate for missing modalities by dynamically leveraging complementary information through multiple experts. (2) Incomplete Modality Adapters compensates for the missing information by leveraging the new feature distribution. (3) Modality Missing Learning leveraging an label-aware adaptive weighting strategy to learn a robust representation with contrastive learning. We evaluate MMLNet on three real-world benchmarks across two languages, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relative simplicity. By ensuring the accuracy of misinformation recognition in incomplete modality scenarios caused by information propagation, MMLNet effectively curbs the spread of malicious misinformation. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhyhome/MMLNet.</description>

      <title>Stimulus Modality Matters: Impact of Perceptual Evaluations from Different Modalities on Speech Emotion Recognition System Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10762v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems rely on speech input and emotional labels annotated by humans. However, various emotion databases collect perceptional evaluations in different ways. For instance, the IEMOCAP dataset uses video clips with sounds for annotators to provide their emotional perceptions. However, the most significant English emotion dataset, the MSP-PODCAST, only provides speech for raters to choose the emotional ratings. Nevertheless, using speech as input is the standard approach to training SER systems. Therefore, the open question is the emotional labels elicited by which scenarios are the most effective for training SER systems. We comprehensively compare the effectiveness of SER systems trained with labels elicited by different modality stimuli and evaluate the SER systems on various testing conditions. Also, we introduce an all-inclusive label that combines all labels elicited by various modalities. We show that using labels elicited by voice-only stimuli for training yields better performance on the test set, whereas labels elicited by voice-only stimuli.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention for Cross-view Online Action Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a critical task in video sequence classification within computer vision, Online Action Detection (OAD) has garnered significant attention. The sensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers their generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA) model, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed representations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model incorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages these representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby enhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level video analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the probabilistic modeling to facilitate the extraction of view-invariant features. Experiments conducted under three evaluation protocols: cross-subject (cs), cross-view (cv), and cross-subject-view (csv) show that PTMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets.</description>

      <title>SIG-Chat: Spatial Intent-Guided Conversational Gesture Generation Involving How, When and Where</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accompanying actions and gestures in dialogue are often closely linked to interactions with the environment, such as looking toward the interlocutor or using gestures to point to the described target at appropriate moments. Speech and semantics guide the production of gestures by determining their timing (WHEN) and style (HOW), while the spatial locations of interactive objects dictate their directional execution (WHERE). Existing approaches either rely solely on descriptive language to generate motions or utilize audio to produce non-interactive gestures, thereby lacking the characterization of interactive timing and spatial intent. This significantly limits the applicability of conversational gesture generation, whether in robotics or in the fields of game and animation production. To address this gap, we present a full-stack solution. We first established a unique data collection method to simultaneously capture high-precision human motion and spatial intent. We then developed a generation model driven by audio, language, and spatial data, alongside dedicated metrics for evaluating interaction timing and spatial accuracy. Finally, we deployed the solution on a humanoid robot, enabling rich, context-aware physical interactions.</description>
