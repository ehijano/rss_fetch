      <title>The Role of High-Speed Rail in Reshaping Chinese County-Level Economic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As high-speed rail (HSR) investment accelerates across China, the question of whether such large-scale infrastructure can promote balanced regional development or exacerbate spatial inequality has become central for policymakers and scholars. This study provides systematic micro-level evidence by analyzing a balanced panel of 353 county-level divisions, including urban districts, county-level cities, and counties, along the Shanghai-Kunming and Xuzhou-Lanzhou HSR corridors from 2008 to 2019. Using a multi-period difference-in-differences (DID) approach, supported by event study and propensity score matching, we quantify the heterogeneous impacts of HSR openings across administrative types and regions, with special attention to the presence of direct HSR station access. The results show that HSR expansion significantly increases secondary and tertiary sector output in urban districts (by 2.77 and 8.71 hundred million RMB) and in county-level cities, particularly in the eastern region. In contrast, counties without HSR stations or with weaker economic foundations experience much smaller gains. Some counties also see a notable contraction in the service sector, which is closely linked to substantial population outflows. Robustness checks confirm the causal interpretation. These findings challenge the prevailing view that HSR fosters uniform growth. Instead, the results reveal that infrastructure-led development can intensify spatial and administrative disparities at the county level. The study underscores the need for integrated and locally tailored policy interventions to ensure that HSR investments contribute to inclusive and sustainable regional development.</description>

      <title>Cost-optimized replacement strategies for water electrolysis systems affected by degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key factor in reducing the cost of green hydrogen production projects using water electrolysis systems is to minimize the degradation of the electrolyzer stacks, as this impacts the lifetime of the stacks and therefore the frequency of their replacement. To create a better understanding of the economics of stack degradation, we present a linear optimization approach minimizing the costs of a green hydrogen supply chain including an electrolyzer with degradation modeling. By calculating the levelized cost of hydrogen depending on a variable degradation threshold, the cost optimal time for stack replacement can be identified. We further study how this optimal time of replacement is affected by uncertainties such as the degradation scale, the load-dependency of both degradation and energy demand, and the costs of the electrolyzer. The variation of the identified major uncertainty degradation scale results in a difference of up to 9 years regarding the cost optimal time for stack replacement, respectively lifetime of the stacks. Therefore, a better understanding of the degradation impact is imperative for project cost reductions, which in turn would support a proceeding hydrogen market ramp-up.</description>

      <title>Better Together? A Field Experiment on Human-Algorithm Interaction in Child Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite algorithms' potential to improve public service efficiency, lack of evidence and widespread concerns about equity have impeded their deployment. We conduct a large-scale randomized controlled trial ($N=4,681$) where we provide algorithm support to workers allocating Child Protective Services (CPS) investigations in real time. Relative to humans on their own, access to the algorithm reduced maltreatment-related hospitalizations, including a 29 percent reduction in child injury admissions. Algorithm support also improved equity, reducing harm disproportionately for historically disadvantaged groups, while reducing CPS surveillance of Black children. We further show that humans with algorithm support outperformed the algorithm on its own, using counterfactual exercises designed to be applicable in settings where an algorithm-only treatment arm is infeasible. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence using novel LLM-based methods applied to worker discussion notes on how workers reallocated investigations to children at greater likelihood of harm, irrespective of algorithm-predicted risk.</description>
