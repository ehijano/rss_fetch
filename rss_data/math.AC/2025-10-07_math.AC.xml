      <title>Note on the Krull dimension of rings of integer-valued polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D$ be an integral domain with quotient field $K,$ $E$ a subset of $K$ and $X$ an indeterminate over $K$. The set $\mathrm{Int}(E,D):=\{f\in K[X];\; f(E)\subseteq D\}$, of integer-valued polynomials on $E$ over $D$, is known to be an integral domain. The purpose of this note is to calculate the Krull dimension of $\mathrm{Int}(E,D)$ across various classes of integral domains $D$ and specific subsets $E$ of $D$. We further extend our study to the ring $\mathrm{Int}_B(E,D):=\{f\in B[X];\; f(E)\subseteq D\},$ where $B$ is an integral domain containing $D$</description>

      <title>On Annihilator Multiplication Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $A$-module $E$ is an annihilator multiplication module if, for each $e\in E$, there is a finitely generated ideal $I$ of $A$ such that $ann(e)=ann(IE)$. In this paper, we investigate fundamental properties of annihilator multiplication modules and employ them as a framework for characterizing significant classes of rings and modules, including torsion-free modules, multiplication modules, injective modules, and principal ideal von Neumann regular rings. In addition, we establish that, for such modules, the equality $Ass_{A}(E)=Ass(A)$ holds, thereby providing a precise connection between module-theoretic and ring-theoretic prime structures.</description>

      <title>Remarks on effective uniform Brian\c{c}on-Skoda</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a noetherian commutative ring. Of great interest is the question whether one can find an explicit integer $k$ such that $\overline{I^{k+n}}\subseteq I^n$ for each ideal $I$ and each integer $n\geq 1$ (the notation $\overline{I^{k+n}}$ denotes the integral closure of $I^{k+n}$). In this article, we investigate this question and obtain optimal values of $k$ for $F$-pure (or dense $F$-pure type) rings and Cohen-Macaulay $F$-injective (or dense $F$-injective type) rings.</description>

      <title>Monomial curves and locally linear resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For four elements of a Noetherian ring we construct complexes of free modules of length three (resp. five) by an explicit description of the homomorphisms of the free modules. We provide exactness criteria for them. As an application we use these results in order to describe explicit the minimal free resolution of the Hartshorne--Rao module of a monomial curve lying on a smooth quadric. Also it provides an example of linearly generated module with syzygies of arbitrary high degree.</description>

      <title>On the dimension of the strongly robust complex for configurations in general position</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly robust toric ideals are the toric ideals for which the set of indispensable binomials is the Graver basis. The strongly robust simplicial complex $\Delta _T$ of a simple toric ideal $I_T$ determines the strongly robust property for all toric ideals that have $I_T$ as their bouquet ideal. We prove that $\text{dim} \Delta_T&lt;\text{rank}(T)$ for configurations in general position, partially answering a question posed by Sullivant.</description>

      <title>Invertibility in partially ordered nonassociative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16565v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Invertibility is important in ring theory because it enables division and facilitates solving equations. Moreover, (nonassociative) rings can be endowed with an extra ''structure'' such as order and topology allowing more richness in the theory. The two main theorems of this article are contributions to invertibility in the context of partially ordered nonassociative rings \textit{and} Hausdorff sequentially Cauchy-complete weak-quasi-topological nonassociative rings. Specifically, the first theorem asserts that the interval $]0,1]$ in any suitable partially ordered nonassociative ring consists entirely of invertible elements. The second theorem asserts that if $f$ is a suitably generalized concept of seminorm from a nonassociative ring to a partially ordered nonassociative ring endowed with Frink's interval topology, then under certain conditions, the subset of elements such that $f(1-a) &lt; 1$ consists entirely of invertible elements. Part of the assumption of the second theorem is that of Hausdorff sequential Cauchy-completeness of the first ring under the topology induced by the seminorm $f$ (which takes values in a partially ordered nonassociative ring endowed with Frink's interval topology). Frink's interval topology is an example of a coarse locally-convex $T_1$ topology. Moreover, to our knowledge, the topology induced by a seminorm into a partially ordered nonassociative ring has never been introduced. Some additional original facts, such as the fact that the topology on a nonassociative ring $R_1$ induced by a norm into a totally ordered associative division ring $R_2$ endowed with Frink's interval topology (or equivalently, with the order topology, since the order of $R_2$ is total) is a Hausdorff locally convex quasi-topological group with an additional separate continuity property of the product, are dealt with in the second section ''Preliminaries''.</description>

      <title>Some new Betti numbers of ideals generated by n+1 generic forms in n variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very little is known on the Hilbert series of graded algebras $\mathbb C[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(g_1,\ldots,g_r)$, $r&gt;n$, $g_i$ generic form of degree $e_i$, in general. One instance when the series is known, is for $n+1$ forms in $n$ variables, \cite{St}. Of course even less is known about Betti numbers. There are some general results on the Betti table by Pardue and Richert in \cite{Pa-Ri,Pa-Ri1}, and by Diem in \cite{Di}. Then there are results on Betti numbers in the case $n+1$ relations in $n$ variables, described below, by Migliore and Mir\`o-Roig in \cite{Mi-Mi}, and more partial results in the general case by the same authors in \cite{Mi-Mi1}. In this paper we consider the same case as in \cite{Mi-Mi}, $n+1$ forms in $n$ variables. Our results can be described as follows. We can determine all graded Betti numbers of $\mathbb C[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(g_1,\ldots,g_{n+1})$, $g_i$ generic, at least if $\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}\deg(g_i)-n$ is even, often in more cases. Thus, given {\em any} set $\{ e_1,\ldots,e_n\}$, $e_i\ge2$ for all $i$, such that $\deg(g_i)=e_i$, $i=1,\ldots,n$, we get many numbers $D_j$, so that we can determine all graded Betti numbers of $\mathbb C[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(g_1,\ldots,g_{n+1})$, $\deg(g_i)=e_i$, $1\le i\le n$, $\deg(g_{n+1})=D_j$. The main ingredients of the proof is a theorem by Pardue and Richert, \cite{Pa-Ri,Pa-Ri1}, and later by Diem,\cite{Di}, and a new short proof of a theorem on Hilbert series of artinian complete intersections by Reid, Roberts, and Roitman, \cite{R-R-R}. We also give examples of algebras with many so called "ghost terms" in the minimal resolution.</description>

      <title>Representations from matrix varieties, and filtered RSK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix Schubert varieties (Fulton '92) carry natural actions of Levi groups. Their coordinate rings are thereby Levi-representations; what is a combinatorial counting rule for the multiplicities of their irreducibles? When the Levi group is a torus, (Knutson-Miller '04) answers the question. We present a general solution, a common refinement of the multigraded Hilbert series, the Cauchy identity, and the Littlewood-Richardson rule. Our result applies to any ``bicrystalline'' algebraic variety; we define these using the operators of (Kashiwara '95) and of (Danilov-Koshevoi '05, van Leeuwen '06). The proof introduces a ``filtered'' generalization of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence.</description>

      <title>On the gcd graphs over polynomial rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gcd-graphs over the ring of integers modulo $n$ are a natural generalization of unitary Cayley graphs. The study of these graphs has foundations in various mathematical fields, including number theory, ring theory, and representation theory. Using the theory of Ramanujan sums, it is known that these gcd-graphs have integral spectra; i.e., all their eigenvalues are integers. In this work, inspired by the analogy between number fields and function fields, we define and study gcd-graphs over polynomial rings with coefficients in finite fields. We establish some fundamental properties of these graphs, emphasizing their analogy to their counterparts over $\mathbb{Z}.$</description>

      <title>Split distributions on Grassmann manifolds and smooth quadric hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is dedicated to studying holomorphic distributions on Grassmann manifolds and smooth quadric hypersurfaces. In special, we prove, under certain conditions, when the tangent and conormal sheaves of a distribution splits as a sum of line bundles on these manifolds, generalizing the previous works on Fano threefolds and $\mathbb{P}^{n}$. We analyze how the algebro-geometric properties of the singular set of singular holomorphic distributions relate to their associated sheaves.</description>

      <title>A Higgs category for the cluster variety of triples of flags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cluster variety of triples of flags (associated with a split simple Lie group of Dynkin type Delta) plays a key role in higher Teichmuller theory as developed by Fock-Goncharov, Jiarui Fei, Ian Le, ... and Goncharov-Shen. We refer to it as the basic triangle associated with Delta. In this paper, for simply laced Delta, we construct and study a Higgs category (in the sense of Yilin Wu) which we expect to categorify the basic triangle. This category is a certain exact dg category (in the sense of Xiaofa Chen) which is Frobenius and stably 2-Calabi-Yau. We show that it has indeed the expected cyclic group symmetry and that its derived category has the expected braid group symmetry. A key ingredient in our construction is a conjecture by Merlin Christ, whose proof occupies most of this paper. The proof is based on a new description of the Higgs category in terms of Gorenstein projective dg modules. Our techniques are in the spirit of Orlov in his work on triangulated categories of graded B-branes.</description>
