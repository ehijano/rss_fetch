      <title>Non-thermal particle acceleration in multi-species kinetic plasmas: universal power-law distribution functions and temperature inversion in the solar corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of non-thermal power-law distribution functions ubiquitously observed in astrophysical/space (e.g., the solar wind) and laboratory kinetic plasmas, is not well understood. Another puzzling phenomenon is temperature inversion in the solar corona. These two issues are deeply connected. We develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) for electromagnetically driven kinetic plasmas, deriving a Fokker-Planck equation for the simultaneous relaxation of multiple species, with (i) a drive diffusion coefficient for the heating of dressed particles directly by the drive and indirectly by waves, and (ii) Balescu-Lenard diffusion and drag coefficients for internal turbulence and Coulomb collisions. Both electron and ion distributions relax towards a universal attractor with a $v^{-5}$ $(E^{-2})$ tail, akin to a $\kappa = 1.5$ distribution, under a super-Debye (but sub-Larmor) drive with a steep power-spectrum. This is an outcome of Debye screening: large-scale fields accelerate the unscreened, fast particles but not the screened, slow ones. The universality may be broken by shallow power-spectra and incomplete relaxation. Collisions cannot decelerate suprathermal particles, rendering a high $v$ tail immune to Maxwellianization. Such a tail may be generated in the solar corona by chromospheric convection despite collisional losses. The suprathermal particles escape sun's gravity (velocity filtration), inverting the temperature profile and raising it to $10^6$ K. A proper analysis of velocity filtration with a $\kappa \approx 1.5-2$ distribution inspired by QLT provides a reasonable fit to the spectroscopic data of heavy ions and explains the abrupt temperature rise, a consequence of the divergence of pressure in the $\kappa \to 1.5$ limit.</description>

      <title>The SOL $\textit{(Solar Origin and Life)}$ Project: Detailed characterization of candidates for the ZAMS and Subgiant stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The context of the Sun in the galactic neighborhood is not well understood, especially when we compare its physical properties to those of nearby stars. Thereby, we still cannot fully comprehend whether or not the Sun is a typical star. This work aims to identify and characterize stars aligned with the solar evolutionary track that could represent it at the ZAMS and subgiant stages. We performed a spectroscopic analysis of 18 photometrically selected candidates using high-resolution and high-SNR spectra as well as the classical spectroscopic method, based on the excitation and ionization equilibria of Fe I and Fe II lines. Additionally, we derived evolutionary parameters using isochrones, and kinematic parameters. We also estimated chromospheric activity levels and performed age estimates through 3 additional independent methods: activity-age relations using the Ca II H $\&amp;$ K and H$\alpha$ lines, and rotation periods estimated from TESS light curves. We identified three candidates that provide a good match to the Sun at $\approx$ 0.5 Gyr (HD 13531 and HD 61033) and subgiant (HD 148577) stages. Moreover, HD 197210 could be of interest when studying the Sun at $\approx$ 2 Gyr, when the Earth's atmosphere started having a significant amount of oxygen. Our selection method was successful and we were able to identify stars similar to the Sun at different evolutionary stages, which is essential for future research in the search of exoplanets and understand habitability, especially with the advent of the next generation of exoplanet-hunting instruments.</description>

      <title>Extreme-ultraviolet synthesis of nanojet-like ejections due to coalescing flux ropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection and characterization of small-scale energetic events such as nanoflares and nanojets remain challenging owing to their short lifetimes, small spatial extent, and relatively low energy release, despite their potential role in coronal heating. Recent observations have identified nanojets as small-scale (length $\lesssim 6.6$~Mm, width $\lesssim 1$~Mm), fast ($\sim$~few 100 km s$^{-1}$), and short-lived ($\lesssim 30$~s) ejections associated with nanoflare-scale energies, providing evidence of magnetic reconnection at small spatial scales. However, the lack of synthetic diagnostics has limited the connection between magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models and observations. In this Letter, we present synthetic observations of the coalescence of two flux ropes, leading to nanojet-like signatures from a numerical model obtained with the \texttt{MPI-AMRVAC} code. We report synthetic observables in Extreme-ultraviolet lines compatible with existing instruments such as SDO/AIA, and upcoming MUSE mission, and compare the synthetic observables with an existing observation of nanojets. The synthetic diagnostics of the emissivity maps, Doppler velocity, thermal, and non-thermal line broadening produce key observational properties, suggesting a plausible 3D scenario for nanojet generation where tiny flux ropes reconnect within loops. Our results provide predictions for the detectability of nanojets with current and future spectroscopic facilities, and establish a bridge between MHD modeling and observations.</description>

      <title>Perhaps there is no brown dwarf desert? A study of sub-stellar companions with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brown dwarf desert describes a range of orbital periods (&lt;5 years) in which fewer brown dwarf-mass companions have been observed around Sun-like stars, when compared to planets and low mass stellar companions. It is therefore theorised that brown dwarf companions are unlikely to form or remain in this period range. The Gaia space telescope is uniquely sensitive to companions in this period range, making it an ideal tool to conduct a survey of the brown dwarf desert. In this study, we use Bayesian inference to analyse data from nearby (&lt;200pc) Sun-like stars in Gaia's DR3 catalogue, assuming single companions. From this, we identify 2673 systems (2.41% of the sample) with possible brown dwarf companions in this period range. Accounting for observational biases, we find that 10.4+0.8-0.6% of nearby Sun-like stars have astrometric errors consistent with a brown dwarf-mass companion with a period less than 5 years, significantly higher than previous studies which reported occurrence rates of &lt;1%. However, we acknowledge the limitations of DR3 and are unable to make a definitive statement without epoch data. By simulating epoch data with multiple companions, we find that, while some of the data can be explained by multiple low-mass brown dwarf companions and high-mass planets (&gt;10MJ), high-mass brown dwarfs (&gt;50MJ) in this period range are comparatively rare. Finally, we used our studies of the brown dwarf distribution to predict the number of companions in the brown dwarf desert we can expect to discover in DR4.</description>

      <title>Electron Cyclotron Maser Emission from Ejected Stellar Prominences on V374 Peg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a possible origin for bursty radio emission observed on the active M dwarf V374 Peg, combining data-driven magnetic field modelling with archival radio light curves. We examine whether stellar prominence ejection can plausibly account for the observed radio bursts that have been attributed to electron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission. Our analysis shows that ejected prominences can produce the required energy range to drive the emission, and that modelled ECM visibility exhibits a rotational phase dependence consistent with the limited observational data (four observed bursts). The results support prominence ejection as a viable mechanism for ECM generation on V374 Peg and motivate further observational campaigns to constrain this process.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Center-to-Limb Effects in Helioseismic Data Using 3D Radiative Hydrodynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-disk observations from missions such as the SDO and SOHO have enabled comprehensive studies of solar oscillations and dynamics. Interpreting helioseismic and photospheric data is complicated by systematic center-to-limb variations. To explore the physical origin of these variations, we perform local 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations that include effects of solar rotation to generate 24-hour synthetic time series of continuum intensity and Doppler velocity for nine viewing angles spanning from -75 to 75 degrees. The simulations reveal a systematic decrease in oscillation power toward the limbs and a pronounced East-West asymmetry that increases with frequency, primarily due to rotation-induced flows. With increasing angular distance from the disk center, the amplitudes and widths of the surface gravity (f) and resonant pressure (p) modes decrease. In contrast, the amplitudes of the corresponding pseudo-modes with frequencies above the acoustic cut-off frequency increase in the intensity power spectra but are suppressed in the velocity spectra. The local helioseismology ring-diagram analysis of the simulation data further demonstrates anisotropic broadening of the modes and distinct differences in background noise and pseudo-mode structure between the intensity and velocity data. These results indicate that the center-to-limb effects arise from both geometric projection and physical factors such as line-formation height and potential effects of the radial differential rotation. The findings provide a framework for correcting helioseismic observations and demonstrate that realistic 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations are a powerful tool for disentangling geometric and physical biases in solar data.</description>

      <title>A Multiband Photometric Study of RR Lyrae Stars in M53 (NGC 5024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiband (UBVRI) time-series photometric study of RR Lyrae (RRL) stars in the globular cluster Messier 53 (NGC 5024) to refine their pulsation properties and determine a precise cluster distance. The archival photometric data includes images taken over 22 years and 3 months using different optical telescopes, providing an excellent time baseline to investigate light curves of variable stars. Using Lomb-Scargle periodogram, we derived accurate periods for 29 fundamental-mode (RRab) and 35 first-overtone (RRc) RRLs. Template-fitting to phase-folded light curves provided robust mean magnitudes and amplitudes. The refined periods confirm M53 as an Oosterhoff II cluster, with a mean period of 0.649 days for RRab and 0.346 days for RRc, and a high RRc fraction (54.7\%). Most RRLs align with the horizontal branch in the color-magnitude diagram, while a few outliers result from blending effects. Period-amplitude diagrams show RRab stars following the Oosterhoff II locus. We derived I-band period-luminosity and multi-band period-Wesenheit relations, comparing them with theoretical predictions. A weighted mean distance modulus of 16.242 $\pm$ 0.05 mag yields a cluster distance of 17.717 $\pm$ 0.408 kpc, in agreement with recent estimates based on parallaxes from Gaia data.</description>

      <title>The massive hot subdwarf binary LAMOST J065816.72+094343.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive short-period binaries involving hot subdwarf stars (sdO/Bs) are rare but important to constraining pathways for binary star evolution. Moreover, some of the most promising candidate progenitor systems leading to Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) involve sdO/Bs. LAMOST J065816.72+094343.1 has been identified as such a candidate. To explore the nature and evolutionary future of LAMOST J065816.72+094343.1, we complemented archival spectroscopic data with additional time series spectra and high-resolution spectroscopy of the object. After combining these with photometric data, we determined the orbital parameters of the system and the mass of the companion. We solved the orbit of the system by analyzing 68 low- and medium-resolution spectra using state-of-the-art mixed local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE model atmospheres. Additionally, we gathered nine high-resolution spectra to determine atmospheric parameters and the projected rotational velocity of the sdOB. The inclination angle of the system was constrained assuming tidal synchronization of the sdOB, which was verified via analysis of the ellipsoidal variations in the TESS light curve. We determine LAMOSTJ065816.72+094343.1 to be a binary consisting of a massive $0.82 \pm 0.17 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ sdOB component with a $1.30^{+0.31}_{-0.26} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ unseen companion. Due to the companion's mass being very close to the Chandrasekhar mass limit and high for a white dwarf, it is unclear whether it is a white dwarf or a neutron star. We find the system to be in a close orbit, with a period of $P=0.31955193 \mathrm{d}$ and an inclination angle of $i = 49.6^{+5.2}_{-4.2} \mathrm{deg}$. While the exact nature of the companion remains unknown, we determine the system to either lead to a SN Ia or an intermediate mass binary pulsar, potentially after a phase as an intermediate-mass X-ray binary.</description>

      <title>The Gaia All-Sky Stellar Parameters Service (GASPS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature and luminosity are the two key diagnostics of a star, yet these cannot come directly from survey data, but must be imputed by comparing those data to models. SED fitting offers a high-precision method to obtain both parameters for stars where both their distance and extinction are well known. The recent publication of many all-sky or large-area surveys coincides the publication of parallaxes and 3D extinction cubes from the Gaia satellite, making it possible to perform SED fitting of truly large ($&gt;10^8$) numbers of Galactic stars for the first time. The analysis of this data requires a high level of automation. Here, we describe the ongoing Gaia All-Sky Stellar Parameters Service (GASPS): the fitting of 240 million SEDs from Gaia DR3 and the extraction of temperatures and luminosities for the corresponding stars using the PySSED code. We demonstrate the quality of the initial results, and the promise that these data show, from wavelength-specific information such as the ultraviolet and infrared excess of each star, to stellar classification, to expansion of the project beyond our own Galaxy, and mineralogical mapping of the Milky Way's interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the dust distribution and polarization around two B213 young stellar objects with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The earliest stages of disk formation and dust evolution during the protostellar phase remain poorly constrained. Millimeter dust emission and its polarization provide key insights into the physical processes and material distribution at the envelope-disk interface. We present ALMA polarimetric observations at 1.4 mm and 3 mm of two young stellar objects in Taurus, IRAS 04166+2706 (K04166) and IRAS 04169+2702 (K04169), probing scales from 25 au to 3000 au. We model the Stokes I emission to separate disk and envelope contributions and analyze the polarization properties to identify the dominant polarization mechanisms.
  K04166 shows extended Stokes I and polarized emission tracing a tentative hourglass magnetic field morphology in its envelope. In the inner envelope and disk (&lt; 100 au), the properties of the polarized emission change, suggesting either a toroidal magnetic field or the presence of large grains. In contrast, K04169 exhibits compact Stokes I and polarized emission consistent with self-scattering from the disk. Both disks are extremely compact, but only K04166 retains a substantial envelope.
  Our multiscale ALMA polarimetric observations reveal a transition from magnetically aligned grains in envelopes to self-scattering in disks within the transition region of 20-50 au. These results provide important clues on dust grain growth and magnetic field morphology at the disk-envelope scales. Despite being embedded in the same filament, the two sources display striking differences, indicating that K04166 is a young embedded object with a substantial envelope threaded by relatively organized magnetic fields. Meanwhile, K04169 is more evolved, likely to be a young T-Tauri star. However, in both disks, the presence of large grains already suggests a scenario of early dust evolution in disks of the Class 0 stage.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the physical and chemical properties of the Class I protostellar system Oph-IRS 44. Binarity, infalling streamers, and accretion shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) In the low-mass star formation process, theoretical models predict that material from the infalling envelope could be shocked as it encounters the outer regions of the disk. Nevertheless, only a few protostars show evidence of these shocks at the disk-envelope interface, and the main formation path of shocked-related species is still unclear. We present new ALMA observations of IRS 44, a Class I source that has previously been associated with accretion shocks, taken at high angular resolution (0.1"). We target multiple molecular transitions of CO, H2CO, and simple sulfur-bearing species. In continuum emission, the binary nature of IRS 44 is observed for the first time at sub-millimeter wavelengths. Infalling signatures are seen for the CO line and the emission peaks at the edges of the continuum emission around IRS 44 B, the same region where bright SO and SO2 emission is seen. Weak CS and H2CO emission is observed, while OCS, H2S, and H2CS transitions are not detected. IRS 44 B seems to be more embedded than IRS 44 A, indicating a non-coeval formation scenario or the rejuvenation of source B due to late infall. CO emission is tracing the outflow component at large scales, infalling envelope material at intermediate scales, and two infalling streamer candidates are identified at disk scales. Infalling streamers might produce accretion shocks when they encounter the outer regions of the infalling-rotating envelope. These shocks heat the dust and release S-bearing species as well as promoting a lukewarm chemistry in the gas phase. With the majority of carbon locked in CO, there is little free C available to form CS and H2CS in the gas, leaving an oxygen-rich environment. The high column densities of SO and SO2 might be a consequence of two processes: direct thermal desorption from dust grains and gas-phase formation due to the availability of O and S.</description>

Abstract: We present the detection of 2MASS J22282889-4310262 (2M2228), a T6/T6.5 brown dwarf, using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) archival data observed at C band (4-8 GHz) over two observing epochs ($2\times96$ minutes). 2M2228 is detected at time and frequency averaged Stokes I and V peak flux densities of $67.3\pm4.9\ \mu\ \rm{Jy beam}^{-1}$ and $14.4\pm3.0\ \mu\text{Jy beam}^{-1}$ in the first epoch and $107.2\pm5.2\ \mu\rm{Jy\ beam}^{-1}$ and $-20.7\pm1.2\ \mu\text{Jy beam}^{-1}$ in the second epoch. This discovery constitutes the eighth and, notably, the most rapidly rotating T dwarf detected to date at radio wavelengths. Our observations reveal highly polarised bursts at fractional polarisation ratios $f_\text{c}&gt;50$%. Using Stokes I light curves, we measure occurrence intervals of $\sim47$ and $\sim58$ minutes in the two observing epochs respectively with the first burst aligning within a half period timescale of the the previously measured mid infrared photometric period of $85.8\pm0.32$ minutes. We attribute the emission to the electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) and constrain the magnetic field strength to $B\gtrsim1.4$ kG. We emphasise that the periods inferred are provisional considering the short observing durations. The combination of previously demonstrated atmospheric stability and newly detected radio emission in 2M2228 makes it a promising laboratory for testing magnetospheric currents-driven auroral models and for guiding future coordinated James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and radio observations to probe the link between auroral activity and atmospheric dynamics in T-type brown dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Local simulations of common-envelope dynamical inspiral. Impact of rotation, accretion, and stratification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common envelope evolution (CEE) is a crucial phase in binary stellar evolution. Current global three-dimensional simulations lack the resolution to capture the small-scale dynamics around the embedded companion, while local wind-tunnel simulations always approximate the companion's orbital motion as linear rather than as rotation around the center of mass. We investigate how rotation, accretion, and stratification influence small-scale gas dynamics, gravitational drag and lift forces, and the spin-up rate of the companion. We perform three-dimensional local hydrodynamic simulations of a $0.2\, M_\odot$ compact companion plunging into the envelope of a $2\, M_\odot$ red giant in a reference frame rotating at the companion's orbital angular velocity, using the Athena++ code. The presence of stratification generates an inward-directed force, partially opposed by a rotation-induced outward lift force. Both the resulting inward directed force and the drag force, strongly influenced by stratification, would affect the evolution of the binary separation. We propose revised semi-analytical prescriptions for both drag and lift forces. Without accretion and for sufficiently small gravitational softening radii, a quasi-hydrostatic bubble forms around the companion, while accretion prevents its formation and converts kinetic energy into heat that could contribute to the envelope ejection. Drag and lift forces are only marginally affected by accretion. The companion spin-up rate varies non-monotonically in time, first increasing and then decreasing as it plunges deeper into the envelope. These results motivate future magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate how accretion, rotation, and stratification affect magnetic amplification, and how magnetic fields, in turn, influence mass and angular momentum accretion rates, as well as the drag and lift force exerted on the companion.</description>

      <title>Particle Acceleration and Depolarization in the Protostellar jet knots HH 80 and HH 81</title>

Abstract: Linearly polarized emission is a powerful tracer of magnetic field geometry and particle acceleration in protostellar jets. We present a polarimetric study of the HH objects HH 80 and HH 81 from where non-thermal emission has been confirmed through spectral index measurements at low frequencies. We carried out observations of HH 80 and HH 81 with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in 4-6 GHz. Unlike the inner jet knots, no linear polarization is detected towards the knots HH 80 and HH 81. We place a $3\sigma$ upper limit of $30~\mu$Jy on the polarization intensity, corresponding to fractional polarization limits of $\Pi_{\max}\approx0.02$ and $0.01$ for HH 80 and HH 81, respectively. To interpret this non-detection, we assess the conditions for synchrotron polarization and the impact of depolarization mechanisms. The shock cooling parameter $\chi_\mathrm{s}$ is lower in these outermost HH objects than in the inner knots, indicating that the reverse shocks in HH 80-81 are less efficient at accelerating relativistic electrons compared with the inner knots. Moreover, Faraday depolarization appears severe: the dispersion in the estimated rotation measure $\sigma_{\rm RM}\sim400~\mathrm{rad~m^{-2}}$ is comparable to or larger than observed RM values themselves. This is consistent with strong fluctuations and turbulence. Together with beam depolarization, these effects can suppress the observable fractional polarization flux densities below the detectable thresholds. We conclude that reduced acceleration efficiency (when compared to inner knots) and strong depolarization account for the absence of polarized emission towards HH 80 and HH 81.</description>

      <title>On flying through the base of a pseudo-streamer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near the 10 solar radius perihelion of Parker Solar Probe orbit 24, a confined region containing an enhanced plasma density of 25,000 particles per cubic centimeter and broadband electrostatic waves was encountered. The solar wind velocity of 200 kilometers per second and ion temperature of 25 eV were significantly reduced as compared to their values in the ambient solar wind. These anomalous plasma conditions were observed on closed magnetic field lines, as determined from observations of the suprathermal electron strahl. Because the polarity of the radial magnetic field did not change sign on the two sides of the crossing and the crossed region contained a double-peaked plasma structure, the spacecraft must have passed through the base of a pseudo-streamer whose structure extended out to 10 solar radii. In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. The current associated with this electric field was less than one milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. It also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations divided by density as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the generalized ohm's law was significant. Also, the density as a function of time had a non-zero slope when the electric field was non-zero, suggesting that the pressure gradient term also mattered. As compared to earlier remote sensing and theoretical results, it is surprising that the plasma in this pseudo-streamer had a remarkably low flow velocity and that the pseudo-streamer base extended out to 10 solar radii.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced Sample of Galactic Red Supergiants Reveals Spiral Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red supergiants (RSGs), representing a kind of massive young stellar population, have rarely been used to probe the structure of the Milky Way, mainly due to the long-standing scarcity of Galactic RSG samples. The Gaia BP/RP spectra (hereafter XP), which cover a broad wavelength range, provide a powerful tool for identifying RSGs. In this work, we develop a feedforward neural network classifier that assigns to each XP spectrum a probability of being an RSG, denoted as $\mathrm{P(RSG)}$. We perform ten independent runs with randomly divided training and validation sets, and apply each run to all XP spectra of stars with $G &lt; 12$ mag. By selecting sources with $\mathrm{P(RSG)} \geq 0.9$, ten high-confidence candidate samples are obtained. A star is considered a ture Galactic RSG only if it appears in at least eight of these samples, yielding a final catalog of 2,436 objects. These RSGs show a clear spatial correlation with OB stars and trace the Galactic spiral arms well, confirming the reliability of our classification, and highlighting their potential to serve as powerful tracers of the Milky Way's structure.</description>

      <title>Predicting dust temperature from molecular line data using machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted experiments with machine learning techniques to construct dust temperature maps from the CO isotopologue molecular line data in the Orion A molecular cloud. In the classical astrophysical methodology, multi-band continuum data are required to derive the dust temperature. The present study aims to investigate the capability and limitations of machine learning techniques to derive dust temperatures in regions without multi-band dust continuum data. We investigated how the number of pixels used for training influences prediction accuracy, and how the dust temperatures sampled in the training area influence prediction accuracy. We found that $\sim$5\% of the total number of pixels in the observational region is sufficient for training to obtain accurate predictions. Furthermore, a dust temperature sample within the training area should cover the whole temperature range and have a similar sample distribution to that of the entire observing region for an accurate prediction. The $^{12}$CO / $^{13}$CO ratio is often found to be the most important feature in predicting the dust temperature. As the $^{12}$CO / $^{13}$CO ratio is a tracer of PDR, the machine learning technique could connect the dust temperatures to the PDRs. We also found that the condition of thermal gas-dust coupling is not required for accurate prediction of the dust temperature from the molecular line data, and that machine learning is capable of capturing information more than classical astrophysical concepts.</description>

      <title>Identification of solid N2O in interstellar ices using open JWST data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. There are only six molecules containing N-O bond that are detected in gaseous phase in interstellar medium. One of those is nitrous oxide (N2O), which was searched for but not found in solid form from as early as Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) mission was launched. The observational capabilities of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) present a possibility to identify solid interstellar N2O.
  Aims. We aim to identify nitrous oxide in open JWST spectra of interstellar ices towards a sample of Class 0, 0/I and flat protostars using the relevant laboratory mixtures of N2O-bearing interstellar ice analogues.
  Methods. A set of laboratory infrared transmission spectra was obtained for the following mixtures: N2O:CO2=1:20, N2O:CO=1:20, N2O:N2=1:20, N2O:CO2:CO=1:15:5, N2O:CO2:N2=1:15:13 at 10-23 K. A search for N2O in JWST NIRSpec spectra towards 50 protostars was performed by fitting the 4.44-4.47 um (2250-2235 cm-1) NN-stretch absorption band with new laboratory mixtures of N2O-bearing ices.
  Results. We claim the first secure identification of N2O in 16 protostars. The fitting results show that N2O is formed predominantly within the apolar layer of the ice mantles, rich in CO, CO2 and N2. The abundance of solid N2O is estimated as 0.2-2.1% relative to solid CO. We present band strengths for N2O in the mixtures corresponding to the apolar layer. Also, an identification of the C-N stretch band at 4.42 um (2260 cm-1) is reported, which we tentatively assign to HNCO, the simplest C-N bond carrier.</description>

      <title>Disc fragmentation. II. Ejection of low mass Free Floating Planets from growing binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations indicate that disc fragmentation due to Gravitational Instability (GI) is the likely origin of massive companions to stars, such as giant planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, Brown Dwarf (BD) companions to FGK stars, and binary stars with separations smaller than 100 au. Additionally, we have recently showed that disc fragmentation in young rapidly evolving binary systems ejects an abundant population of massive Jupiter-mass Free-Floating Planets (FFPs). In this model, a massive disc around an initially single protostar undergoes GI and hatches a number of fragments; the most massive oligarch grows by runaway accretion into the secondary star. As the system rearranges itself from a single to a binary star configuration, a dramatic "pincer movement" by the binary ejects planets through dynamical interactions with the stars. Here we propose that the same scenario applies to an even more abundant population of smaller FFPs discovered by the microlensing surveys. Although disc fragmentation is usually believed to form only massive objects, several pathways for forming small core-dominated planets at separations of tens of au exist. We present results from three complementary simulation approaches, all of which confirm planet ejection efficiency as high as 0.5 for secondaries more massive than $\sim 10$\% of the primary star mass. On the other hand, Jovian mass planets migrate through the region of tens of au too rapidly to eject planets from that region. We discuss implications of this scenario, concluding that microlensing FFPs may be the most convincing evidence yet that disc fragmentation forms planets much less massive than Jupiter.</description>

      <title>Properties of Magnetic Switchbacks in the Near-Sun Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic switchbacks are fluctuations in the solar wind in which the interplanetary magnetic field sharply deflects away from its background direction so as to create folds in magnetic field lines while remaining of roughly constant magnitude. The magnetic field and velocity fluctuations are extremely well correlated in a way corresponding to Alfv\'enic fluctuations propagating away from the Sun. For a background field which is nearly radial this causes an outwardly propagating jet to form. Switchbacks and their characteristic velocity jets have recently been observed to be nearly ubiquitous by Parker Solar Probe with in situ measurements in the inner heliosphere within 0.3 AU. Their prevalence, substantial energy content, and potentially fundamental role in the dynamics of the outer corona and solar wind motivate the significant research efforts into their understanding. Here we review the in situ measurements of these structures (primarily by Parker Solar Probe). We discuss how they are identified and measured, and present an overview of the primary observational properties of these structures, both in terms of individual switchbacks and their collective arrangement into ``patches''. We identify both properties for which there is a strong consensus and those that have limited or qualified support and require further investigation. We identify and collate several open questions and recommendations for future studies.</description>

Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to have a source rich data stream containing signals from large numbers of many different types of source. This will include both individually resolvable signals and overlapping stochastic backgrounds, a regime intermediate between current ground-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays. The resolved sources and backgrounds will be fitted together in a high dimensional Global Fit. To extract information about the astrophysical populations to which the sources belong, we need to decode the information in the Global Fit, which requires new methodology that has not been required for the analysis of current gravitational wave detectors. Here, we %start that development, presenting present a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer the properties of astrophysical populations directly from the output of a LISA Global Fit, consistently accounting for information encoded in both the resolved sources and the unresolved background. Using a simplified model of the Global Fit, we illustrate how the interplay between resolved and unresolved components affects population inference and highlight the impact of data analysis choices, such as the signal-to-noise threshold for resolved sources, on the results. Our approach provides a practical foundation for population inference using LISA data.</description>

      <title>On the effects of radiation on mass transfer in binary stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass transfer (MT) in binary systems is a common evolutionary process that can significantly affect the structure, evolution, and final fate of both stars. In modeling MT hydrodynamics, it is usually assumed that the critical point of the flow, where the velocity exceeds the local sound speed, coincides with the inner Lagrange point (L1). However, in massive donors where radiative pressure dominates over gas pressure and the Eddington factor $\Gamma_\text{Edd}$ can approach or exceed unity, radiation-gas coupling can shift the critical point away from L1, altering the MT rate ($\dot{M}_\text{d}$). We investigate the effects of radiation on MT using time-steady radiative hydrodynamic equations and the von Zeipel theorem. We derive analytical expressions that closely approximate $\dot{M}_\text{d}$, algebraic solutions for simplified cases, and numerical results using a realistic equation of state. Two main differences emerge relative to traditional prescriptions for $\dot{M}_\text{d}$. First, for Roche-lobe-underfilling donors with $\Gamma_\text{Edd} \lesssim 1$, radiative momentum exchange leads to an exponential increase of $\dot{M}_\text{d}$ as a function of $1-\Gamma_\text{Edd}$. We provide a simple modification of existing prescriptions that captures this effect. Second, the photon tiring limit for super-Eddington outflows is much less restrictive near L1 than in spherical stars. We suggest that donors with super-Eddington, convectively inefficient subsurface layers can drive MT with $-\dot{M}_\text{d} \gtrsim 10^{-2}\,\text{M}_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ even before Roche-lobe overflow. We characterize the conditions for this new mode of super-Eddington-boosted MT and discuss its implications for binary evolution, including potential links to nonterminal outbursts of Luminous Blue Variables.</description>

      <title>The first phase of mass transfer in low-mass binaries: neither stable nor a common envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The masses of the white dwarfs in a binary carry information about previous mass-transfer phases. The core mass -- radius relation of low-mass giants gives the size of the progenitor of a helium white dwarf at the moment it last filled its Roche lobe. Previously, we used this information for a few observed systems to propose a new mass-transfer type, based on an angular momentum balance.
  Our aim is to investigate if stable mass transfer instead of the angular momentum prescription is consistent with the observed double helium white dwarf masses.
  We reconstruct the progenitor evolution of observed double helium white dwarfs using the core mass -- radius relation and evaluate if the periods at the start of the second phases of mass transfer are consistent with the outcome of stable mass transfer. More generally, we calculate the mass distribution of double helium white dwarfs for three different progenitors scenarios: double common envelope (with parameter $\alpha \lambda$), angular momentum prescription (with parameter $\gamma$) and stable mass transfer.
  We find that the observed systems are generally not consistent with stable mass transfer. Stable mass transfer leads to a tight correlation between the two white dwarf masses in a binary that is not consistent with the observed mass distribution. Double common envelope evolution is a particularly poor fit to the observations. The angular momentum prescription can populate the observed mass distribution, but not perfectly.
  We conclude that the first phase of mass transfer initiated on the red giant branch in low-mass systems does not generally proceed as stable mass transfer nor as common envelope, and thus is poorly understood. This may be related to the fact that for many observed binaries that have finished the first phase of mass transfer the orbit is eccentric, which is an unexpected outcome of mass transfer.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, many wide orbit circumbinary giant planets have been discovered; some of these may have formed by gravitational fragmentation of circumbinary discs. The aim of this work is to investigate the lower mass limit for circumbinary disc fragmentation. We use the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code SEREN, which employs an approximate method for the radiative transfer, to perform 3 sets of simulations of gravitationally unstable discs. The first set of simulations covers circumstellar discs heated by a single 0.7M$_{\odot}$ star (circumstellar model), the second set covers binaries with the same total stellar mass as the circumstellar model, attended by circumbinary discs with the same temperature profile (circumbinary fiducial model), and the third set covers circumbinary discs heated by each individual star (circumbinary realistic model). We vary the binary separation, mass ratio and eccentricity to see their effect on disc fragmentation. For the circumstellar disc model, we find a lower disc-to-star mass ratio for fragmentation of $\sim\,$0.31. For the circumbinary fiducial disc model we find the same disc-to-star mass ratio for fragmentation (but slightly lower for more eccentric, equal-mass binaries; 0.26). On the other hand, realistic circumbinary discs fragment at a lower mass limit (disc-to-star mass ratio of 0.17-0.26), depending on the binary properties. We conclude that circumbinary discs fragment at a lower disc mass (by $\sim 45\%$) than circumstellar discs. Therefore, gas giant planet around binaries may be able to form by gravitational instability easier than around single stars.</description>

      <title>When Magnetic Field Lines Stretch, Snap, and Expand: A New Look at Solar Flares with L-maps</title>

Abstract: Understanding the three-dimensional evolution of coronal magnetic fields during solar flares remains challenging due to the lack of direct coronal field measurements. Here we combine data-driven MHD simulations of NOAA AR 11158 (Fan et al., 2024) with flare-ribbon and coronal-dimming observations to investigate realistic coronal magnetic-field evolution during an X-class flare. We introduce L-maps - maps of natural logarithm of magnetic field-line lengths - as a diagnostic tool to track the dynamics of simulated coronal magnetic structures. Variations in L-maps identify flare ribbons through field-line shortening and coronal dimmings through field-line lengthening. Comparison with SDO/AIA observations demonstrates strong morphological and temporal agreement, validating the simulated field evolution. Applying K-means clustering to the L-map temporal profiles, we distinguish three stages of coronal evolution: (1) slow pre-flare rise phase, (2) flare reconnection accompanied by CME rise, and (3) post-reconnection CME expansion. We detect a slow pre-flare rise phase of magnetic field lines rooted in ribbon footpoints and identify reconnection dimming - area of rapid expansion of active-region core magnetic field lines during flare impulsive phase due to reconnection. Our results show that L-maps provide a powerful and physically intuitive framework for bridging simulations and observations and for tracking the full three-dimensional evolution of coronal magnetic fields during flares.</description>

      <title>Upper Limits on Radio Emission from the K2-18 System</title>

Abstract: Stellar and planetary magnetic fields play a crucial role in the habitability of a planet and the integrity of its atmosphere. The recently claimed detection of biosignatures, methane, carbon dioxide and dimethyl sulfide/disulfide, in the atmosphere of K2-18 b, a sub-Neptune orbiting an M dwarf star present an intriguing question regarding the stellar magnetic environment and the resistance of the planet's magnetosphere (if it exists) to erosion by magnetic activity from the host. To probe for radio emission from the system, we have conducted observations using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at S, C and X-bands (2-4, 4.5-7.5 and 8-10 GHz respectively) to search for coherent and incoherent radio emission. We detect no radio emission associated with incoherent emission mechanisms. We report $3\sigma$ Stokes I upper limits of $49.8\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at S-band, $17.7\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$at C-band and $18.0\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at X-band and an upper limit of the ratio of the radio to the total bolometric luminosity of $\log L_\text{R}/\log L_\text{bol}&lt;-8.8$. We have also searched for short duration bursts associated with coherent emission mechanisms at C and X-bands . No signals above a $3\sigma$ significance threshold are detected. Although no signals are detected our radio observations offer constraints, albeit limited, on the stellar magnetic environment supporting recent X-ray observations indicating K2-18 is a very faint emitter. Our results also contextualise any planetary transmission spectra by providing constraints on the activity level of the host.</description>

      <title>Peculiar SN Ic 2022esa: An explosion of a massive Wolf-Rayet star in a binary as a precursor to a BH-BH binary?</title>

Abstract: A class of supernovae (SNe) termed `SN Ic-CSM' are characterized by late-time emergence of narrow emission lines of elements formed in the oxygen core of a massive star. A popular scenario is the interaction of the SN ejecta and O-rich circumstellar medium (CSM), i.e., Circumstellar Interaction (CSI). Uncovering the progenitor system of SNe Ic-CSM plays a critical role in understanding the final evolution of a massive star to a bare C+O star. In this Letter, we present observations of SN 2022esa which we show is an SN Ic-CSM. Surprisingly, a stable periodicity of ~32 days is found in its light-curve evolution with a hint of a slowly increasing period over ~200 days. We argue that the main power source is likely the interaction of the SN ejecta and O-rich CSM, while the energy input by the post-SN eccentric binary interaction within the SN ejecta is another possibility. In either case, we propose a massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) star as the progenitor, in a WR-WR or WR-BH (black hole) binary that will eventually evolve to a BH-BH binary. Specifically, in the CSI scenario, the progenitor system is an eccentric binary system with an orbital period of about a year, leading to the observed periodicity through the modulation in the CSM density structure. We also show that some other objects, superluminous SN I 2018ibb (a pair-instability SN candidate) and peculiar SN Ic 2022jli (the first example showing stable periodic modulation), show observational similarities to SNe Ic-CSM and may be categorized as SN Ic-CSM variants. Complemented with a large diversity in their light-curve evolution, we propose that SNe Ic-CSM (potentially linked to SNe Ibn/Icn) are a mixture of multiple channels that cover a range of properties in the progenitor star, the binary companion, and the binary orbit.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Equilibrium with Steady Flow and Relativistic Local Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium system with steady flow as well as spherical symmetry is discovered. The energy-momentum tensor contains the contribution of a current related to the flow and the metric tensor does an off-diagonal component to balance with the flow momentum. The presence of the off-diagonal component of the metric implies the radial motion of the reference frame, which gives rise to a problem how the relativistic effect is included in thermodynamic observables for such a general relativistic system. This problem is solved by taking an instantaneously rest frame in which geometric thermodynamic observables read as previously and giving them the special relativistic effect emerged from the inverse transformation to the original frame pointwise. The solution of the thermodynamic observables in accord with the laws of thermodynamics and the theory of relativity is presented. Finally the relativistic structure equations for the equilibrium are derived, from which the general relativistic Poisson equation as well as the heat conduction one are developed exactly.</description>

      <title>Convection-Driven Multi-Scale Magnetic Fields Determine the Observed Solar-Disk Gamma Rays</title>

Abstract: The solar disk is a continuous source of GeV--TeV gamma rays. The emission is thought to originate from hadronic Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) interacting with the gas in the photosphere and uppermost convection zone after being reflected by solar magnetic fields. Despite this general understanding, existing theoretical models have yet to match observational data. At the photosphere and the uppermost convection zone, granular convection drives a multi-scale magnetic field, forming a larger-scale filamentary structure while also generating turbulence-scale Alfv\'{e}n wave turbulence. Here, we demonstrate that the larger-scale filamentary field shapes the overall gamma-ray emission spectrum, and the Alfv\'{e}n wave turbulence is critical for further suppressing the gamma-ray emission spectrum below $\sim 100$~GeV. For a standard Alfv\'{e}n wave turbulence level, our model's predicted spectrum slope from 1~GeV to 1~TeV is in excellent agreement with observations from Fermi-LAT and HAWC, an important achievement. The predicted absolute flux is a factor of 2--5 lower than the observed data; we outline future directions to resolve this discrepancy. The key contribution of our work is providing a new theoretical framework for using solar disk gamma-ray observations to probe hadronic GCR transport in the lower solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Water vapor emission at the warm cavity wall of the HD 100546 disk as revealed by ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present spatially resolved ALMA observations of the water line at 183 GHz in the disk around the Herbig star HD 100546. The water vapor emission peaks at the inner edge of the warm dust cavity, located ~15 au from the central star. We attribute this to thermal desorption at the water snowline, shifted outward at the dust cavity wall directly heated by the intense radiation. This represents the first spatially resolved image of the water snowline using ALMA observations of the main water isotopologue in a protoplanetary disk. The water emission morphology peaking inside the first dust ring is consistent with previous ALMA detections of oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules in the disk, including thermally desorbed methanol. These findings signal that warm cavities of transition disks provide ideal targets to directly reconstruct the spatial distribution of water vapor and the snowline location with ALMA, and directly connect water vapor emission to ice desorption of complex organic species.</description>

      <title>Where does the simplified Stellar Contamination Model fail in Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar photospheric heterogeneities (e.g., starspots, faculae) distort the stellar spectrum in transit and imprint wavelength-dependent biases on the planet-to-star radius ratio (Transit Light Source Effect, TLSE). The Rackham-TLSE (R-TLSE) prescription applies a disc-averaged correction based solely on filling factor and spectral contrast, but transmission spectroscopy also depends on limb darkening, active-region distribution, and transit geometry. We include these in a pixel-resolved framework, ECLIPSE-Xlambda, and run idealised noise-free model-model comparisons to R-TLSE. For LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, and WASP-69 b, disc-averaged corrections differ from the pixel model by up to about 400 ppm in the optical for active hosts and non-equatorial transits, but stay below about 10 ppm in the near-infrared where limb darkening is weak. We then apply both approaches to the JWST/NIRISS SOSS spectrum of LHS 1140 b. With limb darkening set to zero, ECLIPSE-Xlambda recovers stellar-contamination parameters matching the reference R-TLSE solution, confirming consistency in the disc-averaged limit. With wavelength-dependent limb darkening, reproducing the short-wavelength slope via stellar contamination alone requires hot faculae (delta Tfac about 600 K; ffac about 0.35), equivalent to a circular facular region of radius about 0.6 Rstar (about 60% of the stellar radius) on the disc; such an extended unocculted region is physically unlikely even for an active M dwarf. Purely stellar contamination would therefore require extreme faculae, whereas a genuine atmospheric contribution complementing a more modest facular signal is more plausible. These results delineate the validity regime of R-TLSE and underscore the need for geometry-aware stellar-heterogeneity models including limb darkening in high-precision transmission spectroscopy.</description>
