      <title>Toward ultra-efficient high-fidelity prediction of bed morphodynamics of large-scale meandering rivers using a novel LES-trained machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flood-induced deformation of the bed topography of fluvial meandering rivers could lead to river bank displacement, structural failure of the infrastructures, and the propagation of scour or deposition features. The assessment of sediment transport in large-scale meanders is, therefore, a key environmental issue. High-fidelity numerical models provide powerful tools for such assessments. However, high-fidelity simulations of large-scale rivers using the coupled flow and morphodynamics modules can be computationally expensive, owing to the costly two-way coupling between turbulence and bed morphodynamics. This study seeks to present a novel machine learning approach, which is trained using coupled large-eddy simulation (LES) and morphodynamics results. The proposed machine learning approach predicts bed shear stress and equilibrium bed morphology of large-scale meanders under bankfull flow conditions at a fraction of the cost of coupled LES-morphodynamics. We developed and evaluated the performance of a convolutional neural network autoencoder (CNNAE) algorithm to generate high-fidelity bed shear stress and equilibrium morphology of large-scale meandering rivers. The CNNAE algorithm utilizes instantaneous shear stress distribution and change of bed elevation of high-fidelity simulation results, along with geometric parameters of meanders as inputs to predict mean bed shear stress distribution and equilibrium bed elevation of rivers. The results demonstrated the feasibility, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed CNNAE algorithm.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulation of drag reduction in rotating pipe flow up to $Re_{\tau} \approx 3000$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of rotating pipe flows up to $Re_{\tau} \approx 3000$ are carried out to investigate drag reduction effects associated with axial rotation, extending previous studies carried out at a modest Reynolds number (Orlandi &amp; Fatica 1997; Orlandi &amp; Ebstein 2000). The results show that the drag reduction, which we theoretically show to be equivalent to net power saving assuming no mechanical losses, monotonically increases as either the Reynolds number or the rotation number increases, proportionally to the inner-scaled rotational speed. Net drag reduction up to about $70\%$ is observed, while being far from flow relaminarisation. Scaling laws for the mean axial and azimuthal velocity are proposed, from which a predictive formula for the friction factor is derived. The formula can correctly represent the dependency of the friction factor on the Reynolds and rotation numbers, maintaining good accuracy for low-to-moderate rotation numbers. Examination of the turbulent structures highlights the role of rotation in widening and elongating the small-scale streaks, with subsequent suppression of sweeps and ejections. In the core part of the flow, clear weakening of large-scale turbulent motions is observed at high Reynolds numbers, with subsequent suppression of the outer-layer peak in the pre-multiplied spectra. The Fukagata-Iwamoto-Kasagi decomposition indicates that, consistent with a theoretically derived formula, the outer layer yields the largest contribution to drag reduction at increasingly high Reynolds numbers. In contrast, both the inner and the outer layers contribute to drag reduction as the rotation number increases.</description>

      <title>Vortex to Rotons Transition in Dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental advancements enabled the creation of various systems exhibiting superfluid behavior, with one notable achievement being the development of Dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (dBECs) characterized by long-range dipole-dipole interactions. When confined along one or more spatial dimensions, these condensates exhibit a low-dimensional dispersion relation reminiscent of superfluid liquid helium, featuring a roton minimum. This study investigates the existence of two-dimensional solitary waves characterized by topological defects (quantized vorticity) and their transition to vortex-free Jones-Roberts solitons. The explicit connection between solitary waves and roton excitations is demonstrated for the first time, providing support for Feynman's hypothesis regarding the nature of rotons as fading vortex excitations.</description>

      <title>Non-intrusive model reduction of advection-dominated hyperbolic problems using neural network shift augmented manifold transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advection-dominated problems are commonly noticed in nature, engineering systems, and a wide range of industrial processes. For these problems, linear approximation methods (proper orthogonal decomposition and reduced basis method) are not suitable, as the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay is slow, leading to inefficient and inaccurate reduced order models. There are few non-linear approaches to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. In this work, we use a neural-network shift augmented transformation technique, that employs automatic-shit detection and detects the optimal non-linear transformation of the full-order model solution manifold $\mathcal{M}$. We exploit a deep-learning framework to derive parameter-dependent bijective mapping between the manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. It consists of two neural networks, 1) ShiftNet, to employ automatic-shift detection by learning the shift-operator, which finds the optimal shifts for numerous snapshots of the full-order solution manifold, to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay, and 2) InterpNet, which learns the reference configuration and can reconstruct the field values of the same, for each shifted grid distribution. We construct non-intrusive reduced order models on the resulting transformed linear subspaces and employ automatic-shift detection for predictions. We test our methodology on advection-dominated problems, such as 1D travelling waves, 2D isentropic convective vortex and 2D two-phase flow test cases. This work leads to the development of the complete NNsPOD-ROM algorithm for model reduction of advection-dominated problems, comprising both offline-online stages.</description>

      <title>A variational front-tracking method for multiphase flow with triple junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze a variational front-tracking method for a sharp-interface model of multiphase flow. The fluid interfaces between different phases are represented by curve networks in two space dimensions (2d) or surface clusters in three space dimensions (3d) with triple junctions where three interfaces meet, and boundary points/lines where an interface meets a fixed planar boundary. The model is described by the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations in the bulk domains, with classical interface conditions on the fluid interfaces, and appropriate boundary conditions at the triple junctions and boundary points/lines. We propose a weak formulation for the model, which combines a parametric formulation for the evolving interfaces and an Eulerian formulation for the bulk equations. We employ an unfitted discretization of the coupled formulation to obtain a fully discrete finite element method, where the existence and uniqueness of solutions can be shown under weak assumptions. The constructed method admits an unconditional stability result in terms of the discrete energy. Furthermore, we adapt the introduced method so that an exact volume preservation for each phase can be achieved for the discrete solutions. Numerical examples for three-phase flow and four-phase flow are presented to show the robustness and accuracy of the introduced methods.</description>

      <title>REMIX SPH -- improving mixing in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations using a generalised, material-independent approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present REMIX, a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme designed to alleviate effects that typically suppress mixing and instability growth at density discontinuities in SPH simulations. We approach this problem by directly targeting sources of kernel smoothing error and discretisation error, resulting in a generalised, material-independent formulation that improves the treatment both of discontinuities within a single material, for example in an ideal gas, and of interfaces between dissimilar materials. This approach also leads to improvements in capturing hydrodynamic behaviour unrelated to mixing, such as in shocks. We demonstrate marked improvements in three-dimensional test scenarios, focusing on more challenging cases with particles of equal mass across the simulation. This validates our methods for use-cases relevant across applications spanning astrophysics and engineering, where particles are free to evolve over a large range of density scales, or where emergent and evolving density discontinuities cannot easily be corrected by choosing bespoke particle masses in the initial conditions. We achieve these improvements while maintaining sharp discontinuities; without introducing additional equation of state dependence in, for example, particle volume elements; and without contrived or targeted corrections. Our methods build upon a fully compressible and thermodynamically consistent core-SPH construction, retaining Galilean invariance as well as conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. REMIX is integrated in the open-source, state-of-the-art \swift code and is designed with computational efficiency in mind, which means that its improved hydrodynamic treatment can be used for high-resolution simulations without significant cost to run-speed.</description>

      <title>Morphing median fin enhances untethered bionic robotic tuna's linear acceleration and turning maneuverability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Median fins of fish-like swimmers play a crucial role in linear acceleration and maneuvering processes. However, few research focused on untethered robotic fish experiments. Imitating the behaviour of real tuna, we developed a free-swimming bionic tuna with a foldable dorsal fin. The erection of dorsal fin, at proper conditions, can reduce head heave by 50%, enhance linear acceleration by 15.7%, increase turning angular velocity by 32.78%, and turning radius decreasing by 33.13%. Conversely, erecting the dorsal fin increases the wetted surface area, resulting in decreased maximum speed and efficiency during steady swimming phase. This finding partially explains why tuna erect their median fins during maneuvers or acceleration and fold them afterward to reduce drag. In addition, we verified that folding the median fins after acceleration does not significantly affect locomotion efficiency. This study supports the application of morphing median fins in undulating underwater robots and helps to further understand the impact of median fins on fish locomotion.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Parameter Selection in Nudging Based Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation combines (imperfect) knowledge of a flow's physical laws with (noisy, time-lagged, and otherwise imperfect) observations to produce a more accurate prediction of flow statistics. Assimilation by nudging (from 1964), while non-optimal, is easy to implement and its analysis is clear and well-established. Nudging's uniform in time accuracy has even been established under conditions on the nudging parameter $\chi$ and the density of observational locations, $H$, Larios, Rebholz, and Zerfas \cite{larios2019global}. One remaining issue is that nudging requires the user to select a key parameter. The conditions required for this parameter, derived through $\acute{a}$ priori (worst case) analysis are severe (Section \ref{aprior-analysis} herein) and far beyond those found to be effective in computational experience. One resolution, developed herein, is self-adaptive parameter selection. This report develops, analyzes, tests, and compares two methods of self-adaptation of nudging parameters. One combines analysis and response to local flow behavior. The other is based only on response to flow behavior. The comparison finds both are easily implemented and yield effective values of the nudging parameter much smaller than those of $\acute{a}$ priori analysis.</description>

      <title>Wall Modeling of Turbulent Flows with Varying Pressure Gradients Using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework for developing wall models for large-eddy simulation that is able to capture pressure-gradient effects using multi-agent reinforcement learning. Within this framework, the distributed reinforcement learning agents receive off-wall environmental states including pressure gradient and turbulence strain rate, ensuring adaptability to a wide range of flows characterized by pressure-gradient effects and separations. Based on these states, the agents determine an action to adjust the wall eddy viscosity, and consequently the wall-shear stress. The model training is in situ with wall-modeled large-eddy simulation grid resolutions and does not rely on the instantaneous velocity fields from high-fidelity simulations. Throughout the training, the agents compute rewards from the relative error in the estimated wall-shear stress, which allows the agents to refine an optimal control policy that minimizes prediction errors. Employing this framework, wall models are trained for two distinct subgrid-scale models using low-Reynolds-number flow over periodic hills. These models are validated through simulations of flows over periodic hills at higher Reynolds numbers and flow over the Boeing Gaussian bump. The developed wall models successfully capture the acceleration and deceleration of wall-bounded turbulent flows under pressure gradients and outperform the equilibrium wall model in predicting skin friction.</description>

      <title>Transition of the thermal boundary layer and plume over an isothermal section-triangular roof: An experimental study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of thermal boundary layers and plume near a section-triangular roof under different isothermal heating conditions have been the focus of numerous numerical studies. However, flow transition in this type of flow has never been observed experimentally. Here, phase-shifting interferometry and thermistor measurements are employed to experimentally observe and quantify the flow transitions in a buoyancy-driven flow over an isothermal section-triangular roof. Visualisation of temperature contours is conducted across a wide range of Rayleigh numbers from laminar at $10^3$ to chaotic state at $4 \times 10^6$. Power spectral density of the temperature measurements reveals the type of bifurcations developing as the Rayleigh number is increased. This flow transition is characterised as a complex bifurcation route with the presence of two fundamental frequencies, a low and a high frequency. We found that the thermal stratification in the environment plays a significant role in the flow transition. The spatial development of flow is also quantitatively and qualitatively described. In addition to clarifying flow transition in experiments, the work demonstrates the implementation of phase-shifting interferometry and punctual temperature measurements for characterisation of near-field flow over heated surface.</description>

      <title>On the relevance of lift force modelling in turbulent wall flows with small inertial particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05346v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In particle-laden turbulent wall flows, lift forces can influence the near-wall turbulence. This has been recently observed in particle-resolved simulations, which, however, are too expensive to be used in upscaled models. Instead, point-particle simulations have been the method of choice to simulate the dynamics of these flows during the last decades. While this approach is simpler, cheaper, and physically sound for small inertial particles in turbulence, some issues remain. In the present work, we address challenges associated with lift force modelling in turbulent wall flows and the impact of lift forces in the near-wall flow. We performed direct numerical simulations (DNS) of small inertial point particles in turbulent channel flow for fixed Stokes number and mass loading while varying the particle size. Our results show that the particle dynamics in the buffer region, causing the apparent particle-to-fluid slip velocity to vanish, raises major challenges for accurately modelling lift forces. While our results confirm that lift forces have little influence on particle dynamics for sufficiently small particle sizes, for inner-scaled diameters of order one and beyond, lift forces become quite important near the wall. The different particle dynamics under lift forces results in the modulation of streamwise momentum transport in the near-wall region. We analyze this lift-induced turbulence modulation for different lift force models, and the results indicate that realistic models are critical for particle-modelled simulations to correctly predict turbulence modulation by particles in the near-wall region.</description>

      <title>On the Support of Anomalous Dissipation Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By means of a unifying measure-theoretic approach, we establish lower bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of the space-time set which can support anomalous dissipation for weak solutions of fluid equations, both in the presence or absence of a physical boundary. Boundary dissipation, which can occur at both the time and the spatial boundary, is analyzed by suitably modifying the Duchon &amp; Robert interior distributional approach. One implication of our results is that any bounded Euler solution (compressible or incompressible) arising as a zero viscosity limit of Navier-Stokes solutions cannot have anomalous dissipation supported on a set of dimension smaller than that of the space. This result is sharp, as demonstrated by entropy-producing shock solutions of compressible Euler and by recent constructions of dissipative incompressible Euler solutions, as well as passive scalars. For $L^q_tL^r_x$ suitable Leray-Hopf solutions of the $d-$dimensional Navier-Stokes equation we prove a bound of the dissipation in terms of the Parabolic Hausdorff measure soon as the solution lies in the Prodi-Serrin class. In the three-dimensional case, this matches with the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg partial regularity.</description>

      <title>A scalable method to model large suspensions of colloidal phoretic particles with arbitrary shapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phoretic colloids self-propel thanks to surface flows generated in response to surface gradients (thermal, electrical, or chemical), that are self-induced and/or generated by other particles. Here we present a scalable and versatile framework to model chemical and hydrodynamic interactions in large suspensions of arbitrarily shaped phoretic particles, accounting for thermal fluctuations at all Damkholer numbers. Our approach, inspired by the Boundary Element Method (BEM), employs second-layer formulations, regularised kernels and a grid optimisation strategy to solve the coupled Laplace-Stokes equations with reasonable accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost associated with BEM. As demonstrated by our large-scale simulations, the capabilities of our method enable the exploration of new physical phenomena that, to our knowledge, have not been previously addressed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent diffusion causes particles placed in proximity to separate. We investigate the required swimming efforts to maintain a particle close to its passively advected counterpart. We explore optimally balancing these efforts with the intended goal by developing and comparing a novel Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PIRL) strategy with prescribed control (PC) and standard physics-agnostic Reinforcement Learning strategies. Our PIRL scheme, coined the Actor-Physicist, is an adaptation of the Actor-Critic algorithm in which the Neural Network parameterized Critic is replaced with an analytically derived physical heuristic function (the physicist). This strategy is then compared with an analytically computed optimal PC policy derived from a stochastic optimal control formulation and standard physics-agnostic Actor-Critic type algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We explore the impact of hydrodynamic interactions on the conformational and dynamical properties of wet tangentially-driven active polymers using multiparticle collision dynamics simulations. By analyzing active filaments with varying degrees of flexibility, we find that fluid-mediated interactions significantly influence both their conformation and dynamics. These interactions cause polymer conformations to shrink, especially for semiflexible polymers at high activity levels, where the average size of wet chains becomes nearly three times smaller, due to formation of helix-like structures. This hydrodynamic-induced shrinkage is a hallmark of active polymers, as fluid-mediated interactions have a minimal effect on the mean conformation of passive polymers. Furthermore, for tangentially-driven polymers where activity and conformation are coupled, hydrodynamic interactions significantly enhance the orientational and translational dynamics compared to their dry counterparts.</description>
