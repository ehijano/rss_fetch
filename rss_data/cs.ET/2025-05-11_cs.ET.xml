      <title>Design of a molecular Field Effect Transistor (mFET)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field Effect Transistors (FETs) are ubiquitous in electronics. As we scale FETs to ever smaller sizes, it becomes natural to ask how small a practical FET might be. We propose and analyze an atomically precise molecular FET (herein referred to as an "mFET") with 7,694 atoms made only of hydrogen and carbon atoms. It uses metallic (4,4) carbon nanotubes as the conductive leads, a linear segment of Lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond) as the channel, Lonsdaleite as the insulating layer between the channel and the gate, and a (20,20) metallic carbon nanotube as the surrounding gate. The (4,4) nanotube leads are bonded to the channel using a mix of 5- and 6-membered rings, and to the gate using 5-, 6- and 7-membered rings. Issues of component design assessment and optimization using quantum chemical methods are discussed throughout. A 10 watt sugar-cube-sized computer made with $10^{18}$ such mFETs could deliver $\sim 10^{25}$ switching operations per second.</description>

      <title>A Context-Driven Approach for Co-Auditing Smart Contracts with The Support of GPT-4 code interpreter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surge in the adoption of smart contracts necessitates rigorous auditing to ensure their security and reliability. Manual auditing, although comprehensive, is time-consuming and heavily reliant on the auditor's expertise. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging them to assist auditors in the auditing process (co-auditing). However, the effectiveness of LLMs in smart contract co-auditing is contingent upon the design of the input prompts, especially in terms of context description and code length. This paper introduces a novel context-driven prompting technique for smart contract co-auditing. Our approach employs three techniques for context scoping and augmentation, encompassing code scoping to chunk long code into self-contained code segments based on code inter-dependencies, assessment scoping to enhance context description based on the target assessment goal, thereby limiting the search space, and reporting scoping to force a specific format for the generated response. Through empirical evaluations on publicly available vulnerable contracts, our method demonstrated a detection rate of 96\% for vulnerable functions, outperforming the native prompting approach, which detected only 53\%. To assess the reliability of our prompting approach, manual analysis of the results was conducted by expert auditors from our partner, Quantstamp, a world-leading smart contract auditing company. The experts' analysis indicates that, in unlabeled datasets, our proposed approach enhances the proficiency of the GPT-4 code interpreter in detecting vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>LightNobel: Improving Sequence Length Limitation in Protein Structure Prediction Model via Adaptive Activation Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Protein Structure Prediction Models (PPMs), such as AlphaFold2 and ESMFold, have revolutionized computational biology by achieving unprecedented accuracy in predicting three-dimensional protein folding structures. However, these models face significant scalability challenges, particularly when processing proteins with long amino acid sequences (e.g., sequence length &gt; 1,000). The primary bottleneck that arises from the exponential growth in activation sizes is driven by the unique data structure in PPM, which introduces an additional dimension that leads to substantial memory and computational demands. These limitations have hindered the effective scaling of PPM for real-world applications, such as analyzing large proteins or complex multimers with critical biological and pharmaceutical relevance.
  In this paper, we present LightNobel, the first hardware-software co-designed accelerator developed to overcome scalability limitations on the sequence length in PPM. At the software level, we propose Token-wise Adaptive Activation Quantization (AAQ), which leverages unique token-wise characteristics, such as distogram patterns in PPM activations, to enable fine-grained quantization techniques without compromising accuracy. At the hardware level, LightNobel integrates the multi-precision reconfigurable matrix processing unit (RMPU) and versatile vector processing unit (VVPU) to enable the efficient execution of AAQ. Through these innovations, LightNobel achieves up to 8.44x, 8.41x speedup and 37.29x, 43.35x higher power efficiency over the latest NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs, respectively, while maintaining negligible accuracy loss. It also reduces the peak memory requirement up to 120.05x in PPM, enabling scalable processing for proteins with long sequences.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Quantum Error Correcting Code under Temporal Variation of Qubit Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error rates in current noisy quantum hardware are not static; they vary over time and across qubits. This temporal and spatial variation challenges the effectiveness of fixed-distance quantum error correction (QEC) codes. In this paper, we analyze 12 days of calibration data from IBM's 127-qubit device (ibm_kyiv), showing the fluctuation of Pauli-X and CNOT gate error rates. We demonstrate that fixed-distance QEC can either underperform or lead to excessive overhead, depending on the selected qubit and the error rate of the day. We then propose a simple adaptive QEC approach that selects an appropriate code distance per qubit, based on daily error rates. Using logical error rate modeling, we identify qubits that cannot be used and qubits that can be recovered with minimal resources. Our method avoids unnecessary resource overhead by excluding outlier qubits and tailoring code distances. Across 12 calibration days on ibm_kyiv, our adaptive strategy reduces physical qubit overhead by over 50% per logical qubit while maintaining access to 85-100% of usable qubits. To further validate the method, we repeat the experiment on two additional 127-qubit devices, ibm_brisbane and ibm_sherbrooke, where the overhead savings reach up to 71% while still preserving over 80% qubit usability. This approach offers a practical and efficient path forward for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)-era QEC strategies.</description>
