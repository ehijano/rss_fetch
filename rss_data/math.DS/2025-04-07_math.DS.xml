      <title>The hybrid matching of Hurwitz systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study planar hybrid systems composed by two stable linear systems, defined by Hurwitz matrices, in addition with a jump that can be a piecewise linear, a polynomial or an analytic function. We provide an explicit analytic necessary and sufficient condition for this class of hybrid systems to be asymptotically stable. We also prove the existence of limit cycles in this class of hybrid systems. Our results can be seen as generalizations of results already obtained in the literature. This was possible due to an embedding of piecewise smooth vector fields in a hybrid structure.</description>

      <title>Global Continuation of Stable Periodic Orbits in Systems of Competing Predators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a continuation technique to obtain global families of stable periodic orbits, delimited by transcritical bifurcations at both ends. To this end, we formulate a zero-finding problem whose zeros correspond to families of periodic orbits. We then define a Newton-like fixed-point operator and establish its contraction near a numerically computed approximation of the family. To verify the contraction, we derive sufficient conditions expressed as inequalities on the norms of the fixed-point operator, and involving the numerical approximation. These inequalities are then rigorously checked by the computer via interval arithmetic. To show the efficacy of our approach, we prove the existence of global families in an ecosystem with Holling's type II functional response, and thereby solve a stable connection problem proposed by Butler and Waltler in 1981. Our method does not rely on restricting the choice of parameters and is applicable to many other systems that numerically exhibit global families.</description>

      <title>Convergence and consensus analysis of a class of best-response opinion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opinion dynamics aims to understand how individuals' opinions evolve through local interactions. Recently, opinion dynamics have been modeled as network games, where individuals update their opinions in order to minimize the social pressure caused by disagreeing with others. In this paper, we study a class of best response opinion dynamics introduced by Mei et al., where a parameter $\alpha &gt; 0$ controls the marginal cost of opinion differences, bridging well-known mechanisms such as the DeGroot model ($\alpha = 2$) and the weighted-median model ($\alpha = 1$). We conduct theoretical analysis on how different values of $\alpha$ affect the system's convergence and consensus behavior. For the case when $\alpha &gt; 1$, corresponding to increasing marginal costs, we establish the convergence of the dynamics and derive graph-theoretic conditions for consensus formation, which is proved to be similar to those in the DeGroot model. When $\alpha &lt; 1$, we show via a counterexample that convergence is not always guaranteed, and we provide sufficient conditions for convergence and consensus. Additionally, numerical simulations on small-world networks reveal how network structure and $\alpha$ together affect opinion diversity.</description>

      <title>Invariant sets for homeomorphisms of hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that under some assumptions on how points escape to infinity in the universal cover, homeomorphisms of hyperbolic 3-manifolds are forced to have several invariant sets (in particular, they cannot be minimal). For this, we use some shadowing techniques which, when the homeomorphism has positive speed with respect to a uniform foliation, allow us to obtain strong consequences on the structure of the invariant sets. We discuss also homological rotation sets and end the paper with some extensions to other manifolds as well as posing some general problems for the understanding of minimal homeomorphisms of 3-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Asymptoticity, automorphism groups and strong orbit equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given any strong orbit equivalence class of minimal Cantor systems, and any cardinal smaller than or equal to the continuum, we show that there exists a minimal subshift within the given class whose number of asymptotic components is exactly the given cardinal. For finite or countable ones, we explicitly construct such examples using $\mathcal{S}$-adic subshifts. We derived the uncountable case by showing that any topological dynamical system with countably many asymptotic components has zero topological entropy. We also deduce that within any strong orbit equivalence class, there exists a subshift whose automorphism group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>On the commensurating full group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new Polish group, called the commensurating full group, associated to an ergodic measure-class preserving transformation of a standard atomless probability space. It is an analogue of the $\rm L^1$ full group defined by Le Ma\^itre, which does not need the transformation to preserve a measure to be defined. We prove, among others, that it is a complete invariant of flip conjugacy, and that it is quasi-isometric to the line in the sense of Rosendal.</description>

      <title>Shannon Weights for binary dynamical recurrent sources of zero entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A probabilistic source is defined as the set of infinite words (over a given denumerable alphabet) endowed with a probability $\mu$. The paper deals with general binary sources where the distribution of any symbol (0 or 1) may depend on an unbounded part of the previous history. The paper studies Shannon weights: whereas the classical Shannon entropy ${\cal E}_{\mu}$ is the average amount of information brought by one symbol of the emitted word, the Shannon weight sequence deals with the average amount of information $m_{\mu}(n)$ that is brought by the emitted prefix of length $n$. For a source with a non zero entropy, the estimate $m_{\mu}(n)\sim{\cal E}_{\mu} \cdot n$ thus holds. The paper considers the model of dynamical sources, where a source word isemitted as an encoded trajectory of a dynamical system of the unit interval, when endowed with probability $\mu$. It focus on sources with zero entropy and gives explicit constructions for sources whose Shannon weight sequence satisfies $m_{\mu}(n)=o(n)$, with a prescribed behaviour. In this case, sources with zero entropy lead to dynamical systems built on maps with an indifferent fixed point. This class notably contains the celebrated Farey source, which presents well-known intermittency phenomena. Methods are based on analytic combinatorics and generating functions, and they are enlarged, in the present dynamical case, with dynamical systems tools (mainly transfer operators).</description>

      <title>Non-Birkhoff periodic orbits in symmetric billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-Birkhoff periodic orbits in symmetric convex planar billiards. Our main result provides a quantitative criterion for the existence of such orbits with prescribed minimal period, rotation number, and spatiotemporal symmetry. We exploit this criterion to find sufficient conditions for a symmetric billiard to possess infinitely many non-Birkhoff periodic orbits. It follows that arbitrarily small analytical perturbations of the circular billiard have non-Birkhoff periodic orbits of any rational rotation number and with arbitrarily long periods. We also generalize a known result for elliptical billiards to other $\mathbb{D}_2$-symmetric billiards. Lastly, we provide Matlab codes which can be used to numerically compute and visualize the non-Birkhoff periodic orbits whose existence we prove analytically.</description>

      <title>Averaging principle for rough slow-fast systems of level 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The averaging principle for slow-fast systems of various kind of stochastic (partial) differential equations has been extensively studied. An analogous result was shown for slow-fast systems of rough differential equations driven by random rough paths a few years ago and the study of ``rough slow-fast systems" seems to be gaining momentum now. In all known results, however, the driving rough paths are of level 2. In this paper we formulate rough slow-fast systems driven by random rough paths of level 3 and prove the strong averaging principle of Khas'minskii-type.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling of Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infection: Human-Animal Dynamics with Environmental Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, one of the most prevalent neglected tropical diseases, pose a significant threat to public health in tropical and subtropical areas. These parasites infect humans and animals through direct contact with contaminated soil or accidental ingestion. This study examines the dynamics of STH transmission using a deterministic compartmental model and nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Our model incorporates the roles humans, animals, and the environment play as reservoirs for spreading STH. We derived the basic reproduction number and demonstrate that the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points are asymptotically stable under specific thresholds. We also performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how each parameter affects the model's output. The sensitivity analysis identifies key parameters influencing infection rates, such as ingestion rate, disease progression rate, and shedding rate, all of which increase infection. Conversely, higher clearance and recovery rates decrease infection. The study also highlights the potential for cross-species transmission of STH infections between humans and animals, underscoring the One Health concept, which acknowledges the interdependence of human, animal, and environmental health.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation analysis of an opinion dynamics model coupled with an environmental dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an opinion dynamics model coupled with an environmental dynamics. Based on a forward invariance argument, we can simplify the analysis of the asymptotic behavior to the case when all the opinions in the social network are synchronized. Our goal is to emphasize the role of the trust given to the environmental signal in the asymptotic behavior of the opinion dynamics and implicitly of the coupled system. To do that, we conduct a bifurcation analysis of the system around the origin when the trust parameter is varying. Specific conditions are presented for both pitchfork and Hopf bifurcation. Numerical illustration completes the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>On the small boundary property and $\mathcal Z$-absorption, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a minimal and free topological dynamical system $(X, \mathbb Z^d)$. It is shown that zero mean dimension of $(X, \mathbb Z^d)$ is characterized by $\mathcal Z$-absorption of the crossed product C*-algebra $A=\mathrm{C}(X) \rtimes \mathbb Z^d$, where $\mathcal Z$ is the Jiang-Su algebra. In fact, among other conditions, the following are shown to be equivalent:
  (1) $(X, \mathbb Z^d)$ has the small boundary property.
  (2) $A \cong A \otimes \mathcal Z$.
  (3) $A$ has uniform property $\Gamma$.
  (4) $l^\infty(A)/J_{2, \omega, \mathrm{T}(A)}$ has real rank zero.
  The same statement also holds for unital simple AH algebras with diagonal maps.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every $C^2$ conservative partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism of a closed 3-manifold without periodic points is ergodic, which gives an affirmative answer to the Ergodicity Conjecture by Hertz-Hertz-Ures in the absence of periodic points. We also show that a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism of a closed 3-manifold $M$ with no periodic points is accessible if the non-wandering set is all of $M$ and the fundamental group $\pi_1(M)$ is not virtually solvable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified approach to the classical Hopf Decomposition (also known as the conservative--dissipative decomposition) for actions of locally compact second countable groups. While the decomposition is well understood for free actions of countable groups, the extension to general actions requires new techniques and structural insights, particularly concerning recurrence and transience, cocycle behavior, and the structure of stabilizers. We establish several new characterizations and prove a structure theorem for totally dissipative actions, generalizing Krengel's classical result for flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study of properties within one dimensional dynamics, the assumption of a negative Schwarzian derivative has been shown to be very useful. However, this condition may seem somewhat arbitrary, as it is not inherently a dynamical condition, except for the fact that it is preserved under iteration. In this brief work, we show that the negative Schwarzian derivative condition is not arbitrary in any sense but is instead strictly related to the fulfillment of the Minimum Principle for the derivative of the map and its iterates, which plays a key role in the proof of Singer's Theorem.</description>

      <title>Data assimilation for networks of coupled oscillators: Inferring unknown model parameters from partial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring the state and unknown parameters of a network of coupled oscillators is of utmost importance. This task is made harder when only partial and noisy observations are available, which is a typical scenario in realistic high-dimensional systems. The general task of inference falls under data assimilation, and a commonly used assimilation method is the Ensemble Kalman Filter. Employing network-specific localization of the forecast covariance, an Ensemble Kalman Filter with state space augmentation is shown to yield highly accurate estimates of both the oscillator phases and unknown model parameters in the case where only a subset of oscillator phases are observed. In contrast, standard data assimilation methods yield poor results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for Kuramoto oscillators and for networks of theta neurons, using a variety of network topologies.</description>

Abstract: A structure-preserving kernel ridge regression method is presented that allows the recovery of nonlinear Hamiltonian functions out of datasets made of noisy observations of Hamiltonian vector fields. The method proposes a closed-form solution that yields excellent numerical performances that surpass other techniques proposed in the literature in this setup. From the methodological point of view, the paper extends kernel regression methods to problems in which loss functions involving linear functions of gradients are required and, in particular, a differential reproducing property and a Representer Theorem are proved in this context. The relation between the structure-preserving kernel estimator and the Gaussian posterior mean estimator is analyzed. A full error analysis is conducted that provides convergence rates using fixed and adaptive regularization parameters. The good performance of the proposed estimator together with the convergence rate is illustrated with various numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>On the small boundary property, $\mathcal Z$-absorption, and Bauer simplexes</title>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact metrizable space, and let $\Delta$ be a closed set of Borel probability measures on $X$. We study the small boundary property of the pair $(X, \Delta)$. In particular, it is shown that $(X, \Delta)$ has the small boundary property if it has a restricted version of property Gamma.
  As an application, it is shown that, if $A$ is the crossed product C*-algebra $\mathrm{C}(X)\rtimes\mathbb Z^d$, where $(X, \mathbb Z^d)$ is a free minimal topological dynamical system, or if $A$ is an AH algebra with diagonal maps, then, $A$ is $\mathcal Z$-stable if the set of extreme tracial states is compact, regardless of its dimension.</description>

      <title>Singularity, weighted uniform approximation, intersections and rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15607</link>

Abstract: A classical argument was introduced by Khintchine in 1926 in order to exhibit the existence of totally irrational singular linear forms in two variables. This argument was subsequently revisited and extended by many authors. For instance, in 1959 Jarnik used it to show that for $n \geq 2$ and for any non-increasing positive $f$ there are totally irrational matrices $A \in M_{m,n}({\mathbb R})$ such that for all large enough $t$ there are $\mathbf{p} \in {\mathbb Z}^m, \mathbf{q} \in {\mathbb Z}^n \smallsetminus \{0\}$ with $$\|\mathbf{q}\| \leq t \ \text{ and } \ \|A \mathbf{q} - \mathbf{p}\| \leq f(t).$$ We denote the collection of such matrices by $\mathrm{UA}^*_{m,n}(f)$. We adapt Khintchine's argument to show that the sets $\mathrm{UA}^*_{m,n}(f)$, and their weighted analogues $\mathrm{UA}^*_{m,n}(f, \mathbf{w})$, intersect many manifolds and fractals, and have strong intersection properties. For example, we show that:
  When $n \geq 2$, the set $\bigcap_{\mathbf{w}} \mathrm{UA}^*(f, \mathbf{w}) $, where the intersection is over all weights $\mathbf{w}$, is nonempty, and moreover intesects many manifolds and fractals;
  For $n \geq 2$, there are vectors in ${\mathbb R}^n$ which are simultaneously $k$-singular for every $k$, in the sense of Yu;
  when $n \geq 3$, $\mathrm{UA}^*_{1,n}(f) + \mathrm{UA}^*_{1,n}(f) = {\mathbb R}^n$.
  We also obtain new bounds on the rate of singularity which can be attained by column vectors in analytic submanifolds of dimension at least 2 in ${\mathbb R}^n$.</description>
