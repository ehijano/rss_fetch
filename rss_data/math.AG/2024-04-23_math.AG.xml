      <title>Equivariant Algebraic K-Theory and Derived completions II: the case of Equivariant Homotopy K-Theory and Equivariant K-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the mid 1980s, while working on establishing completion theorems for equivariant Algebraic K-Theory similar to the well-known Atiyah-Segal completion theorem for equivariant topological K-theory, the late Robert Thomason found the strong finiteness conditions that are required in such theorems to be too restrictive. Then he made a conjecture on the existence of a completion theorem in the sense of Atiyah and Segal for equivariant Algebraic G-theory, for actions of linear algebraic groups on schemes that holds without any of the strong finiteness conditions that are required in such theorems proven by him, and also appearing in the original Atiyah-Segal theorem. In an earlier work by the first two authors, we solved this conjecture by providing a derived completion theorem for equivariant G-theory. In the present paper, we provide a similar derived completion theorem for the homotopy Algebraic K-theory of equivariant perfect complexes, on schemes that need not be regular.
  Our solution is broad enough to allow actions by all linear algebraic groups, irrespective of whether they are connected or not, and acting on any normal quasi-projective scheme of finite type over a field, irrespective of whether they are regular or projective. This allows us therefore to consider the Equivariant Homotopy Algebraic K-Theory of large classes of varieties like all toric varieties (for the action of a torus) and all spherical varieties (for the action of a reductive group). With finite coefficients invertible in the base fields, we are also able to obtain such derived completion theorems for equivariant algebraic K-theory but with respect to actions of diagonalizable group schemes. These enable us to obtain a wide range of applications, several of which are also explored.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Algebraic K-Theory and Derived completions III: Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we discuss applications of the derived completion theorems proven in our previous two papers. One of the main applications is to Riemann-Roch problems for forms of higher equivariant K-theory, which we are able to establish in great generality both for equivariant G-theory and equivariant homotopy K-theory with respect to actions of linear algebraic groups on normal quasi-projective schemes over a given field. We show such Riemann-Roch theorems apply to all toric and spherical varieties.
  We also obtain Lefschetz-Riemann-Roch theorems involving the fixed point schemes with respect to actions of diagonalizable group schemes. We also show the existence of certain spectral sequences that compute the homotopy groups of the derived completions of equivariant G-theory starting with equivariant Borel-Moore motivic cohomology.</description>

      <title>Chow trace of 1-motives and the Lang-N\'eron groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in the case of primary field extensions, the extension of scalars of Deligne $1$-motives admits a left adjoint, called Chow image, and a right adjoint, called Chow trace. This generalizes Chow's results on abelian varieties. Then we study the Chow trace in the framework of Voevodsky's triangulated categories of (\'etale) motives. With respect to the $1$-motivic $t$-structure on the category of Voevodsky's homological $1$-motives, the zero-th direct image of an abelian variety is given by the Chow trace, and the first direct image is the $0$-motive defined by the (geometric) Lang-N\'eron group.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Pseudostable Hodge Integrals and Mumford's Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the relationship between quadratic Hodge classes on moduli spaces of pseudostable and stable curves given by the contraction morphism $\mathcal{T}.$ While Mumford relations do not hold in the pseudostable case, we show that one can express the (pullback via $\mathcal{T}$ of the) Chern classes of $\mathbb{E}\oplus \mathbb{E}^\vee$ solely in terms of descendants and strata classes. We organize the combinatorial structure of the pullback of products of two pseudostable $\lambda$ classes and obtain an explicit comparison of arbitrary pseudostable and stable quadratic Hodge integrals.</description>

      <title>Filtered Stokes G-local Systems in Nonabelian Hodge Theory on Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the wild nonabelian Hodge correspondence on curves, filtered Stokes G-local systems are regarded as the objects on the Betti side. In this paper, we demonstrate a construction of the moduli space of them, called the Betti moduli space, it will reduce to the wild character variety when the Betti weights are trivial. We study some particular examples including Eguchi-Hanson space and the Airy equation together with the corresponding moduli spaces. Furthermore, we provide a proof of the correspondence among irregular singular G-connections, Stokes G-local systems, and Stokes G-representations to fill a gap in the literature. This correspondence can be viewed as the G-version of irregular Rieman-Hilbert correspondence on curves.</description>

Abstract: Cayley and Oguiso have constructed certain quartic K3 surfaces $S$, with automorphisms $g$ of infinite order. We show that when $g$ is symplectic (resp. anti-symplectic), it acts as the identity (resp. minus the identity) on the degree zero part of the Chow group of zero-cycles of $S$.</description>

Abstract: In this short note we prove two projectivity criteria for fibrations between mildly singular compact K\"ahler spaces. They are the relative versions of the celebrated criteria of Kodaira and Moishezon. As an application we obtain that the MRC fibration always has a model that is a projective morphism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g$ over a field $K$ of characteristic zero. After extending $K$ we can view it as a marked curve with its $2g+2$ Weierstrass points. We present an explicit algorithm to compute the stable reduction of this marked curve for a valuation of residue characteristic $2$ over a finite extension of $K$. In the cases $g\le2$ we work out relatively simple conditions for the structure of this reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define arroids as an abstract axiom set encoding the intersection properties of arrangements of curves. The tropicalization of the complement of arrangement of curves meeting pairwise transversely is shown to be determined by the associated arroid. We give conditions for when the cohomology of the complement of an arrangement is computable using tropical cohomology, and we give criteria for when the complement is a maximal variety in terms of tropical geometry.</description>

      <title>Separation of variables for Hitchin systems with the structure group $SO(4)$, on genus two curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sets of points giving spectral curves can be regarded as phase coordinates of Hitchin systems. We address the problem of finding out trajectories of Hitchin systems in those coordinates. The problem is being solved for the systems with structure groups $SO(4)$ and $SL(2)$ on genus 2 curves. Our method is a transfer of straight line windings of fibers of the Hitchin map, which are given by Prymians of the spectral curves for the systems with simple classical structure groups. The transfer is carried out by means of an analog of the Jacobi inversion map, which does not exist for Prymians in general but can be defined in the two cases in question.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is focused on the investigation of the algebraic complete integrability (a.c.i) of the Toda lattice associated with the twisted affine Lie algebra (a_4^{\left(2\right)}). First, we prove that the generic fiber of the momentum map for this system is an affine part of an abelian surface. Second, we show that the flows of integrable vector fields on this surface are linear. Finally, using the formal Laurent solutions of the system, we provide a detailed geometric description of these abelian surfaces and the divisor at infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of understanding whether two given function fields are isomorphic is well-known to be difficult, particularly when the aim is to prove that an isomorphism does not exist. In this paper we investigate a family of maximal function fields that arise as Galois subfields of the Hermitian function field. We compute the automorphism group, the Weierstrass semigroup at some special rational places and the isomorphism classes of such function fields. In this way, we show that often these function fields provide in fact examples of maximal function fields with the same genus, the same automorphism group, but that are not isomorphic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.02247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a theory of Becker-Gottlieb transfer based on Spanier-Whitehead duality that holds in both the motivic and \'etale settings for smooth quasi-projective varieties in as broad a context as possible: for example, for varieties over non-separably closed fields in all characteristics, and also for both the \'etale and motivic settings.
  In view of the fact that the most promising applications of the traditional Becker-Gottlieb transfer has been to torsors and Borel-style equivariant cohomology theories, we focus our applications to motivic cohomology theories for torsors as well as Borel-style equivariant motivic cohomology theories, both defined with respect to motivic spectra. We obtain several results in this direction, including a stable splitting in generalized motivic cohomology theories. Various further applications will be discussed in forthcoming papers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.02249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, which is a continuation of earlier work by the first author and Gunnar Carlsson, one of the first results we establish is the additivity of the motivic Becker-Gottlieb transfer, as well as their \'etale realizations. This extends the additivity results the authors already established for the corresponding traces. We then apply this to derive several important consequences: for example, in addition to obtaining the analogues of various double coset formulae known in the classical setting of algebraic topology, we also obtain applications to Brauer groups of homogeneous spaces associated to reductive groups over separably closed fields. We also consider the relationship between the transfer on schemes provided with a compatible action by a $1$-parameter subgroup and the transfer associated to the fixed point scheme of the $1$-parameter subgroup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.02471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I discuss mirrors of Landau-Ginzburg models formed by a minimal semisimple adjoint orbit of $\mathfrak{sl}(n)$ together with a potential obtained via the Cartan-Killing form. I show that the Landau-Ginzburg models produced by the Gross-Siebert recipe give precisely the objects of the desired mirrors.
  It is known that Landau-Ginzburg model $LG(2)$ over the semisimple adjoint orbit of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ does not have projective mirrors. I prove Homological Mirror Symmetry for $LG(2)$ by constructing a Landau-Ginzburg mirror and showing that its Orlov category of singularities is equivalent to $Fuk(LG(2))$.</description>

      <title>Filtrations on the globalization of twisted D-modules over Dedekind schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fabian Januszewski and the author established the theory of twisted D-modules over general base schemes. In this short note, we construct a $K$-invariant positive exhaustive filtration on the globalization of the twisted D-module on a smooth quasi-compact $K$-scheme over a Dedekind scheme $S$ obtained by the direct image of a $K$-equivariant twisted integrable connection along a $K$-equivariant closed immersion from a smooth proper $K$-scheme $Y$ with $K$ a smooth $S$-affine group scheme, whose $p$th associated graded $\mathcal{O}_S$-module is locally free of finite rank for every integer $p$. In particular, the $k$-module of its global sections is projective if $S$ is affine with coordinate ring $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.02800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\bar{\mathcal{M}}_{g, m|n}$ denote Hassett's moduli space of weighted pointed stable curves of genus $g$ for the heavy/light weight data $\left(1^{(m)}, 1/n^{(n)}\right)$, and let $\mathcal{M}_{g, m|n} \subset \bar{\mathcal{M}}_{g, m|n}$ be the locus parameterizing smooth, not necessarily distinctly marked curves. We give a change-of-variables formula which computes the generating function for $(S_m\times S_n)$-equivariant Hodge-Deligne polynomials of these spaces in terms of the generating functions for $S_{n}$-equivariant Hodge-Deligne polynomials of $\bar{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of quartic surfaces and Cremona transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of determining which automorphisms of a smooth quartic surface $S \subset \mathbb{P}^3$ are induced by a Cremona transformation of $\mathbb{P}^3$. We provide the first steps towards a complete solution of this problem when $\rho(S)=2$. In particular, we give several examples of quartics whose automorphism groups are generated by involutions, but no non-trivial automorphism is induced by a Cremona transformation of $\mathbb{P}^3$, giving a negative answer for Oguiso's question of whether every automorphism of finite order of a smooth quartic surface $S\subset \mathbb{P}^3$ is induced by a Cremona transformation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we give a purely algebraic approach to the contraction group scheme predicted by Bernstein--Higson--Subag and constructed by Barbasch--Higson--Subag. We also compare quotient schemes of contraction group schemes with other related schemes, equipped with actions of contraction group schemes in the cases of symmetric and $\theta$-stable parabolic subgroups.</description>

      <title>Weak weak approximation and the Hilbert property for degree-two del Pezzo surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that del Pezzo surfaces of degree $2$ over a field $k$ satisfy weak weak approximation if $k$ is a number field and the Hilbert property if $k$ is Hilbertian of characteristic zero, provided that they contain a $k$-rational point lying neither on any $4$ of the $56$ exceptional curves nor on the ramification divisor of the anticanonical morphism. This builds upon results of Manin, Salgado--Testa--V\'arilly-Alvarado, and Festi--van Luijk on the unirationality of such surfaces, and upon work of the first two authors verifying weak weak approximation under the assumption of a conic fibration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show an equivalence between the two categories in the title, thus establishing a link between Frobenius-linear objects of formal (schematic) and analytic (adic) nature. We will do this for arbitrary p-complete rings, arbitrary affine-flat group schemes and without making use of the Frobenius structure. As a possible application, we take a look at prismatic cohomology of K3-surfaces and complete intersections of projective space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an expression for the Smith-Thom deficiency of the Hilbert square $X^{[2]}$ of a smooth real algebraic variety $X$ in terms of the rank of a suitable Mayer-Vietoris mapping in several situations. As a consequence, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the maximality of $X^{[2]}$ in the case of projective complete intersections, and show that with a few exceptions no real nonsingular projective complete intersection of even dimension has maximal Hilbert square. We also provide new examples of smooth real algebraic varieties with maximal Hilbert square.</description>

      <title>Moving curves of least gonality on symmetric products of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a sequel of arXiv:2208.00990. Let $C$ be a smooth complex projective curve of genus $g$ and let $C^{(k)}$ be its $k$-fold symmetric product. The covering gonality of $C^{(k)}$ is the least gonality of an irreducible curve $E\subset C^{(k)}$ passing through a general point of $C^{(k)}$. It follows from previous works of the authors that if $2\leq k\leq 4$ and $g\geq k+4$, the covering gonality of $C^{(k)}$ equals the gonality of $C$. In this paper, we prove that under mild assumptions of generality on $C$, the only curves $E\subset C^{(k)}$ computing the covering gonality of $C^{(k)}$ are copies of $C$ of the form $C+p$, for some point $p\in C^{(k-1)}$. As a byproduct, we deduce that the connecting gonality of $C^{(k)}$ (i.e. the least gonality of an irreducible curve $E\subset C^{(k)}$ connecting two general points of $C^{(k)}$) is strictly larger than the covering gonality.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a recipe for B-model computation of genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau and Fano Projective Hypersurfaces. Our formalism can be applied equally to both Calabi-Yau and Fano cases. In Calabi-Yau case, drastic cancellation of terms used in our formalism occurs and it results in another representation of BCOV-Zinger formula for projective Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>The product of simple modules over KLR algebras and quiver Grassmannians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.08244v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the product of two simple modules over KLR algebras using the quiver Grassmannians for Dynkin quivers. More precisely, we establish a bridge between the Induction functor on the category of modules of KLR algebras and the irreducible components of quiver Grassmannians for Dynkin quivers via a sort of extension varieties, which is an analogue of the extension group in Hall algebras. As a result, we give a necessary condition when the product of two simple modules over a KLR algebra is simple using the set of irreducible components of quiver Grassmannians. In particular, in some special cases, we provide a proof for the conjecture recently proposed by Lapid and Minguez.</description>

Abstract: For any $d\ge 4$, by deformation theory of schemes, we present examples of (complete or excellent) $d$-dimensional mixed characteristic normal local domains admitting no small Cohen-Macaulay algebra, but admitting instances of small (maximal) Cohen-Macaulay modules. It is also shown that a graded normal domain over a field whose Proj is an Abelian variety admits a graded small (maximal) Cohen-Macaulay module.</description>

      <title>Ring of invariants of an exponential map of a polynomial ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field of arbitrary characteristic. We prove the following: (1) Let $B=k^{[3]}$ and $\delta \in \mathrm{EXP}(B)$ be non-trivial. If the plinth ideal $(\mathrm{pl} (\delta))$ contains a quasi-basic element, then the ring of invariants ($B^{\delta}$) is $k^{[2]}$. (2) Let $B=k^{[n]}$ and $\delta \in \mathrm{EXP}(B)$ be a triangular exponential map. If the ring of invariants ($B^{\delta}$) is an affine $k$-algebra, then $B^{\delta}$ is non-rigid.
  Using a different approach, we prove a stronger version of (2) for triangular derivations of $k^{[n]}$ when the characteristic of $k$ is zero. We prove the following results for a $k$-domain $R$ when the characteristic of $k$ is zero: (1) The kernel of any triangular $R$-derivation of $R^{[n]}$ is non-rigid. (2) The kernel of any linear locally nilpotent $R$-derivation of $R^{[n]}$ is non-rigid.</description>

      <title>Symmetric varieties for endoscopic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a quasi-split reductive group $G$ and a symmetric variety $X$, we introduce a notion of endoscopic varieties for $(G,X)$, and establish the foundational properties of these varieties such as matching of stable semi-simple orbits. To do this, we introduce certain automorphism groups of homogeneous spherical varieties, which encode the fine rational structure needed to work over non-algebraically closed fields. In particular, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding symmetric varieties under a mild restriction of the characteristic of the field of definition. We conjecture that this construction plays a role analogous to endoscopic groups in the context of the relative trace formula. As evidence, we show how our construction gives a pre-stabilization of regular elliptic terms of relative trace formulae for many pairs $(G,X)$.
  When the cotangent bundle of the symmetric variety is hyperspherical, we relate our theory to the Hamiltonian variety of the Langlands dual group introduced by Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis, and Venkatesh, proving some structural conjectures for this variety in the symmetric setting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the set of (real Dolbeault classes of) balanced metrics $\Theta$ on a balanced manifold $X$ with respect to which a torsion-free coherent sheaf $\mathcal{E}$ on $X$ is slope stable. We prove that the set of all such $[\Theta] \in H^{n - 1,n - 1}(X,\mathbb{R})$ is an open convex cone locally defined by a finite number of linear inequalities.
  When $\mathcal{E}$ is a Hermitian vector bundle, the Kobayashi--Hitchin correspondence provides associated Hermitian Yang--Mills connections, which we show depend continuously on the metric, even around classes with respect to which $\mathcal{E}$ is only semi-stable. In this case, the holomorphic structure induced by the connection is the holomorphic structure of the associated graded object. The method relies on semi-stable perturbation techniques for geometric PDEs with a moment map interpretation and is quite versatile, and we hope that it can be used in other similar problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple, simply-connected complex algebraic group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, and $G/B$ the associated complete flag variety. The Hochschild cohomology $HH^\bullet(G/B)$ is a geometric invariant of the flag variety related to its generalized deformation theory and has the structure of a $\mathfrak{g}$-module. We study this invariant via representation-theoretic methods; in particular, we give a complete list of irreducible subrepresentations in $HH^\bullet(G/B)$ when $G=SL_n(\mathbb{C})$ or is of exceptional type (and conjecturally for all types) along with nontrivial lower bounds on their multiplicities. These results follow from a conjecture due to Kostant on the structure of the tensor product representation $V(\rho) \otimes V(\rho)$.</description>
