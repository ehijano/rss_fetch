      <title>Evolutionary dynamics with random payoff matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty, characterised by randomness and stochasticity, is ubiquitous in applications of evolutionary game theory across various fields, including biology, economics and social sciences. The uncertainty may arise from various sources such as fluctuating environments, behavioural errors or incomplete information. Incorporating uncertainty into evolutionary models is essential for enhancing their relevance to real-world problems. In this perspective article, we survey the relevant literature on evolutionary dynamics with random payoff matrices, with an emphasis on continuous models. We also pose challenging open problems for future research in this important area.</description>

      <title>Estimating the epidemic threshold under individual vaccination behaviour and adaptive social connections: A game-theoretic complex network model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information dissemination intricately intertwines with the dynamics of infectious diseases in the contemporary interconnected world. Recognizing the critical role of public awareness, individual vaccination choices appear to be an essential factor in collective efforts against emerging health threats. This study aims to characterize disease transmission dynamics under evolving social connections, information sharing, and individual vaccination decisions. To address this important problem, we present an integrated behaviour-prevalence model on an adaptive multiplex network. While the physical layer (layer-II) focuses on disease transmission under vaccination, the virtual layer (layer-I), representing individuals' social contacts, is adaptive and deals with information dissemination, resulting in the dynamics of vaccination choice in a socially influenced environment. Utilizing the microscopic Markov Chain Method (MMCM), we derive analytical expressions of the epidemic threshold for populations with different levels of perceived vaccine risk. It indicates that the adaptive nature of social contacts contributes to the higher epidemic threshold compared to non-adaptive scenarios, and numerical simulations also support that. The network topology, such as the power-law exponent of a scale-free network, also significantly influences the spreading of infections in the network population. We also observe that vaccine uptake increases proportionately with the number of individuals with a higher perceived infection risk or a higher sensitivity of an individual to their non-vaccinated neighbours. As a result, our findings provide insights for public health officials in developing vaccination programs in light of the evolution of social connections, information dissemination, and vaccination choice in the digital era.</description>

      <title>On the study of the limit cycles for a class of population models with time-varying factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of population models with time-varying factors, represented by one-dimensional piecewise smooth autonomous differential equations.
  We provide several derivative formulas in "discrete" form for the Poincar\'{e} map of such equations, and establish a criterion for the existence of limit cycles.
  These two tools, together with the known ones, are then combined in a preliminary procedure that can provide a simple and unified way to analyze the equations.
  As an application, we prove that a general model of single species with seasonal constant-yield harvesting can only possess at most two limit cycles, which improves the work of Xiao in 2016.
  We also apply our results to a general model described by the Abel equations with periodic step function coefficients, showing that its maximum number of limit cycles, is three.
  Finally, a population suppression model for mosquitos considered by Yu and Li in 2020 and Zheng et al. in 2021 is studied using our approach.</description>

      <title>The exact travelling wave solutions of a KPP equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the exact analytical traveling wave solutions of the Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov equation with the reaction term belonging to the class of functions, which includes that of the (generalized) Fisher equation, for the particular values of the waves speed. The solutions are written in terms of elementary functions.</description>

      <title>Evolution with Opponent-Learning Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The universe involves many independent co-learning agents as an ever-evolving part of our observed environment. Yet, in practice, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) applications are usually constrained to small, homogeneous populations and remain computationally intensive. In this paper, we study how large heterogeneous populations of learning agents evolve in normal-form games. We show how, under assumptions commonly made in the multi-armed bandit literature, Multi-Agent Policy Gradient closely resembles the Replicator Dynamic, and we further derive a fast, parallelizable implementation of Opponent-Learning Awareness tailored for evolutionary simulations. This enables us to simulate the evolution of very large populations made of heterogeneous co-learning agents, under both naive and advanced learning strategies. We demonstrate our approach in simulations of 200,000 agents, evolving in the classic games of Hawk-Dove, Stag-Hunt, and Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each game highlights distinct ways in which Opponent-Learning Awareness affects evolution.</description>

      <title>Life at low Reynolds number isn't such a drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The following is an unedited version of two short articles that are forthcoming in Nature Chemical Engineering. Inspired by Purcell's classic lecture "Life at low Reynolds number", I discuss how scaling arguments, dimensional analysis, and fundamental concepts from chemical engineering science can be used to quantitatively describe microbial swimming -- thereby helping to better understand biological systems and inspiring new engineering advances in turn.</description>
