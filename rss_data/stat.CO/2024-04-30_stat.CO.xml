      <title>Fast Adaptive Fourier Integration for Spectral Densities of Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The specification of a covariance function is of paramount importance when employing Gaussian process models, but the requirement of positive definiteness severely limits those used in practice. Designing flexible stationary covariance functions is, however, straightforward in the spectral domain, where one needs only to supply a positive and symmetric spectral density. In this work, we introduce an adaptive integration framework for efficiently and accurately evaluating covariance functions and their derivatives at irregular locations directly from \textit{any} continuous, integrable spectral density. In order to make this approach computationally tractable, we employ high-order panel quadrature, the nonuniform fast Fourier transform, and a Nyquist-informed panel selection heuristic, and derive novel algebraic truncation error bounds which are used to monitor convergence. As a result, we demonstrate several orders of magnitude speedup compared to naive uniform quadrature approaches, allowing us to evaluate covariance functions from slowly decaying, singular spectral densities at millions of locations to a user-specified tolerance in seconds on a laptop. We then apply our methodology to perform gradient-based maximum likelihood estimation using a previously numerically infeasible long-memory spectral model for wind velocities below the atmospheric boundary layer.</description>

      <title>Variational approximations of possibilistic inferential models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferential models (IMs) offer reliable, data-driven, possibilistic statistical inference. But despite IMs' theoretical/foundational advantages, efficient computation in applications is a major challenge. This paper presents a simple and apparently powerful Monte Carlo-driven strategy for approximating the IM's possibility contour, or at least its $\alpha$-level set for a specified $\alpha$. Our proposal utilizes a parametric family that, in a certain sense, approximately covers the credal set associated with the IM's possibility measure, which is reminiscent of variational approximations now widely used in Bayesian statistics.</description>

      <title>Sparse Interaction Neighborhood Selection for Markov Random Fields via Reversible Jump and Pseudoposteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.05933v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the interacting neighborhood of a Markov Random Field model with finite support and homogeneous pairwise interactions based on relative positions of a two-dimensional lattice. Using a Bayesian framework, we propose a Reversible Jump Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm that jumps across subsets of a maximal range neighborhood, allowing us to perform model selection based on a marginal pseudoposterior distribution of models. To show the strength of our proposed methodology we perform a simulation study and apply it to a real dataset from a discrete texture image analysis.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bayesian data selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are many issues that can cause problems when attempting to infer model parameters from data. Data and models are both imperfect, and as such there are multiple scenarios in which standard methods of inference will lead to misleading conclusions; corrupted data, models which are only representative of subsets of the data, or multiple regions in which the model is best fit using different parameters. Methods exist for the exclusion of some anomalous types of data, but in practice, data cleaning is often undertaken by hand before attempting to fit models to data. In this work, we will employ hierarchical Bayesian data selection; the simultaneous inference of both model parameters, and parameters which represent our belief that each observation within the data should be included in the inference. The aim, within a Bayesian setting, is to find the regions of observation space for which the model can well-represent the data, and to find the corresponding model parameters for those regions. A number of approaches will be explored, and applied to test problems in linear regression, and to the problem of fitting an ODE model, approximated by a finite difference method. The approaches are simple to implement, can aid mixing of Markov chains designed to sample from the arising densities, and are broadly applicable to many inferential problems.</description>

      <title>A New Class of Realistic Spatio-Temporal Processes with Advection and Their Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traveling phenomena, frequently observed in a variety of scientific disciplines including atmospheric science, seismography, and oceanography, have long suffered from limitations due to lack of realistic statistical modeling tools and simulation methods. Our work primarily addresses this, introducing more realistic and flexible models for spatio-temporal random fields. We break away from the traditional confines of the classic frozen field by either relaxing the assumption of a single deterministic velocity or rethinking the hypothesis regarding the spectrum shape, thus enhancing the realism of our models. While the proposed models stand out for their realism and flexibility, they are also paired with simulation algorithms that are equally or less computationally complex than the commonly used circulant embedding for Gaussian random fields in $\mathbb{R}^{2+1}$. This combination of realistic modeling with efficient simulation methods creates an effective solution for better understanding traveling phenomena.</description>

      <title>Regularized Estimation of Sparse Spectral Precision Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral precision matrix, the inverse of a spectral density matrix, is an object of central interest in frequency-domain analysis of multivariate time series. Estimation of spectral precision matrix is a key step in calculating partial coherency and graphical model selection of stationary time series. When the dimension of a multivariate time series is moderate to large, traditional estimators of spectral density matrices such as averaged periodograms tend to be severely ill-conditioned, and one needs to resort to suitable regularization strategies involving optimization over complex variables.
  In this work, we propose complex graphical Lasso (CGLASSO), an $\ell_1$-penalized estimator of spectral precision matrix based on local Whittle likelihood maximization. We develop fast $\textit{pathwise coordinate descent}$ algorithms for implementing CGLASSO on large dimensional time series data sets. At its core, our algorithmic development relies on a ring isomorphism between complex and real matrices that helps map a number of optimization problems over complex variables to similar optimization problems over real variables. This finding may be of independent interest and more broadly applicable for high-dimensional statistical analysis with complex-valued data. We also present a complete non-asymptotic theory of our proposed estimator which shows that consistent estimation is possible in high-dimensional regime as long as the underlying spectral precision matrix is suitably sparse. We compare the performance of CGLASSO with competing alternatives on simulated data sets, and use it to construct partial coherence network among brain regions from a real fMRI data set.</description>
