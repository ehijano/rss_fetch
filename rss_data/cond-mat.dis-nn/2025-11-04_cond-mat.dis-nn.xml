      <title>Correspondence Between Ising Machines and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computation with the Ising model is central to future computing technologies like quantum annealing, adiabatic quantum computing, and thermodynamic classical computing. Traditionally, computed values have been equated with ground states. This paper generalizes computation with ground states to computation with spin averages, allowing computations to take place at high temperatures. It then introduces a systematic correspondence between Ising devices and neural networks and a simple method to run trained feed-forward neural networks on Ising-type hardware. Finally, a mathematical proof is offered that these implementations are always successful.</description>

      <title>Glass Patterns in Twisted Disordered Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisting and stacking two copies of a 2D crystal can produce a long-wavelength periodic interference pattern known as a moir\'e pattern. Performing the same procedure with an aperiodic structure instead generates a single moir\'e spot at the rotation center, known as a Glass pattern. We explore the implications of these patterns across a variety of models: they allow measurement of microscopic parameters from mesoscopic resistivity measurements; they generate an impurity that modifies the properties of a moir\'e lattice at the rotation center; and they allow for domain formation in amorphous magnets. These results establish Glass patterns as a generic feature of twisted disordered systems and provide a framework for future theoretical and experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>Long-range frustration in Minimal Vertex Cover Problem on random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A vertex cover on a graph is a set of vertices in which each edge of the graph is adjacent to at least one vertex in the set. The Minimal Vertex Cover (MVC) Problem concerns finding vertex covers with a smallest cardinality. The MVC problem is a typical computationally hard problem among combinatorial optimization on graphs, for which both developing fast algorithms to find solution configurations on graph instances and constructing an analytical theory to estimate their ground-state properties prove to be difficult tasks. Here, by considering the long-range frustration (LRF) among MVC configurations and formulating it into a theoretical framework of a percolation model, we analytically estimate the energy density of MVCs on sparse random graphs only with their degree distributions. We test our framework on some typical random graph models. We show that, when there is a percolation of LRF effect in a graph, our predictions of energy densities are slightly higher than those from a hybrid algorithm of greedy leaf removal (GLR) procedure and survey propagation-guided decimation algorithm on graph instances, and there are still clearly closer to the results from the hybrid algorithm than an analytical theory based on GLR procedure, which ignores LRF effect and underestimates energy densities. Our results show that LRF is a proper mechanism in the formation of complex energy landscape of MVC problem and a theoretical framework of LRF helps to characterize its ground-state properties.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of spectral determinants of matrix-valued random Schr\"odinger operators and Dyson Brownian motion in cubic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the moments of $\overline{|\det(H-E)|^q}$ and the associated large deviations of $\log |\det(H-E)|$ where $H$ are random matrix operators involving Laplace operators and random potentials. This includes as a special case Hessians of random elastic manifolds at a generic energy configuration. In one dimension $d=1$ these are $N \times N$ matrix valued random Schr\"odinger operators and $\log | \det(H-E) | $ is the sum of the $N$ associated Lyapunov exponents. Using a mapping to a stochastic matrix Ricatti equation we make a connection between the spectral properties of these operators and the total $N$ particle current of a Dyson Brownian motion (DBM) in a cubic potential. The latter model was studied by Allez and Dumaz [1] who showed that for $N=+\infty$ it exhibits a sharp transition between a phase with non-zero current and a confined (zero current) phase. We compute the barrier-crossing probability of the DBM at large but finite $N$, which gives an estimate of the exponential tail of the average density of states of a matrix Schrodinger operator below the edge of its spectrum. The barrier behaves as $\sim N (-E)^{3/2}$ at large negative energy and vanishes as $\sim N(E^*-E)^{5/4}$ near the edge. For $q=1$ the present work provides an independent derivation of the total complexity of stationary points for an elastic string embedded in $N$ dimension in presence of disorder.</description>

      <title>Binary perceptron computational gap -- a parametric fl RDT view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) likely exhibits the so-called statistical-computational gap characterized with the appearance of two phase transitioning constraint density thresholds: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} the \emph{satisfiability threshold} $\alpha_c$, below/above which ABP succeeds/fails to operate as a storage memory; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}} \emph{algorithmic threshold} $\alpha_a$, below/above which one can/cannot efficiently determine ABP's weight so that it operates as a storage memory.
  We consider a particular parametric utilization of \emph{fully lifted random duality theory} (fl RDT) [85] and study its potential ABP's algorithmic implications. A remarkable structural parametric change is uncovered as one progresses through fl RDT lifting levels. On the first two levels, the so-called $\c$ sequence -- a key parametric fl RDT component -- is of the (natural) decreasing type. A change of such phenomenology on higher levels is then connected to the $\alpha_c$ -- $\alpha_a$ threshold change. Namely, on the second level concrete numerical values give for the critical constraint density $\alpha=\alpha_c\approx 0.8331$. While progressing through higher levels decreases this estimate, already on the fifth level we observe a satisfactory level of convergence and obtain $\alpha\approx 0.7764$. This allows to draw two striking parallels: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} the obtained constraint density estimate is in a remarkable agrement with range $\alpha\in (0.77,0.78)$ of clustering defragmentation (believed to be responsible for failure of locally improving algorithms) [17,88]; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}} the observed change of $\c$ sequence phenomenology closely matches the one of the negative Hopfield model for which the existence of efficient algorithms that closely approach similar type of threshold has been demonstrated recently [87].</description>

      <title>Quantum critical behavior of diluted quasi-one-dimensional Ising chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CoNb$_2$O$_6$ is a unique magnetic material. It features bulk three-dimensional magnetic order at low temperatures, but its quantum critical behavior in a magnetic field is well described by the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising universality class. This behavior is facilitated by the structural arrangement of magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions in nearly isolated zig-zag chains. In this work, we investigate the effect of random site dilution on the critical properties of such a quasi-one-dimensional quantum Ising system. To this end, we introduce an anisotropic site-diluted three-dimensional transverse-field Ising model. We find that site dilution leads to unconventional activated scaling behavior at the quantum phase transition. Interestingly, the critical exponents of the quantum critical point are in good agreement with those of the disordered three-dimensional transverse-field Ising universality class, despite the strong spatial anisotropy. We discuss the generality our findings as well as implications for experiments.</description>

      <title>Spin glass phase at zero temperature in the Edwards-Anderson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04112v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the analysis of mean-field spin glass models has seen tremendous progress in the last twenty years, lattice spin glasses have remained largely intractable. This article presents the solutions to a number of questions about the Edwards-Anderson model of short-range spin glasses (in all dimensions) that were raised in the physics literature many years ago. First, it is shown that the ground state is sensitive to small perturbations of the disorder, in the sense that a small amount of noise gives rise to a new ground state that is nearly orthogonal to the old one with respect to the site overlap inner product. Second, it is shown that one can overturn a macroscopic fraction of the spins in the ground state with an energy cost that is negligible compared to the size of the boundary of the overturned region - a feature that is believed to be typical of spin glasses but clearly absent in ferromagnets. The third result is that the boundary of the overturned region in dimension $d$ has fractal dimension strictly greater than $d-1$, confirming a prediction from physics. The fourth result is that the expected size of the critical droplet of a bond grows at least like a power of the volume. The fifth result is that the correlations between bonds in the ground state can decay at most like the inverse of the distance. This contrasts with the random field Ising model, where it has been shown recently that the correlation decays exponentially in distance in dimension two. Taken together, these results comprise the first mathematical proof of glassy behavior in a short-range spin glass model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall Effect without Chern Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Hall effect was originally observed in a two-dimensional electron gas forming Landau levels when exposed to a strong perpendicular magnetic field and was later generalized to Chern insulators without net magnetization. Here, further extending the realm of the quantum Hall effect, we report on the robust occurrence of an integer quantized transverse conductance at the onset of disorder in a microscopic lattice model, all bands of which are topologically trivial (zero Chern number). We attribute this phenomenon to the energetic separation of nonquantized Berry fluxes within those bands. Adding disorder then nudges the system into a quantum Hall phase from an extended critical regime obtained by placing the Fermi energy within a broad window inside a trivial band. This natural integer-rounding mechanism manifests as the mobility-gap-induced quantization of a nonuniversal Hall conductance. Our results are corroborated by numerical transport simulations and the analysis of two complementary topological markers.</description>

      <title>Is Grokking a Computational Glass Relaxation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding neural network's (NN) generalizability remains a central question in deep learning research. The special phenomenon of grokking, where NNs abruptly generalize long after the training performance reaches a near-perfect level, offers a unique window to investigate the underlying mechanisms of NNs' generalizability. Here we propose an interpretation for grokking by framing it as a computational glass relaxation: viewing NNs as a physical system where parameters are the degrees of freedom and train loss is the system energy, we find memorization process resembles a rapid cooling of liquid into non-equilibrium glassy state at low temperature and the later generalization is like a slow relaxation towards a more stable configuration. This mapping enables us to sample NNs' Boltzmann entropy (states of density) landscape as a function of training loss and test accuracy. Our experiments in transformers on arithmetic tasks suggests that there is NO entropy barrier in the memorization-to-generalization transition of grokking, challenging previous theory that defines grokking as a first-order phase transition. We identify a high-entropy advantage under grokking, an extension of prior work linking entropy to generalizability but much more significant. Inspired by grokking's far-from-equilibrium nature, we develop a toy optimizer WanD based on Wang-landau molecular dynamics, which can eliminate grokking without any constraints and find high-norm generalizing solutions. This provides strictly-defined counterexamples to theory attributing grokking solely to weight norm evolution towards the Goldilocks zone and also suggests new potential ways for optimizer design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban sprawl reshapes cities, yet its quantitative laws remain elusive. Analyzing built-up expansion in 19 cities (1985-2015) with tools from surface growth physics in radial geometry, we reveal anisotropic, branch-like growth and a piecewise linear scaling between area and population. We uncover a robust local roughness exponent $\alpha_{\text{loc}}\approx 0.54$, coexisting with variable $\beta$ and $z$. This unusual coexistence of universal and variable exponents offers a rare empirical testbed for nonequilibrium growth and an empirical basis for modeling urban sprawl.</description>

      <title>Growth of Structural Lengthscale in Kob Andersen Binary Mixtures: Role of medium range order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central and extensively debated question in glass physics concerns whether a single, growing lengthscale fundamentally controls glassy dynamics, particularly in systems lacking obvious structural motifs like the Kob Andersen binary Lennard Jones (KALJ) model. In this work, we investigate structural and dynamical lengthscales in supercooled liquids using KALJ model in two compositions: 80:20 and 60:40. We compute the dynamical lengthscale from displacement displacement correlation functions and observe a consistent growth as temperature decreases. To explore the static counterpart, we use a structural order parameter (SOP) based on the mean field caging potential. While this SOP is known to predict short time dynamics effectively, its bare correlation function reveals minimal spatial growth. Motivated by recent findings that long time dynamics reflect collective rearrangements, we perform spatial coarse graining of the SOP and identify an optimal lengthscale Lmax that maximises structure dynamics correlation. We show that the structural correlation length derived from SOP coarse grained over Lmax exhibits clear growth with cooling and closely tracks the dynamical lengthscale, especially for A particles in the 80:20 mixture and for both A and B particles in the 60:40 system. Our results reconcile the previously observed absence of static length growth in the KALJ model by highlighting the necessity of intermediate range structural descriptors. Furthermore, we find that the particles with larger structural length growth also correspond to species with latent crystallisation tendencies, suggesting a possible link between structural order, dynamics, and incipient crystallisation.</description>
