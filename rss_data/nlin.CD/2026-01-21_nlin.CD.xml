      <title>Complex transitions between spiking, bursting and silent regimes in a new memristive Rulkov neuronal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rulkov model, which simulates the behavior of biological neurons, is modified by replacing one of its control parameters with a memristive, sigmoid-type function of finite memory. This modification causes the parameter to vary according to the system's history throughout the simulation. Previous works usually modify the Rulkov model by introducing additional parameters altering its behavior. Here, by contrast, we retain the original equations and allow the control parameters to vary in time, thereby preserving the model's fundamental properties. In this sense, the proposed model is locally equivalent in time to the original one. However, unlike the original model, which reproduces a single neuronal regime per simulation, the new memristive version exhibits both uniform and chaotic transitions among multiple neuronal activity regimes. Its dynamics are examined with respect to the rate at which the memristive function changes and the number of internal states it stores. Three distinct scenarios emerge around a bifurcation point. Before the bifurcation, the system undergoes uniform transitions toward a stable bursting regime. After the bifurcation, it shows uniform transitions toward a final spiking or silent regime. At the bifurcation point, highly complex transitions arise. As examples, we present trajectories in which the neuron chaotically switches between regimes without ever settling, and trajectories for which it requires around 140000 map iterations to reach a stationary regime.</description>

      <title>Survival probability of particles inside the Lemon Billiard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the escape of particles in the lemon billiard, a two-parameter family of billiard systems defined by the intersection of two identical circles. Using numerical simulations, we explore how the survival probability depends on the position and size of the hole, as well as on the billiard shape parameter. We find that the survival probability exhibits a two-stage decay pattern: an initial exponential regime followed by a long-time power-law tail, a signature of the stickiness effect. Our results show that the short-time exponential decay rate follows a power-law dependence on the hole size, with different scaling exponents for holes placed in chaotic regions versus mixed phase space regions. For holes located in mixed phase space regions, the decay exponent of the long-time power-law tail remains approximately constant, while the amplitude follows a power-law scaling with hole size. We also examine the dependence of short-time exponential decay rate on the billiard shape parameter and observe scaling behavior for small values of this parameter, which breaks down as the parameter increases.</description>

      <title>Global Recovery from Local Data: Interior Nudging for 2D Navier-Stokes equations in a Physical Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many real-world applications of data assimilation (DA), the strategic placement of observers is crucial for effective and efficient forecasting. Motivated by practical constraints in sensor deployment, we show that global recovery of the flow field can be achieved using observations available only in a subregion of the domain, possibly far from the boundary. We focus on the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations posed in a bounded physical domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Building on the continuous data assimilation framework of Azouani, Olson, and Titi (2014), we rigorously prove that the assimilated solution converges globally to the true solution under suitable conditions on the nudging parameter, spatial resolution, and the geometry of the observation region, specifically, when the maximum distance from any point in the domain to the observational subregion is bounded by a constant multiple of \( \nu^{1/2} \) (in terms of scaling). Our computational results, conducted via finite element methods over complex geometries, support the theoretical findings and reveal even greater robustness in practice. Specifically, synchronization with the true solution is achieved even when the observational subregion lies farther from the rest of the domain than the theoretical threshold permits. Across all three tested scenarios, the local nudging algorithm performs comparably to full-domain assimilation, reaching global accuracy up to machine precision. Interestingly, observational data near the boundary are found to be largely uninformative. This demonstrates that full observability is not necessary: carefully chosen interior observations, even far from the boundary, can suffice.</description>

      <title>Long-term prediction of ENSO with physics-guided Deep Echo State Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The El Ni\~{n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a dominant mode of interannual climate variability, yet the mechanisms limiting its long-lead predictability remain unclear. Here we develop a physics-guided Deep Echo State Network (DESN) that operates on physically interpretable climate modes selected from the extended recharge oscillator (XRO) framework. DESN achieves skillful Ni\~{n}o3.4 predictions up to 16-20 months ahead with minimal computational cost. Mechanistic experiments show that extended predictability arises from nonlinear coupling between warm water volume and inter-basin climate modes. Error-growth analysis further indicates a finite ENSO predictability horizon of approximately 30 months. These results demonstrate that physics-guided reservoir computing provides an efficient and interpretable framework for diagnosing and predicting ENSO at long lead times.</description>

      <title>On Thermalization in A Nonlinear Variant of the Discrete NLS Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermalization properties of a fully nonlinear lattice model originally derived from the two-dimensional cubic defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) using analytical and numerical methods. Our analysis reveals both ergodic and nonergodic regimes; importantly, we find broad parameter ranges where the dynamics is ergodic even though it lies outside the Gibbsian parameter regime (for both $D=0.25$ and $D=2$), and a higher-energy range where ergodicity breaks down. We observe that in a certain range of parameters, the system requires non-standard statistical descriptions, indicating a breakdown of conventional thermalization. We examine the influence of the nonlinear dispersion parameter $D$ on the system's behavior, showing that increasing $D$ enhances fluctuations and speeds up the crossover of $q(T)$ toward the $\sim 1/T$ scaling. By analyzing excursion times, probability density functions, and localization patterns, we characterize transitions between ergodic and nonergodic behavior. In long-time numerical simulations within the non-ergodic regime for $D&gt;1$, stable localization over two sites is observed, while $D&lt;1$ favors single-site localization in the high energy density regimes. Our results provide insights into the interplay between thermalization, localization, and non-standard statistical behavior in genuinely nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian hydrodynamic reductions of one-dimensional Vlasov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Hamiltonian fluid reductions of the one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson equation. Our approach utilizes the hydrodynamic Poisson bracket framework, which allows us to systematically identify fundamental normal variables derived from the analysis of the Casimir invariants of the resulting Poisson bracket. This framework is then applied to analyze several well-established Hamiltonian closures of the onedimensional Vlasov equation, including the multi-delta distribution and the waterbag models. Our key finding is that all of these seemingly distinct closures consistently lead to the formulation of a unified form of parametric closures: When expressed in terms of the identified normal variables, the parameterization across all these closures is revealed to be polynomial and of the same degree. All these parametric closures are uniquely generated from one of the moments, called $\mu$2, a cubic polynomial in the normal variables. This result establishes a structural connection between these different physical models, offering a path toward a more unified and simplified description of the one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson dynamics through its reduced hydrodynamic forms with an arbitrary number of fluid variables.</description>

      <title>Caustics of finitely dense inertial particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating collision rates is of immense importance in particle-laden flows. An economical way of doing this is to directly identify incidences of caustics, or extreme clustering, by tracking particle velocity gradients in the neighborhoods of individual particles. The objective of this work is two-fold. (i) We find conditions under which caustics form, in point-vortex flow and in two-dimensional turbulence. While caustics are known to form in regions of strain, we show that the type of strain is key. Particles must remain in compressional strain throughout the process to form caustics, whereas survivor particles: which visit high strain but do not form caustics, briefly go through extensional strain during the early part of the process. This enables survivor particles to attain significantly straighter paths, and to move faster, whereas caustics particles follow paths of high curvature and move slower. As a result, caustics particles stay longer in high-strain regions than survivors. (ii) We ask about the effect of finite particle density, where the particle is denser than the background fluid. We show that finite-density particles need to sample stronger background strain than infinite-density ones to trigger caustics, but our other findings are universal across particle density.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear phase synchronization and the role of spacing in shell models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A shell model can be considered as a chain of triads, where each triad can be interpreted as a nonlinear oscillator that can be mapped to a spinning top. Investigating the relation between phase dynamics and intermittency in a such a chain of nonlinear oscillators, it is found that synchronization is linked to increased energy transfer. In particular, the results provide evidence that the observed systematic increase of intermittency, as the shell spacing is decreased, is associated with strong phase alignment among consecutive triadic phases, facilitating the energy cascade. It is shown that while the overall level of synchronization can be quantified using a Kuramoto order parameter for the global phase coherence in the inertial range, a local, weighted Kuramoto parameter can be used for the detection of burst-like events propagating across shells in the inertial range. This novel analysis reveals how partially phase-locked states are associated with the passage of extreme events of energy flux. Applying this method to helical shell models, reveals that for a particular class of helical interactions, a reduction in phase coherence correlates with suppression of intermittency. When inverse cascade scenarios are considered using two different shell models including a non local helical shell model, and a local standard shell model with a modified conservation law, it was shown that a particular phase organization is needed in order to sustain the inverse energy cascade. It was also observed that the PDFs of the triadic phases were peaked in accordance with the basic considerations of the form of the flux, which suggests that a triadic phase of \pi/2 and -\pi/2 maximizes the forward and the inverse energy cascades respectively.</description>

      <title>Multiphase transport and compositional mixing mechanisms in twin-wire laser directed energy deposition: toward process stability and graded material fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twin-wire laser directed energy deposition (TW-LDED) provides a promising route for alloying and fabrication of compositionally graded structures. However, inherent multiparameter coupling in twin-wire systems critically exacerbates both process instabilities and compositional inhomogeneity. This unresolved issue escalates into a fundamental technological bottleneck, as the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components.</description>

Abstract: We prove the holding of chaos in the sense of Li-Yorke for a family of four-dimensional discrete dynamical systems that are naturally associated to ODEs systems describing coupled oscillators subject to an external non-conservative force, also giving an example of a discrete map that is Li-Yorke chaotic but not topologically transitive. Analytical results are generalized to a modular definition of the problem and to a system of nonlinear oscillators described by polynomial potentials in one coordinate. We perform numerical simulations looking for a strange attractor of the system; furthermore, we perform a bifurcation analysis of the system presenting 1D and 2D bifurcation diagrams, together with spectra of Lyapunov exponents and basins of attraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Associative memory models retrieve stored information through content-based addressing, mimicking the neural processes of animal brains. The classical Hopfield network-based models store memories as vectors of discrete values and have good storage capacity but do not consider the role of neuronal synchronization in memory storage and retrieval as observed in brains. This is addressed in phase-oscillator-based models which store memories as time-dependent phase-synchronized states, but suffer from instability and low capacity. The present study addresses these challenges through a novel chaotic oscillator-based associative memory model, by defining a phase relationship in chaotic systems and encoding memory as synchronized states of these phases. The underlying chaos in the network is shown to significantly improve both storage and retrieval and offer insights into the dynamics of memory retrieval.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation and spatiotemporal chaos in relativistic degenerate plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the nonlinear interactions of high-frequency circularly polarized electromagnetic (EM) waves and low-frequency electron-acoustic (EA) density perturbations driven by the EM wave ponderomotive force in relativistic plasmas {(moderate, strong, and ultra-relativistic)} with two groups of electrons--the population of relativistic degenerate dense electrons (bulk plasma) and the sparse relativistic nondegenerate (classical) electrons, and immobile singly charged positive ions. By pattern selection, we show that many solitary patterns can be generated and drenched through modulational instability of EM waves at different spatial length scales and that the EM wave radiation spectra emanating from compact astrophysical objects may not settle into stable envelope solitons but into different incoherent states, including the emergence of temporal and spatiotemporal chaos due to collisions and fusions among the patterns with strong EA wave emission. The appearance of these states is confirmed by analyzing the Lyapunov exponent spectra, correlation function, and mutual information {as quantitative evidence}. As a result, the redistribution of wave energy from initially exciting many solitary patterns at large scales to a few new incoherent patterns with small wavelengths in the system occurs, leading to the onset of turbulence in astrophysical plasmas.</description>
