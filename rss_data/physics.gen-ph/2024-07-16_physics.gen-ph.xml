      <title>Can the "basis vectors", describing the internal spaces of fermion and boson fields with the Clifford odd (for fermion) and Clifford even (for boson) objects, explain interactions among fields, with gravitons included?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Clifford odd and even ``basis vectors'', describing the internal spaces of fermion and boson fields, respectively, offer in even-dimensional spaces, like in $d=(13+1)$, the description of quarks and leptons and antiquarks and antileptons appearing in families, as well as of all the corresponding gauge fields: photons, weak bosons, gluons, Higgs's scalars and the gravitons, which not only explain all the assumptions of the {\it standard model}, and makes several predictions, but also explains the existence of the graviton gauge fields. Analysing the properties of fermion and boson fields concerning how they manifest in $d=(3+1)$, assuming space in $d=(3+1)$ flat, while all the fields have non-zero momenta only in $d=(3+1)$, this article illustrates that scattering of fermion and boson fields, with gravitons included, represented by the Feynman diagrams, are determined by the algebraic products of the corresponding ``basis vectors'' of fields, contributing to scattering. There are two kinds of boson gauge fields appearing in this theory, both contribute when describing scattering. We illustrate, assuming that the internal space, which manifests in $d=(3+1)$ origin in $d=(5+1)$, and in $d=(13+1)$, the annihilation of an electron and positron into two photons, and the scattering of an electron and positron into two muons. The theory offers an elegant and promising illustration of the interaction among fermion and boson second quantised fields.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the time variation of $c$ and $G$ from Dark Energy Survey Snpernova Program</title>

Abstract: In the context of the dispersion relation $c = \lambda \nu$ and considering an expanding universe where the observed wavelength today is redshifted from the emitted wavelength by $\lambda_{0} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} (1+z)$, to keep $c$ constant, it must be that $\nu_{0} = \nu_{\text{emit}} /(1+z)$. However, although the theory for wavelength in the RW metric includes the cosmological redshift, the same is not simply deduced for frequency (the inverse of time). Instead, cosmological time dilation $T_{0} = T_{\text{emit}} (1+z)$ is an additional assumption made to uphold the hypothesis of constant speed of light rather than a relation directly derived from the RW metric. Therefore, verifying cosmological time dilation observationally is crucial. The most recent data employing supernovae for this purpose was released recently by the Dark Energy Survey. Results from the i-band specifically support variations in the speed of light within 1-$\sigma$. We used these observations to investigate variations in various physical quantities, including $c$ and $G$, using the minimally extended varying speed of light model. The speed of light was $0.4$\% to $2.2$\% slower, and Newton's constant may have decreased by $1.7$\% to $8.4$\% compared to their current values at redshift $2$. These findings, consistent with previous studies, hint at resolving tensions between different $\Lambda$CDM cosmological backgrounds but are not yet conclusive evidence of a varying speed of light, as the full-band data aligns with standard model cosmology.</description>

      <title>Synchronizing Rhythms of Logic</title>

Abstract: Although quantum states nicely express interference effects, the outcomes of experiments are not states, but correspond to probability distributions. Twenty years ago we proved that probability distributions leave open a choice of quantum states to explain experiments that is resolvable only by a move beyond logic, which, inspired or not, can be characterized as a guess. Guesses link the inner lives of investigators to their explanations of experimental results. Recognizing the inescapability of guesswork in physics leads to avenues of investigation, one of which is presented here.
  We invert the quest for the logical foundations of physics to reveal a physical foundation of logic and calculation, and we represent this foundation mathematically, in such a way as to show the shaping and re-shaping of calculations by guesswork. We draw on the interplay between guessing and computation in digital contexts that, perhaps surprisingly, include living organisms. Digital computation and communication depend on a type of synchronization that coordinates transitions among physically distinct conditions represented by "digits." This logical synchronization, known to engineers but neglected in physics, requires guesswork for its maintenance. By abstracting digital hardware, we model the structure of human thinking as logically synchronized computation, punctuated by guesses.
  We adapt marked graphs to mathematically represent computation and represent guesses by unpredictable changes in these marked graphs. The marked graphs reveal a logical substructure to spatial and temporal navigation, with implications across physics and its biological applications. By limiting our model to the logical aspect of communications and computations, we unveil logical structure in relation to guesswork, applicable not just to electronics but also to the functioning of living organisms.</description>
