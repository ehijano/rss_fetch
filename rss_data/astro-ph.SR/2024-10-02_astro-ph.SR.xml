      <title>SynCOM: A tool for simulating coronal outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SynCOM is a package of procedures written in IDL (Interactive Data Language) that simulates transient solar wind flows. Each function within SynCOM handles specific tasks, such as initializing parameters, generating synthetic profiles, creating Gaussian blobs to represent solar wind features, and producing high-resolution images of the solar corona. This modular design allows users to call or customize individual functions independently, providing flexibility to adjust simulations to different observational or solar wind conditions. The software architecture is designed to facilitate SynCOM, which effectively creates synthetic datasets for testing and verifying feature tracking algorithms. It also takes advantage of the robust capabilities of the IDL for high-performance scientific computing</description>

      <title>On the Onset Mechanism for Solar Coronal Jets, and Implications for the Onset Mechanism for CME-Producing Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale solar eruptions often include ejection of a filament, a solar flare, and expulsion of a coronal mass ejection (CME). Unravelling the magnetic processes that build up the free energy for these eruptions and trigger that energy's release in the eruption is a continuing challenge in solar physics. Such large-scale eruptions are comparatively infrequent, with the moderate level ones (say, GOES M-class events) occurring perhaps once every few days on average during active-activity times, and much less frequently during quieter times. In contrast, solar coronal jets, which are long (~50,000 km), narrow (less than about 10,000 km), transient (~10--20 min) plasma spires with bright bases and that are seen in soft X-rays and EUV, occur much more frequently, likely several hundred times per day independent of large-scale solar activity level. Recent studies indicate that coronal jets are small-scale versions of large-scale eruptions, often produced by eruption of a small-scale "miniflament," that results in a "miniflare" analogous to a larger typical solar flare, and that sometimes produces a CME analogue (a "narrow CME" or "white-light jet"). Under the assumption that jets are small-scale eruptions, their higher occurrence frequency and faster build-up evolution reveals perhaps fundamental aspects of all eruptions that are not as easy to discern in the more-complex magnetic environment and the slower build up to the larger eruptions. Therefore, the study of coronal jets can provide insights into the onset mechanism of CME-producing large-scale eruptions.</description>

      <title>The SynCOM Flow Tracking Challenge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding solar wind flows is crucial for unraveling the dynamics of the Sun's corona and improving space weather forecasting. However, the complex nature of the solar wind and the absence of reliable ground-truth data present significant challenges to current tracking methods. To address this, the Flow Tracking Challenge was established, providing a platform for testing and refining flow tracking algorithms using synthetic images generated by the Synthetic Coronal Outflow Model (SynCOM). The challenge is divided into two phases: a preliminary phase focusing on simpler flow scenarios and a main phase featuring more complex synthetic images that mimic solar outflows. These phases allow researchers to evaluate their methods under various simulated conditions. SynCOM's synthetic data benchmark improves accuracy in velocity estimations. This paper presents the preliminary results of the Flow Tracking Challenge, where the synthetic images from SynCOM are used to test solar wind velocity tracking methods. Initial findings demonstrate SynCOM's value as a benchmark, guiding improvements for upcoming missions like PUNCH.</description>

      <title>Solar internetwork magnetic fields: Statistical comparison between observations and MHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the magnetic fields in the quiet Sun account for the majority of the magnetic energy in the solar photosphere, inferring their exact spatial distribution, origin, and evolution poses an important challenge because the signals lie at the limit of todays instrumental precision. This severely hinders and biases our interpretations, which are mostly made through nonlinear model-fitting approaches. Our goal is to directly compare simulated and observed polarization signals in the FeI 630.1 nm and 630.2 nm spectral lines in the solar internetwork. This way, we aim to constrain the mechanism responsible for the generation of the quiet Sun magnetism while avoiding the biases that plague other diagnostic methods. We used three different three-dimensional radiative magneto-hydrodynamic simulations representing different scenarios of magnetic field generation in the internetwork: small-scale dynamo, decay of active regions, and horizontal flux emergence. We synthesized Stokes profiles at different viewing angles and degraded them according to the instrumental specifications of the spectro-polarimeter on the Hinode satellite. Finally, we statistically compared the simulated spectra to the observations at the appropriate viewing angles. The small-scale dynamo simulation reproduced best the statistical properties of the observed polarization signals. This is especially prominent for the disk center viewing geometry, where the agreement is excellent. Moving toward more inclined lines of sight, the agreement worsens slightly. The agreement between the small-scale dynamo simulation and observations at the disk center suggests that small-scale dynamo action plays an important role in the generation of quiet Sun magnetism. However, the magnetic field around 50 km above the photosphere in this simulation does not reproduce observations as well as at the very base of the photosphere.</description>

      <title>Magnetized winds of M-type stars and star-planet magnetic interactions: uncertainties and modeling strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M-type stars are the most common stars in the universe. They are ideal hosts for the search of exoplanets in the habitable zone (HZ), as their small size and low temperature make the HZ much closer in than their solar twins. Harboring very deep convective layers, they also usually exhibit very intense magnetic fields. Understanding their environment, in particular their coronal and wind properties, is thus very important, as they might be very different from what is observed in the solar system. The mass loss rate of M-type stars is poorly known observationally, and recent attempts to estimate it for some of them (TRAPPIST-1, Proxima Cen) can vary by an order of magnitude. In this work, we revisit the stellar wind properties of M-dwarfs in the light of the latest estimates of $\dot{M}$ through Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption at the astropause and slingshot prominences. We outline a modeling strategy to estimate the mass loss rate, radiative loss and wind speed, with uncertainties, based on an Alfv\'en wave driven stellar wind model. We find that it is very likely that several TRAPPIST-1 planets lie within the Alfv\'en surface, which imply that these planets experience star-planet magnetic interactions (SPMI). We also find that SPMI between Proxima Cen b and its host star could be the reason of recently observed radio emissions.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS). Overview of gaseous molecular emission and absorption in low-mass protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MIRI-MRS instrument onboard JWST allows for probing the molecular gas composition at mid-IR wavelengths at unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. It is important to study these features in low-mass embedded protostellar systems since the formation of planets is thought to start in this phase. We present JWST/MIRI-MRS data of 18 low-mass protostellar systems in the JOYS program, focusing on gas-phase molecular lines in spectra extracted from the central protostellar positions. Besides H2, the most commonly detected molecules are H2O, CO2, CO, and OH. Other molecules such as 13CO2, C2H2, 13CCH, HCN, C4H2, CH4, and SO2 are detected only toward at most three of the sources. The JOYS data also yield the surprising detection of SiO gas toward two sources (BHR71-IRS1, L1448-mm) and for the first time CS and NH3 at mid-IR wavelengths toward a low-mass protostar (B1-c). The temperatures derived for the majority of the molecules are 100-300 K, much lower than what is typically derived toward more evolved Class II sources (&gt;500 K). Toward three sources (e.g., TMC1-W), hot (~1000 K) H2O is detected, indicative of the presence of hot molecular gas in the embedded disks, but such warm emission from other molecules is absent. The agreement in abundance ratios with respect to H2O between ice and gas point toward ice sublimation in a hot core for a few sources (e.g., B1-c) whereas their disagreement and velocity offsets hint at high-temperature (shocked) conditions toward other sources (e.g., L1448-mm, BHR71-IRS1). The typical temperatures of the gas-phase molecules of 100-300 K are consistent with both ice sublimation in hot cores as well as high-temperature gas phase chemistry. Molecular features originating from the inner embedded disks are not commonly detected, likely because they are too extincted even at mid-IR wavelengths by small not-settled dust grains in upper layers of the disk.</description>

      <title>TIC 290061484: A Triply Eclipsing Triple System with the Shortest Known Outer Period of 24.5 Days</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have discovered a triply eclipsing triple-star system, TIC 290061484, with the shortest known outer period, Pout, of only 24.5 days. This "eclipses" the previous record set by lambda Tauri at 33.02 days, which held for 68 yr. The inner binary, with an orbital period of Pin = 1.8 days, produces primary and secondary eclipses and exhibits prominent eclipse timing variations with the same periodicity as the outer orbit. The tertiary star eclipses, and is eclipsed by, the inner binary with pronounced asymmetric profiles. The inclinations of both orbits evolve on observable timescales such that the third-body eclipses exhibit dramatic depth variations in TESS data. A photodynamical model provides a complete solution for all orbital and physical parameters of the triple system, showing that the three stars have masses of 6.85, 6.11, and 7.90 MSun, radii near those corresponding to the main sequence, and Teff in the range of 21,000-23,700 K. Remarkably, the model shows that the triple is in fact a subsystem of a hierarchical 2+1+1 quadruple with a distant fourth star. The outermost star has a period of ~3200 days and a mass comparable to the stars in the inner triple. In ~20 Myr, all three components of the triple subsystem will merge, undergo a Type II supernova explosion, and leave a single remnant neutron star. At the time of writing, TIC 290061484 is the most compact triple system and one of the tighter known compact triples (i.e., Pout/Pin = 13.7).</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismology is the study of the interior physics and structure of stars using their pulsations. It is applicable to stars across the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram and a powerful technique to measure masses, radii and ages, but also directly constrain interior rotation, chemical mixing, and magnetism. This is because a star's self-excited pulsation modes are sensitive to its structure. Asteroseismology generally requires long-duration and high-precision time series data. The method of forward asteroseismic modelling, which is the statistical comparison of observed pulsation mode frequencies to theoretically predicted pulsation frequencies calculated from a grid of models, provides precise constraints for calibrating various transport phenomena. In this introduction to asteroseismology, we provide an overview of its principles, and the typical data sets and methodologies used to constrain stellar interiors. Finally, we present key highlights of asteroseismic results from across the HR diagram, and conclude with ongoing challenges and future prospects for this ever-expanding field within stellar astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Volatile composition of the HD 169142 disk and its embedded planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The composition of a planet's atmosphere is intricately linked to the chemical makeup of the protoplanetary disk in which it formed. Determining the elemental abundances from key volatiles within disks is therefore essential for establishing connections between the composition of disks and planets. The disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 169142 is a compelling target for such a study due to its molecule-rich nature and the presence of a newly-forming planet between two prominent dust rings. In this work, we probe the chemistry of the HD 169142 disk at small spatial scales, drawing links between the composition of the disk and the planet-accreted gas. Using thermochemical models and archival data, we constrain the elemental abundances of volatile carbon, oxygen, and sulfur. Carbon and oxygen are only moderately depleted from the gas phase relative to their interstellar abundances, with the inner 60 au appearing enriched in volatile oxygen. The C/O ratio is approximately solar within the inner disk and rises above this in the outer disk, as expected across the H2O snowline. The gas-phase sulfur abundance is depleted by a factor of 1000, consistent with a number of other protoplanetary disks. Interestingly, the observed SiS emission near the HD 169142 b protoplanet vastly exceeds chemical model predictions, supporting previous hypotheses suggesting its origin in shocked gas or a localised outflow. We contextualise our findings in terms of the potential atmospheric composition of the embedded planet, and highlight the utility of sulfur-bearing molecules as probes of protoplanetary disk chemistry.</description>

      <title>Compact object populations over cosmic time II. Compact object merger rates and masses over redshift from varying initial conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a first study of the impact of varying two components of the initial conditions in binary population synthesis of compact binary mergers - the initial mass function, which is made metallicity- and star formation rate-dependent, and the orbital parameter (orbital period, mass ratio and eccentricity) distributions, which are assumed to be correlated - within a larger grid of initial condition models also including alternatives for the primary mass-dependent binary fraction and the metallicity-specific cosmic star formation history. We generate the initial populations with the sampling code BOSSA and evolve them with the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS. We find strong suggestions that the main role of initial conditions models is to set the relative weights of key features defined by the evolution models. In the two models we compare, black hole-black hole (BHBH) mergers are the most strongly affected, which we connect to a shift from the common envelope to the stable Roche lobe overflow formation channels with decreasing redshift. We also characterize variations in the black hole-neutron star (BHNS) and neutron star-neutron star (NSNS) final parameter distributions. We obtain the merger rate evolution for BHBH, BHNS and NSNS mergers up to $z=10$, and find a variation by a factor of $\sim50-60$ in the local BHBH and BHNS merger rates, suggesting a more important contribution from initial conditions than previously thought, and calling for a complete exploration of the initial conditions model permutations.</description>

Abstract: The MOND modified gravity paradigm, best known for its agreement with galactic rotation curve data, is difficult to devise laboratory tests for. MOND's predictions differ substantially from Newtonian gravity only in the case of very small accelerations ($a &lt; a_0 = 1.2\times10^{-10}~\mathrm{m/s}^2 = 3.8~\mathrm{mm/s/y}$). In the solar system, radio and laser measurements of test bodies do permit acceleration measurements this precise; however, in at least some viable realizations, MOND has an "external field effect" (EFE) which essentially disables the MOND effects in the presence of the inner Milky Way's background gravitational field, invalidating Solar System limits. Can we do any measurement with Solar-System-like acceleration precision, but on a system many kiloparsecs away that avoids the EFE? In this paper, we show that MOND's non-$1/r^2$ gravitational acceleration has a unique and hard-to-fake effect: in contrast to the non-precessing elliptical orbits predicted by two-body Newtonian gravity, in the presence of MOND we expect apsidal precession in two-body systems. An extreme precision apsidal precession detection opportunity is available for eclipsing binaries, where, for some viewing geometries, apsidal precession causes transit time variations (TTVs) and transit duration variations (TDVs). If appropriate binaries can be found and measured, the presence or absence of timing variations may provide a definitive "solar-system-like" test of many EFE-bearing MOND theories like QUMOND.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Amplification during Stellar Collisions between Low-Mass Stars</title>

Abstract: Blue straggler stars in stellar clusters are a subset of stars that are bluer and appear younger than other cluster members, seemingly straggling behind in their evolution. They offer a unique opportunity to understand the stellar dynamics and populations within their hosts. In the collisional formation scenario, a persistent challenge is the excessive angular momentum in the collision product. The consequent significant mass loss during transition to a stable state leads to a star with too low a mass to be a blue straggler, unless it spins down efficiently. While many proposed spin-down mechanisms involve boosted angular momentum loss via magnetic braking within the collision product, the existence or strength of these magnetic fields has not been confirmed. Here, we report three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of collisions between two low-mass main-sequence stars and investigate magnetic field amplification. Magnetic field energy is amplified by a factor of $10^{8}-10^{10}$, resulting in the magnetic field strength of $10^{7}-10^{8}$G at the core of the collision product, independent of collision parameters. The surface magnetic field strengths have increased up to $10-10^{4}$ G. In addition, a distinctly flattened, rotating gas structure appears around the collision products in off-axis collisions, which may be a hint of possible disk formation. Such significant magnetic amplification and potential disk formation suggest the possibility of efficient spin-down of collision products via magnetic braking and magnetic disk locking, which can result in their appearance as blue stragglers.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the physical origin of large cavities in transition disks from multi-wavelength dust continuum emission</title>

Abstract: The physical origin of the large cavities observed in transition disks is to date still unclear. Different physical mechanisms (e.g., a companion, dead zones, enhanced grain growth) produce disk cavities of different depth, and the expected spatial distribution of gas and solids in each mechanism is not the same. In this work, we analyze the multi-wavelength interferometric visibilities of dust continuum observations obtained with ALMA and VLA for six transition disks: CQTau, UXTau A, LkCa15, RXJ1615, SR24S, and DMTau, and calculate brightness radial profiles, where diverse emission morphology is revealed at different wavelengths. The multi-wavelength data is used to model the spectral energy distribution and compute constraints on the radial profile of the dust surface density, maximum grain size, and dust temperature in each disk. They are compared with the observational signatures expected from various physical mechanisms responsible for disk cavities. The observational signatures suggest that the cavities observed in the disks around UXTau A, LkCa15, and RXJ1615 could potentially originate from a dust trap created by a companion. Conversely, in the disks around CQTau, SR24S, DMTau, the origin of the cavity remains unclear, although it is compatible with a pressure bump and grain growth within the cavity.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a millisecond pulsar associated with Terzan 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations show that globular clusters might be among the best places to find millisecond pulsars. However, the globular cluster Terzan 6 seems to be an exception without any pulsar discovered, although its high stellar encounter rate suggests that it harbors dozens of them. We report the discovery of the first radio pulsar, PSR J1750-3116A, likely associated with Terzan 6 in a search of C-band (4-8 GHz) data from the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope with a spin period of 5.33 ms and dispersion measure, DM$\simeq$ 383 ${\rm pc\,cm^{-3}}$. The mean flux density of this pulsar is approximately 3 $\mu$Jy. The DM agrees well with predictions from the Galactic free electron density model, assuming a distance of 6.7 kpc for Terzan 6. PSR J1750-3116A is likely an isolated millisecond pulsar, potentially formed through dynamical interactions, considering the core-collapsed classification and the exceptionally high stellar encounter rate of Terzan 6. This is the highest radio frequency observation that has led to the discovery of a pulsar in a globular cluster to date. While L-band (1-2GHz) observations of this cluster are unlikely to yield significant returns due to propagation effects, we predict that further pulsar discoveries in Terzan 6 will be made by existing radio telescopes at higher frequencies.</description>

      <title>orbitize! v3: Orbit fitting for the High-contrast Imaging Community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: orbitize! is a package for Bayesian modeling of the orbital parameters of resolved binary objects from time series measurements. It was developed with the needs of the high-contrast imaging community in mind, and has since also become widely used in the binary star community. A generic orbitize! use case involves translating relative astrometric time series, optionally combined with radial velocity or astrometric time series, into a set of derived orbital posteriors. This paper is published alongside the release of orbitize! version 3.0, which has seen significant enhancements in functionality and accessibility since the release of version 1.0 (Blunt et al., 2020).</description>

      <title>JWST captures a sudden stellar outburst and inner disk wall destruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present JWST/MIRI observations of T~Cha, a highly variable ($\Delta V \sim$3-5\,mag) accreting Sun-like star surrounded by a disk with a large ($\sim 15$\,au) dust gap. We find that the JWST mid-infrared spectrum is signiticantly different from the {\it Spitzer} spectrum obtained 17 years before, where the emission at short wavelengths ($5-10 \mu m$) has decreased by $\sim 2/3$ while at longer wavelengths ($15-25 \mu m$) it increased by up to a factor of $\sim 3$. This 'seesaw' behavior is contemporary with a fairly constant higher optical emission captured by the All Sky Automated Survey. By analyzing and modelling both SEDs, we propose that JWST caught the star during an outburst that destructed the asymmetric inner disk wall responsible for the high optical variability and lower $15-25$\,micron\ emission during the {\it Spitzer} time. The dust mass lost during this outburst is estimated to be comparable ($\sim 1/5$) to the upper limit of the total micron-sized dust mass in the inner disk of T~Cha now. Monitoring this system during possible future outbursts and more observations of its quiescent state will reveal if the inner disk can be replenished or will continue to be depleted and vanish.</description>
