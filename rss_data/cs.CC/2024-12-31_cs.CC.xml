      <title>Pushing Blocks via Checkable Gadgets: PSPACE-completeness of Push-1F and Block/Box Dude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove PSPACE-completeness of the well-studied pushing-block puzzle Push-1F, a theoretical abstraction of many video games (introduced in 1999). The proof also extends to Push-$k$ for any $k \ge 2$. We also prove PSPACE-completeness of two versions of the recently studied block-moving puzzle game with gravity, Block Dude - a video game dating back to 1994 - featuring either liftable blocks or pushable blocks. Two of our reductions are built on a new framework for "checkable" gadgets, extending the motion-planning-through-gadgets framework to support gadgets that can be misused, provided those misuses can be detected later.</description>

      <title>Functional Lower Bounds in Algebraic Proofs: Symmetry, Lifting, and Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong algebraic proof systems such as IPS (Ideal Proof System; Grochow-Pitassi [GP18]) offer a general model for deriving polynomials in an ideal and refuting unsatisfiable propositional formulas, subsuming most standard propositional proof systems. A major approach for lower bounding the size of IPS refutations is the Functional Lower Bound Method (Forbes, Shpilka, Tzameret and Wigderson [FSTW21]), which reduces the hardness of refuting a polynomial equation f(x) = 0 with no Boolean solutions to the hardness of computing the function 1/f(x) over the Boolean cube with an algebraic circuit. Using symmetry, we provide a general way to obtain many new hard instances against fragments of IPS via the functional lower bound method. This includes hardness over finite fields and hard instances different from Subset Sum variants, both of which were unknown before, and stronger constant-depth lower bounds. Conversely, we expose the limitation of this method by showing it cannot lead to proof complexity lower bounds for any hard Boolean instance (e.g., CNFs) for any sufficiently strong proof systems.</description>

      <title>On Extremal Properties of k-CNF: Capturing Threshold Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a basic question on the expressiveness of $k$-CNF formulas: How well can $k$-CNF formulas capture threshold functions? Specifically, what is the largest number of assignments (of Hamming weight $t$) accepted by a $k$-CNF formula that only accepts assignments of weight at least $t$? Among others, we provide the following results:
  - While an optimal solution is known for $t \leq n/k$, the problem remains open for $t &gt; n/k$. We formulate a (monotone) version of the problem as an extremal hypergraph problem and show that for $t = n-k$, the problem is exactly the Tur\'{a}n problem.
  - For $t = \alpha n$ with constant $\alpha$, we provide a construction and show its optimality for $2$-CNF. Optimality of the construction for $k&gt;2$ would give improved lower bounds for depth-$3$ circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum state testing beyond the polarizing regime and quantum triangular discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01952v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexity class Quantum Statistical Zero-Knowledge ($\mathsf{QSZK}$) captures computational difficulties of the time-bounded quantum state testing problem with respect to the trace distance, known as the Quantum State Distinguishability Problem (QSDP) introduced by Watrous (FOCS 2002). However, QSDP is in $\mathsf{QSZK}$ merely within the constant polarizing regime, similar to its classical counterpart shown by Sahai and Vadhan (JACM 2003) due to the polarization lemma (error reduction for SDP).
  Recently, Berman, Degwekar, Rothblum, and Vasudevan (TCC 2019) extended the $\mathsf{SZK}$ containment for SDP beyond the polarizing regime via the time-bounded distribution testing problems with respect to the triangular discrimination and the Jensen-Shannon divergence. Our work introduces proper quantum analogs for these problems by defining quantum counterparts for triangular discrimination. We investigate whether the quantum analogs behave similarly to their classical counterparts and examine the limitations of existing approaches to polarization regarding quantum distances. These new $\mathsf{QSZK}$-complete problems improve $\mathsf{QSZK}$ containments for QSDP beyond the polarizing regime and establish a simple $\mathsf{QSZK}$-hardness for the quantum entropy difference problem (QEDP) defined by Ben-Aroya, Schwartz, and Ta-Shma (ToC 2010). Furthermore, we prove that QSDP with some exponentially small errors is in $\mathsf{PP}$, while the same problem without error is in $\mathsf{NQP}$.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Formalisms for Representing Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a longstanding dispute over which formalism is the best for representing knowledge in AI. The well-known "declarative vs. procedural controversy" is concerned with the choice of utilizing declarations or procedures as the primary mode of knowledge representation. The ongoing debate between symbolic AI and connectionist AI also revolves around the question of whether knowledge should be represented implicitly (e.g., as parametric knowledge in deep learning and large language models) or explicitly (e.g., as logical theories in traditional knowledge representation and reasoning). To address these issues, we propose a general framework to capture various knowledge representation formalisms in which we are interested. Within the framework, we find a family of universal knowledge representation formalisms, and prove that all universal formalisms are recursively isomorphic. Moreover, we show that all pairwise intertranslatable formalisms that admit the padding property are also recursively isomorphic. These imply that, up to an offline compilation, all universal (or natural and equally expressive) representation formalisms are in fact the same, which thus provides a partial answer to the aforementioned dispute.</description>

      <title>An alternative explicit circuit diagram for the quantum search algorithm by implementing a non-unitary gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16514v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the final quantum state in the Grover search algorithm is the normalized marked quantum state in the Gram-Schmidt process, Abrams and Lloyd [1] has showed that we can generate this vector by using a non-unitary gate or an approximation of this non-unitary gate. Following Abrams and Lloyd [1], in this paper, we present an example explicit unitary implementation by using the square root of the non-unitary matrix. In this implementation, the reading of the marked element with high probability still requires repetitions similar to the original algorithm. However, we show that in smaller numerical cases one can obtain the solution with $O(n)$ repetitions. Since we still use the marking part of the original algorithm, $U_{mark}$, the complexity for a single repetition of the circuit is bounded by the complexity of this operator. We also discuss how the implementation of the non-unitary can be done through linear combination of unitary matrices or similar methods. Finally we discuss how these approximations may change the complexity.</description>
