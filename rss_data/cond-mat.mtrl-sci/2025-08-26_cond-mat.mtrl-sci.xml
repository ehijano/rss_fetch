      <title>Spontaneous spiral patterns etched on Germanium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin metal film on Germanium, in the presence of water, results in a remarkable pattern forming system. Here we present an analysis of spirals spontaneously etched on the Ge surface. We obtain measurements of the growth dynamics of the spirals and measurements of the local strain field in the metal film. Both indicate that the near geometric order of the pattern originates from the unique far field of a singularity - a crystal defect. The measured engraving profile is found in quantitative agreement with a model of metal catalyzed corrosion of the Ge surface. Specifically, local etch depth is inversely proportional to the normal velocity of the Ge-metal contact line. The growth mechanism combines crack propagation, reaction diffusion dynamics, and thin film mechanical instabilities, and illustrates how a defect's long range field can impose geometric order in a non-equilibrium growth process. General features relevant to other pattern forming systems are the coupling of chemistry and mechanics and the singularity driven order.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Performance of FeFET Gate Stack via Heterogeneously co-doped Ferroelectric HfO$_2$ Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the impact of spatially controlled Zr and Al heterogeneous co-doping in HfO$_2$ thin films tailored for metal-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor (MFIS) gate stacks of ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFETs). By precisely modulating the vertical arrangement of Zr and Al dopants during atomic layer deposition, we introduce deliberate compositional gradients that affect crystallization dynamics during subsequent annealing. This strategy enables us to systematically tune the phase evolution and domain nucleation within the ferroelectric layer, directly influencing device reliability and performance. From a structural perspective, our findings demonstrate that the phase composition of annealed HfO$_2$ films in MFIS stacks is primarily determined by the spatial arrangement of dopants. From an electrical perspective, we observe significant enhancement of remanent polarization and endurance of the gate stacks through heterogeneous co-doping, depending on the spatial arrangement of dopants.</description>

      <title>Molecular Tools for Non-Planar Surface Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) investigations of on-surface chemistry on passivated silicon have only shown in-plane chemical reactions, and studies on bare silicon are limited in facilitating additional reactions post-molecular-attachment. Here, we enable subsequent reactions on Si(100) through selectively adsorbing 3D, silicon-specific "molecular tools". Following an activation step, the molecules present an out-of-plane radical that can function both to donate or accept molecular fragments, thereby enabling applications across multiple scales, e.g., macroscale customizable silicon-carbon coatings or nanoscale tip-mediated mechanosynthesis. Creation of many such molecular tools is enabled by broad molecular design criteria that facilitate reproducibility, surface specificity, and experimental verifiability. These criteria are demonstrated using a model molecular tool tetrakis(iodomethyl)germane ($Ge(CH_{2}I)_{4}$; TIMe-Ge), with experimental validation by SPM and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and theoretical support by density functional theory (DFT) investigations. With this framework, a broad and diverse range of new molecular engineering capabilities are enabled on silicon.</description>

      <title>On the Relationship and Distinction Between Atomic Density and Coordination Number in Describing Grain Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal defects are often rationalized through broken-bond counting via the nearest neighbor coordination number. In this work, we highlight that this perspective overlooks intrinsic heterogeneities in interatomic spacing that decisively shape defect properties. We analyze excess free volume, energy, and entropy for a large set of BCC-Fe grain boundaries relaxed by molecular statics and demonstrate that an atomic-density field, as a systematically coarse-grained field variable, provides a more comprehensive descriptor. Unlike coordination alone, the density field simultaneously captures bond depletion and spacing variations, thereby unifying structural and volumetric information. Our results establish density-based descriptors as principled surrogates for grain-boundary thermodynamics and kinetics, offer a direct bridge from atomistic data to mesoscale models, and motivate augmenting broken-bond rules in predictive theories of interfacial energetics, excess properties, segregation and phase behavior.</description>

      <title>Identifying the magnetic genes in fully- and partially-ordered V$_2$$X$Al ($X$ = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) Heusler alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multicomponent Heusler alloys exhibit various magnetic properties arising from their diverse atomic compositions and crystal structures. Identifying the general physical principles that govern these behaviors is essential for advancing their potential in spintronic applications. In this work, we combine density functional theory with atomistic Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the magnetic ground states, finite-temperature magnetic transitions, and electronic structures of fully-ordered $L2_1$-, $XA$-type, and partially-ordered V$_2X$Al ($X=$ Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) Heusler alloys. We introduce the concept of magnetic genes, defined as V-$X$-V triangular motifs connected by the nearest-neighbor (NN) exchange interactions $J_{\mathrm{V-}X}$. Within this framework, the magnetic ground states and transition temperatures across the V$_2X$Al family can be consistently understood. The magnetic order is primarily governed by the NN $J_{\mathrm{V-}X}$ interactions in the triangular genes, while the transition temperatures are additionally influenced by $J_{X-X}$ couplings. Furthermore, the magnetic genes are still proven to be effective in our calculations on partially-ordered V$_2$$X$Al alloys from $L2_1$ to $XA$-type structures. Our results suggest that the concept of magnetic genes provides a unifying principle for understanding magnetic ordering in V-based Heusler alloys and could serve as a powerful guide for exploring magnetism and designing advanced spintronic materials in a broader class of Heusler systems.</description>

      <title>Phonon anharmonicity-driven charge density wave transition and ultrafast dynamics in 1T-TaS2/TaSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW), a symmetry-breaking collective phenomenon in condensed matter systems, exhibits periodic modulations of electron density coupled with lattice distortions, where the lattice plays a critical role via electron-phonon coupling. In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) 1T-TaS2/TaSe2, experiments reveal rich temperature- and pressure-dependent CDW phase behaviors, along with metastable CDW states induced by ultrafast optical excitation. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms governing thermal/pressure-driven transitions and particularly the microscopic evolution of CDW phases remain incompletely understood. Here, we perform first-principles anharmonic phonon calculations and machine-learning force-field molecular dynamics at finite temperatures/pressures to investigate the CDW transitions in 1T-TaS2/TaSe2. The calculated CDW transition temperature TCDW and critical pressure Pc are in quantitative agreement with experimental values. Our results demonstrate that the melting of CDW originates from phonon anharmonicity, with ionic fluctuations dominating the transition dynamics. We observe the microscopic evolution of CDW under varying temperature/pressure, revealing an ultrafast nucleation process of CDW (~3 ps). Our results emphasize the essential role of phonon anharmonicity in elucidating CDW transition mechanisms underlying, and advance fundamental understanding of CDW-related phenomena in TMDs.</description>

      <title>Segregation-driven cross-slip mechanism of shockley partials in the gamma prime phase of CoNi-based superalloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general, the cross-slip of superdislocations (a/2&lt;011&gt;) from {111} planes to {001} planes has been frequently observed in superalloys, accompanied by the formation of an antiphase boundary (APB) and driven by thermal activation. However, no prior studies have evidenced the occurrence of Shockley partial dislocation (a/6&lt;112&gt;) cross-slip within the gamma prime phase of superalloys. In this work, we present a newly observed cross-slip phenomenon: the Shockley partial dislocations cross-slip from one {111} plane to another {111} conjugate plane, facilitated by the formation of a stair-rod dislocation in the ordered gamma prime phase of a CoNi-based superalloy. Compression tests were conducted at 850 degrees Celsius with a strain rate of 10^-4 s^-1. Defects such as stacking faults and dislocations, along with the associated chemical fluctuations, were characterized using high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Elemental segregation was found to reduce the activation energy required for cross-slip by decreasing the energies of stacking faults and dislocations. In addition to elemental segregation, local stress concentrations, arising from the combined effects of applied stress, shearing dislocations within the gamma prime phase, and dislocation pile-ups, also play a critical role in triggering cross-slip. The formation of sessile stair-rod dislocations via this newly identified Shockley partial cross-slip in the gamma prime phase is beneficial for enhancing the high-temperature deformation resistance of the alloy by increasing the critical resolved shear stress required for further plastic deformation.</description>

      <title>Molecular augmented dynamics: Generating experimentally consistent atomistic structures by design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental objective of materials modeling is identifying atomic structures that align with experimental observables. Conventional approaches for disordered materials involve sampling from thermodynamic ensembles and hoping for an experimental match. This process is inefficient and offers no guarantee of success. We present a method based on modified molecular dynamics, that we call molecular augmented dynamics (MAD), which identifies structures that simultaneously match multiple experimental observables and exhibit low energies as described by a machine learning interatomic potential (MLP) trained from ab-initio data. We demonstrate its feasibility by finding representative structures of glassy carbon, nanoporous carbon, ta-C, a-C:D and a-CO$_x$ that match their respective experimental observables -- X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, pair distribution function and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data -- using the same initial structure and underlying MLP. The method is general, accepting any experimental observable whose simulated counterpart can be cast as a function of differentiable atomic descriptors. This method enables a computational "microscope" into experimental structures.</description>

      <title>Tunable Valley Polarization and Anomalous Hall Effect in Ferrovalley NbX2 and TaX2 (X = S, Se, Te): A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides lack inversion symmetry and have broken time-reversal symmetry due to the honeycomb structure and intrinsic ferromagnetism, which leads to their valley polarization. Here, we explored the electronic and magnetic properties of the novel ferrovalley materials 1H-NbS2, 1H-NbSe2, 1H-NbTe2, 1H-TaS2, 1H-TaSe2, and 1H-TaTe2 using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. The materials are dynamically stable bipolar magnetic semiconductors. Among the magnetic semiconductors, NbSe2 showed the maximum Curie temperature of 176.25 K. For these materials, the ferromagnetic state was more favorable than the antiferromagnetic state, indicating robust ferrovalley characteristics. These ferrovalley materials showed a giant tunable valley polarization at K and K' points in the Brillouin zone without applying any external factors due to intrinsic exchange interactions of transition metal d-orbital electrons and spin-orbit coupling. TaTe2 exhibited an outstanding valley splitting of 541 meV. Reversing Bloch electrons' magnetic moment caused an alteration of valley polarization. Additionally, the application of uniaxial and biaxial strain led to the manipulation and variation of the bandgap and valley polarization. Berry curvature exhibited opposite signs and unequal magnitudes at K and K' points, which led to the anomalous valley Hall effect in these materials. NbS2, NbSe2, and NbTe2 exhibited Berry curvature at unstrained crystals, whereas Berry curvature appeared only in TaSe2 and TaTe2 with the application of strain. These ferrovalley materials exhibited distinct band gaps for spin-up and spin-down electrons, enabling the selective transport of spin-polarized electrons.</description>

      <title>Functional theory of the occupied spectral density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of interacting electrons in an external potential by introducing the occupied spectral density $\rho(\mathbf{r},\omega)$ as fundamental variable. First, we formulate the problem using an embedding framework, and prove a one-to-one correspondence between a $\rho(\mathbf{r},\omega)$ and the local dynamical external potential $v_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{r},\omega)$ that embeds the interacting electrons into an open quantum system. Then, we use the Klein functional to ($i$) define a universal functional of $\rho(\mathbf{r},\omega)$, ($ii$) introduce a variational principle for the total energy as a functional of $\rho(\mathbf{r},\omega)$, and ($iii$) formulate a non-interacting mapping of spectral self-consistent equations suitable for numerical applications. At variance with time-dependent density-functional theory, this formulation aims at studying charged excitations and electronic spectra -- including electronic correlations -- with a functional theory; An explicit and formally correct description of all electronic levels could also lead to more accurate approximations for the total energy.</description>

      <title>Metal-Free Room-Temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving robust room-temperature ferromagnetism in purely organic 2D crystals remains a fundamental challenge, primarily due to antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling mediated by {\pi}-electron superexchange. Here, we present a mix-topology design strategy to induce strong ferromagnetic (FM) coupling in metal-free 2D systems. By covalently connecting radical polyaromatic hydrocarbon monomers (also referred to as nanographenes) with distinct sublattice topologies, this approach rationally breaks inversion symmetry and enables selective alignment of majority spins across the extended network, giving rise to metal-free ferromagnetism. Based on this strategy, we designed a family of 32 organic 2D crystals featuring spin-1/2 and mixed spin-1/2-spin-1 honeycomb lattices. Systematic first-principles calculations reveal that these materials are robust FM semiconductors with tunable spin-dependent bandgaps ranging from 0.9 to 3.8 eV. Notably, we demonstrate record-high magnetic coupling of up to 127 meV, spin-splitting energies exceeding 2 eV, and Curie temperatures surpassing 550 K, indicating thermal stability well above room temperature. The microscopic origin of the strong FM exchange stems from enhanced spin-orbital overlap and dominant direct exchange, while AFM superexchange is effectively suppressed. Our findings establish a generalizable design principle for realizing robust metal-free FM semiconductors and open new avenues for developing flexible and biocompatible magnets for next-generation spintronic and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Phonons Drive the Topological Phase Transition in Quasi-One-Dimensional Bi$_4$I$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional bismuth halides offer an exceptional platform for exploring diverse topological phases, yet the nature of the room-temperature topological phase transition in Bi$_4$I$_4$ remains unresolved. While theory predicts the high-temperature $\beta$-phase to be a strong topological insulator (TI), experiments observe a weak TI. Here we resolve this discrepancy by revealing the critical but previously overlooked role of electron-phonon coupling in driving the topological phase transition. Using our newly developed ab initio framework for phonon-induced band renormalization, we show that thermal phonons alone drive $\beta$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ from the strong TI predicted by static-lattice calculations to a weak TI above ~180 K. At temperatures where $\beta$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ is stable, it is a weak TI with calculated surface states closely match experimental results, thereby reconciling theory with experiment. Our work establishes electron-phonon renormalization as essential for determining topological phases and provides a broadly applicable approach for predicting topological materials at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Suppression Strategy for Dual Thermal Transport Channels in Crystalline Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel design principle for achieving ultralow thermal conductivity in crystalline materials via a "heavy-light and soft-stiff" structural motif. By combining heavy and light atomic species with soft and stiff bonding networks, both particle-like ($\kappa_p$) and wave-like ($\kappa_c$) phonon transport channels are concurrently suppressed. First-principles calculations show that this architecture induces a hierarchical phonon spectrum: soft-bonded heavy atoms generate dense low-frequency modes that enhance scattering and reduce $\kappa_p$, while stiff-bonded light atoms produce sparse high-frequency optical branches that disrupt coherence and lower $\kappa_c$. High-throughput screening identifies Tl$_4$SiS$_4$ ($\kappa_p$ = 0.10, $\kappa_c$ = 0.06 W/mK) and Tl$_4$GeS$_4$ ($\kappa_p$ = 0.09, $\kappa_c$ = 0.06 W/mK) as representative candidates with strongly suppressed transport in both channels. A minimal 1D triatomic chain model further demonstrates the generality of this mechanism, offering a new paradigm for phonon engineering beyond the conventional $\kappa_p$-$\kappa_c$ trade-off.</description>

Abstract: We report the development of the [Pt0.75Ti0.25/Co-Ni multilayer/Ta]n superlattice with strong spin-orbit torque, large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and low switching current density. We demonstrate that the efficiency of the spin-orbit torque increases linearly with the repetition number n, which is in good agreement with the spin Hall effect of the Pt0.75Ti0.25 being the only source of the spin-orbit torque. Meanwhile, the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy field is also enhanced by more than a factor of 2 as n increases from 1 to 6. The [Pt0.75Ti0.25/(Co/Ni)3/Ta]n superlattice also exhibits deterministic, low-current-density magnetization switching despite the very large layer thicknesses. The combination of the strong spin-orbit torque, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and low-current-density switching makes the [Pt0.75Ti0.25/Co-Ni multilayer/Ta]n superlattice a compelling material candidate for ultrafast, energy-efficient, long-data-retention spintronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Pulsed laser synthesis of mesoporous metal chalcogenide thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesoporous films of the metal chalcogenide $\beta$-FeSe were grown on MgO substrates by KrF pulsed laser deposition (PLD) in an argon background. At 100 mTorr, gated intensified charge-coupled device imaging and ion probe measurements showed that the plasma plume responsible for crystal growth initially comprised three components, with distinct expansion velocities. Plume interactions with the substrate heater and ablation target gave rise to complex dynamics, including collisions between the charged leading edge -- rebounding between the substrate and the target -- and slower-moving species in the plume interior. Film growth was dominated by species with kinetic energies $\le$0.5 eV/atom. X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy revealed that films grown in this environment -- with a substrate temperature of 350$^\circ$C, a laser fluence of 1.0 J cm$^{-2}$, and a 7.5 mm$^2$ spot area -- formed a porous framework with 15% porosity and pore sizes below 100 nm. X-ray diffraction indicated that the porous films were epitaxial with respect to the substrate and likely grew by oriented-attachment of gas-phase molecular clusters or very small nanoparticles, in contrast to the conventional epitaxy of vacuum films from atomic constituents. The in-plane orientation of the mesoporous films was $\beta$-FeSe[100]$\parallel$[110]MgO, attributed to the soft landing of pre-formed crystallites on the MgO substrates, where protruding Se rows of $\beta$-FeSe aligned with corrugations of the MgO surface. This work implies that growth of candidate electrocatalyst materials by PLD in inert gas background may allow mesoporous frameworks with a single crystallographic orientation that expose specific crystal facets for electrochemical reactions and active site engineering.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Driven Topological Phases in Kagome Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome materials have garnered substantial attention owing to their diverse physical phenomena, yet canonical systems such as the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family exhibit poor $Z_{2}$-type topological properties, spurring an urgent quest for kagome platforms hosting ideal topological states. Recently, Zhou et al. proposed the kagome-type IAMX family, which exhibits distinctive ideal topological states; however, their analysis is primarily restricted to the spinless approximation. In this work, we model relativistic effects in the IAMX family, demonstrating that tuning the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength drives topological phase transitions and induces novel topological states, resulting in a rich phase diagram. The configuration of topological surface states evolves continuously as the SOC strength is modulated, consistent with the evolution of the topological phase transition. This suggests a viable route toward designing multi-functional topological devices. First-principles calculations performed on three specific IAMX compounds confirm that SOC governs their topological phases, in complete accord with our model analysis.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Screening of 2D Photocatalyst Heterostructures with Suppressed Electron-Hole Recombination for Solar Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and scalable photocatalysts for solar water splitting remain a critical challenge in renewable energy research. The work presents a high-throughput first-principles discovery of two-dimensional (2D) type-II van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) optimized for visible-light-driven photocatalytic water splitting. We screened 482 heterostructures constructed from 60 experimentally realizable 2D monolayers and identified 148 stable type-II vdWHs with spatially separated valence and conduction band edges, out of which 65 satisfy the thermodynamic redox conditions for water splitting over a broad pH range. Among these, the best two, MoTe2/Tl2O and MoSe2/WSe2, exhibit a high visible-light absorption coefficient exceeding 0.6X10^6 cm-1, resulting in a high power conversion efficiency of 2%. Quantum kinetic analysis of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reveals nearly barrierless free energy profiles across multiple adsorption sites. Our study further reveals that intrinsic interlayer electric fields in these vdWHs drive directional charge separation, suppressing carrier recombination. Our results establish a design framework for using type-II 2D heterostructures as tunable and experimentally accessible 2D photocatalysts for efficient hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Learning Reaction-Diffusion Kinetics from Mechanical Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in materials science is characterizing chemical processes that are elusive to direct measurement, particularly in functional materials operating under realistic conditions. Here, we demonstrate that mechanical strain fields contain sufficient information to reconstruct hidden chemical kinetics in coupled chemomechanical systems. Our partial differential equation-constrained learning framework decodes concentration-dependent diffusion kinetics, thermodynamic driving forces, and spatially heterogeneous reaction rates solely from mechanical observations. Using battery electrode materials as a model system, we demonstrate that the framework can accurately identify complex constitutive laws governing three distinct scenarios: classical Fickian diffusion, spinodal decomposition with pattern formation, and heterogeneous electrochemical reactions with spatial rate variations. The approach demonstrates robustness while maintaining accuracy with limited spatial data and reasonable experimental noise levels. Most significantly, the framework simultaneously infers multiple fundamental processes and properties, including diffusivity, reaction kinetics, chemical potential, and spatial heterogeneity maps, all from mechanical information alone. This method establishes a paradigm for materials characterization, enabling accurate learning of chemical processes in energy storage systems, catalysts, and phase-change materials where conventional diagnostics prove difficult. By revealing that mechanical deformation patterns serve as information-rich fingerprints of the underlying chemical processes, this work follows the pathway of inversely learning constitutive laws, with broad implications in materials science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of two distinct pathways of trion generation in monolayer MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitation power and energy dependent photoluminescence (PL) and transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) studies are carried out on chemical vapour deposition (CVD) grown 1L-MoS2 films to understand the process of trion formation. The study shows that the excitation with sufficiently low photon energy results in the creation of trions directly in the K/K' valleys through photon absorption followed by phonon scattering events. On the other hand, excitation energy sufficiently larger than the band-gap can generate the carriers away from the K/K' valleys. Dissimilarity in the rates of relaxation of the photo-excited electrons and the holes to the bottom of the K/K' valleys results in the transformation of the excitons residing there into trions. Our TAS study clearly demonstrates a temporary increase of the trion population in the K/K' valleys. Moreover, excitation intensity dependent PL spectroscopy performed under above-band-gap excitation, also suggests the coexistence of both the pathways of trion generation in this material. This conclusion is further validated by a rate equation model. Our findings provide valuable insight into the formation of trions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC), which could be crucial in designing valleytronic devices based on trions.</description>

      <title>Twist-angle transferable continuum model and second flat Chern band in twisted MoTe2 and WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a twist-angle transferable continuum model for twisted transition metal dichalcogenide (tTMD) homobilayers, using tMoTe2 and tWSe2 as examples. All model parameters are extracted from density functional theory (DFT) calculations at a single twist angle (3.89{\deg}) and monolayer data. Our model captures both lattice relaxation effects and the long-range behavior of piezoelectric and ferroelectric potentials. Leveraging lattice relaxations obtained via machine learning force fields (MLFFs), the model can be efficiently transferred to other twist angles without requiring additional DFT calculations. It accurately reproduces the DFT band dispersions and quantum geometries across a wide range of twist angles. Furthermore, our model reveals that a second flat Chern band arises near 2{\deg} when the interlayer potential difference becomes comparable to the interlayer tunneling. This continuum model provides a clear understanding and starting point for engineering novel electronic phases in moir\'e TMDs through twist angles and lattice relaxations.</description>

      <title>Universal Machine Learning Potentials under Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) represent arguably the most successful application of machine learning to materials science, demonstrating remarkable performance across diverse applications. However, critical blind spots in their reliability persist. Here, we address one such significant gap by systematically investigating the accuracy of uMLIPs under extreme pressure conditions from 0 to 150 GPa. Our benchmark reveals that while these models excel at standard pressure, their predictive accuracy deteriorates considerably as pressure increases. This decline in performance originates from fundamental limitations in the training data rather than in algorithmic constraints. In fact, we show that through targeted fine-tuning on high-pressure configurations, the robustness of the models can be easily increased. These findings underscore the importance of identifying and addressing overlooked regimes in the development of the next generation of truly universal interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>X-ray magnetic circular dichroism originating from the $T_{z}$ term in collinear altermagnets under trigonal crystal field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the microscopic origin and spectral features of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) in collinear antiferromagnets with trigonal crystal fields, using $\alpha$-MnTe as a prototypical example. Although such systems exhibit zero net magnetization, we demonstrate that XMCD can emerge from the anisotropic magnetic dipole operator $T_{z}$, arising from quadrupolar spin distributions. By constructing a complete multipole basis and analyzing the symmetry conditions under trigonal distortion, we identify specific spin and orbital configurations that enable a finite XMCD response. Further, we employ both one-electron and multi-electron models, including spin-orbit coupling and Coulomb interactions, to calculate the XMCD spectra for various $d^n$ configurations. Our findings provide theoretical benchmarks for XMCD in altermagnets and highlight the key role of orbital symmetry and magnetic anisotropy in realizing observable dichroic effects.</description>

      <title>Theory of tunnel magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions with hexagonal boron nitride barriers: mechanism and application to ferromagnetic alloy electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN), with its strong in-plane bonding and good lattice match to hcp and fcc metals, offers a promising alternative barrier material for magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Here, we investigate spin-dependent transport in hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$$/$$h$-BN$/$hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$(0001) MTJs with physisorption-type interfaces using first-principles calculations. We find that a high TMR ratio arises from the resonant tunneling of the down-spin surface states of the hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$, having a $\Delta_1$-like symmetry around the $\Gamma$ point. Ni doping tunes the Fermi level and enhances this effect by reducing the overlap between up-spin and down-spin conductance channels in momentum space under the parallel configuration, thereby suppressing antiparallel conductance and increasing the TMR ratio. This mechanism is analogous to Brillouin zone spin filtering and is sensitive to the interfacial distance but not specific to $h$-BN barriers; similar behavior may emerge in MTJs with other two-dimensional insulators or semiconductors. These findings provide insight into surface-state-assisted tunneling mechanisms and offer guidance for the interface engineering of next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Classification of Altermagnetism and Emergence of Type-IV Magnetism in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetism, particularly 2D altermagnetism (AM), has attracted considerable interest due to its exceptional physical properties and broad application potential. However, the classification of AM undergoes a fundamental paradigm shift when transitioning from three-dimensional (3D) to 2D symmetry-enforced fully compensated collinear magnetism$-$a shift that has remained largely overlooked. Here, by extending unconventional magnetism to 2D collinear systems, we identify the symmetry conditions and electronic band characteristics of a distinct magnetic phase: type-IV magnetism. This new class lies beyond the established descriptions of ferromagnetism, conventional antiferromagnetism, and AM. Type-IV magnetism supports the successive emergence of both nonrelativistic spin-degenerate and relativistic spin-splitting phenomena, belonging strictly to neither conventional antiferromagnetism nor standard AM. We further establish a universal symmetry classification framework for 2D type-IV magnets via a mapping from the collinear spin layer group to the magnetic layer group. Monolayer MgCr$_2$O$_3$ and monolayer BaMn$_2$Ch$_3$ (Ch=Se, Te) are showcased as representative materials, exhibiting gate-tunable reversible spin textures and the quantum electric Hall effect, respectively. Our work underscores the rich functional prospects of type-IV magnets, offering a new route toward spin manipulation and anomalous transport that promises innovative designs for high-performance spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MACE-Field, a field-aware $O(3)$-equivariant interatomic potential that provides a compact, derivative-consistent route to dielectric properties (such as polarisation $\mathbf P$, Born effective charges $Z^*$ and polarisability $\boldsymbol\alpha$) and finite-field simulations across chemistry for inorganic solids. A uniform electric field is injected within each message-passing layer via a Clebsch-Gordan tensor-product which couples the field to latent spherical-tensor features, and perturbs them via an equivariant residual mixing. This plug-in design preserves the standard MACE readout and can inherit existing MACE foundation weights, turning pretrained models into field-aware ones with minimal change. To demonstrate, we train: (i) a cross-chemistry ferroelectric polarisation model (2.5k nonpolar$\!\to$polar polarisation branches), (ii) a cross-chemistry BECs/polarisability model ($\sim$6k Materials Project dielectrics spanning 81 elements), and (iii-iv) single-material molecular dynamics on BaTiO$_3$ and $\alpha$-SiO$_2$. The models recover polarisation branches and spontaneous polarisation, predict $Z^*$ and $\boldsymbol\alpha$ (hence $\varepsilon_\infty$) across diverse chemistries, and reproduce BaTiO$_3$ hysteresis and the IR/Raman and dielectric spectra of $\alpha$-quartz, benchmarking comparatively with Allegro-pol.</description>

      <title>Wurtzite MnSe as a barrier for CdSe quantum wells with built-in electric field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetic materials have attracted a lot of attention recently due to the numerous effects, which have an application potential and occur due to the spin-split band structure coexisting with the compensated magnetic order. Incorporation of such intriguing compounds into low-dimensional structures represents an important avenue towards exploiting and enhancing their functionalities. Prominent examples of this group are semiconductors well suited to the band-gap engineering strategies. Here, we present for the first time visible-light-emitting CdSe quantum wells, in which wurtzite MnSe as an alermagnetic candidate plays the role of a barrier. Photoluminescence experiments with temporal resolution demonstrate that in such quantum wells, a built-in electric field is present and strongly influences the energies of the emitted photons, the dynamics of recombination, and excitation power dependence. Numerical simulations allow us to estimate that the magnitude of the electric field is 14MV/m. We anticipate that such quantum wells offer potential to probe the barrier properties and that wurtzite MnSe is an interesting platform to study the interplay of the altermagnetism and built-in electric field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundational machine learning interatomic potentials that can accurately and efficiently model a vast range of materials are critical for accelerating atomistic discovery. We introduce universal potentials based on the graph atomic cluster expansion (GRACE) framework, trained on several of the largest available materials datasets. Through comprehensive benchmarks, we demonstrate that the GRACE models establish a new Pareto front for accuracy versus efficiency among foundational interatomic potentials. We further showcase their exceptional versatility by adapting them to specialized tasks and simpler architectures via fine-tuning and knowledge distillation, achieving high accuracy while preventing catastrophic forgetting. This work establishes GRACE as a robust and adaptable foundation for the next generation of atomistic modeling, enabling high-fidelity simulations across the periodic table.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent phonon control using ultrashort pulse trains is the key to realizing structural phase transitions in solids by non-thermal pathways. By combining double-pulse excitation and time-resolved second harmonic generation techniques under high-density electronic excitation in a 2D layered material, WTe$_{2}$, we demonstrate that the lattice symmetry switching from the Weyl semimetallic T$_{d}$ to the semimetallic 1T$^{\prime}$ phases is independent of the amplitude of the coherent interlayer shear phonons. This finding provides new insights into the mechanisms for symmetry switching that electronic excitation-driven shear sliding plays a dominant role.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of anomalous temperature dependence of resistivity in V-Al alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$ is a representative example of highly resistive metallic alloys exhibiting a crossover to a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR), known as the Mooij correlation. Despite numerous proposals to explain this anomalous behavior,none have provided a satisfactory quantitative explanation thus far. In this work, we calculate the electrical conductivity using an ab initio methodology that combines the Kubo-Greenwood formalism with the coherent potential approximation (CPA). The temperature dependence of the conductivity is obtained within a CPA-based model of thermal atomic vibrations. Using this approach, we observe the crossover to the negative TCR behavior in V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$, with the temperature coefficient following the Mooij correlation, which matches experimental observations in the intermediate-to-high temperature range.Analysis of the results allows us to clearly identify a non-Boltzmann contribution responsible for this behavior and describe it as a function of temperature and composition.</description>

      <title>Crystalline-to-Crystalline Phase Transition between Germanium Selenide Polymorphs with High Resistance Contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding phase transitions between crystalline phases of a material is crucial for both fundamental research and potential applications such as phase-change memory. In this study, we investigate the phase transition between GeSe crystalline polymorphs induced by either global annealing at moderate temperatures or localized laser-induced heating. The highly conductive gamma-GeSe transforms into semiconducting, single-crystalline alpha-GeSe while preserving a well-aligned crystal orientation. The distinct structural and electronic properties at the gamma-GeSe/alpha-GeSe interface were investigated by transmission electron microscopy analysis. We propose that the clustering of Ge vacancies in the gamma-GeSe phase at elevated temperatures is a key mechanism driving the transition, leading to the formation of alpha-GeSe through the segregation of a minor GeSe2 phase. Furthermore, we observe a high electrical resistance contrast of approximately 10^7 between gamma-GeSe and alpha-GeSe, underscoring the potential of GeSe as a model polymorphic system for electronic applications, including phase-change memory.</description>

      <title>Highly anisotropic 1D materials supported in exfoliable 2D coordination polymers with optical anisotropy switching via twist-engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) materials provide a platform to study and control the physical properties of low-dimensional materials. While strategies developed for two-dimensional (2D) crystals are not directly transferable to one-dimensional (1D) systems, we can benefit from them by creating layers formed by interconnected chains. Here, we develop a molecular strategy to illustrate this concept consisting of assembling 1D materials in 2D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Crystals of [FeX(pzX)(bpy)] (X = Cl, F; pz = pyrazole; bpy = bipyridine) consist of iron chains along the b-axis, crosslinked via bpy ligands along the a-axis to form 2D layers, stacked along the c-axis via vdW forces. This structural anisotropy manifests itself in highly-anisotropic optical properties, as demonstrated by optical measurements in the visible and terahertz ranges, results which are supported by DFT calculations. Chemical substitution enables the tuning of the optical properties, as exemplified by the photoluminescence of the Cl-derivative, which is quenched for the F-derivative. Thin-layers are obtained by mechanical exfoliation, and their optical properties are further tuned through the fabrication of orthogonally-twisted vdW heterostructures, enabling to effectively switch-off the optical anisotropy. Our work highlights the chemical flexibility of vdW layered MOFs as a platform for designing and manipulating 1D architectures.</description>

      <title>Polarization- and time-resolved nonlinear multi-photon spectroscopy for confocal microscopy of semiconductor nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a versatile confocal microscopy setup for optical second harmonic generation (SHG) and multi-photon spectroscopy that enables polarization-resolved studies of semiconductor bulk crystals and low-dimensional structures. The system offers full polarization control in both excitation and detection, spatial scanning with micrometer resolution, and spectrally tunable excitation over a broad energy range from 0.5 to 4.0 eV, using femtosecond and picosecond laser pulses. Samples are mounted in a helium-flow cryostat, allowing temperature control from 4 to 300 K. Magnetic fields up to 0.625 T can be applied in the Voigt geometry via an electromagnet. The nonlinear optical signals are analyzed using a high-resolution spectrometer with a spectral resolution of 60 $\mu$eV. We demonstrate the potential of the setup by means of SHG polarization tomography measurements on a Cu$_2$O crystal as well as through a SHG spectral scan of a ZnSe crystal over a wide energy range from 1.4 to 3.1 eV. Polarization-resolved confocal SHG mapping of various twisted mono- and bilayer MoS$_2$ structures is also presented. In addition, time-resolved two-color pump-probe experiments are shown for a Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ crystal, illustrating the potential of the system for investigating coherent exciton and phonon dynamics.</description>

      <title>Novel diamagnetic garnet-type substrate single crystals for ultralow-damping yttrium iron garnet Y3Fe5O12 films at cryogenic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Y3Sc2Ga3O12-Y3Sc2Al3O12 and Y3Sc2Ga3O12-Y3Al5O12 (YSGAG) solid solution single crystals with diameters up to 30 mm and total lengths up to about 100 mm were grown by the conventional Czochralski technique. Rocking curve measurements on polished sections revealed typical FWHM values of about 22 arcsec, which is indicative of relatively high structural quality for a solid-solution crystal. The grown substrate crystals are nearly lattice-matched with Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) to allow epitaxial growth of high-quality thin films. Single crystalline YIG films with thicknesses between 100 nanometer and 2.9 micrometer were successfully grown on epi-polished YSGAG substrates using liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). Selected magnetic and microwave properties of the epitaxial films, which still exhibit small lattice misfits to the substrates, were then studied at room temperature. In addition, initial low-temperature investigations confirm that the YIG/YSGAG system is superior to the conventional YIG/GGG (Gd3Ga5O12) system at temperatures below 10 K, as the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth does not increase with decreasing temperature. Therefore, the novel diamagnetic substrates are better suited for microwave applications at low temperature, as excessive damping losses induced by paramagnetic substrates can be avoided. It therefore seems to be a suitable pathway to achieve scalable microwave components for hybrid-integrated quantum systems based on ultralow-damping YIG films that can operate efficiently at millikelvin temperatures.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-induced magnetism in fullerene monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using molecular orbital theory, we introduce magnetism in pure-carbon, charge-neutral fullerene monolayers which are otherwise non-magnetic. By controlling either molecular or lattice symmetry, we can realise highly-tuneable magnetic fullerene monolayers. We demonstrate a general design principle based on group theory analysis and explain the origin of magnetism using two representative systems with $S_4$ and $C_3$ molecular symmetries. Moreover, for building blocks that lack appropriate molecular symmetry, we can enforce crystalline symmetry to induce magnetism as well. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of realising our proposed magnetic fullerene monolayers by examining a previously synthesised C$_{60}$ system. Our work opens a new direction in introducing magnetism in non-magnetic building blocks by enforcing either molecular or lattice symmetry.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Moment Tensor Potential in Ag-Cu Alloy: Accuracy, Transferability, and Phase Diagram Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) has been developed for the Cu-Ag binary alloy and its accuracy, transferability, and thermodynamic fidelity evaluated. The model was trained on a diverse dataset encompassing solid, liquid, and interfacial configurations derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Benchmarking against experiment and DFT data demonstrated significant improvements over the widely used classical Embedded Atom Method (EAM) potential, particularly in predicting defect energetics, surface properties, and the eutectic phase diagram. Despite a slight underestimation of Ag's melting point, the MTP model achieved consistent accuracy across elemental and binary systems without direct fitting to high-temperature phase transitions. The predicted eutectic temperature and composition were found in close agreement with experimental observations. These results establish MTP as a robust framework for modeling immiscible metallic systems and pave the way for its integration into large-scale atomistic simulations where both fidelity and generalizability are essential.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Electrical Transport Properties and Electronic Structure of Zr2CuSb3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The checkerboard lattice has been proposed to host topological flat bands as a result of destructive interference among its various electronic hopping terms. However, it has proven challenging to realize experimentally due to the difficulty of isolating this structure from any significant out-of-plane bonding while maintaining structural integrity. Here, single crystals of Zr2CuSb3, a potential candidate for the checkerboard lattice, were synthesized using the solution (self-flux) method, and their structure was confirmed via X-ray diffraction. Electrical transport measurements indicate metallic behavior with electron-dominated carriers. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals multiple electron pockets and significant kz broadening due to its large c-axis and low dispersion features in k z. Density functional theory calculations further disentangle the contributions from each high-symmetry plane, providing a comprehensive characterization of electronic behavior.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Structure of Transient Switching States in Ferroelectric AlScN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve the microscopic mechanism of polarization switching in wurtzite ferroelectric AlScN by integrating advanced thin-film fabrication, ferroelectric switching dynamics characterizations, high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations enabled by a deep neural network-based interatomic potential. Contrary to earlier interpretations proposing a transient nonpolar intermediate phase, we demonstrate that the broad transitional regions previously observed in STEM images are projection artifacts resulting from the intrinsic three-dimensional zigzag morphology of 180$^\circ$ domain walls, which are a characteristic form of inversion domain boundary. This is further confirmed by STEM imaging of strategically prepared, partially switched Al$_{0.75}$Sc$_{0.25}$N thin films. Our simulations reveal that switching proceeds through collective, column-by-column atomic displacements, directly explaining the emergence of zigzag-shaped domain walls, and is consistent with the nucleation-limited switching behavior observed in experimental switching dynamic measurements. Furthermore, we show that increasing Sc content systematically lowers domain wall energy and associated nucleation barrier, thereby reducing the switching field in agreement with experimental trends. These findings establish a direct connection between local domain wall structure, switching kinetics, and macroscopic ferroelectric behavior.</description>

      <title>Interplay between trimer structure and magnetic ground state in Ba5Ru3O12 probed by Neutron and muSR techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06113v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a detailed inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and muon spin relaxation (muSR) investigation of a trimer Ruthenate Ba5Ru3O12 system, which undergoes long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at TN = 60 K. The INS reveals two distinct spin wave excitations below TN: one at 5.6 meV and the other at 10-15 meV. By accompanying the INS spectra based on a linear spin wave theory using SpinW software and machine learning force fields (MLFFs), we show that Ba5Ru3O12 exhibits spin frustration due to competing exchange interactions between neighboring and next-neighboring Ru-moments, exchange anisotropy, and strong spin-orbit coupling, which yields a non-collinear spin structure, in contrast to other ruthenate trimers in this series. Interestingly, these magnetic excitations do not completely vanish even at high temperatures above TN, evidencing short-range magnetic correlations in this trimer system. This is further supported by muSR spectroscopy, which exhibits a gradual drop in the initial asymmetry around the magnetic phase transition and is further verified through maximum entropy analysis. The results of muSR spectroscopy indicate a dynamic nature of magnetic order, attributed to local magnetic anisotropy within the trimer as a result of local structural distortion and different hybridization, consistent with canted spin-structure. We predict the ground state of Ru3O12-isolated trimer through theoretical calculations, which agree with the experimentally observed spin excitation</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and implement numerically a phase field model for the growth and detachment of a gas bubble resting on an electrode and being filled with hydrogen produced by water electrolysis. The bubble is surrounded by a viscous liquid, has a prescribed static contact angle and is also subject to gravitational forces. We compute, as a function of the static contact angle, the time at which the bubble detaches from the substrate and what volume it has at that time. We also investigate de dependence of the detachment time on other parameters such as the applied voltage and the hydrogen ion concentration at the fluid bulk.</description>

      <title>FDTRImageEnhancer: Combining Physics-Informed Deconvolution and Microstructure-Aware Deep Learning to Enhance Thermal Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present FDTRImageEnhancer, an open-source computational framework that improves thermal conductivity mapping from Frequency Domain ThermoReflectance (FDTR) phase data by integrating a physics-based Gaussian convolution abstraction with microstructure-aware deep learning. The Gaussian kernel models the spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, while k-means clustering of high-resolution structural images reduces the parameter space for inverse modeling. A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the detection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in conventional FDTR inversions. Demonstrated on finite element-generated synthetic data, the framework recovers bulk values within less than 0.5% error and qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image resolution. Full Python code and datasets are provided for reproducibility, with the methodology readily adaptable to other inverse thermal transport problems.</description>

      <title>Sequence-Defined Phase Behavior of Poly(N-Isopropylacrylamide-co-Acrylamide) in Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise arrangement of different chemical moieties in a polymer determines its thermophysical properties. How the sequence of moieties impacts the properties of a polymer is an outstanding problem in polymer science. Herein, we address this problem for the thermoresponsive property of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylamide) in water using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Eight distinct copolymers, each with a different arrangement of NIPAM(N-isopropylacrylamide) and AM (acrylamide) monomers, are considered. The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) shows a strong correlation with the mean block length of the periodic sequences of the copolymer. We further identify copolymer sequences that exhibit both the LCST and upper critical solution temperature (UCST). Moreover, there are sequences that do not show any LCST or UCST for the temperature range explored in this study. This wide variability in thermorepsonsive property is found to be closely linked to the the extent of hydrongen bond formation in the system, which appears to have a significant correlation with the monomer sequence of the copolymer. These findings offer new directions in the design of structurally diverse thermoresponsive copolymers.</description>

      <title>CrystalDiT: A Diffusion Transformer for Crystal Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure generation that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend of architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs, CrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive bias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent system. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a balanced training strategy, our approach achieves 9.62% SUN (Stable, Unique, Novel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including FlowMM (4.38%) and MatterGen (3.42%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28% unique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates, demonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than complexity for materials discovery. Our results suggest that in data-limited scientific domains, carefully designed simple architectures outperform sophisticated alternatives that are prone to overfitting.</description>

      <title>Optimal Geometric Design of Thermoelectric Metamaterials for Enhancing Power Generation: An Interpretative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric metamaterials featuring width modulation through constrictions (constricted geometries) have emerged as a promising approach for improving heat management and thermoelectric performance. Through a combination of theoretical calculations, analytical formalism, and validation against experimental data, it is shown that thermoelectric performance in such geometries is governed by two fundamental mechanisms of pure geometrical origin: (i) a characteristic scaling behavior of resistance with Transmissivity, and (ii) the critical formation of the Constriction Thermal Resistance. Hourglass-shaped thermoelectric legs - identified as optimal in recent experiments - are found to exhibit the same underlying transport mechanisms observed in other constricted profiles, including single and multiple sharp constrictions. The commonly used Geometric Parameter is found to be insufficient for capturing the full influence of geometry on transport, whereas Transmissivity serves as a robust descriptor of constricted geometry, independent of material choice or device operating conditions. A universal scaling formalism is derived linking electrical and thermal resistances, along with key thermoelectric performance metrics, to the Transmissivity. A unified optimization framework is also developed for composite legs, incorporating both constricted material and contact electrodes. This framework indicates that previously reported performance gains may be largely attributed to contact resistance, rather than geometry alone. Transmissivity is established as a key geometric descriptor, enabling generalized design principles and global optimization criteria for enhancing thermoelectric power generation. This analysis elucidates new avenues in the design of thermoelectric metamaterials for efficient energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Low Power, Scalable Nanofabrication via Photon Upconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro- and nanoscale fabrication, which enables precise construction of intricate three-dimensional structures, is of foundational importance for advancing innovation in plasmonics, nanophotonics, and biomedical applications. However, scaling fabrication to industrially relevant levels remains a significant challenge. We demonstrate that triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) offers a unique opportunity to increase fabrication speeds and scalability of micro- and nanoscale 3D structures. Due to its nonlinearity and low power requirements, TTA-UC enables localized polymerization with nanoscale resolutions while simultaneously printing millions of voxels per second through optical parallelization using off-the-shelf light-emitting diodes and digital micromirror devices. Our system design and component integration empower fabrication with a minimum lateral feature size down to 230 nm and speeds up to 112 million voxels per second at a power of 7.0 nW per voxel. This combination of high resolution and fast print speed demonstrates that TTA-UC is a significant advancement in nanofabrication technique, evidenced by the fabrication of hydrophobic nanostructures on a square-centimeter scale, paving the way for industrial nanomanufacturing.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Entropy Calculations of Water Predict the Interiors of Uranus and Neptune to be 15-30% Colder than Previous Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ab initio free energy calculations are employed to derive the entropy of liquid and superionic water over a wide range of conditions in the interiors of Uranus and Neptune. The resulting adiabats are much shallower in pressure-temperature space than those adopted for earlier models of Uranus and Neptune. Our models for their interiors are thus much colder, increasing the likelihood that diamond rain or the recently predicted phase separation of planetary ices has occurred in the mantles of ice giant planets. Based on our ab initio data, we construct interior models for Uranus and Neptune with the Concentric MacLaurin Spheroid method that match the existing gravity measurements. We compare fully convective models with models that include a convective boundary between liquid and superionic water. We also share a code to characterize giant planet atmospheres where para and ortho hydrogen as well as helium are present.</description>

      <title>Features of Surface Structuring of Direct and Indirect Band Gap Semiconductors by Femtosecond Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of femtosecond (fs) laser radiation on semiconductors with direct (ZnSe, GaAs, CdZnTe) band gap, with the structurally induced direct-to-indirect band gap transition (PbI2, GaSe) and indirect band gap (Si) has been studied. The fs-laser treatment of semiconductors has been performed in the multi-pulse regime in air environment. The influence of fs-laser radiation parameters on surface morphology of the semiconductors has been analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 2D Fourier transform of SEM images, optical photoluminescence spectroscopy. Under the treatment with the fundamental fs-laser radiation (800 nm, about 130-150 fs) both low spatial frequency LIPSS and high spatial frequency LIPSS have been observed. Specific features of LIPSS of two types (low spatial frequency LIPSS and high spatial frequency LIPSS) and other structure peculiarities (grooves, grains, different defects in periodic structure, i.e. loops, strip breaks, and ablation products) have been also analysed. The formation mechanisms of LIPSS are also considered within the scope of two approaches,namely an electromagnetic approach and matter reorganization processes.</description>

      <title>Polarization-dependent chiral transport and chiral solitons in spin Kitaev models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in synthetic quantum matter allow researchers to design quantum models inaccessible in traditional materials. Here, we propose protocols to engineer a new class of quantum spin models, which we call spin Kitaev models. The building blocks are basic spin-exchange interactions combined with locally selective Floquet pulses, a capability recently demonstrated in a range of experimental platforms. The resulting flip-flip and flop-flop terms lead to intriguing quantum transport dynamics beyond conventional spin models. For instance, in the absence of a magnetic field, spin excitations polarized along the $x$ and $y$ axes propagate chirally in opposite directions, producing polarization-dependent spin transport. In the large-spin limit, the spin Kitaev model maps to a nonlinear Hatano-Nelson model, where the interplay of nonlinearity and the underlying curvature yields polarization-dependent chiral solitons. A magnetic field binds two oppositely polarized chiral solitons into a chiral solitonic molecule, whose travel direction depends on its orientation. Our results, directly accessible in current experiments, open new opportunities for simulating transport in curved spaces and for applications in spintronics, information processing, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural network for fatigue life prediction of irradiated austenitic and ferritic/martensitic steels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework to predict the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life of irradiated austenitic and ferritic/martensitic (F/M) steels used in nuclear reactors. These materials experience cyclic loading and irradiation at elevated temperatures, causing complex degradation that traditional empirical models fail to capture accurately. The developed PINN model incorporates physical fatigue life constraints into its loss function, improving prediction accuracy and generalizability. Trained on 495 data points, including both irradiated and unirradiated conditions, the model outperforms traditional machine learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and the conventional Neural Network. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis identifies strain amplitude, irradiation dose, and testing temperature as dominant features, each inversely correlated with fatigue life, consistent with physical understanding. PINN captures saturation behaviour in fatigue life at higher strain amplitudes in F/M steels. Overall, the PINN framework offers a reliable and interpretable approach for predicting fatigue life in irradiated alloys, enabling informed alloy selection.</description>

      <title>Orbital-selective two-gap superconductivity in kagome metal CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have revealed anisotropic multigap superconductivity in the kagome metal CsV3Sb5. However, the interplay between its multi-orbital character and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in governing multiple superconducting gaps remains incompletely understood. In this work, we theoretically investigate the superconducting gap of CsV3Sb5 by combining first-principles calculations with superconducting density functional theory (SCDFT). Our results demonstrate that orbital-selective pairing drives the observed two-gap superconductivity in CsV3Sb5. Specifically, the two distinct gaps exhibit strong orbital dependence: a large, highly anisotropic gap (average magnitude ~0.64 meV) primarily originates from V-3d orbitals, while a small, isotropic gap (~0.25 meV) is associated with the Sb-5pz orbital. The V-3d orbitals strongly couple to the in-plane V-V bond-stretching and out-of-plane V-Sb bending phonon modes, whereas the kagome-plane Sb-5pz orbital weakly interacts with Cs shearing phonon mode. Moreover, our calculations reveal EPC-induced band renormalization, manifested as kinks at approximately -13 meV and -30 meV in the electronic dispersion, consistent with prior experimental observations. These findings provide fundamental insights into the orbital-selective superconductivity and EPC mechanisms in kagome CsV3Sb5.</description>

      <title>A universal machine learning model for the electronic density of states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last few years several ``universal'' interatomic potentials have appeared, using machine-learning approaches to predict energy and forces of atomic configurations with arbitrary composition and structure, with an accuracy often comparable with that of the electronic-structure calculations they are trained on. Here we demonstrate that these generally-applicable models can also be built to predict explicitly the electronic structure of materials and molecules. We focus on the electronic density of states (DOS), and develop PET-MAD-DOS, a rotationally unconstrained transformer model built on the Point Edge Transformer (PET) architecture, and trained on the Massive Atomistic Diversity (MAD) dataset. We demonstrate our model's predictive abilities on samples from diverse external datasets, showing also that the DOS can be further manipulated to obtain accurate band gap predictions. A fast evaluation of the DOS is especially useful in combination with molecular simulations probing matter in finite-temperature thermodynamic conditions. To assess the accuracy of PET-MAD-DOS in this context, we evaluate the ensemble-averaged DOS and the electronic heat capacity of three technologically relevant systems: lithium thiophosphate (LPS), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and a high entropy alloy (HEA). By comparing with bespoke models, trained exclusively on system-specific datasets, we show that our universal model achieves semi-quantitative agreement for all these tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning can be performed using a small fraction of the bespoke data, yielding models that are comparable to, and sometimes better than, fully-trained bespoke models.</description>

      <title>Design of broadband optical gain in GaSb-based waveguide amplifiers with asymmetric quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A design strategy for achieving broadband optical gain in GaSb-based semiconductor amplifiers operating beyond 2 \mu m is presented. By employing asymmetric GaInSb/AlGaAsSb quantum wells (QWs) of varying thicknesses, a flat and wide gain spectrum is demonstrated. The approach leverages carrier density and transition energy tuning across QWs to access various energy levels at specific current densities. Simulations using "Harold" self-consistent environment predict a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) gain bandwidth exceeding 340 nm for a structure comprising one 7 nm and three 13 nm-thick QWs. The modelling parameters were validated against experimental data, ensuring a robust framework for designing broadband amplifiers and superluminescent diodes for mid-infrared applications.</description>

      <title>Accounting the size distribution of HTS granules for the critical current density from magnetic measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The determination of the critical current density from magnetic hysteresis loops is widely used to characterize and compare superconducting samples. Magnetic hysteresis loops for tapes and single crystals depend on both the critical current density and sample size. The latter sets the scale of supercurrent circulation. However, in polycrystalline high-temperature superconductors prepared by solid-phase synthesis or by sol-gel method, the magnetization is determined by the circulation of supercurrents in individual grains. The paper discusses the effect of the grain size distribution on the effective scale of current circulation. Log-normal and Weibull distributions are both considered as possible for grain sizes. The effective size for calculating the intragrain current density has been shown to be significantly larger than the average grain size.</description>

      <title>Core-mantle partitioning and the bulk Earth abundances of hydrogen and carbon: Implications for their origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determined the metal/silicate partition coefficients of hydrogen and carbon, DH and DC, simultaneously under typical conditions of Earth's core formation. Experiments demonstrate that both DH and DC diminish in the presence of carbon and hydrogen, respectively, indicating their strong interactions in liquid metal. With these partitioning data, we investigated the core and bulk Earth abundances of hydrogen and carbon based on core formation scenarios that are compatible with the bulk silicate Earth composition and the mass fraction and density deficit of the core. The results of the single-stage core formation modelling are markedly different from those using DH and DC individually determined in earlier experiments, indicating that the Earth building blocks do not match enstatite chondrites in water abundance and require contributions by carbonaceous chondrites. The multi-stage core formation models combined with an Earth accretion scenario accounting for isotopic composition show 0.18-0.49 wt% H and 0.19-1.37 wt% C in the core, leading to 0.53-1.40 wt% H2O (present as H in the core) and 0.07-0.44 wt% C in the bulk Earth. Our modelling also demonstrates that up to 53% and 72% of Earth's water (hydrogen) and carbon, respectively, could have been derived from non-carbonaceous chondritic materials.</description>

      <title>Bridging Grain Mapping and Dark Field X-ray Microscopy for Multiscale Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resolving how defects emerge and interact within the hierarchical structure of polycrystalline materials remains a core challenge in materials science. Grain-mapping methods such as three-dimensional X-ray diffraction (3DXRD) and diffraction contrast tomography (DCT) provide essential mesoscale context but lack the resolution to image lattice defects. Conversely, high-resolution methods like Dark Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) capture lattice distortions but not the surrounding microstructure. Here, we introduce a transferable framework that unifies these complementary approaches into a single, non-destructive workflow. Enabled by open-source software, the method translates grain orientation and position data into precise goniometer settings for DFXM imaging without dismounting or reorienting the sample. Applied to an iron polycrystal containing 1100 grains, DFXM motor positions were calculated for all grains within seconds, enabling on-the-fly targeting of specific grains. This allows reproducible zooming from the millimetre-scale aggregate to individual dislocations. We resolve three-dimensional misorientation fields across grain boundaries with 36 nm pixel size, directly capturing grain-grain interactions within their microstructural context. Finally, we show transferability from LabDCT to synchrotron and XFEL platforms, enabling new ways of studying defect interactions across scales.</description>

      <title>Optimization of superconducting properties of F-doped SmFeAsO by cubic anvil high-pressure technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We optimize the synthesis conditions for SmFeAsO0.80F0.20 (Sm1111) bulks using a cubic-anvil high-pressure (CA-HP) apparatus through both ex-situ and in-situ processes, applying pressures of up to 4 GPa and heating temperatures of up to 1600{\deg}C. A comprehensive characterization has been performed, including structural, microstructural, transport, and magnetic measurements. Our findings indicate that a modest growth pressure of approximately 0.5 GPa is sufficient for the formation of the Sm1111 phase in the ex-situ process. In contrast, the in-situ process requires higher synthesis pressure (4 GPa) and temperature (1400 {\deg}C for 1 hour) to achieve the Sm1111 phase with enhanced superconducting properties. Notably, the optimized in-situ process significantly reduces the reaction time needed for the formation of the Sm1111 phase compared to conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP), leading to an increase in the transition temperature by 3 K and improvements in critical current density (Jc). Conversely, the optimized ex-situ process results in an onset transition temperature (Tc) of approximately 53 K, similar to that of CSP, though it enhances the Jc by an order of magnitude. Despite these advancements, a small amount of impurity phases, as observed during CSP, persists in all Sm1111 samples prepared through either the in-situ or ex-situ CA-HP processes. These results suggest that the in-situ process under optimized conditions (1400 {\deg}C, 4 GPa for 1 hour) can effectively improve the superconducting properties of Sm1111. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis comparing these results with high gas pressure techniques, spark plasma sintering, and CSP methods suggests that a small amount of impurity phases in Sm1111 is persistent and cannot be completely eliminated by various pressure techniques, even at the applied pressure of up to 4 GPa.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature anisotropic in-plane spin dynamics in graphene induced by PdSe$_2$ proximity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures offer a versatile platform for tailoring electrical, magnetic, optical, and spin transport properties of materials through proximity effects. Notably, hexagonal transition metal dichalcogenides have been shown to induce valley-Zeeman spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in graphene, resulting in significant spin lifetime anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane spin orientations. However, in-plane lifetimes remain isotropic due to the inherent threefold symmetry of the heterostructure. Here, we demonstrate that pentagonal PdSe$_2$, characterised by unique in-plane anisotropy, induces an unprecedented gate-tunable SOC in graphene. Our measurements reveal a remarkable 10-fold modulation of the spin lifetime for spins oriented within the graphene plane at room temperature. Moreover, the directional dependence of the spin lifetimes, along the three spatial directions, suggests the existence of a persistent in-plane spin texture component that dominates the spin dynamics. These findings deepen our understanding of spin dynamics in van der Waals heterostructures and open avenues for designing and engineering novel topological phases in graphene-based heterostructures within the strong SOC regime.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric stress engineering of dense dislocations in brittle superconductors for strong vortex pinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large lossless currents in high-temperature superconductors (HTS) critically rely on dense defects with suitable size and dimensionality to pin vortices, with dislocations being particularly effective due to their one-dimensional geometry to interact extensively with vortex lines. However, in non-metallic compounds such as HTS with rigid lattices, conventional deformation methods typically lead to catastrophic fracture rather than dislocation-mediated plasticity, making it a persistent challenge to introduce dislocations at high density. Here, we propose an asymmetric stress field strategy using extrusion to directly nucleate a high-density of dislocations in HTS by activating shear-driven lattice slip and twisting under superimposed hydrostatic compression. As demonstrated in iron-based superconductors (IBS), atomic displacements of nearly one angstrom trigger the formation of tilted dislocation lines with a density approaching that of metals. With further structural refinement, these dislocations serve as strong pinning centers that lead to a fivefold enhancement in the current-carrying capacity of IBS at 33 T, along with low anisotropy and a large irreversibility field. This work not only establishes a scalable route to engineer pinning landscapes in HTS, but also offers a generalizable framework for manipulating dislocation structures in rigid crystalline systems.</description>

Abstract: The spring network model constitutes the backbone in the representations of a host of physical systems. In this work, we report the disturbance-driven microscopic dynamics of an isolated, closed spring network of spherical topology in mechanical equilibrium. The system permits self-intersection. We first show the lowest-energy configurations of the closed spring networks as packings of regular triangles. The dynamics of the disturbed spring network is analyzed from the multiple perspectives of energetics, structural instability, and speed distribution. We reveal the crumpling transition of strongly disturbed spring networks and the rapid convergence of the speed distribution toward the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. This work demonstrates the rich physics arising from the interplay of flexibility and dynamics. The results may yield insights into the shape fluctuation and structural instability of deformable membranes from the dynamical perspective.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent dynamical Hubbard functional for correlated solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body functionals of the Green's function can provide fundamental advances in electronic-structure calculations, due to their ability to accurately predict both spectral and thermodynamic properties, such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments and total energies of materials. However, fully first-principles, self-consistent calculations with these dynamical functionals remain a major challenge, ultimately limiting their application to thermodynamic quantities, and restricting spectral predictions to one-shot calculations. In this paper, we present a fully self-consistent treatment of the electronic structure of solids using a dynamical functional. Our approach leverages the so-called dynamical Hubbard functional, which generalizes the DFT+$U$ correction by incorporating frequency-dependent screening, augmenting the static density functional to accurately describe both spectral and thermodynamic properties of materials with $d$- or $f$-localized orbitals near the Fermi level. To enable this, we employ the algorithmic-inversion method based on a sum-over-poles representation, resulting in a numerically accurate self-consistent scheme for frequency-integrated properties, while keeping real-axis spectral resolution for dynamically-resolved quantities. Using this framework, we study the paradigmatic correlated solid SrVO$_3$, accurately reproducing its spectral features, essentially confirming previous one-shot predictions, and improving the description of its equilibrium properties, such as the equilibrium volume and bulk modulus, bringing these significantly closer to experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Lost Data in Electron Microscopy</title>

Abstract: The goal of this study is to estimate the amount of lost data in electron microscopy and to analyze the extent to which experimentally acquired images are utilized in peer-reviewed scientific publications. Analysis of the number of images taken on electron microscopes at a core user facility and the number of images subsequently included in peer-reviewed scientific journals revealed low efficiency of data utilization. More than 90% of electron microscopy data generated during routine instrument operation remain unused. Of the more than 150000 electron microscopy images evaluated in this study, only approximately 3500 (just over 2%) were made available in publications. Thus, the amount of lost data in electron microscopy can be estimated as &gt;90% (in terms of data being recorded but not being published in peer-reviewed literature). On the one hand, these results highlight a shortcoming in the optimal use of microscopy images; on the other hand, they indicate the existence of a large pool of electron microscopy data that can facilitate research in data science and the development of AI-based projects. The considerations important to unlock the potential of lost data are discussed in the present article.</description>

Abstract: MXenes, a family of 2D transition metal compounds, have emerged as promising materials due to their unique electronic properties and tunable surface chemistry. However, the translation of these nanoscale properties into macroscopic devices is constrained by suitable cross-linking strategies that enable both processability and controlled inter-flake charge transport. Herein, we demonstrate the tunability of interfaces and the inter-layer spacing between Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXene flakes through molecular cross-linking with homologous diamines. Oleylamine was first used to stabilize MXenes in chloroform, followed by diamine-mediated cross-linking to tune precisely the interlayer spacing. Grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXRD/GIWAXS) confirmed the correlation between ligand chain length and inter-layer spacing, which was further supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, we investigated the charge transport properties of thin films consisting of these diamine-crosslinked Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXenes and observed a strong dependence of the conductivity on the interlayer spacing. The dominating charge transport mechanism is variable range hopping (VRH) in accordance with the structure analysis of the films. Finally, we probed chemiresistive vapor sensing in MXene composites, observing pronounced water sensitivity and selectivity, highlighting their potential for use in humidity sensors. Insights into molecular cross-linking and its impact on charge transport open avenues for next-generation MXene-based electronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Electronic density of states (DOS) plays a crucial role in determining and understanding materials properties. We investigate the machine learnability of additive atomic contributions to electronic DOS, focusing on atom-projected DOS rather than structural DOS. This approach for structure-property mapping is both scalable and transferable, and achieves high prediction accuracy for pure and compound silicon and carbon structures of various sizes and configurations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of this model to complex Sn-S-Se compound structures. Utilizing locally trained DOS is shown to significantly enhance the accuracy of predicting material properties, including band energy, Fermi energy, heat capacity, and magnetic susceptibility. Our findings indicate that directly learning atomic DOS, rather than structural DOS, improves the efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability of machine learning in structure-property mapping. This streamlined approach reduces computational complexity, paving the way for examination of electronic structures in materials without the need for computationally expensive ab initio calculations</description>

      <title>Kinetic roughening transition of ice crystals and its implications during recrystallization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypothesis Roughening transitions at solid-liquid interfaces govern crystal morphology in diverse systems. In ice crystallization, these transitions control interfacial faceting and surface kinetics. Faceted morphologies are often associated with ice-active molecules, which inhibit recrystallization and are essential for cryopreservation. We hypothesize that kinetic roughening transitions can induce faceting even in the absence of ice-active agents, particularly at high solute concentrations with depressed melting points, potentially complicating the interpretation of crystal morphology as an indicator of ice activity.
  Experiments We investigated the kinetic roughening transition of ice in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and proline-water solutions using cryomicroscopy and real-time image analysis. Crystals grew in microdroplets, maintaining near-equilibrium conditions as solute concentration increased during growth due to conversion of liquid water to ice. Antifreeze protein type III (AFPIII) was applied to distinguish intrinsic roughening from adsorption-mediated effects.
  Findings A distinct kinetic roughening transition temperature (TR = -16.0 +/- 0.2 oC) was identified, marking a shift from rounded disks at higher temperatures to faceted hexagonal plates at lower temperatures, independent of solute type. Recrystallization below TR revealed asymmetry between growth and melting interfaces. AFPIII promoted faceting even above TR, consistent with stabilization of step edges and elevation of the roughening transition temperature. These results clarify the interplay between intrinsic interface kinetics and molecular adsorption, with implications for interpreting ice morphology, surface roughening, and cryopreservation design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chalcohalides are an emerging family of semiconductors with irresistible material properties, shaped by the intricate interplay between their unique structural chemistry and vibrational dynamics. Despite their promise for next-generation solar energy conversion devices, their intrinsic optoelectronic properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we focus on the (Sb,Bi)(S,Se)(Br,I) system, a subset of compounds that share the same quasi-1D crystal structure. Using a two-step physical vapor deposition (PVD) process, we synthesize the eight ternary chalcohalide compounds, demonstrating bandgaps ranging from 1.38 to 2.08 eV with sharp, single-component photoluminescence (PL) peaks. In a parallel exploration of carrier dynamics and intrinsic electron-phonon interactions -- comprehensively studied using power-, temperature-dependent, and time-resolved PL measurements -- we map their direct impact on optoelectronic performance. Supported by first-principles density functional theory (DFT) defect calculations, we establish clear structure-property relations, identifying solid-solutions engineering as an effective means to fine-tune the native phonon structures and further suppress non-radiative recombination. This study provides a blueprint for optimizing chalcohalides as high-efficiency materials across a wide range of optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>How does picosecond structural deformation of (Ba,Sr)TiO$_{3}$ relate to the pyroelectric effect?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pyroelectric effect in ferroelectric thin films is typically composed of different contributions, which are difficult to disentangle. In addition, clamping to the substrate interface plays an important role. We studied epitaxial (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ thin films grown on NdScO$_3$ to see if time-resolved measurements can shed more light on the complex interaction. In particular, we compare standard measurements of the pyroelectric coefficient by temperature-dependent hysteresis loops to transient deformation measurements on picosecond timescales in the same material. The advantage of the time-resolved approach lies in its increased sensitivity in thin films compared to that of polarization hysteresis measurements. Whereas a fast thermal expansion of the ferroelectric thin film was observed after femtosecond laser excitation of the intermediate SrRuO$_3$ layer, heat diffusion simulations reveal frustration of the thermal expansion, which might be explained with the charge dynamics at the Schottky barrier formed at the SrRuO$_3$/(Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. More studies are required to quantitatively assess the individual contributions to the pyroelectric coefficient of the materials used in our layer architecture.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal topological solitons in active metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From protein motifs to black holes, topological solitons are pervasive nonlinear excitations that are robust and can be driven by external fields. So far, existing driving mechanisms all accelerate solitons and antisolitons in opposite directions. Here we introduce a local driving mechanism for solitons that accelerates both solitons and antisolitons in the same direction instead: non-reciprocal driving. To realize this mechanism, we construct an active mechanical metamaterial consisting of non-reciprocally coupled oscillators subject to a bistable potential. We find that such nonlinearity coaxes non-reciprocal excitations - so-called non-Hermitian skin waves, which are typically unstable - into robust oneway (anti)solitons. We harness such non-reciprocal topological solitons by constructing an active waveguide capable of transmitting and filtering unidirectional information. Finally, we illustrate this mechanism in another class of metamaterials that displays the breaking of 'supersymmetry' causing only antisolitons to be driven. Our observations and models demonstrate a subtle interplay between non-reciprocity and topological solitons, whereby solitons create their own driving force by locally straining the material. Beyond the scope of our study, non-reciprocal solitons might provide an efficient driving mechanism for robotic locomotion and could emerge in other settings, e.g. quantum mechanics, optics and soft matter.</description>

Abstract: Breathing solitons consist of a fast beating wave within a compact envelope of stable shape and velocity. They can propagate and carry information and energy in a variety of contexts such as plasmas, optical fibers and cold atoms, but propagating breathers have remained elusive when energy conservation is broken. Here, we report on the observation of breathing, unidirectional, arbitrarily long-lived solitons in non-reciprocal, non-conservative active metamaterials. Combining precision desktop experiments, numerical simulations and perturbation theory on generalizations of the sine-Gordon and nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, we demonstrate that unidirectional breathers generically emerge in weakly nonlinear non-reciprocal materials, and that their dynamics are governed by an unstable fixed point. Crucially, breathing solitons can persist for arbitrarily long times provided: (i) this fixed point displays a bifurcation when a delicate balance between energy injection and dissipation is struck; (ii) the initial conditions allow the dynamics to reach this bifurcation point. Importantly, discrete effects tend to stabilize these non-reciprocal breathers over a wider range of initial conditions. Our work establishes non-reciprocity as a promising avenue to generate stable nonlinear unidirectional waves, and could be generalized beyond metamaterials to optics, soft matter and superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>The quantum metric of electrons with spin-momentum locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum materials are characterized by electromagnetic responses intrinsically linked to the geometry and topology of electronic wavefunctions, encoded in the quantum metric and Berry curvature. Whereas Berry curvature-mediated transport effects have been identified in several magnetic and nonmagnetic systems, quantum metric-induced transport phenomena remain limited to topological antiferromagnets. Here we show that spin-momentum locking -- a general characteristic of the electronic states at surfaces and interfaces of spin-orbit coupled materials -- leads to a finite quantum metric. This metric activates a nonlinear in-plane magnetoresistance that we measure and electrically control in 111-oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum metric effects in a vast class of materials and enable previously unexplored strategies to design functionalities based on quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>Architecting mechanisms of damage in topological metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Architecting mechanisms of damage in metamaterials by leveraging lattice topology and geometry poses a vital yet complex challenge, essential for engineering desirable mechanical responses. Of these metamaterials, Maxwell lattices, which are on the verge of mechanical stability, offer significant potential for advanced functionality. By leveraging their robust topological features, they enable precise control of effective elastic properties, manipulation of stress localisation and delocalisation across specific domains, and targeted global damage that follows local fracture events. In this work, we identify topology and geometry-dependent parameters that establish a simple, yet precise, framework for designing the behaviour of non-idealised Maxwell lattices and their damage processes. We numerically explore the underlying phenomenology to demonstrate how this framework can guide or arrest damage in lattices, both with and without domain walls and additional boundary constraints. Our approach uncovers a robust way to manipulate the mechanisms of damage and the path they follow in metamaterials, with further insight into crack arrest, diversion, and shielding.</description>

      <title>Effective potential of scalar Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of effective potential for the scalar Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics in one-loop is presented in this letter. The planar and non-local Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics is so coupled to a complex scalar field sector in 1+2 dimensions, where we achieve the Lee-Wick pseudo-scalar electrodynamics. The effective action formalism is applied such that the quantum corrections are examined in one loop to the scalar effective potential as function of the classical field, of the Lee-Wick mass, and also of the coupling constants of this model. The instability of the effective potential is investigated due to Lee-Wick mass.</description>

      <title>Direct probe of magnetic field effects on phonons by ultrasound propagation in a quasi-two-dimensional honeycomb magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the phonon behavior of a Co-based honeycomb frustrated magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ under magnetic field applied perpendicular to the honeycomb plane. The temperature and field dependence of the sound velocity and sound attenuation unveil prominent spin-lattice coupling in this material, promoting ultrasound as a sensitive probe for magnetic properties. An out-of-plane ferrimagnetic order is determined below the N\'eel temperature $T_N=27$~K. A comprehensive analysis of our data further supports a triple-Q ground state of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. Furthermore, the ultrasound data were systematically compared to the thermal transport results from literature, to unveil the importance of phononic contribution to the observed transport behaviors.</description>

      <title>Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility, the rate at which the relaxation time grows with decreasing temperature, is central to unravelling the glass transition. Fragility is often associated with dynamic heterogeneity, implying that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using: Lennard Jones (LJ) and Weeks Chandler Andersen (WCA) systems, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q,p) system, where fragility is varied by changing the potential softness. We define a structural order parameter based on a mean field caging potential and analyse energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic free energy barrier slope correlates with fragility, the microscopic free energy barrier does not show a consistent trend. Instead, it exhibits a strong correlation with a structure dynamics correlation measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble simulations. Interestingly, the two systems showing the highest structure dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8,5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, large non Gaussian parameters, yet low four point susceptibilities, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation length and mobility contrast. Both systems lie in the enthalpy dominated regime and are close to the spinodal, pointing to mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. Our results reveal that structure dynamics correlation is more closely linked to the contrast in individual particle mobility than to the spatial extent of dynamic correlations that typically scale with fragility.</description>

      <title>Enhanced phonon-drag by nanoscale design of homoepitaxial \hbox{$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phonon drag may be harnessed for thermoelectric generators and devices. Here, we demonstrate the geometric control of the phonon-drag contribution to the thermopower. In nanometer-thin electrically conducting $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films homoepitaxially-grown on insulating substrates it is enhanced from -0,4 mV/K to up to -3 mV/K at 100 K by choice of the film thickness. Analysis of the temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficients reveal that a crossover from three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional electron-phonon interaction occurs for film thicknesses below 75~nm. The ratio of phonon-phonon to electron-phonon relaxation times in these confined structures is $10$ times larger than that of bulk. Generally the phonon drag can be tuned depending on the relations between the phonon-drag interaction length $\lambda_\text{PD}$, the phonon mean free path $\lambda$ and the film thickness $d$. Phonon drag can be enhanced for $\lambda_\text{PD}\gg\lambda&gt;d$.</description>

      <title>4D-PreNet: A Unified Preprocessing Framework for 4D-STEM Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift, and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements. Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet, an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated characterization.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: From Resolving Theoretical Foundations of Chiral(ity)-Induced Spin Selectivity to Pioneering Implementations in Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chiral(ity)-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where electrons passing through a chiral medium acquire significant spin-polarization at ambient temperatures, has been widely observed experimentally, yet its theoretical foundations remain actively debated. Open questions persist regarding whether CISS originates from helical geometry or more general chirality, and whether a unified mechanism can account for phenomena across solid-state and soft-matter systems, mesoscopic films, and single molecules. Clarifying the interrelations between existing models is essential to determine if a universal picture of CISS can be found or whether system-specific models are required, and if so, where their common starting point should lie for a workable classification of CISS manifestations. Despite this theoretical fragmentation, recent studies of CISS effects in electron transfer systems, magnetic field sensitivity and coherence of radical pair reactions, polarized electroluminescence in chiral hybrid perovskites, DNA-based biosensors, and enantioselective detection, highlight its broad conceptual relevance and potential applications in spintronics, molecular sensors, and quantum information processing. In this review, we help bridge the gap between theory, experiment, and implementation, with a particular focus on prospects for quantum sensing and metrology. We outline fundamental frameworks of CISS, clarifying what constitutes the `chiral', the `induced', and the `spin-selectivity' that makes up CISS, before going on to survey key model realizations and their assumptions. We examine some of the emerging quantum sensing applications and assess the model-specific implications, in particular exemplifying these in the context of spin-correlated radical pairs, which offer a promising, tunable, and biomimetic platform for emerging molecular quantum technologies.</description>
