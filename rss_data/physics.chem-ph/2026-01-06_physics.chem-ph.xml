      <title>High-Level Ab Initio Investigation of the NH2 + O Reaction: Insights into the Potential Energy Surface and Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reaction between NH2 and O represents a critical oxidation pathway in the combustion of ammonia and hydrazine. However, significant discrepancies persist among previous experimental and theoretical studies regarding its kinetics. In this work, we present a high-level theoretical characterization of the NH2O potential energy surface (PES) using the internally contracted multi-reference configuration interaction (ic-MRCI) method with the cc-pVTZ-F12 basis set. The full-dimensional PES was constructed via the permutation invariant polynomial-neural network (PIP-NN) approach, encompassing all energetically accessible channels, including HNO + H, NH + OH, NO + H2, and HON + H. Stationary points were characterized with particular attention to the intricate multi-reference nature of the system. Based on the refined PES, we computed thermal rate coefficients and branching ratios over a wide temperature range. Our results provide accurate, first-principles kinetic data that are essential for refining combustion models of nitrogen-containing fuels.</description>

      <title>Ion Clustering Regulated by Extreme Nanoconfinement Enables Mechanosensitive Nanochannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanosensitive ion nanochannels regulate transport by undergoing conformational changes within nanopores. However, achieving precise control over these conformational states remains a major challenge for both artificial soft or solid pores. Here, we propose an alternative mechanism that modulates the charge carrier density inside nanopores, inspired by transistors in solid-state electronics. This strategy leverages a novel phenomenon of confinement-regulated ion clustering in two-dimensional extremely confined nanochannels, revealed by extensive $\mu$s-scale enhanced-sampling molecular simulations based on an \emph{ab initio}-refined force field and nucleation theory. The resulting \emph{force-ion transistor} enables mechanically gated control of ion transport and provides a conceptual foundation for designing ionic mechanical logic gates. Our findings offer new insights into piezochannel mechanosensing and electromechanical coupling in biosystems beyond conformational signaling, opening pathways to integrate artificial ion channels with neuromorphic devices for processing mechanical stimuli.</description>

      <title>A quadratic-scaling algorithm with guaranteed convergence for quantum coupled-channel calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rigorous quantum dynamics calculations provide essential insights into complex scattering phenomena across atomic and molecular physics, chemical reaction dynamics, and astrochemistry. However, the application of the gold-standard quantum coupled-channel (CC) method has been fundamentally constrained by a steep cubic scaling of computational cost [${O}(N^3)$]. Here, we develop a general, rigorous, and robust method for solving the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation for a single column of the scattering S-matrix with quadratic scaling [${O}(N^2)$] in the number of channels. The Weinberg-regularized Iterative Series Expansion (WISE) algorithm resolves the divergence issues affecting iterative techniques by applying a regularization procedure to the kernel of the multichannel Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation. The method also explicitly incorporates closed-channel effects, including those responsible for multichannel Feshbach resonances. We demonstrate the power of this approach by performing rigorous calculations on He + CO and CO + N$_2$ collisions, achieving exact quantum results with demonstrably quadratic scaling. Our results establish a new computational paradigm, enabling state-to-state quantum scattering computations for complex molecular systems and providing a novel window onto the intricate multichannel molecular collision dynamics.</description>

      <title>Surface energetics of wurtzite and sphalerite polymorphs of zinc sulfide and implications for their formation in nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface energetics of zinc sulfide nanoparticles determines their structure, properties, and occurrence. Using a combination of experimental techniques, we investigated the thermodynamics of the two polymorphs, sphalerite and wurtzite at bulk and nanoscale to understand their occurrence. Calorimetric measurements confirmed that wurtzite has a lower surface energy than sphalerite, which causes a reversal in phase stability at the nanoscale, with wurtzite energetically stable for particle size below 10 nm. Taking these surface energies into account, a simple model of the thermodynamics of the sphalerite - wurtzite transformation as a function of particle size and temperature can explain the occurrence of the zinc sulfide polymorphs in environments as diverse as ore bodies and planetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Effects of Edge Atoms and Channel Width on Charge Storage in Nanoporous Carbon Supercapacitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amorphous structure of nanoporous carbon electrodes in supercapacitors complicates the establishment of clear links between electrode geometry and capacitance. In this work, we examine how specific structural features govern charge storage and explain capacitance variations among carbide-derived carbon (CDC) electrodes. Two key methodological and mechanistic advances are introduced. First, we propose a physically motivated, electric-field-based definition of the ion sphere of influence, which avoids the ambiguity of radial distribution function-based cutoffs and enables a more reliable characterization of local ion--electrode interactions. Second, we introduce an ion-resolved channel-width descriptor that quantifies pore accessibility by identifying the narrowest passage a counter-ion must traverse to enter a pore, directly linking accessibility to ion decoordination. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of supercapacitors comprising realistic CDC electrodes and a room-temperature ionic liquid electrolyte under applied potentials, we show that carbon atoms located at the edges of graphitic sheets consistently accumulate higher charge than basal-plane atoms across all electrode types. The fraction of edge atoms increases with structural disorder and correlates with enhanced capacitance, in agreement with recent experimental findings linking disorder to charge storage. Furthermore, analysis of pore size and channel width reveals that ion decoordination is governed primarily by channel width rather than pore size alone. Together, these results establish edge atom concentration and pore channel width as decisive structural descriptors controlling charge accumulation in nanoporous carbon supercapacitors, providing clear design guidelines for optimizing electrode architectures.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Study of C36 and O@C36 Fullerene Isomers with (C1, C2, Cs, D2, D3h) symmetries: Geometry Optimization, Electrical Properties and Spectroscopic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we conducted a theoretical analysis of specific C36 and O@C36 Fullerene isomers, namely those with (D3h, C1, Cs, C2, D2) symmetries, in the gaseous phase using the DFT method at B3LYP/6-31G* level. We studied geometry optimizations, relative stability, atomization energies, Fermi energy, energy gap, electronic properties, electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, and thermodynamic analysis, along with IR and NMR spectra. Consistently, our findings revealed distinct properties and characteristics among different C36 fullerene isomers. The energetic order of C36 fullerene isomers was established as C36-D3h &lt; C36-C1 &lt; C36-Cs &lt; C36-C2 &lt; C36-D2, a trend unaffected by the encapsulation of oxygen. Notably, the D2 isomer displayed the smallest energy gap, indicating higher electrical conductivity compared to other isomers, while it exhibited the largest gap after encapsulation. Furthermore, we observed that the C1 (D2) isomer exhibited the largest (smallest) Electric dipole moment among the studied C36 isomers, whereas the C2 (D2) isomer demonstrated the largest Electric dipole moment among the O@C36 isomers studied. The encapsulation of oxygen in C36 isomers influenced their properties, including alterations in electronic properties, IR, and NMR chemical shifts. A detailed analysis of BSSE corrections showed the tininess of their impact on the analyzed observables, such that uncorrected and BSSE-corrected calculations led to nearly identical results, confirming the robustness and reliability of the B3LYP/6-31G* approach used in this work and, eventually, in other large and rigid fullerenes systems.</description>

      <title>Liquid-vapor critical behavior of the TIP4P/2005 water model: effects of NaCl solutes and hydrophobic confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The liquid-vapor critical behavior of water is strongly influenced by both ionic solutes and confinement. Molecular dynamics simulations of aqueous NaCl solutions using the TIP4P/2005 water model and the Madrid-2019 ion parameters reveal a systematic increase in the liquid-vapor critical temperature and pressure with salt concentration, consistent with experimental trends. In contrast, confinement between parallel hydrophobic plates leads to a depression of the critical point. The critical temperature was determined from the Binder cumulant crossing in the NVT ensemble, using a recently developed method originally applied to an active Brownian particle system. The reliability of this approach was verified through complementary NPT simulations. We further demonstrate the pronounced sensitivity of the estimated critical point to the van der Waals cutoff distance, underscoring the importance of properly accounting for long-range interactions. Our framework, which employs and tests an adjusted subbox method, can be readily extended to other critical phenomena, including the liquid-liquid critical point of water.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Radiation Chemistry by a One-Shot Hybrid Continuum / Monte Carlo Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal evolution of radiolytic species created by high-energy electrons in water underpins key applications from radiotherapy and nuclear safety to environmental processing and electron microscopy. Here, using the Manchester Inhomogeneous Radiation Chemistry by Linear Expansions (MIRaCLE) toolkit, we introduce and benchmark a novel approach to simulating these processes. Although the initial conditions are determined stochastically, the subsequent time evolution is calculated deterministically using a continuum representation, derived from those initial conditions. This hybrid approach essentially averages over many chemistry ``trajectories'' simultaneously, often converging to the 1% level in one shot, not requiring multiple runs. We demonstrate this new approach through the calculation of time-dependent G-values for e_{aq}^-$, \dot{\mathrm{OH}} and other radiolytic products, including at unprecedented dose rates where calculations which would take years with a conventional Monte Carlo approach can be performed in mere hours on a commercial laptop. We demonstrate that the main artifact of continuum modelling can be mitigated by a correction term. These results establish MIRaCLE as a flexible and efficient platform for modelling long-timescale radiolysis, providing a bridge between Monte Carlo approaches and macroscopic reaction--diffusion schemes, with broad implications for radiation chemistry in medicine, energy, and materials science.</description>

      <title>Accurate Helium-Benzene Potential: from CCSD(T) to Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate modeling of non-covalent interactions between helium and graphitic materials is important for understanding quantum phenomena in reduced dimensions, with the helium-benzene complex serving as the fundamental prototype. However, creating a quantitatively reliable potential energy surface (PES) for this weakly bound system remains a significant computational challenge. In this work, we present a comprehensive, multi-level investigation of the He-Bz interaction, establishing benchmark energies using high-level coupled-cluster singles-and-doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) methods extrapolated to the complete basis set limit and assessing higher-order (CCSDT(Q)) contributions. We use symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) to benchmark it against CCSD(T) and to decompose the interaction into its physical components-confirming it is dominated by a balance between dispersion and exchange-repulsion. A continuous, three-dimensional PES is constructed from discrete ab initio points using multifidelity Gaussian process regression that combines density functional theory results with sparse coupled-cluster energies. The result is a highly accurate PES with sub-cm-1 accuracy that obeys physical laws. This new PES is applied to path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations to study the solvation of 4He atoms on benzene at low temperatures. Our PIMC results reveal qualitatively different solvation behavior, particularly in the filling of adsorption layers, when compared to simulations using commonly employed empirical Lennard-Jones potentials. This work provides a benchmark PES essential for accurate many-body simulations of helium on larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons towards graphene.</description>

      <title>Modeling the emission spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by recurrent fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent fluorescence (RF) is an important relaxation mechanism in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which could stabilize them and contribute to the production of aromatic infrared bands that are observed in the infrared spectra of the interstellar medium (ISM). In this theoretical work, a statistical model of relaxation by recurrent fluorescence is formally developed, including Herzberg-Teller and Duschinsky rotation effects as well as a full account of vibrational progressions. Using canonical and harmonic approximations, the RF rate constants can be determined from the transition dipole moment time autocorrelation functions. Application to the naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene cations is presented based on quantum chemical inputs obtained from time-dependent density-functional theory. For these highly symmetric molecules, the low-lying, symmetry-forbidden electronic excited states are predicted to contribute possibly even more than higher energy, non-forbidden states. Such an unexpected contribution could increase the cooling efficiency of PAHs and, in turn, stabilize them further under the highly ionized environments of the ISM.</description>

      <title>Coupling between thermochemical contributions of subvalence correlation and of higher-order post-CCSD(T) correlation effects -- a step toward `W5 theory'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the thermochemical impact of post-CCSD(T) contributions to the total atomization energy (TAE, the sum of all bond energies) of first- and second-row molecules, and specifically their coupling with the subvalence correlation contribution. In particular, we find large contributions from (Q) when there are several neighboring second-row atoms. Otherwise, both higher-order triples $T_3$--(T) and connected quadruples (Q) are important in systems with strong static correlation. Reoptimization of the reference geometry for core-valence correlation increases the calculated TAE across the board, most pronouncedly so for second-row compounds with neighboring second-row atoms. %just slightly increases the calculated TAE for all species, but more pronouncedly so if strong static correlation is present, as well as for second-row compounds, again especially with neighboring second-row atoms. We present a first proposal for a `W5 theory' protocol and compare computed TAEs for the W4-08 benchmark with prior reference values. For some key second-row species, the new values represent nontrivial revisions. Our predicted TAE$_0$ values (TAE at 0 K) agree well with the ATcT (active thermochemical tables) values, including for the very recent expansion of the ATcT network to boron, silicon, and sulfur compounds.</description>

      <title>A Length-Gauge Origin-Invariant Approach to Vibrational Circular Dichroism Spectra without Gauge-Including Atomic Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have extended the origin-invariant length gauge (LG(OI)) approach -- originally developed by Caricato and co-workers for optical rotation (OR) and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) -- to vibrational circular dichroism (VCD). This approach avoids the need for gauge-including atomic orbitals (GIAOs), which are typically required to circumvent the unphysical dependence of the CD rotatory strengths on the arbitrary choice of coordinate origin for length gauge (LG) computations. Benchmark VCD spectra are presented for (P)-hydrogen peroxide, (S)-methyloxirane, (1R, 5R)-{\alpha}-pinene, and (1R, 4R)-camphor using Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and density functional theory (DFT) methods across a range of basis sets and compared to those obtained from LG, velocity-gauge (VG), and GIAO computations. These analyses show that for VCD the LG(OI) approach does not converge to the basis-set limit as rapidly as the GIAO approach, but does yield similar quality spectra as GIAO for all major VCD peaks for quadruple-zeta-quality basis sets. The LG(OI) and VG VCD spectra are less reliable compared to GIAOs for smaller basis sets.</description>

      <title>Landscape of grain boundary migration in polycrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grain boundary (GB) migration is a pivotal process that significantly impacts the development of microstructures, thereby influencing the practical performance of polycrystalline materials. Recent advances in 3D experimental techniques have revealed conflicts between observed GB migration behaviors and classical theoretical models. These contradictions raise two fundamental questions, namely, whether GB migration is linearly related to curvature, and how GB energy affect GB migration? Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of GB migration dynamics in polycrystals and resolve these conflicts within a theoretical framework. Unexpectedly, in a polycrystalline system, the range of GB migration velocities shows little correlation with the magnitude of its curvature. The extent of the influence of GB energy on GB migration is revealed to mostly depend on GB step energy. Finally, a more general GB migration formula is derived to incorporate various driving forces beyond curvature.</description>

      <title>Implicitly Restarted Lanczos Enables Chemically-Accurate Shallow Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The variational optimization of high-dimensional neural network models, such as those used in neural quantum states (NQS), presents a significant challenge in machine intelligence. Conventional first-order stochastic methods (e.g., Adam) are plagued by slow convergence, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and numerical instability, preventing NQS from reaching the high accuracy required for fundamental science. We address this fundamental optimization bottleneck by introducing the implicitly restarted Lanczos (IRL) method as the core engine for NQS training. Our key innovation is an inherently stable second-order optimization framework that recasts the ill-conditioned parameter update problem into a small, well-posed Hermitian eigenvalue problem. By solving this problem efficiently and robustly with IRL, our approach automatically determines the optimal descent direction and step size, circumventing the need for demanding hyperparameter tuning and eliminating the numerical instabilities common in standard iterative solvers. We demonstrate that IRL enables shallow NQS architectures (with orders of magnitude fewer parameters) to consistently achieve extreme precision (1e-12 kcal/mol) in just 3 to 5 optimization steps. For the F2 molecule, this translates to an approximate 17,900-fold speed-up in total runtime compared to Adam. This work establishes IRL as a superior, robust, and efficient second-order optimization strategy for variational quantum models, paving the way for the practical, high-fidelity application of neural networks in quantum physics and chemistry.</description>

      <title>Variation on the theme of Jarzynski's inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jarzynski equality, which relates equilibrium free-energy difference to an average of non-equilibrium work, plays a central role in modern non-equilibrium statistical thermodynamics. In this paper, we study a weaker consequence of this relation, known as Jarzynski's inequality, which can be formally obtained from the Jarzynski equality via Jensen's inequality. We identify and analyze several extensions of Jarzynski's inequality that go beyond its direct derivation from the Jarzynski equality. In particular, we consider chemical systems both in the linear-response regime and away from linear thermodynamics. Furthermore, by employing functional-integral techniques, we extend Jarzynski's inequality to many-body statistical systems described by quantum field theory. Salient issues, such as connections of the Jarzynski inequality with the maximum work theorem and the Landau--Lifshitz theory of fluctuations, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Charge Hopping Dynamics along a Disordered Chain in Quantum Environments: Comparative Study of Different Rate Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a computational study of charge hopping dynamics along a one dimensional chain with Gaussian site energy disorder and linearly coupled quantum bath. Time dependent square displacements are calculated directly from numerical solutions of Pauli master equations, for five different rate kernels: exact Fermi golden rule (FGR) rate expression, stationary phase interpolation (SPI) approximation, semiclassical (SC) approximation, classical Marcus rate expression, and Miller-Abrahams expression. All results demonstrate diffusive behavior in the steady state limit. The results based on the FGR rate expression show that the charge transport in quantum bath can be much more sensitive to the disorder than the prediction from the classical Marcus expression. While the SPI approximation captures this general trend reasonably well, the SC approximation tends to be unreliable at both quantitative and qualitative levels, and becomes even worse than the classical Marcus expression under certain conditions. These results offer useful guidance in the choice of approximate rate kernels for larger scale simulations, and also demonstrate significant but fragile positive effects of quantum environments on the charge hopping dynamics.</description>

      <title>Is There Elliptic Distortion in the Light Harvesting Complex 2 of Purple Bacteria?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single molecule spectroscopy (SMS) revealed unusually large gap between two major exciton peaks of the B850 unit of light harvesting complex 2 (LH2), which could be explained assuming elliptic distortion or k=2 symmetry modulation in the site excitation energy. On the basis of extensive simulation of the SMS data and ensemble lineshape, we found that uniform modulation of k=2 symmetry cannot explain the dependence of intensity ratios on the gap of the two major peaks, which are available from SMS, nor the ensemble lineshape. Alternative models of disorder with k=1 and k=2 symmetry correlation are shown to reproduce these data reasonably well and can even explain the gap distribution when it is assumed that the lower major peak in the SMS lineshape is an intensity weighted average of k=1- and k=0 states.</description>

      <title>Allostery Beyond Amplification: Temporal Regulation of Signaling Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Allostery is a fundamental mechanism of protein regulation and is commonly interpreted as modulating enzymatic activity or product abundance. Here we show that this view is incomplete. Using a stochastic model of allosteric regulation combined with an information-theoretic analysis, we quantify the mutual information between an enzyme's regulatory state and the states of downstream signaling components. Beyond controlling steady-state production levels, allostery also regulates the timing and duration over which information is transmitted. By tuning the temporal operating regime of signaling pathways, allosteric regulation enables distinct dynamical outcomes from identical molecular components, providing a physical mechanism for temporal information flow, signaling specificity, and coordination without changes in metabolic pathways.</description>

      <title>Addressing intramolecular vibrational redistribution in a single molecule through pump and probe surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02117v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of accurate tools to characterize Intramolecular Vibrational Redistribution (IVR) is of major interest in chemistry. In this context, surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopies stand up as well-established techniques to study molecular vibrational lines and populations with a sensitivity that can reach the singe-molecule level. However, to date, this possibility has not been fully developed to address IVR. Here, we establish a quantum mechanical framework based on molecular optomechanics that accounts for IVR, and adopt it to analyze strategies to optimize IVR characterization by vibrational spectroscopy. In particular, we model two different pump-and-probe configurations where the vibrational pumping is provided either by infrared laser illumination or by Stokes SERS. We show for the two pumping configurations the existence of clear signatures on the anti-Stokes SERS spectra of population transfer between coupled vibrational modes in a molecule. Our calculations adopt realistic molecular and SERS parameters, suggesting that these signatures of IVR are accessible at the single-molecule level with current experimental platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum scattering calculations for strongly interacting molecular systems are computationally demanding due to the large number of molecular states coupled by the anisotropy of atom - molecule interactions. We demonstrate that thermal rate coefficients for total (elastic + inelastic) atom - molecule scattering are insensitive to the interaction anisotropy of the underlying potential energy surface. In particular, we show that the rate coefficients for Rb-H$_2$ and Rb-N$_2$ scattering at room temperature can be computed to 1% accuracy with anisotropy set to zero, reducing the complexity of coupled channel quantum scattering calculations to numerical solutions of a single differential equation. Our numerical calculations and statistical analysis based on Gaussian process regression elucidate the origin and limitations of the invariance of the total scattering rate coefficients to changes in atom - molecule interaction anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Body-Order Paradox of Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many cases, the predictions of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can be interpreted as a sum of body-ordered contributions, which is explicit when the model is directly built on neighbor density correlation descriptors, and implicit when the model captures the correlations through non-linear functions of low body-order terms. In both cases, the "effective body-orderedness" of MLIPs remains largely unexplained: how do the models decompose the total energy into body-ordered contributions, and how does their body-orderedness affect the accuracy and learning behavior? In answering these questions, we first discuss the complexities in imposing the many-body expansion on ab initio calculations at the atomic limit. Next, we train a curated set of MLIPs on datasets of hydrogen clusters and reveal the inherent tendency of the ML models to deduce their own, effective body-order trends, which are dependent on the model type and dataset makeup. Finally, we present different trends in the convergence of the body-orders and generalizability of the models, providing useful insights for the development of future MLIPs.</description>

Abstract: The process of preparing heterogeneous catalysts on porous supports includes a drying stage, in which the porous material, impregnated with an aqueous solution of the catalyst precursor, is dried, and the precursor is precipitated on the pore walls. The precipitate distribution throughout the support volume strongly influences the catalyst performance and durability within industrial reactors. This paper presents a mathematical model for simulating the precipitation distribution during the drying of a porous sphere. Examples of calculations are given demonstrating the influence of some parameters on the distribution by space and by pore size.17</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new approach for constructing a renormalized and regularized Fock matrix for self-consistent field calculations. The scheme relies on second-order perturbation theory and is conceptually related to quasiparticle self-consistent second-order Green's function theory (GF2). The regularization is derived within the framework of perturbative similarity renormalization group (SRG) theory. By optimizing both the regularization and spin-scaling parameters, we introduce three SRG-qsGF2 variants that enable accurate predictions of quasiparticle energies and dipole moments. Lastly, we demonstrate that formulating second-order perturbation theory for the total electronic energy using the renormalized SRG-qsGF2 Fock matrix as the unperturbed Hamiltonian mitigates divergence problems commonly observed in conventional M{\o}ller--Plesset perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Bridging Visual Intuition and Chemical Expertise: An Autonomous Analysis Framework for Nonadiabatic Dynamics Simulations via Mentor-Engineer-Student Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing nonadiabatic molecular dynamics trajectories traditionally heavily relies on expert intuition and visual pattern recognition, a process that is difficult to formalize. We present VisU, a vision-driven framework that leverages the complementary strengths of two state-of-the-art large language models to establish a "virtual research collective." This collective operates through a "Mentor-Engineer-Student" paradigm that mimics the collaborative intelligence of a professional chemistry laboratory. Within this ecosystem, the Mentor provides physical intuition through visual reasoning, while the Engineer adaptively constructs analysis scripts, and the Student executes the pipeline and manages the data and results. VisU autonomously orchestrates a four-stage workflow comprising Preprocessing, Recursive Channel Discovery, Important-Motion Identification, and Validation/Summary. This systematic approach identifies reaction channels and key nuclear motions while generating professional academic reports. By bridging visual insight with chemical expertise, VisU establishes a new paradigm for human-AI collaboration in the analysis of excited-state dynamics simulation results, significantly reducing dependence on manual interpretation and enabling more intuitive, scalable mechanistic discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A capacitor consisting of the [bmim][NTf$_2$] ionic liquid (IL) confined in between planar graphite electrodes has been investigated by molecular dynamics based on an all-atom, unpolarizable force field. Structural and dynamical properties such as: (i) the density and orientation of the [bmim]$^+$ and [NTf$_2$]$^-$ ions throughout the capacitor; (ii) the electrostatic double layer at the electrode / electrolyte interface; (iii) the ions' mobility perpendicular and parallel to the graphite plates are determined as a function of the electrostatic charge of the capacitor, the concentration of absorbed water, the temperature and pressure. Grouping the [bmim]$^+$ and [NTf$_2$]$^-$ ions into neutral ion pairs reveals an intriguing ordering normal to the interface that is related to correlations among the dipole moments of the neutral ion pairs. These correlations might explain the observation of an anomalous Stark effect (Pockels effect) reported a few years ago in Langmuir, vol. 37, 5193-5201, (2021), and provides useful insight for the multitude of electro-chemical applications that involve electrode / ionic liquid interfaces.</description>

Abstract: Cavity dressing of molecular vibrational dynamics expands the role of characteristic vibrations as spectroscopic markers of underlying ultrafast dynamics. Interacting vibrational modes exhibit a pronounced excited state delocalization due to the interaction with the cavity mode, which is reflected in the ultrafast dynamics. We characterize the ultrafast dynamics of these cavity-dressed characteristic vibrations in the presence of dissipation. Specifically, we present two complementary three-pulse coherent multidimensional spectroscopic techniques capable of monitoring one- and two-quantum cavity-dressed vibrational excitations. Dissipative properties, such as transport and dephasing, are described using a microscopic theory that includes low- and high-energy phonon modes. Simulations were performed with finite laser pulses. The cavity coupling strengths fall within a range similar to vibrational mode couplings, hinting towards a possibility of control of intermolecular vibrational energy redistribution. The framework is extendable to a broad range of cavity-controlled nonlinear spectroscopies of dissipative molecular systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mathematical framework for reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT) is proposed. The work is inspired by and generalizes the work by E.H.~Lieb [E.H. Lieb, Int. J. Quant. Chem. 24(1983), pp.243--277] on density-functional theory (DFT). We introduce a Banach space for density matrices with finite kinetic energy. The dual space is a rich class of single-particle potentials, i.e., Hermitian forms. The ground state energy of an $N$-fermion system with external forces given by any such Hermitian form is expressed as the Legendre--Fenchel transform of a convex and lower semicontinuous ``universal'' reduced density matrix functional. The formalism is employed to provide a mathematical framework for density-functional theory (DFT). The main tool here is a rigorous definition of diagonals of reduced density matrices. The result is a refinement of Lieb's results on DFT applicable to a wide variety of models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) method is a promising approach for large-scale quantum chemical calculations on currently available quantum hardware. However, its naive implementation lacks size consistency, which is essential for accurate intermolecular interaction energy calculations using the supramolecular approach. Here, we present a size-consistent implementation of QSCI by sampling Slater determinants for the dimer in the localized molecular orbital basis, constructing the subspaces for the monomers and dimer, and augmenting the dimer subspace with additional determinants required for size consistency. Implemented within the Hamiltonian simulation-based QSCI (HSB-QSCI) framework, our method numerically satisfies size consistency for 4H/8H/12H clusters, the FH dimer, and the FH--H$_2$O system. Application to intermolecular interaction energy calculations of hydrogen-bonded FH dimer and FH--H$_2$O demonstrates that our approach reproduces complete active space-configuration interaction (CAS-CI) values with errors below 0.04 kcal mol$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>A mini-review on combinatorial solutions to the Marcus-Lushnikov irreversible aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.</description>
