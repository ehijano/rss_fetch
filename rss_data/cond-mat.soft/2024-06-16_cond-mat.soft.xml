      <title>Strain rate controls alignment in growing bacterial monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing monolayers of rod-shaped bacteria exhibit local alignment similar to extensile active nematics. When confined in a channel or growing inward from a ring, the local nematic order of these monolayers changes to a global ordering with cells throughout the monolayer orienting in the same direction. The mechanism behind this phenomenon is so far unclear, as previously proposed mechanisms fail to predict the correct alignment direction in one or more confinement geometries. We present a strain-based model relating net deformation of the growing monolayer to the cell-level deformation resulting from single-cell growth and rotation, producing predictions of cell orientation behavior based on the velocity field in the monolayer. This model correctly predicts the direction of preferential alignment in channel-confined, inward-growing, and unconfined colonies. The model also quantitatively predicts orientational order when the velocity field has no net negative strain rate in any direction. We further test our model in simulations of expanding colonies confined to spherical surfaces. Our model and simulations agree that cells away from the origin cell orient radially relative to the colony's center. Additionally, our model's quantitative prediction of the orientational order agrees with the simulation results in the top half of the sphere but fails in the lower half where there is a net negative strain rate. The success of our model bridges the gap between previous works on cell alignment in disparate confinement geometries and provides insight into the underlying physical effects responsible for large-scale alignment.</description>

      <title>Energetics of particle-size segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a continuum framework for the energetics of particle-size segregation in bidisperse granular flows. Building on continuum segregation equations and a recent segregation flux model, the proposed framework offers general analytical expressions to study the physics of granular flows from a mechanical energy perspective. To demonstrate the framework's applicability, we examined the energetics in shear-driven flows. Numerical experiments with varying frictional coefficients and particle-size ratios revealed two distinct phases in the associated energetics with particle segregation and diffusive remixing, and that the potential energy to the kinetic energy ratio in the steady state follows the scaling relationship $\hat{E}^{(s)}_{gp} / \hat{E}^{(s)}_{k} \propto Pe^{-1/2}_{sr}$ for $0.4 \leq Pe_{sr} \leq 300$, the segregation-rheology P\'eclet number. Our findings hint that the bulk segregation-mixing state can be predicted and controlled using $Pe_{sr}$, determined from known system parameters, providing a impactful tool for engineering and geophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Phantom chain simulations for fracture of star polymer networks with various strand densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite many attempts, the relation between fracture and structure of polymer networks is yet to be clarified. For this problem, a recent study for phantom chain simulations [Macromolecules, 56, 9359 (2023)] has demonstrated that the fracture characteristics obtained for polymer networks with various node functionalities and conversion ratios lie on master curves if they are plotted against cycle rank. In this study, we extended the simulation to the effect of prepolymer concentration on the relationships between cycle rank and fracture characteristics within the concentration range of 1&lt;c/c^*&lt;8, concerning the overlapping concentration c^*. We created networks from sols of star-branched phantom bead-spring chains via end-linking reaction between different chains through Brownian dynamics simulations with varying the number of branching arms f from 1 to 8, and the conversion ratio {\phi}_c from 0.6 to 0.95. For the resultant networks, cycle rank {\xi} was consistent with the mean-field theory. The networks were uniaxially stretched with energy minimization until break to obtain modulus G, strain at break {\epsilon}_b, stress at break {\sigma}_b, and work for fracture W_b. With the branch point density \u{psion}_br, G/\u{psion}_br, {\epsilon}_b, {\sigma}_b/\u{psion}_br, and W_b/\u{psion}_br of the data for various f and {\phi}_c draw master curves if plotted against {\xi}. The master curves depend on c; as c increases, all the mechanical characteristics monotonically increase. If we plot {\sigma}_b/\u{psion}_br and W_b/\u{psion}_br against G/\u{psion}_br, the data for various f and {\phi}_c lie on master curves but depending on c. Consequently, the fracture characteristics are not solely described by modulus for the examined energy-minimized phantom chain networks.</description>

      <title>Diffusiophoretic Brownian dynamics: characterization of hydrodynamic effects for an active chemoattractive polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phoretic Brownian dynamics method is shown here to be an effective approach to simulate the properties of colloidal chemophoretic based systems. The method is then optimized to allow for the comparison with results from multiparticle collision dynamics, a hydrodynamic method with explicit solvent, which can also be employed in the case of chemoattractive polymers. In order to obtain a good match of the conformational equilibrium properties of the models without and with explicit solvent, we propose a modified version of the phoretic Brownian dynamics accounting for the explicit solvent induced swelling. In the presence of activity, chemoattractive polymers show a transition to a compact globular state and hydrodynamics have a non-trivial influence in the polymer collapse times. The phoretic Brownian method can then be applied to much longer polymers, which allows the observation of a non-monotonous growth of both, the radius of gyration and the relaxation time with polymer length, for such chemoattractive active polymers.</description>

      <title>Delayed phosphate release can highly improve energy efficiency of muscle contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The power stroke of myosin and the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) are pivotal in the conversion of ATP's chemical energy into mechanical work. Although the precise sequence of these two events remains a subject of debate, it is generally agreed that Pi-release into the solution doesn't occur instantly upon the binding of a myosin to actin. Here, we examine how Pi-release that is not directly coupled with the power stroke affects muscle contraction. Utilizing a cross-scale mechanics model for a sarcomere unit that integrates the chemomechanical cycle of individual myosins, we find that relatively slow Pi-release can markedly improve energy efficiency during muscle contraction in silico. Our analysis leads us to propose that gradual Pi-release may offer a route to finely adjust the bond strength of an attached myosin, thereby indirectly modulating the power stroke to influence muscle performance. When our model is applied to simulate muscle performance in response to rapid jumps in Pi concentrations, we observe asymmetric rates of force alteration, which corroborate previous experimental findings. Indeed, our model's predictions in the current work are largely consistent with experimental data. This research provides crucial insights into the kinetics of Pi-release within the myosin's chemomechanical cycle and its significant regulatory impact on muscle contraction.</description>

      <title>Physical networks become what they learn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical networks can develop diverse responses, or functions, by design, evolution or learning. We focus on electrical networks of nodes connected by resistive edges. Such networks can learn by adapting edge conductances to lower a cost function that penalizes deviations from a desired response. The network must also satisfy Kirchhoff's law, balancing currents at nodes, or, equivalently, minimizing total power dissipation by adjusting node voltages. The adaptation is thus a double optimization process, in which a cost function is minimized with respect to conductances, while dissipated power is minimized with respect to node voltages. Here we study how this physical adaptation couples the cost landscape, the landscape of the cost function in the high-dimensional space of edge conductances, to the physical landscape, the dissipated power in the high-dimensional space of node voltages. We show how adaptation links the physical and cost Hessian matrices, suggesting that the physical response of networks to perturbations holds significant information about the functions to which they are adapted.</description>

Abstract: Short-range repulsion governs the dynamics of matter from atoms to animals. Using theory, simulations, and experiments, we find that an ensemble of repulsive particles spreads compactly with a sharp boundary, in contrast to the diffusive spreading of Brownian particles. Starting from the pair interactions, at high densities, the many-body dynamics follow non-linear diffusion with a self-similar expansion, growing as $t^{1/4}$; At longer times, thermal motion dominates with the classic $t^{1/2}$ expansion. A logarithmic growth controlled by nearest-neighbor interactions connects the two self-similar regimes.</description>

      <title>Local grafting heterogeneities control water intrusion and extrusion in nanopores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrophobic nanoporous materials can be intruded by water only by exerting an external action, typically increasing pressure. For some materials, water extrudes when the pressure is lowered again. Controlling intrusion/extrusion hysteresis is central in a number of technological applications, including materials for energy applications and for high performance liquid chromatography, and experimental techniques, as liquid porosimetry, but is still far from being understood. In this work, we consider water intrusion and extrusion in common mesoporous materials grafted with hydrophobic chains, showing that the macroscopic properties of the system are significantly affected by subnanometric heterogeneities in the grafting. For example, intrusion and extrusion pressures can vary more than 20 MPa depending on the chain length and density of the grafting. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations reveal that local changes of radius and contact angle produced by grafting heterogeneities can pin the interface during intrusion or facilitate bubble nucleation in extrusion. These unprecedented microscopic insights can directly impact the design of energy materials and chromatography columns, as well as the interpretation of porosimetry results.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic and intrinsic effects setting viscosity in complex fluids and life processes: the role of fundamental physical constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the values and origin of fundamental physical constants, one of the grandest challenges in modern science, has been discussed in particle physics, astronomy and cosmology. More recently, it was realised that fundamental constants have a bio-friendly window set by life processes involving motion and flow. This window is related to intrinsic fluid properties such as energy and length scales in condensed matter set by fundamental constants. Here, we discuss important extrinsic factors governing the viscosity of complex fluids operating in life processes due to collective effects. We show that both extrinsic and intrinsic factors affecting viscosity need to be taken into account when estimating the bio-friendly range of fundamental constants from life processes, and our discussion provides a straightforward recipe for doing this. We also find that the relative role of extrinsic and intrinsic factors depends on the range of variability of these intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Remarkably, the viscosity of a complex fluid such as blood with significant extrinsic effects is not far from the intrinsic viscosity calculated using the fundamental constants only, and we discuss the reason for this in terms of dynamics of contact points between cells.</description>

      <title>Elastic instability behind brittle fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17372v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that nucleation of brittle cracks in initially flawless soft elastic solids is preceded by a nonlinear elastic instability, which cannot be captured without accounting for geometrical precise description of finite elastic deformation. As a prototypical problem we consider a homogeneous elastic body subjected to tension and assume that it is weakened by the presence of a free surface which then serves as a site of crack nucleation. We show that in this maximally simplified setting, brittle fracture emerges from a symmetry breaking elastic instability activated by softening and involving large elastic rotations. The implied bifurcation of the homogeneous elastic equilibrium is highly unconventional for nonlinear elasticity as it exhibits an extraordinary sensitivity to geometry, reminiscent of the transition to turbulence in fluids. We trace the post-bifurcational development of this instability beyond the limits of applicability of scale free continuum elasticity and use a phase-field approach to capture the scale dependent sub-continuum strain localization, signaling the formation of actual cracks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic control of active droplets using light-responsive chiral liquid crystal environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microscopic active droplets are of interest since they can be used to transport matter from one point to another. The challenge is to control the trajectory. In this work, we demonstrate an approach to control the direction of active droplet propulsion by a photoresponsive cholesteric liquid crystal environment. The active droplet represents a water dispersion of bacterial B. subtilis microswimmers. When placed in a cholesteric, a surfactant-stabilized active droplet distorts the local director field, producing a point defect-hedgehog, which breaks the fore-aft symmetry. The chaotic motion of the bacteria inside the droplet is rectified into directional motion by the asymmetric director field outside the droplet. When the pitch of the cholesteric is altered by visible light irradiation, the asymmetry axis and thus the droplet trajectory realign along a new direction. Droplets realign counterclockwise on exposure to light of 535 nm, and clockwise on exposure to light of 450 nm, as dictated by the photoinduced change in the handedness of the cholesteric. The strategy allows for a non-contact dynamic control of active droplets trajectories and demonstrates the advantage of orientationally ordered media in control of active matter over their isotropic counterparts.</description>

      <title>From hydrodynamics to dipolar colloids: modeling complex interactions and self-organization with generalized potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-organization of clusters of particles is a fundamental phenomenon across various physical systems, including hydrodynamic and colloidal systems. One example is that of dense spherical particles submerged in a fluid and subjected to horizontal oscillations. The interaction of the particles with the oscillating flow leads to the formation of one-particle-thick chains or multiple-particle-wide bands. In this study, we model the hydrodynamic interactions between such particles and parallel chains using simplified potentials. We first focus on the hydrodynamic interactions between chains, which we characterize using data from numerical simulations. Based on these interactions, we propose a simplified model potential, called the Siren potential, which combines the representative hydrodynamic interactions: short-range attraction, mid-range repulsion, and long-range attraction. Through one-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations, we successfully replicate the characteristic patterns observed in hydrodynamic experiments and draw the phase diagram for the model potential. We extend our analysis to two-dimensional systems, introducing a dipole-capillary model potential that accounts for both chain formation and Siren-like chain interactions. This potential is based on colloidal particles at an interface, where chain formation is driven by an external electric field inducing a dipole moment parallel to the interface in each particle. The capillary force contributes the long-range attraction. Starting with parallel chains, the patterns in the two-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of this colloidal system are similar to those observed in the hydrodynamic experiments. Still, the model potentials help clarify the dynamic behavior of the particles and chains due to the complex interactions encountered in both hydrodynamic and colloidal systems, drawing parallels between them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a framework for deriving theoretical equations for mean squared displacement (MSD) and fractional Fokker-Planck (FFP) is developed for any arbitrary rheological model. The obtained general results are then specified for different fractional rheological models. To test the novel equations extracted from our framework and bridge the gap between microrheology and fractional rheological models, microrheology of polystyrene (PS) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solutions at several polymer concentrations is measured. By comparing the experimental and theoretical MSDs, we find the fractional rheological parameters and demonstrate for the first time that the polymer concentration regimes can be distinguished using the fractional exponent and relaxation time data because of the existence of a distinct behavior in each regime. We suggest novel and simple approximations for the critical overlap concentration and the shear viscosity of viscoelastic liquid-like solutions. This work provides a new and more sensitive approach for distinguishing different polymer concentration regimes and measuring the critical overlap concentration and shear viscosity of polymeric solutions, which is useful when conventional rheological characterization methods are unreliable due to the volatility and low viscosity of the samples.</description>
