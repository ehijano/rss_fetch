      <title>Missing digits and sums of two prime squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate integers whose base $g$ expansion omits a fixed digit and which can be represented as a sum of two prime squares. In the first part of the paper, we apply the Hardy--Littlewood circle method to obtain asymptotic formulas for weighted count of representations of such integers up to $g^k$ as $k\to\infty$, where we weight by the von Mangoldt function. In this case, we also get an interesting bias depending on the fixed digit we are missing. In the second part, combining the circle method with sieve methods, we study the second moment of the corresponding unweighted counting function. This allows us to get a nontrivial lower bound for the cardinality of the set $$\{ n \leq g^k : n \text{ omits the digit } b \text{ in its base } g \text{ expansion and } n = p^2 + q^2 \text{ for some primes } p,q \}. $$</description>

      <title>Ordinary abelian varieties: isogeny graphs and polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an integer $D$ and an ordinary isogeny class of abelian varieties defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with commutative $\mathbb{F}_q$-endomorphism algebra, we provide algorithms for computing all isogenies of degree dividing $D$ and polarizations of degree dividing $D$. We discuss phenomena that arise for higher dimension abelian varieties but not elliptic curves, bounds on the diameter of the graph of minimal isogenies, and decompositions of isogeny graphs into orbits for the Picard group of the Frobenius order.</description>

      <title>A proof of Spence's formula using the reciprocity law for Dedekind sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1963, Edward Spence published a proof of the following
  With $\phi$ being Euler totient function, if $n&gt;1$ is an integer, and if \begin{equation*} 0&lt;a_1&lt;\cdots&lt;a_{\phi(n)}&lt;n, \end{equation*} are the positive integers less than $n$, coprime with $n$, then \begin{equation*} \sum_{j=1}^{\phi(n)}ja_j = \frac{\phi(n)}{24}\left(8n\phi(n)+6n+2\phi(m)(-1)^{\omega(m)}-2^{\omega(m)}\right), \end{equation*} where $m$ is the square-free part of $n$ and $\omega(m)$ is the number of prime factors of $m$.
  Spence's proof relies on an ingenious observation considering Nagell's totient function. Later in 1971, Lucien Van Hamme provided an alternative proof of the result using Fourier analysis and previous work from Hubert Delange in 1968. In this paper I propose another proof of the formula using the reciprocity law for Dedekind sums. If the formula is of interest on its own, it also plays a role in the analysis of the distribution of the $a_j$ as suggested by the work from Hubert Delange.</description>

      <title>On the Vanishing and Cuspidality of $D_4$ Modular Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop vanishing and cuspidality criteria for quaternionic modular forms on $G=\mathrm{Spin}(4,4)$ using a theory of scalar Fourier coefficients. By analyzing a Fourier-Jacobi expansion for these forms, we prove that a level one quaternionic modular form on $G$ vanishes if and only if its primitive Fourier coefficients are zero. Using this criterion, we characterize Pollack's quaternionic Saito-Kurokawa subspace by imposing a system of linear relation among certain primitive Fourier coefficients. This characterization strengthens earlier work of the author with Johnson-Leung, Negrini, Pollack, and Roy. We also study quaternionic modular forms in the more general setting of a group $G_J$ associated to a cubic norm structure $J$. Here we establish a new relationship between the degenerate Fourier coefficients of quaternionic modular forms, and the Fourier coefficients of the holomorphic modular forms associated to their constant terms. As a consequence, we prove that in weights $\ell\geq 5$, a level one quaternionic modular form on $G$ is cuspidal if and only if its non-degenerate Fourier coefficients satisfy a polynomial growth condition.</description>

      <title>Positive characteristic analogues of finite algebraic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: J.~Rosen introduced the ring $\mathcal{P}^0_{\mathcal{A}}$ of so-called finite algebraic numbers, which may be seen as an analogue of certain periods in the ring $\mathcal{A}=\prod_p \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} /\bigoplus_p \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$, $p$ running through all prime numbers. In this article, we introduce its positive characteristic analogue $\mathcal{P}^0_{\mathcal{A}_K}$ over the rational function field $K=\mathbb{F}_q(\theta)$, $q$ being a prime power, and study foundational properties.</description>

      <title>Rationality of quaternionic Eisenstein series on $\mathrm{U}(2,n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{G}=\mathrm{U}(2,n)$ be the unitary group associated to a Hermitian space over a quadratic imaginary number field $E$. We assume that 2 is unramified in $E$, and the Hermitian space splits at all finite places and has signature $(2,n)$, where $n\equiv 2 \operatorname{mod} 4$. A theory of Fourier expansions of quaternionic modular forms on $\mathbf{G}$ is developed by Hilado, McGlade, and Yan. In this paper, we define a family of degenerate Heisenberg Eisenstein series $E_{\ell}$ for $\ell&gt;n$ on $\mathbf{G}$, which is a weight $\ell$ quaternionic modular form, and we explicitly compute their Fourier expansions. We prove that the Fourier coefficients of $E_{\ell}$ are rational in a certain sense, and that their denominators are uniformly bounded by an integer depending only on $\ell,n$, and $E$. This provides the first family of quaternionic Eisenstein series whose Fourier coefficients are known to be rational or algebraic.</description>

      <title>On the structure of prime-detecting quasimodular forms in higher levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Craig, van Ittersum, and Ono conjectured that every prime-detecting quasimodular form of level $1$ is a quasimodular Eisenstein series. This conjecture was proved by Kane--Krishnamoorthy--Lau and by van Ittersum--Mauth--Ono--Singh independently. However, in higher levels, prime-detecting quasimodular forms need not be Eisenstein. Recently, Kane, Krishnamoorthy, and Lau formulated a natural higher level analogue of the above conjecture and proved it by analytic methods. In a similar direction, but via an alternative approach based on the independence of characters of $\ell$-adic Galois representations, we prove that any prime-detecting quasimodular form on $\Gamma_{0}(N)$ belongs to the direct sum of the spaces of quasimodular Eisenstein series and quasimodular oldforms. Moreover, for a quasimodular form $f$ that is not prime-detecting, we give an upper bound for the number of primes $p$ less than $X$ for which the $p$-th Fourier coefficient of a quasimodular form vanishes.</description>

      <title>Finite $q$-multiple harmonic sums on $2-\cdots-2,1-\cdots-1$ indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many results for explicit expressions about $q$-multiple zeta values or $q$-harmonic sums on $A-\cdots-A$ indices, that is, the indices are the same. Though the way to treat $q$-multiple zeta values unless the indices are the same, it has been successful to get the explicit expression of $q$-harmonic sums on $1-\cdots-1,2,1-\cdots-1$ indices. In this paper, we shall consider more general results when the ratio of indices of $2$ to indices of $1$ increases.</description>

      <title>Irrationality of rapidly converging series: a problem of Erd\H{o}s and Graham</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answering a question of Erd\H{o}s and Graham, we show that the double exponential growth condition $\limsup_{n\to\infty}a_n^{1/\phi^n}=\infty$ for a monotonically increasing sequence of positive integers $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$, together with the bound $a_n a_{n+1}\geq n^{1+\tau}$, is sufficient for the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/(a_n a_{n+1})$ to have an irrational sum; here $\phi$ denotes the golden ratio $(1+\sqrt{5})/2$ and $\tau&gt;0$. We also provide a positive generalization to $\sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/(a_n^{w_0}\cdots a_{n+d-1}^{w_{d-1}})$, and a negative result showing that some of its instances are essentially optimal. The original problem was autonomously solved by the AI agent \emph{Aletheia}, powered by Gemini Deep Think, while the remaining material is largely a product of human-AI interactions.</description>

      <title>On the Visibility category of the Shafarevich--Tate group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$ and a nontrivial element $\sigma$ of its Shafarevich--Tate group, we introduce the Visualization category $\mathcal{V}(E; \sigma)$ of abelian varieties that ``visualize'' $\sigma$ in the sense of Mazur, and we study minimal objects in this category. In particular, we show that there can be several minimal visualizing abelian varieties of different dimensions, answering a question of Mazur. In the case that $\sigma$ has order $2$ or $3$, we revisit two constructions of visualizing abelian varieties, due to Agashe and Stein, and Cremona and Mazur. We show that the Agashe--Stein construction always yields minimal visualizations for these orders. We also build upon the Cremona--Mazur construction and show how it can be made totally explicit. While the Cremona--Mazur construction can produce non-minimal objects, an appropriate choice in the construction for order $2$ elements $\sigma$ yields an explicit genus $2$ curve whose Jacobian is a minimal visualization. For order $3$ elements we apply our algorithmic construction to Fisher's database of such elements, and obtain computational evidence that, in the majority of cases, the Cremona--Mazur construction yields a minimal visualization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explicitly construct Maass wave cusp forms associated to Hecke characters on arbitrary real quadratic fields. This result is a generalization of Maass (1949), who constructed Maass wave cusp forms under the assumption that narrow class number is one. We also compute its Petersson inner product explicitly and give a few examples involving dihedral Artin representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the angular restrictions for the second moment of toroidal families of $L$-functions using the general theory of trace functions. With the mollification technique we deduce non-vanishing of a positive proportion. Our two main ingredients are classification results of Katz to determine the sheaves at play and a recent result of Fouvry, Kowalski, Michel and Sawin to bound bilinear sums of their trace functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a formalization of spherically complete spaces, which is a fundamental notion in non-archimedean functional analysis. This work includes the equivalent definitions of spherically complete spaces, their basic properties, examples and non-examples such as the field $\mathbf{C}_p$ of $p$-adic complex numbers. As applications, we formalize the Birkhoff-James orthogonality, Hahn-Banach extension theorem and the spherical completion for non-archimedean Banach spaces.

      <description>arXiv:2601.21901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Mullin's prime-generating procedures to produce sequences of primes lying in given residue classes. In particular we study the sequences generated by cyclotomic polynomials $\Phi_m(cx)$ for suitable $c\in\mathbb{Z}$. Under the Extended Riemann Hypothesis in general and unconditionally for some moduli, we show that the analogue of the second Euclid--Mullin sequence omits infinitely many primes $\equiv1\pmod{m}$. We further show unconditionally that at least one prime is omitted for infinitely many $m$. This generalises work of the first author for $m=1$ and the second author for $m=2^k$.</description>

      <title>Motivic pieces of curves: $L$-functions and periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a curve $C$ over a number field $K$ equipped with the action of a finite group $G$ by $K$-automorphisms, one obtains a factorisation of $L(C,s)$ into a product of $L$-functions of `motivic pieces of curves' associated to irreducible $G$-representations. We describe an algorithm for explicitly computing values of these $L$-functions, demonstrating implementations in the cases of certain curves with actions by $C_3$, $C_4$ and $D_{10}$. We explain how this algorithm can be used to factor $L$-functions of curves with endomorphisms of Hecke type.
  Towards applications, we explicitly formulate and numerically verify a version of Deligne's Period Conjecture for hitherto-uninvestigated $L$-functions arising from motivic pieces of superelliptic curves.</description>

      <title>Non-abelian Rees construction and pure motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Rees construction (of common use in commutative algebra and Hodge theory) interpolates between filtrations, viewed as ${\mathbb G}_m$-equivariant vector bundles on the affine line, and their associated gradings. Various non-abelian versions have been proposed, where the multiplicative group ${\mathbb G}_m$ is replaced by an arbitrary reductive group. Building on a construction due to P. O'Sullivan, we present a Galois correspondence between quasi-homogeneous spaces and certain monoidal categories, and apply it to monoidal categories of motives with concrete applications to algebraic cycles. In particular, we give a new proof and generalization of the Clozel-Deligne theorem about numerical equivalence on abelian varieties over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Classifying integer hypertilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are two objectives to this work: to classify all tame integer tilings and to classify all tame integer hypertilings. Motivation for the first objective comes from Conway and Coxeter's modelling of positive integer friezes using triangulated polygons, which has received significant attention since the discovery of cluster algebras by Fomin and Zelevinsky in 2002. Assem, Reutenauer, and Smith introduced $\text{SL}_2$-tilings as generalisations of friezes, and Bessenrodt, Holm, and J{\o}rgensen classified positive integer $\text{SL}_2$-tilings using infinite triangulated polygons. Here we consider $N$-tilings, of which $\text{SL}_2$-tilings are the case $N=1$. We provide a geometric model for all tame integer $N$-tilings using a generalisation of the Farey graph in the hyperbolic plane. Highlights of this model include classifications of all positive integer $N$-tilings and of all quiddity sequences of positive rational friezes using triangulated polygons.
  The second objective is motivated by Bhargava's celebrated study of binary quadratic forms using integer cubes and by an observation of Demonet et al.\ that there is essentially only one three-dimensional positive integer tiling with $\text{SL}_2$ cross sections. We consider a richer class of three-dimensional tilings, which we call hypertilings, using the Cayley hyperdeterminant. We classify all tame integer hypertilings using generalised Farey graphs; remarkably, those with Cayley hyperdeterminant 1 prove to have a simple description in terms of triple Hadamard products of integer pairs.</description>

Abstract: Let $a,b$ be positive integers. In this note, we study the numerical semigroup $H=\left&lt;a,a+1,b\right&gt;$ and and the associated numerical semigroup ring $R=k[[H]]$. Under the certain conditions, we provide explicit formulas for the Frobenius number of $H$ and for the first Hilbert coefficient of $R$.</description>

      <title>The sum-product problem for small sets II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish that every set of $k=10$ natural numbers determines at least $30$ distinct pairwise sums or at least $30$ distinct pairwise products, as well as the analogous result for $k=11$ and at least $34$ sums/products, with sharpness uniquely (up to scaling) exhibited by $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18\}$ and $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24\}$, respectively. This extends previous work of the fifth author with Clevenger, Havard, Heard, Lott, and Wilson, which established the corresponding thresholds for $k\leq 9$. Included is a classification result for sets of $10$ real numbers (resp. positive real numbers) determining at most $29$ pairwise sums (resp. pairwise products) that do not contain $8$ elements of any single arithmetic progression (resp. geometric progression), as well as some observations controlling additive quadruples in small subsets of two-dimensional generalized geometric progressions.</description>

      <title>On cellular rational approximations to $\zeta(5)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse a certain family of cellular integrals, which are period integrals on the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{0,8}$ of curves of genus zero with eight marked points, and give rise to simultaneous rational approximations to $\zeta(3)$ and $\zeta(5)$. By exploiting the action of a large symmetry group on these integrals, we construct an infinite $effective$ sequence of rational approximations $p/q$ to $\zeta(5)$ satisfying \[ 0&lt;\bigg|\zeta(5)-\frac pq\bigg|&lt;\frac1{q^{0.86}}. \]</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field, $S$ a finite set of places. For $\mathbb{G}_m$ or an elliptic curve $E$ defined over $K$, we establish uniformity results on the number of $S$-integral torsion points relative to a non-torsion point $\beta$, as $\beta$ varies over number fields of bounded degree. In particular for $\mathbb{G}_m$, if $D$ is a positive integer, we prove a uniform bound on the degree of a torsion point $\zeta$ that is $S$-integral relative to a non-torsion point $\beta$ with degree $\leq D$.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field and $S$ a finite set of places of $K$ that contains all of the archimedean places. Let $\varphi: \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^1$ be a rational map of degree $d \geq 2$ defined over $K$. Given $\alpha \in \mathbb{P}^1(K)$ non-preperiodic and $\beta \in \mathbb{P}^1(K)$ non-exceptional, we prove an upper bound of the form $O(|S|^{1+\epsilon})$ on the number of points in the forward orbit of $\alpha$ that are $S$-integral relative to $\beta$, extending results of Hsia--Silverman [HS11]. We also prove uniform bounds when $\varphi$ is a polynomial, extending resaults of Krieger et al [KLS+15].</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over rings which are "combinations of discrete algebras and affinoid $\mathbb{Q}_p$-algebras", and prove basic results such as the existence of a fully faithful functor from the category of Galois representations, the deperfection of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over perfect period rings, and the dualizability of the cohomology of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules, and the classification of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules of rank $1$. This work is motivated by the categorical $p$-adic Langlands correspondence for locally analytic representations, as proposed by Emerton-Gee-Hellmann, and the $GL_1$ case, as formulated and proved by Rodrigues Jacinto-Rodr\'iguez Camargo.</description>

Abstract: Finiteness and duality of cohomology of families of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules were proved by Kedlaya-Pottharst-Xiao. In this paper, we study solid locally analytic representations introduced by Rodrigues Jacinto-Rodr\'iguez Camargo in terms of analytic stacks and 6-functor formalisms, which are developed by Clausen-Scholze, Heyer-Mann, respectively. By using this, we provide a generalization of the result of Kedlaya-Pottharst-Xiao, giving a new proof for cases already proved there.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the distribution of difference of multiplicative and additive characters modulo $p$ at consecutive polynomial values. More precisely, for an interval $I$ over finite field and $0&lt;m&lt;1$, we investigate the following sums \begin{align*}
  \sum_{n\in I}|\psi(F(n))-\psi(F(n+1))|^{2m} \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{n\in I}|\chi(F(n))-\chi(F(n+1))|^{2m}, \end{align*} where $\psi$ is a non-trivial additive character and $\chi$ is a non-trivial multiplicative character modulo $p$, under suitable conditions on $\chi$ and $F$. As a consequence, we derive a formula for the first moment by specializing to $m=1/2$.</description>

In this paper, we use this classification to determine the complete list of degree $7$ orthomorphism polynomials over finite fields of order $q\in\{11,~13,~17,~19,~25,~49\}.$ In addition, the non-existence of these polynomials is established for certain fields.</description>

Abstract: In 1986, Kato and Kuzumaki introduced some Diophantine properties of fields, called the $C_i^q$ properties, and they hoped they would provide a good characterization of the cohomological dimension of fields. In this paper, we study the stability of some variants of the $C_i^q$ properties under transcendental and algebraic extensions. As an application, we obtain the $C_n^1$ property for the field $\mathbf{F}_p(x_1,\cdots,x_n)$.</description>

Abstract: For $\textrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ ($n\geq3$), $\textrm{SO}(n+1,n)$ ($n\geq2$), $\textrm{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{R})$ ($n\geq2$) and for the adjoint real split form of the exceptional group $\textrm{G}_2$, we exhibit non-uniform lattices in which we construct thin Hitchin representations by arithmetic methods. These representations give infinitely many orbits under the action of the mapping class group (except maybe for $\textrm{G}_2$). In particular, we show that when $p\neq2$ is prime every non-uniform lattice of $\mathrm{SL}(p,\mathbb{R})$ contains thin Hitchin representations.</description>

      <title>Explicit desingularisation of Kummer surfaces in characteristic two via specialisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04532v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the birational geometry of the Kummer surfaces associated to the Jacobian varieties of genus two curves, with a particular focus on fields of characteristic two. In order to do so, we explicitly compute a projective embedding of the Jacobian of a general genus two curve and, from this, we construct its associated Kummer surface. This explicit construction produces a model for desingularised Kummer surfaces over any field of characteristic not two, and specialising these equations to characteristic two provides a model of a partial desingularisation. Adapting the classic description of the Picard lattice in terms of tropes, we also describe how to explicitly find completely desingularised models of Kummer surfaces whenever the $p$-rank is not zero. In the final section of this paper, we compute an example of a Kummer surface with everywhere good reduction over a quadratic number field, and draw connections between the models we computed and a criterion that determines when a Kummer surface has good reduction at two.</description>

      <title>On the Bogomolov-Positselski Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. An oriented pro-$p$ group $(G,\theta)$ is said to have the Bogomolov--Positselski property if it is Kummerian and if $I_\theta(G)$ is a free pro-$p$ group. In this paper, we provide a new criterion for an oriented pro-$p$ group to satisfy the Bogomolov--Positselski property. This criterion builds on earlier work of Positselski (arXiv:1405.0965) and Quadrelli--Weigel (arXiv:2103.12438), relates their approaches, and answers a question raised in (arXiv:2103.12438).
  Under additional assumptions, we obtain two further sufficient criteria. The first is analogous to a Merkurjev--Suslin type statement. The second allows one to weaken the hypotheses appearing in Positselski's criterion (arXiv:1405.0965 Theorem 2). Finally, we show that the stronger conditions are satisfied by pro-$p$ groups of elementary type. As a consequence, the Elementary Type Conjecture implies Positselski's ``Module Koszulity Conjecture 1'' (arXiv:1008.0095) for fields with finitely generated maximal pro-$p$ Galois group.</description>

Abstract: This paper details a generalization of the formalism presented in the author's 2024 paper, "The Collatz Conjecture and Non-Archimedean Spectral Theory - Part I - Arithmetic Dynamical Systems and Non-Archimedean Value Distribution Theory", to the case of Hydra maps on the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ of a global field $K$. In addition to recounting these definitions, background material is presented for the necessary standard material in algebraic number theory and integration and Fourier analysis with respect to the $p$-adic Haar measure. This paper is meant to serve as a technical manual for use of Hydra maps and numens in future research.</description>

      <title>The most concise recurrence formula for the sums of integer powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For integers $n,k \geq 1$, let $S_k(n)$ denote the power sum $1^k +2^k + \cdots + n^k$. In this note, we first recall the minimal recurrence relation connecting $S_k(n)$ and $S_{k-1}(n)$ established by Abramovich (1973). We then discuss an old algorithm to determine the coefficients of the power sum polynomial $S_k(n)$ in terms of the coefficients of $S_{k-1}(n)$ (see, e.g., Bloom (1993) and Owens (1992)). Moreover, we bring to light an explicit relationship between $S_k(n)$ and $S_{k+1}(n)$ put forward by Budin and Cantor (1972). We conclude that these procedures (including the integration formula expressing $S_k(n)$ in terms of $S_{k-1}(n)$) all constitute equivalent methods to determine $S_k(n)$ starting from $S_{k-1}(n)$. In addition, as a by-product, we provide a determinantal formula for the Bernoulli numbers involving the binomial coefficients.</description>
