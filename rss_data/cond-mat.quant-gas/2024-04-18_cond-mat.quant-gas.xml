      <title>Mass-Assisted Local Deconfinement in a Confined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confinement is a prominent phenomenon in condensed matter and high-energy physics that has recently become the focus of quantum-simulation experiments of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). As such, a theoretical understanding of the effect of confinement on LGT dynamics is not only of fundamental importance, but can lend itself to upcoming experiments. Here, we show how confinement in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT can be \textit{locally} avoided by proximity to a resonance between the fermion mass and the electric field strength. Furthermore, we show that this local deconfinement can become global for certain initial conditions, where information transport occurs over the entire chain. In addition, we show how this can lead to strong quantum many-body scarring starting in different initial states. Our findings provide deeper insights into the nature of confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs and can be tested on current and near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Microwave seeding time crystal in Floquet driven Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal seeding enables a deeper understanding of phase behavior, leading to the development of methods for controlling and manipulating phase transitions in various applications such as materials synthesis, crystallization processes, and phase transformation engineering. How to seed a crystalline in time domain is an open question, which is of great significant and may provide an avenue to understand and control time-dependent quantum many-body physics. Here, we utilize a microwave pulse as a seed to induce the formation of a discrete time crystal in Floquet driven Rydberg atoms. In the experiment, the periodic driving on Rydberg states acts as a seeded crystalline order in subspace, which triggers the time-translation symmetry breaking across the entire ensemble. The behavior of the emergent time crystal is elaborately linked to alterations in the seed, such as the relative phase shift and the frequency difference, which result in phase dependent seeding and corresponding shift in periodicity of the time crystal, leading to embryonic synchronization. This result opens up new possibilities for studying and harnessing time-dependent quantum many-body phenomena, offering insights into the behavior of complex many-body systems under seeding.</description>

      <title>Area laws and thermalization from classical entropies in a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaling of local quantum entropies is of utmost interest for characterizing quantum fields, many-body systems, and gravity. Despite their importance, theoretically and experimentally accessing quantum entropies is challenging as they are nonlinear functionals of the underlying quantum state. Here, we show that suitably chosen classical entropies capture the very same features as their quantum analogs for an experimentally relevant setting. We describe the post-quench dynamics of a multi-well spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate from an initial product state via measurement distributions of spin observables and estimate the corresponding entropies using the asymptotically unbiased k-nearest neighbor method. We observe the dynamical build-up of quantum correlations signaled by an area law, as well as local thermalization revealed by a transition to a volume law, both in regimes characterized by non-Gaussian distributions. We emphasize that all relevant features can be observed at small sample numbers without assuming a specific functional form of the distributions, rendering our method directly applicable to a large variety of models and experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Area laws for classical entropies in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the information extractable from measurement distributions of two non-commuting spin observables in a multi-well spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. We provide a variety of analytic and numerical evidence that suitably chosen classical entropies and classical mutual informations thereof contain the typical feature of quantum entropies known in quantum field theories, that is, the area law, even in the non-Gaussian regime and for a non-zero temperature. Towards a feasible experimental implementation, we estimate entropic quantities from a finite number of samples without any additional assumptions on the underlying quantum state using k-nearest neighbor estimators.</description>

      <title>Decoupled sound and amplitude modes in trapped dipolar supersolids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate elementary excitations of dipolar quantum gases across the superfluid to supersolid phase transition in a toroidal trap. We show how decoupled first sound, second sound, and Higgs modes emerge by following their origin from superfluid modes across the transition. The structure of these excitations reveals the interplay between crystal and superfluid oscillations. Our results unify previous notions of coupled Goldstone and Higgs modes in harmonic traps, allowing us to establish a correspondence between excitations of trapped and infinitely extended supersolids. We propose protocols for selectively probing these sound and amplitude modes, accessible to state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

      <title>Generic free fermions with nearest neighbour interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generic free fermions are free fermions with a single particle spectrum that satisfies the $q$ no resonance condition, i.e., where equal sums of single-particle energies are unique. This property guaranties that they have no degeneracies and gives them relaxation properties more similar to those of generic systems. In this article we provide a minimal example of a generic free fermionic model with nearest neighbour interactions -- a tight-binding model with complex hopping. Using some standard results from number theory we prove that this model fulfils the $q$ no resonance condition when the number of lattice sites is prime. Whenever this is not the case one can recover the $q$ no resonance condition by adding hopping terms between sites corresponding to the divisors of the number of sites. We further discuss its many-body spectral statistics and show that local probes -- like the ratio of consecutive level spacings -- look very similar to what is expected for the Poisson statistics. We however demonstrate that free fermion models can never have Poisson statistics with an analysis of the moments of the spectral form factor.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle cooling algorithms for quantum many-body state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probing correlated states of many-body systems is one of the central tasks for quantum simulators and processors. A promising approach to state preparation is to realize desired correlated states as steady states of engineered dissipative evolution. A recent experiment with a Google superconducting quantum processor [X. Mi et al., Science 383, 1332 (2024)] demonstrated a cooling algorithm utilizing auxiliary degrees of freedom that are periodically reset to remove quasiparticles from the system, thereby driving it towards the ground state. We develop a kinetic theory framework to describe quasiparticle cooling dynamics, and employ it to compare the efficiency of different cooling algorithms. In particular, we introduce a protocol where coupling to auxiliaries is modulated in time to minimize heating processes, and demonstrate that it allows a high-fidelity preparation of ground states in different quantum phases. We verify the validity of the kinetic theory description by an extensive comparison with numerical simulations of a 1d transverse-field Ising model using a solvable model and tensor-network techniques. Further, the effect of noise, which limits efficiency of variational quantum algorithms in near-term quantum processors, can be naturally described within the kinetic theory. We investigate the steady state quasiparticle population as a function of noise strength, and establish maximum noise values for achieving high-fidelity ground states. This work establishes quasiparticle cooling algorithms as a practical, robust method for many-body state preparation on near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>False vacuum decay and nucleation dynamics in neutral atom systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: False vacuum decay and nucleation offer the opportunity to study non-equilibrium dynamical phenomena in quantum many-body systems with confinement. Recent work has examined false vacuum decay in 1D ferromagnetic Ising spins and superfluids. In this paper, we study false vacuum nucleation dynamics in 1D antiferromagnetic neutral atom chains with Rydberg interactions, using both numerical simulations and analytic modeling. We apply a staggered local detuning field to generate the false and true vacuum states. Our efforts focus on two dynamical regimes: decay and annealing. In the first, we corroborate the phenomenological decay rate scaling and determine the associated parameter range for the decay process; in the second, we uncover and elucidate a procedure to anneal the false vacuum from the initial to the final system, with intermediate nucleation events. We further propose experimental protocols to prepare the required states and perform quenches on near-term neutral atom quantum simulators, examining the experimental feasibility of our proposed setup and parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Long-lived oscillations of false and true vacuum states in neutral atom systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastable false vacuum states arise in a range of quantum systems and can be observed in various dynamical scenarios, including decay, bubble nucleation, and long-lived oscillations. False vacuum phenomenology has been examined in quantum many-body systems, notably in 1D ferromagnetic Ising spin systems and superfluids. In this paper, we study long-lived oscillations of false and true vacuum states in 1D antiferromagnetic neutral atom chains with long-range Rydberg interactions. We use a staggered local detuning field to achieve confinement. Using theoretical and numerical models, we identify novel spectral signatures of quasiparticle oscillations distinct to antiferromagnetic neutral atom systems and interpret them using a classical energy model of deconfinement from Rydberg tails. Finally, we evaluate the experimental accessibility of our proposed setup on current neutral-atom platforms and discuss experimental feasibility and constraints.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamical Fermi suppression of optically-induced inelastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observe strong dynamical suppression of optically induced loss in a weakly interacting Fermi gas as the $s$-wave scattering length is increased. The single, cigar-shaped cloud behaves as a large spin lattice in energy space with a tunable Heisenberg Hamiltonian. The loss suppression occurs as the lattice transitions into a magnetized state, where the fermionic nature of the atoms inhibits interactions. The data are quantitatively explained by incorporating spin-dependent loss into a quasi-classical collective spin vector model, the success of which enables the application of optical control of effective long-range interactions to this system.</description>

      <title>Exact Solution of Bipartite Fluctuations in One-Dimensional Fermions</title>

Abstract: Emergence of hydrodynamics in quantum many-body systems has recently garnered growing interest. The recent experiment of ultracold atoms [J. F. Wienand {\it et al.}, arXiv:2306.11457] studied emergent hydrodynamics in hard-core bosons using a bipartite fluctuation, which quantifies how the particle number fluctuates in a subsystem. In this Letter, we theoretically study the variance of a bipartite fluctuation in one-dimensional noninteracting fermionic dynamics starting from an alternating state, deriving the exact solution of the variance and its asymptotic linear growth law for the long-time dynamics. To compare the theoretical prediction with the experiment, we generalize our exact solution by incorporating the incompleteness of the initial alternating state, deriving the general linear growth law analytically. We find that it shows quantitative agreement with the experimentally observed variance growth without any fitting parameters.</description>

      <title>Thermally induced localization of dopants in a magnetic spin ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I unveil a novel variant of Anderson localization. This emergent phenomenon pertains to the motion of a dopant in a thermal spin lattice, rendered localized by thermal fluctuations. This is in stark contrast to the intrinsic origin of localization for quenched disorder. The system of interest consists of spin-$1/2$ particles organized in a two-leg ladder with nearest neighbor Ising interactions $J$. The motion of a hole -- the dopant -- is initialized by suddenly removing a spin from the thermal spin ensemble, which then moves along the ladder via nearest neighbor hopping $t$. I find that the hole remains \emph{localized} for all values of $J/t$ and for \emph{all} nonzero temperatures. The origin is an effective disorder potential seen by the hole and induced by thermal spin fluctuations. Its length scale is found to match with the underlying spin-spin correlation length at low temperatures. For ferromagnetic couplings ($J&lt;0$), the associated localization length of the hole increases with decreasing temperature and becomes proportional to the correlation length at low temperatures, asymptotically delocalizing at low temperatures. For antiferromagnetic couplings ($J&gt;0$), there is a smooth crossover between thermal localization at high temperatures to localization driven by the antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures. At infinite temperatures, the dynamics becomes independent of the sign of the spin coupling, whereby the localization length is a universal function of $|J|/t$, diverging as $(t/J)^{2}$ for $|J| \ll t$. Finally, I analyze a setup with Rydberg-dressed atoms, which naturally realizes finite range Ising interactions, accessible in current experimental setups. I show that the discovered localization phenomenon can be probed on experimentally accessible length- and timescales, providing a strong testing ground for my predictions.</description>
