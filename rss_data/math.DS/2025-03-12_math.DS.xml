      <title>Horizontality of partially hyperbolic foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show exactly which Seifert manifolds support partially hyperbolic dynamical systems. In particular, a circle bundle over a higher-genus surface supports a partially hyperbolic system if and only if it supports an Anosov flow. We also show for these systems that the center-stable and center-unstable foliations can be isotoped so that their leaves are transverse to the circle fibering. As a consequence, every partially hyperbolic system defined on the unit tangent bundle of a higher-genus surface is a collapsed Anosov flow.</description>

      <title>The Brjuno and Wilton Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Brjuno and Wilton functions bear a striking resemblance, despite their very different origins; while the Brjuno function $B(x)$ is a fundamental tool in one-dimensional holomorphic dynamics, the Wilton function $W(x)$ stems from the study of divisor sums and self-correlation functions in analytic number theory. We show that these perspectives are unified by the semi-Brjuno function $B_0(x)$. Namely, $B(x)$ and $W(x)$ can be expressed in terms of the even and odd parts of $B_0(x)$, respectively, up to a bounded defect. Based on numerical observations, we further analyze the arising functions $\Delta^+(x) = B^+(x) - 2B_0^+(x)$ and $\Delta^-(x) = W^-(x) - 2B_0^-(x)$, the first of which is H\"older continuous whereas the second exhibits discontinuities at rationals, behaving similarly to the classical popcorn function.</description>

      <title>Newton's method applied to rational functions: Fixed points and Julia sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a rational function $R$, let $N_R(z)=z-\frac{R(z)}{R'(z)}.$ Any such $N_R$ is referred to as a Newton map. We determine all the rational functions $R$ for which $N_R$ has exactly two attracting fixed points, one of which is an exceptional point. Further, if all the repelling fixed points of any such Newton map are with multiplier $2$, or the multiplier of the non-exceptional attracting fixed point is at most $\frac{4}{5}$, then its Julia set is shown to be connected. If a polynomial $p$ has exactly two roots, is unicritical but not a monomial, or $p(z)=z(z^n+a)$ for some $a \in \mathbb{C}$ and $n \geq 1$, then we have proved that the Julia set of $N_{\frac{1}{p}}$ is totally disconnected. For the McMullen map $f_{\lambda}(z)=z^m - \frac{\lambda}{z^n}$, $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}\setminus \{0\}$ and $m,n \geq 1$, we have proved that the Julia set of $N_{f_\lambda}$ is connected and is invariant under rotations about the origin of order $m+n$. All the connected Julia sets mentioned above are found to be locally connected.</description>

      <title>Joint State-Parameter Estimation for the Reduced Fracture Model via the United Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an effective United Filter method for jointly estimating the solution state and physical parameters in flow and transport problems within fractured porous media. Fluid flow and transport in fractured porous media are critical in subsurface hydrology, geophysics, and reservoir geomechanics. Reduced fracture models, which represent fractures as lower-dimensional interfaces, enable efficient multi-scale simulations. However, reduced fracture models also face accuracy challenges due to modeling errors and uncertainties in physical parameters such as permeability and fracture geometry. To address these challenges, we propose a United Filter method, which integrates the Ensemble Score Filter (EnSF) for state estimation with the Direct Filter for parameter estimation. EnSF, based on a score-based diffusion model framework, produces ensemble representations of the state distribution without deep learning. Meanwhile, the Direct Filter, a recursive Bayesian inference method, estimates parameters directly from state observations. The United Filter combines these methods iteratively: EnSF estimates are used to refine parameter values, which are then fed back to improve state estimation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the United Filter method surpasses the state-of-the-art Augmented Ensemble Kalman Filter, delivering more accurate state and parameter estimation for reduced fracture models. This framework also provides a robust and efficient solution for PDE-constrained inverse problems with uncertainties and sparse observations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical behavior and bifurcation analysis for a theoretical model of dengue fever transmission with incubation period and delayed recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As offered by the World Health Organisation (WHO), close to half of the population in the world's resides in dengue-risk zones. Dengue viruses are transmitted to individuals by Aedes mosquito species infected bite (Ae. Albopictus of Ae. aegypti). These mosquitoes can transmit other viruses, including Zika and Chikungunya. In this research, a mathematical model is formulated to reflect different time delays considered in both extrinsic and intrinsic incubation periods, as well as in the recovery periods of infectious individuals. Preliminary results for the non-delayed model including positivity and boundedness of solutions, non-dimensionalization and equalibria analysis are presented. The threshold parameter (reproduction number) of the model is obtained via next generation matrix schemes. The stability analysis of the model revealed that various dynamical behaviour can be observed depending on delay parameters, where in particular the effect of delay in the recovery time of infectious individuals may lead to substantial changes in the dynamics. The ideas presented in this paper can be applied to other infectious diseases, providing qualitative evaluations for understanding time delays influencing the transmission dynamics.</description>

      <title>Partial differential equation system for binarization of degraded document images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, partial differential equation (PDE) systems have been successfully applied to the binarization of text images, achieving promising results. Inspired by the DH model and incorporating a novel image modeling approach, this study proposes a new weakly coupled PDE system for degraded text image binarization. In this system, the first equation is designed to estimate the background component, incorporating both diffusion and fidelity terms. The second equation estimates the foreground component and includes diffusion, fidelity, and binarization source terms. The final binarization result is obtained by applying a hard projection to the estimated foreground component. Experimental results on 86 degraded text images demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits significant advantages in handling degraded text images.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article presents the concept of a cumulant representation for distribution functions describing the states of many-particle systems with topological nearest-neighbor interaction. A solution to the Cauchy problem for the hierarchy of nonlinear evolution equations for the cumulants of distribution functions of such systems is constructed. The connection between the constructed solution and the series expansion structure for a solution to the Cauchy problem of the BBGKY hierarchy has been established. Furthermore, the expansion structure for a solution to the Cauchy problem of the hierarchy of evolution equations for reduced observables of topologically interacting particles is established.</description>

      <title>Unimodal Measurable Pseudo-Anosov Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit a continuously varying family $F_\lambda$ of homeomorphisms of the sphere $S^2$, for which each $F_\lambda$ is a measurable pseudo-Anosov map. Measurable pseudo-Anosov maps are generalizations of Thurston's pseudo-Anosov maps, and also of the generalized pseudo-Anosov maps of [19]. They have a transverse pair of invariant full measure turbulations, consisting of streamlines which are dense injectively immersed lines: these turbulations are equipped with measures which are expanded and contracted uniformly by the homeomorphism. The turbulations need not have a good product structure anywhere, but have some local structure imposed by the existence of tartans: bundles of unstable and stable streamline segments which intersect regularly, and on whose intersections the product of the measures on the turbulations agrees with the ambient measure.
  Each map $F_\lambda$ is semi-conjugate to the inverse limit of the core tent map with slope $\lambda$: it is topologically transitive, ergodic with respect to a background Oxtoby-Ulam measure, has dense periodic points, and has topological entropy $h(F_\lambda) = \log \lambda$ (so that no two $F_\lambda$ are topologically conjugate). For a full measure, dense $G_\delta$ set of parameters, $F_\lambda$ is a measurable pseudo-Anosov map but not a generalized pseudo-Anosov map, and its turbulations are nowhere locally regular.</description>

      <title>Action Functional as an Early Warning Indicator in the Space of Probability Measures via Schr\"odinger Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10405v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Critical transitions and tipping phenomena between two meta-stable states in stochastic dynamical systems are a significant scientific issue. In this work, we expand the methodology of identifying the most probable transition pathway between two meta-stable states with Onsager-Machlup action functional, to investigate the evolutionary transition dynamics between two meta-stable invariant sets with Schr\"odinger bridge. In contrast to existing methodologies such as statistical analysis, bifurcation theory, information theory, statistical physics, topology, and graph theory for early warning indicators, we introduce a novel framework on Early Warning Signals (EWS) within the realm of probability measures that align with the entropy production rate (EPR). To validate our framework, we apply it to the Morris-Lecar model and investigate the transition dynamics between a meta-stable state and a stable invariant set (the limit cycle or homoclinic orbit) under various conditions. Additionally, we analyze real Alzheimer's data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database to explore EWS indicating the transition from healthy to pre-AD states. This framework not only expands the transition pathway to encompass measures between two specified densities on invariant sets, but also demonstrates the potential of our early warning indicators for complex diseases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using techniques from many-body quantum theory, we propose a framework for representing the evolution of observables of measure-preserving ergodic flows through infinite-dimensional rotation systems on tori. This approach is based on a class of weighted Fock spaces $F_w(\mathcal H_\tau)$ generated by a 1-parameter family of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces $\mathcal H_\tau$, and endowed with commutative Banach algebra structure under the symmetric tensor product using a subconvolutive weight $w$. We describe the construction of the spaces $F_w(\mathcal H_\tau)$ and show that their Banach algebra spectra, $\sigma(F_w(\mathcal H_\tau))$, decompose into a family of tori of potentially infinite dimension. Spectrally consistent unitary approximations $U^t_\tau$ of the Koopman operator acting on $\mathcal H_\tau$ are then lifted to rotation systems on these tori akin to the topological models of ergodic systems with pure point spectra in the Halmos--von Neumann theorem. Our scheme also employs a procedure for representing observables of the original system by polynomial functions on finite-dimensional tori in $\sigma(F_w(\mathcal H_\tau))$ of arbitrarily large degree, with coefficients determined from pointwise products of eigenfunctions of $U^t_\tau$. This leads to models for the Koopman evolution of observables on $L^2$ built from tensor products of finite collections of approximate Koopman eigenfunctions. Numerically, the scheme is amenable to consistent data-driven implementation using kernel methods. We illustrate it with applications to Stepanoff flows on the 2-torus and the Lorenz 63 system. Connections with quantum computing are also discussed.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the penalty function for the $\mathbb{Z}^2$-hard square shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of maximizing measures for a penalty function of a two-dimensional subshift of finite type, building on the work of Gonschorowski et al. \cite{GQS}. In the one-dimensional case, such measures remain stable under Lipschitz perturbations for any subshift of finite type. However, instability arises for a penalty function of the Robinson tiling, which is a two-dimensional subshift of finite type with no periodic point and zero entropy. This raises the question of whether stability persists in two-dimensional subshifts of finite type with positive topological entropy. In this paper, we address this question by studying the $\mathbb{Z}^2$-hard square shift, a well-known example of a two-dimensional subshift with positive entropy. Our main theorem establishes that, in contrast to previous results, a penalty function of the hard square shift remains stable under Lipschitz perturbations.</description>

      <title>On real and observable rational realizations of input-output equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a single (differential-algebraic) input-output equation, we present a method for finding different representations of the associated system in the form of rational realizations; these are dynamical systems with rational right-hand sides. It has been shown that in the case where the input-output equation is of order one, rational realizations can be computed, if they exist. In this work, we focus first on the existence and actual computation of the so-called observable rational realizations, and secondly on rational realizations with real coefficients. The study of observable realizations allows to find every rational realization of a given first order input-output equation, and the necessary field extensions in this process. We show that for first order input-output equations the existence of a rational realization is equivalent to the existence of an observable rational realization. Moreover, we give a criterion to decide the existence of real rational realizations. The computation of observable and real realizations of first order input-output equations is fully algorithmic. We also present partial results for the case of higher order input-output equations.</description>

      <title>Energy matching in reduced passive and port-Hamiltonian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that any port-Hamiltonian (pH) system is passive, and conversely, any minimal and stable passive system has a pH representation. Nevertheless, this equivalence is only concerned with the input-output mapping but not with the Hamiltonian itself. Thus, we propose to view a pH system either as an enlarged dynamical system with the Hamiltonian as additional output or as two dynamical systems with the input-output and the Hamiltonian dynamic. Our first main result is a structure-preserving Kalman-like decomposition of the enlarged pH system that separates the controllable and zero-state observable parts. Moreover, for further approximations in the context of structure-preserving model-order reduction (MOR), we propose to search for a Hamiltonian in the reduced pH system that minimizes the $\mathcal{H}_2$-distance to the full-order Hamiltonian without altering the input-output dynamic, thus discussing a particular aspect of the corresponding multi-objective minimization problem corresponding to $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal MOR for pH systems. We show that this optimization problem is uniquely solvable, can be recast as a standard semidefinite program, and present two numerical approaches for solving it. The results are illustrated with three academic examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every Hardy field extends to an $\omega$-free Hardy field. This result relates to classical oscillation criteria for second-order homogeneous linear differential equations. It is essential in [11], and here we apply it to answer questions of Boshernitzan, and to generalize a theorem of his.</description>

      <title>The intrinsic reductions and the intrinsic depths in non-archimedean dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short paper, we aim at giving a more conceptual and simpler proof of Rumely's moduli theoretic characterization of type II minimal locus of the resultant function $\operatorname{ordRes}_\phi$ on the Berkovich hyperbolic space for a rational function $\phi$ on $\mathbb{P}^1$ defined over an algebraically closed and complete non-archimedean and non-trivially valued field, and also at making it sharper and simplifying the proof of the degenerating limit theorem of DeMarco--Faber for the family of the unique maximal entropy measures on $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$ associated to a meromorphic family of complex rational functions. For those aims, we introduce the intrinsic reduction of $\phi$ at each point in the Berkovich projective line and its directionwise intrinsic depths, which are defined in terms of the tree and analytic structures of the Berkovich projective line and are suitable languages, and then establish two theorems in non-archimedean dynamics.</description>

      <title>Modeling advection on distance-weighted directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a model for describing advection dynamics on distance-weighted directed graphs. To this end we establish a set of key properties, or axioms, that a discrete advection operator should satisfy, and prove that there exists an essentially unique operator satisfying all such properties. Both infinite and finite networks are considered, as well as possible variants and extensions. We illustrate the proposed model through examples, both analytical and numerical, and we describe an application to the simulation of a traffic network.</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis of multiplicative chaos Part I: the proof of Garban-Vargas conjecture for 1D GMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the exact Fourier dimension for all standard sub-critical Gaussian multiplicative chaos on the unit interval, thereby confirming the Garban-Vargas conjecture. The proof relies on a significant improvement of the vector-valued martingale method, initially developed by Chen-Han-Qiu-Wang in the studies of the Fourier dimensions of Mandelbrot cascade random measures.</description>
