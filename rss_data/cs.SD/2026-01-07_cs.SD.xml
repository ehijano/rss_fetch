      <title>Quantifying Quanvolutional Neural Networks Robustness for Speech in Healthcare Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech-based machine learning systems are sensitive to noise, complicating reliable deployment in emotion recognition and voice pathology detection. We evaluate the robustness of a hybrid quantum machine learning model, quanvolutional neural networks (QNNs) against classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under four acoustic corruptions (Gaussian noise, pitch shift, temporal shift, and speed variation) in a clean-train/corrupted-test regime. Using AVFAD (voice pathology) and TESS (speech emotion), we compare three QNN models (Random, Basic, Strongly) to a simple CNN baseline (CNN-Base), ResNet-18 and VGG-16 using accuracy and corruption metrics (CE, mCE, RCE, RmCE), and analyze architectural factors (circuit complexity or depth, convergence) alongside per-emotion robustness. QNNs generally outperform the CNN-Base under pitch shift, temporal shift, and speed variation (up to 22% lower CE/RCE at severe temporal shift), while the CNN-Base remains more resilient to Gaussian noise. Among quantum circuits, QNN-Basic achieves the best overall robustness on AVFAD, and QNN-Random performs strongest on TESS. Emotion-wise, fear is most robust (80-90% accuracy under severe corruptions), neutral can collapse under strong Gaussian noise (5.5% accuracy), and happy is most vulnerable to pitch, temporal, and speed distortions. QNNs also converge up to six times faster than the CNN-Base. To our knowledge, this is a systematic study of QNN robustness for speech under common non-adversarial acoustic corruptions, indicating that shallow entangling quantum front-ends can improve noise resilience while sensitivity to additive noise remains a challenge.</description>

      <title>VocalBridge: Latent Diffusion-Bridge Purification for Defeating Perturbation-Based Voiceprint Defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech synthesis technologies, including text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC), has intensified security and privacy concerns related to voice cloning. Recent defenses attempt to prevent unauthorized cloning by embedding protective perturbations into speech to obscure speaker identity while maintaining intelligibility. However, adversaries can apply advanced purification techniques to remove these perturbations, recover authentic acoustic characteristics, and regenerate cloneable voices. Despite the growing realism of such attacks, the robustness of existing defenses under adaptive purification remains insufficiently studied.
  Most existing purification methods are designed to counter adversarial noise in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems rather than speaker verification or voice cloning pipelines. As a result, they fail to suppress the fine-grained acoustic cues that define speaker identity and are often ineffective against speaker verification attacks (SVA). To address these limitations, we propose Diffusion-Bridge (VocalBridge), a purification framework that learns a latent mapping from perturbed to clean speech in the EnCodec latent space. Using a time-conditioned 1D U-Net with a cosine noise schedule, the model enables efficient, transcript-free purification while preserving speaker-discriminative structure. We further introduce a Whisper-guided phoneme variant that incorporates lightweight temporal guidance without requiring ground-truth transcripts. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms existing purification methods in recovering cloneable voices from protected speech. Our findings demonstrate the fragility of current perturbation-based defenses and highlight the need for more robust protection mechanisms against evolving voice-cloning and speaker verification threats.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Quantization Error Propagation in Encoder-Decoder ASR Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Running Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models on memory-constrained edge devices requires efficient compression. While layer-wise post-training quantization is effective, it suffers from error accumulation, especially in encoder-decoder architectures. Existing solutions like Quantization Error Propagation (QEP) are suboptimal for ASR due to the model's heterogeneity, processing acoustic features in the encoder while generating text in the decoder. To address this, we propose Fine-grained Alpha for Dynamic Quantization Error Propagation (FADE), which adaptively controls the trade-off between cross-layer error correction and local quantization. Experiments show that FADE significantly improves stability by reducing performance variance across runs, while simultaneously surpassing baselines in mean WER.</description>

      <title>Understanding Human Perception of Music Plagiarism Through a Computational Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a wide variety of music similarity detection algorithms, while discussions about music plagiarism in the real world are often based on audience perceptions. Therefore, we aim to conduct a study to examine the key criteria of human perception of music plagiarism, focusing on the three commonly used musical features in similarity analysis: melody, rhythm, and chord progression. After identifying the key features and levels of variation humans use in perceiving musical similarity, we propose a LLM-as-a-judge framework that applies a systematic, step-by-step approach, drawing on modules that extract such high-level attributes.</description>

      <title>A Music Information Retrieval Approach to Classify Sub-Genres in Role Playing Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video game music (VGM) is often studied under the same lens as film music, which largely focuses on its theoretical functionality with relation to the identified genres of the media. However, till date, we are unaware of any systematic approach that analyzes the quantifiable musical features in VGM across several identified game genres. Therefore, we extracted musical features from VGM in games from three sub-genres of Role-Playing Games (RPG), and then hypothesized how different musical features are correlated to the perceptions and portrayals of each genre. This observed correlation may be used to further suggest such features are relevant to the expected storytelling elements or play mechanics associated with the sub-genre.</description>

      <title>Multi-channel multi-speaker transformer for speech recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of teleconferencing and in-vehicle voice assistants, far-field multi-speaker speech recognition has become a hot research topic. Recently, a multi-channel transformer (MCT) has been proposed, which demonstrates the ability of the transformer to model far-field acoustic environments. However, MCT cannot encode high-dimensional acoustic features for each speaker from mixed input audio because of the interference between speakers. Based on these, we propose the multi-channel multi-speaker transformer (M2Former) for far-field multi-speaker ASR in this paper. Experiments on the SMS-WSJ benchmark show that the M2Former outperforms the neural beamformer, MCT, dual-path RNN with transform-average-concatenate and multi-channel deep clustering based end-to-end systems by 9.2%, 14.3%, 24.9%, and 52.2% respectively, in terms of relative word error rate reduction.</description>

      <title>Omni2Sound: Towards Unified Video-Text-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training a unified model integrating video-to-audio (V2A), text-to-audio (T2A), and joint video-text-to-audio (VT2A) generation offers significant application flexibility, yet faces two unexplored foundational challenges: (1) the scarcity of high-quality audio captions with tight A-V-T alignment, leading to severe semantic conflict between multimodal conditions, and (2) cross-task and intra-task competition, manifesting as an adverse V2A-T2A performance trade-off and modality bias in the VT2A task. First, to address data scarcity, we introduce SoundAtlas, a large-scale dataset (470k pairs) that significantly outperforms existing benchmarks and even human experts in quality. Powered by a novel agentic pipeline, it integrates Vision-to-Language Compression to mitigate visual bias of MLLMs, a Junior-Senior Agent Handoff for a 5 times cost reduction, and rigorous Post-hoc Filtering to ensure fidelity. Consequently, SoundAtlas delivers semantically rich and temporally detailed captions with tight V-A-T alignment. Second, we propose Omni2Sound, a unified VT2A diffusion model supporting flexible input modalities. To resolve the inherent cross-task and intra-task competition, we design a three-stage multi-task progressive training schedule that converts cross-task competition into joint optimization and mitigates modality bias in the VT2A task, maintaining both audio-visual alignment and off-screen audio generation faithfulness. Finally, we construct VGGSound-Omni, a comprehensive benchmark for unified evaluation, including challenging off-screen tracks. With a standard DiT backbone, Omni2Sound achieves unified SOTA performance across all three tasks within a single model, demonstrating strong generalization across benchmarks with heterogeneous input conditions.

      <title>UniSRCodec: Unified and Low-Bitrate Single Codebook Codec with Sub-Band Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Audio Codecs (NACs) can reduce transmission overhead by performing compact compression and reconstruction, which also aim to bridge the gap between continuous and discrete signals. Existing NACs can be divided into two categories: multi-codebook and single-codebook codecs. Multi-codebook codecs face challenges such as structural complexity and difficulty in adapting to downstream tasks, while single-codebook codecs, though structurally simpler, suffer from low-fidelity, ineffective modeling of unified audio, and an inability to support modeling of high-frequency audio. We propose the UniSRCodec, a single-codebook codec capable of supporting high sampling rate, low-bandwidth, high fidelity, and unified. We analyze the inefficiency of waveform-based compression and introduce the time and frequency compression method using the Mel-spectrogram, and cooperate with a Vocoder to recover the phase information of the original audio. Moreover, we propose a sub-band reconstruction technique to achieve high-quality compression across both low and high frequency bands. Subjective and objective experimental results demonstrate that UniSRCodec achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among cross-domain single-codebook codecs with only a token rate of 40, and its reconstruction quality is comparable to that of certain multi-codebook methods.

      <title>SPO-CLAPScore: Enhancing CLAP-based alignment prediction system with Standardize Preference Optimization, for the first XACLE Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first XACLE Challenge (x-to-audio alignment challenge) addresses the critical need for automatic evaluation metrics that correlate with human perception of audio-text semantic alignment. In this paper, we describe the "Takano_UTokyo_03" system submitted to XACLE Challenge. Our approach leverages a CLAPScore-based architecture integrated with a novel training method called Standardized Preference Optimization (SPO). SPO standardizes the raw alignment scores provided by each listener, enabling the model to learn relative preferences and mitigate the impact of individual scoring biases. Additionally, we employ listener screening to exclude listeners with inconsistent ratings. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that both SPO and listener screening effectively improve the correlation with human judgment. Our system achieved 6th place in the challenge with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) of 0.6142, demonstrating competitive performance within a marginal gap from the top-ranked systems. The code is available at https://github.com/ttakano398/SPO-CLAPScore.</description>

      <title>Vulnerabilities of Audio-Based Biometric Authentication Systems Against Deepfake Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As audio deepfakes transition from research artifacts to widely available commercial tools, robust biometric authentication faces pressing security threats in high-stakes industries. This paper presents a systematic empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art speaker authentication systems based on a large-scale speech synthesis dataset, revealing two major security vulnerabilities: 1) modern voice cloning models trained on very small samples can easily bypass commercial speaker verification systems; and 2) anti-spoofing detectors struggle to generalize across different methods of audio synthesis, leading to a significant gap between in-domain performance and real-world robustness. These findings call for a reconsideration of security measures and stress the need for architectural innovations, adaptive defenses, and the transition towards multi-factor authentication.</description>

      <title>The World is Not Mono: Enabling Spatial Understanding in Large Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing large audio-language models perceive the world as "mono" -- a single stream of audio that ignores the critical spatial dimension ("where") required for universal acoustic scene analysis. To bridge this gap, we first introduce a hierarchical framework for Auditory Scene Analysis (ASA). Guided by this framework, we introduce a system that enables models like Qwen2-Audio to understand and reason about the complex acoustic world. Our framework achieves this through three core contributions: First, we build a large-scale, synthesized binaural audio dataset to provide the rich spatial cues. Second, we design a hybrid feature projector, which leverages parallel semantic and spatial encoders to extract decoupled representations. These distinct streams are integrated via a dense fusion mechanism, ensuring the model receives a holistic view of the acoustic scene. Finally, we employ a progressive training curriculum, advancing from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to explicitly evolve the model's capabilities towards reasoning. On our comprehensive benchmark, the model demonstrates comparatively strong capability for spatial understanding. By enabling this spatial perception, our work provides a clear pathway for leveraging the powerful reasoning abilities of large models towards holistic acoustic scene analysis, advancing from "mono" semantic recognition to spatial intelligence.</description>

      <title>MoE Adapter for Large Audio Language Models: Sparsity, Disentanglement, and Gradient-Conflict-Free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending the input modality of Large Language Models~(LLMs) to the audio domain is essential for achieving comprehensive multimodal perception. However, it is well-known that acoustic information is intrinsically \textit{heterogeneous}, entangling attributes such as speech, music, and environmental context. Existing research is limited to a dense, parameter-shared adapter to model these diverse patterns, which induces \textit{gradient conflict} during optimization, as parameter updates required for distinct attributes contradict each other. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textit{\textbf{MoE-Adapter}}, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts~(MoE) architecture designed to decouple acoustic information. Specifically, it employs a dynamic gating mechanism that routes audio tokens to specialized experts capturing complementary feature subspaces while retaining shared experts for global context, thereby mitigating gradient conflicts and enabling fine-grained feature learning. Comprehensive experiments show that the MoE-Adapter achieves superior performance on both audio semantic and paralinguistic tasks, consistently outperforming dense linear baselines with comparable computational costs. Furthermore, we will release the related code and models to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Interpretable All-Type Audio Deepfake Detection with Audio LLMs via Frequency-Time Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in audio large language models (ALLMs) have made high-quality synthetic audio widely accessible, increasing the risk of malicious audio deepfakes across speech, environmental sounds, singing voice, and music. Real-world audio deepfake detection (ADD) therefore requires all-type detectors that generalize across heterogeneous audio and provide interpretable decisions. Given the strong multi-task generalization ability of ALLMs, we first investigate their performance on all-type ADD under both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, SFT using only binary real/fake labels tends to reduce the model to a black-box classifier, sacrificing interpretability. Meanwhile, vanilla RFT under sparse supervision is prone to reward hacking and can produce hallucinated, ungrounded rationales. To address this, we propose an automatic annotation and polishing pipeline that constructs Frequency-Time structured chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, producing ~340K cold-start demonstrations. Building on CoT data, we propose Frequency Time-Group Relative Policy Optimization (FT-GRPO), a two-stage training paradigm that cold-starts ALLMs with SFT and then applies GRPO under rule-based frequency-time constraints. Experiments demonstrate that FT-GRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on all-type ADD while producing interpretable, FT-grounded rationales. The data and code are available online.</description>

      <title>Segment-Aware Conditioning for Training-Free Intra-Utterance Emotion and Duration Control in Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While controllable Text-to-Speech (TTS) has achieved notable progress, most existing methods remain limited to inter-utterance-level control, making fine-grained intra-utterance expression challenging due to their reliance on non-public datasets or complex multi-stage training. In this paper, we propose a training-free controllable framework for pretrained zero-shot TTS to enable intra-utterance emotion and duration expression. Specifically, we propose a segment-aware emotion conditioning strategy that combines causal masking with monotonic stream alignment filtering to isolate emotion conditioning and schedule mask transitions, enabling smooth intra-utterance emotion shifts while preserving global semantic coherence. Based on this, we further propose a segment-aware duration steering strategy to combine local duration embedding steering with global EOS logit modulation, allowing local duration adjustment while ensuring globally consistent termination. To eliminate the need for segment-level manual prompt engineering, we construct a 30,000-sample multi-emotion and duration-annotated text dataset to enable LLM-based automatic prompt construction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our training-free method not only achieves state-of-the-art intra-utterance consistency in multi-emotion and duration control, but also maintains baseline-level speech quality of the underlying TTS model.

      <title>The Sonar Moment: Benchmarking Audio-Language Models in Audio Geo-Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geo-localization aims to infer the geographic origin of a given signal. In computer vision, geo-localization has served as a demanding benchmark for compositional reasoning and is relevant to public safety. In contrast, progress on audio geo-localization has been constrained by the lack of high-quality audio-location pairs. To address this gap, we introduce AGL1K, the first audio geo-localization benchmark for audio language models (ALMs), spanning 72 countries and territories. To extract reliably localizable samples from a crowd-sourced platform, we propose the Audio Localizability metric that quantifies the informativeness of each recording, yielding 1,444 curated audio clips. Evaluations on 16 ALMs show that ALMs have emerged with audio geo-localization capability. We find that closed-source models substantially outperform open-source models, and that linguistic clues often dominate as a scaffold for prediction. We further analyze ALMs' reasoning traces, regional bias, error causes, and the interpretability of the localizability metric. Overall, AGL1K establishes a benchmark for audio geo-localization and may advance ALMs with better geospatial reasoning capability.</description>

      <title>WearVox: An Egocentric Multichannel Voice Assistant Benchmark for Wearables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wearable devices such as AI glasses are transforming voice assistants into always-available, hands-free collaborators that integrate seamlessly with daily life, but they also introduce challenges like egocentric audio affected by motion and noise, rapid micro-interactions, and the need to distinguish device-directed speech from background conversations. Existing benchmarks largely overlook these complexities, focusing instead on clean or generic conversational audio. To bridge this gap, we present WearVox, the first benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate voice assistants in realistic wearable scenarios. WearVox comprises 3,842 multi-channel, egocentric audio recordings collected via AI glasses across five diverse tasks including Search-Grounded QA, Closed-Book QA, Side-Talk Rejection, Tool Calling, and Speech Translation, spanning a wide range of indoor and outdoor environments and acoustic conditions. Each recording is accompanied by rich metadata, enabling nuanced analysis of model performance under real-world constraints. We benchmark leading proprietary and open-source speech Large Language Models (SLLMs) and find that most real-time SLLMs achieve accuracies on WearVox ranging from 29% to 59%, with substantial performance degradation on noisy outdoor audio, underscoring the difficulty and realism of the benchmark. Additionally, we conduct a case study with two new SLLMs that perform inference with single-channel and multi-channel audio, demonstrating that multi-channel audio inputs significantly enhance model robustness to environmental noise and improve discrimination between device-directed and background speech. Our results highlight the critical importance of spatial audio cues for context-aware voice assistants and establish WearVox as a comprehensive testbed for advancing wearable voice AI research.</description>

      <title>Exploring How Audio Effects Alter Emotion with Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio effects (FX) such as reverberation, distortion, modulation, and dynamic range processing play a pivotal role in shaping emotional responses during music listening. While prior studies have examined links between low-level audio features and affective perception, the systematic impact of audio FX on emotion remains underexplored. This work investigates how foundation models - large-scale neural architectures pretrained on multimodal data - can be leveraged to analyze these effects. Such models encode rich associations between musical structure, timbre, and affective meaning, offering a powerful framework for probing the emotional consequences of sound design techniques. By applying various probing methods to embeddings from deep learning models, we examine the complex, nonlinear relationships between audio FX and estimated emotion, uncovering patterns tied to specific effects and evaluating the robustness of foundation audio models. Our findings aim to advance understanding of the perceptual impact of audio production practices, with implications for music cognition, performance, and affective computing.</description>

      <title>CMDAR: A Chinese Multi-scene Dynamic Audio Reasoning Benchmark with Diverse Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to reason from audio, including speech, environmental sounds, and music, is essential for AI agents to interact effectively in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on static or single-scene settings and English audio data and do not fully capture scenarios where multiple speakers, unfolding events, and heterogeneous audio sources interact. To address these challenges, we introduce CMDAR, a Chinese benchmark for evaluating models on complex, multi-scene, and dynamically evolving audio reasoning tasks. CMDAR comprises 3,000 carefully curated question-answer pairs linked to diverse audio clips, covering five categories of complex reasoning and spanning three question types. We benchmark 26 state-of-the-art audio language models on CMDAR and observe that they exhibit limitations in complex reasoning tasks. In CMDAR-main, Qwen2.5-Omni achieves 76.67% accuracy, whereas GPT-4o Audio reaches 68.47%. However, GPT-4o Audio substantially outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni on the more challenging multiple-choice with multiple audios and open-ended tasks. And we provide detail analysis corresponding suggestions for the future development of large audio language models.</description>

      <title>Musical Score Understanding Benchmark: Evaluating Large Language Models' Comprehension of Complete Musical Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding complete musical scores entails integrated reasoning over pitch, rhythm, harmony, and large-scale structure, yet the ability of Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models to interpret full musical notation remains insufficiently examined. We introduce the Musical Score Understanding Benchmark (MSU-Bench), the first large-scale, human-curated benchmark for score-level musical understanding across textual (ABC notation) and visual (PDF) modalities. MSU-Bench contains 1,800 generative Question-Answering pairs from works by Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Debussy, and others, organised into four levels of increasing difficulty, ranging from onset information to texture and form. Evaluations of more than fifteen state-of-the-art models, in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, reveal pronounced modality gaps, unstable level-wise performance, and challenges in maintaining multilevel correctness. Fine-tuning substantially improves results across modalities while preserving general knowledge, positioning MSU-Bench as a robust foundation for future research in multimodal reasoning. To facilitate further research, we publicly release MSU-Bench and all associated resources.</description>

      <title>MOSS Transcribe Diarize: Accurate Transcription with Speaker Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription (SATS) aims to transcribe what is said and to precisely determine the timing of each speaker, which is particularly valuable for meeting transcription. Existing SATS systems rarely adopt an end-to-end formulation and are further constrained by limited context windows, weak long-range speaker memory, and the inability to output timestamps. To address these limitations, we present MOSS Transcribe Diarize, a unified multimodal large language model that jointly performs Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription in an end-to-end paradigm. Trained on extensive real wild data and equipped with a 128k context window for up to 90-minute inputs, MOSS Transcribe Diarize scales well and generalizes robustly. Across comprehensive evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art commercial systems on multiple public and in-house benchmarks.</description>

      <title>TELEVAL: A Dynamic Benchmark Designed for Spoken Language Models in Chinese Interactive Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, accompanied by a growing number of evaluation benchmarks. However, most existing benchmarks emphasize task completion and capability scaling, while remaining poorly aligned with how users interact with SLMs in real-world spoken conversations. Effective spoken interaction requires not only accurate understanding of user intent and content, but also the ability to respond with appropriate interactional strategies. In this paper, we present TELEVAL, a dynamic, user-centered benchmark for evaluating SLMs in realistic Chinese spoken interaction scenarios. TELEVAL consolidates evaluation into two core aspects. Reliable Content Fulfillment assesses whether models can comprehend spoken inputs and produce semantically correct responses. Interactional Appropriateness evaluates whether models act as socially capable interlocutors, requiring them not only to generate human-like, colloquial responses, but also to implicitly incorporate paralinguistic cues for natural interaction. Experiments reveal that, despite strong performance on semantic and knowledge-oriented tasks, current SLMs still struggle to produce natural and interactionally appropriate responses, highlighting the need for more interaction-faithful evaluation.</description>
