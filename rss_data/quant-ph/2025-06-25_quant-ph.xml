      <title>Universal framework with exponential speedup for the quantum simulation of quantum field theories including QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum simulation framework universally applicable to a wide class of quantum systems, including quantum field theories such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Specifically, we generalize an efficient quantum simulation protocol developed for bosonic theories in [Halimeh et al., arXiv:2411.13161] which, when applied to Yang-Mills theory, demonstrated an exponential resource advantage with respect to the truncation level of the bosonic modes, to systems with both bosons and fermions using the Jordan-Wigner transform and also the Verstraete-Cirac transform. We apply this framework to QCD using the orbifold lattice formulation and achieve an exponential speedup compared to previous proposals. As a by-product, exponential speedup is achieved in the quantum simulation of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian, the latter being a special limit of the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian. In the case of Hamiltonian time evolution of a theory on an $L^d$ spatial lattice via Trotterization, one Trotter step can be realized using $\mathcal{O}(L^d)$ numbers of CNOT gates, Hadamard gates, phase gates, and one-qubit rotations. We show this analytically for any matter content and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge group with any $N$. Even when we use the Jordan-Wigner transform, we can utilize the cancellation of quantum gates to significantly simplify the quantum circuit. We also discuss a block encoding of the Hamiltonian as a linear combination of unitaries using the Verstraete-Cirac transform. Our protocols do not assume oracles, but rather present explicit constructions with rigorous resource estimations without a hidden cost, and are thus readily implementable on a quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Nonstabilizerness and Error Resilience in Noisy Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how noise impacts nonstabilizerness - a key resource for quantum advantage - in many-body qubit systems. While noise typically degrades quantum resources, we show that amplitude damping, a nonunital channel, can generate or enhance magic, whereas depolarizing noise provably cannot. In an encoding-decoding protocol, we find that, unlike in the coherent case, a sharp decoding fidelity transition does not match a transition in nonstabilizerness. Our results point toward the possibility of leveraging, rather than merely mitigating, noise for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Transversal Surface-Code Game Powered by Neutral Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atom technologies have opened the door to novel theoretical advances in surface-code protocols for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC), offering a compelling alternative to lattice surgery by leveraging transversal gates. However, a crucial gap remains between the theory of FTQC and its practical realization on neutral atom systems; most critically, a key theoretical requirement -- that syndrome extraction must be performed frequently enough to keep error accumulation below a threshold constant -- is difficult to satisfy in a scalable manner in conventional zoned approach. In this work, we develop a comprehensive theoretical framework that closes such a gap, bridging theoretical advances in surface-code fault-tolerant protocols with capabilities of neutral atoms. Building on the "game of surface code" framework originally developed for superconducting qubits, we introduce an alternative game-based paradigm for transversal-gate FTQC that harnesses the unique strengths of neutral atom arrays. The game rules are designed to enable syndrome extraction at any intermediate step during logical gate implementation, ensuring compatibility with the threshold theorem. We further present an efficient method for designing resource state factories tailored to transversal-gate FTQC. As an application, our framework offers a systematic methodology and high-level abstraction for resource estimation and optimization, demonstrating that space-time performance competitive with a baseline lattice-surgery-based approach on superconducting qubits is possible, even when physical operations on neutral atoms are orders of magnitude slower. These results establish a solid foundation that bridges the theory and experiment of FTQC powered by neutral atoms, charting a well-founded pathway toward scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computers and setting practical directions for technological development.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Scaling Limit in Critical Quantum Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical quantum metrology aims to harness critical properties near quantum phase transitions to enhance parameter estimation precision. However, critical slowing down inherently limits the achievable precision within a finite evolution time. To address this challenge, we establish a fundamental scaling limit of critical quantum metrology with respect to the total evolution time. We find that the winding number of the system's phase space trajectory determines the scaling bound of quantum Fisher information. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the exponential scaling of the quantum Fisher information can be obtained, and for this, it is necessary to increase the winding number by the total evolution time. We explicitly construct a time-dependent control to achieve optimal scaling from a simple on-off scheme depending on the system's phase and discuss its topological nature. We highlight that such an exponential scaling of quantum Fisher information remains valid even without reaching the critical point and in the presence of thermal dissipation, albeit with a decreased exponent.</description>

      <title>Dissipative quantum North-East-Center model: steady-state phase diagram, universality and nonergodic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the dissipative quantum North-East-Center (NEC) model: a two-dimensional spin-1/2 lattice subject to chiral, kinetically constrained dissipation and coherent quantum interactions. This model combines kinetic constraints and chirality at the dissipative level, implementing local incoherent spin flips conditioned by an asymmetric majority-vote rule. Through a cluster mean-field approach, we determine the steady-state phase diagram of the NEC model under different Hamiltonians, consistently revealing the emergence of two distinct phases, bistable and normal, across all cases considered. We further investigate the stability of the steady-state with respect to inhomogeneous fluctuations in both phases, showing the emergence of instabilities at finite wavevectors in the proximity of the phase transition. Next, we study the nonergodicity of the model in the bistable phase. We characterize the dynamics of minority islands of spins surrounded by a large background of spins pointing in the opposite direction. We show that in the bistable phase, the minority islands are always reabsorbed by the surrounding at a constant velocity, irrespectively of their size. Finally, we propose and numerically benchmark an equation of motion for the reabsorption velocity of the islands where thermal and quantum fluctuations act independently at linear order.</description>

      <title>Programmable photonic quantum walks on lattices with cyclic, toroidal, and cylindrical topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic implementations of unitary processes on lattice structures, such as quantum walks, have been demonstrated across various architectures. However, few platforms offer the combined advantages of scalability, reconfigurability, and the ability to simulate dynamics on lattices with periodic boundary conditions, such as cyclic or toroidal geometries. Here, we employ a recently developed platform that enables the implementation of arbitrary translationally invariant unitary operations on one- and two-dimensional lattices, and demonstrate a natural mechanism for introducing periodic boundary conditions. Our approach leverages direct access to the reciprocal lattice, where discrete sampling of the unitary evolution effectively enforces the desired topology. We program our platform to realize quantum walks on 1D cyclic lattices and 2D lattices with cylindrical or toroidal topologies. The lattice size can be readily tuned by adjusting the sampling density in reciprocal space. By controlling reciprocal-space occupancy, we investigate the dynamics of localized states and wavepackets, observing refocusing behavior, breathing modes modulated by reciprocal-space discretizations, and wavepacket trajectories that reflect the underlying topology. We further demonstrate a form of dimensional reduction by mapping a 2D quantum walk on a cylinder to a 1D walk with a high-dimensional coin. These results establish a versatile platform for realizing a broad class of optical mode transformations within bounded Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Revealing Hidden Non n-Locality In n-Local Star Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Keeping pace with technological advancement, in the past decade, use of scalable networks have extended the study of quantum non-classicality beyond the regime of Bell-CHSH nonlocality. Present work provide characterization of non n-locality that can be exploited by incorporating filtering operations in star-shaped n-local networks. This in turn provide a framework of sequential n-local networks capable of generating non n-local correlations by involving some suitable form of stochastic local operations assisted with classical communications(SLOCC). It is observed that for effectiveness of such sequential networks, Bell-CHSH nonlocality(upto SLOCC operations) of every individual two-qubit state, distributed in the network, is not mandatory. However, there does not exist any separable local filter, which when applied in n-local network involving only Bell local states(upto SLOCC operations), can reveal non n-locality. Interestingly, instances revealing advantage of nonseparable mutli-qubit local filters over separable mutli-qubit local filters(by central node) are obtained. Such an advantage is attributable to the specific topology of star-shaped n-local networks and thus can never be reflected in Bell scenario.</description>

      <title>Pulsed laser attack at 1061 nm potentially compromises quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution systems offer cryptographic security, provided that all their components are thoroughly characterised. However, certain components might be vulnerable to a laser-damage attack, particularly when attacked at previously untested laser parameters. Here we show that exposing 1550-nm fiber-optic isolators to 17-mW average power, 1061-nm picosecond attacking pulses reduces their isolation below a safe threshold. Furthermore, the exposure to 1160-mW sub-nanosecond pulsed illumination permanently degrades isolation at 1550 nm while the isolators maintain forward transparency. These threats are not addressed by the currently-practiced security analysis.</description>

      <title>Generation of hyperentangled photon pairs in the time and frequency domain on a silicon photonic chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-dimensional entangled photon states represent an important resource in quantum communication networks. Specifically, hyperentangled states presenting simultaneous entanglement in several degrees of freedom (DoF), stand out for their noise resilience and information capacity. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of hyperentangled photon pairs in the time and frequency-bin domain by spontaneous four-wave mixing from the coherent driving of two integrated Silicon microresonators. We demonstrate entanglement in each DoF by proving the violation of the Clauser Horne Shimony Holt (CHSH) inequality by more than 27 standard deviations (STDs) in each reduced space. Genuine hyperentanglement is then assessed from the negativity of an hyperentanglement witness, which is verified by more than 60 STDs. These results mark, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of time-frequency bin hyperentanglement in an integrated silicon photonic device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a Hamiltonian of physical interest, we show the existence of a unitary transformation that drives the initial state of a two-qubit system to a designated final state. We implement an application of the above framework by finding an optimal control process that enables us to determine the entanglement of the two-qubit system with a single measurement. We also show that this process is robust to environmental noise. Our results provide mathematical justification for our earlier computational experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbation theory is used to investigate the evolution of the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem of a bipartite quantum system in the course of a gedanken scattering experiment. We find surprisingly simple criteria for the initial state and the scattering matrix that guarantee that the subsystem entropy increases. The class of states that meet these criteria are more correlated than simple product states of the subsystems. They form a subclass of the set of all separable states, and they can therefore be assembled by classical processes alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate quantum entanglement and work extraction in two distinct optomechanical systems. The first system consists of two spatially separated Fabry-P\'erot cavities driven by squeezed light in the resolved-sideband regime, while the second system comprises a laser field incident on a vibrating mirror. We analyze the entanglement dynamics between optical and mechanical modes, as well as quantum correlations in a mixed optomechanical bipartite system (optic-optic mode) mediated by radiation pressure. Using logarithmic negativity as a measure, we quantify the entanglement evolution in both optic-optic and mirror-mirror bipartite subsystems. Furthermore, we show how three distinct types of extractable work vary with system parameters and examine their relationship with entanglement. Our results highlight the relationship between quantum correlations and extracted work in optomechanical system, offering insights for quantum information processing and energy transfer in hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Berry Phase Calculation via Adaptive Variational Quantum Computing Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum computing approach for efficiently calculating the Berry phase in topological Hamiltonians. Our method leverages cyclic adiabatic evolution of the Hamiltonian and employs adaptive variational quantum algorithms for state preparation and evolution, optimizing circuit efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. We benchmark our approach on dimerized Fermi-Hubbard chains with four sites, demonstrating precise Berry phase simulations in both noninteracting and interacting regimes. Our results show that circuit depths reach up to 106 layers for noninteracting systems and increase to 279 layers for interacting systems due to added complexity. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of our scheme across a wide range of parameters governing adiabatic evolution and variational algorithm. These findings highlight the potential of adaptive variational quantum algorithms for advancing quantum simulations of topological materials and computing geometric phases in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>An information-theoretic proof of the Planckian bound for thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that quantum mechanics entails a fundamental lower bound on the thermalization time $\tau$ of any system. At finite temperature, we show that $\tau$ is bounded by half the Planckian dissipation time, $\tau \geq \tau_{\rm Pl}/2$ with $\tau_{\rm Pl} = \hbar/(k_{\rm B} T)$. In the low-temperature regime, our bound takes the form $\tau \geq \hbar / \Delta$ with $\Delta$ the spectral gap, in close connection with the quantum adiabatic theorem. These bounds, rooted in Hamiltonian estimation, hold for arbitrary quantum processes that output states close to the corresponding thermal ensemble for a nontrivial class of Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Broadband photonic structures to achieve high coupling efficiencies and Purcell factors with dark and interlayer excitons in 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Horizontal slot waveguides are planar photonic structures with a guided mode which is strongly polarized in the out-of-plane direction and tightly confined in a sub-wavelength region of lower refractive index. We show through FDTD simulations that this mode can lead to coupling efficiencies $\beta&gt;80\%$ and Purcell factors $F_P&gt;10$ for some types of dark intralayer excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers -- more aplty named ``gray excitons'', as their out-of-plane dipole does couple to adequately polarized light -- as well as interlayer excitons in TMD heterostructures. These figures indicate a path to the strong coupling regime for gray and interlayer excitons, while bright excitons are poorly coupled to the slot mode and experience Purcell suppression for $\lambda&gt;\SI{1}{\micro\meter}$. A significant hurdle towards strong coupling, however, is the low oscillator strengths of these two excitonic species. We use the Tavis-Cummings model to show that a horizontal-slot racetrack resonator can overcome this difficulty and reach a cooperativity $C&gt;&gt;1$, albeit sacrificing the broadband characteristic of waveguides.</description>

      <title>Improved energy barrier in higher-dimensional hypergraph product codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-shot error correction outperform conventional approaches by requiring only one round of stabilizer measurements for decoding, even in the presence of measurement errors. This capability relates to the confinement property of codes, which provides an energy barrier lower bound. Earlier research established a confinement property for higher-dimensional hypergraph product (HHGP) codes (Quintavalle et al. 2021 PRX Quantum), resulting in an energy barrier lower bound for these codes. In this work, we show an improved energy barrier lower bound for HHGP codes with low-density parity-check (LDPC) properties. This bound is derived by analyzing the structure of the logical operators. Our bound exceeds results derived from confinement alone, and unlike standard hypergraph product codes, these higher dimensional variants can possess macroscopic energy barriers even when the underlying classical codes lack this property. Specifically, our analysis shows that the energy barrier of LDPC HHGP codes is lower bounded by the distance of the underlying classical codes. This lower bound is tight if the underlying classical codes exhibit system size-dependent distances but constant energy barriers, like 3D and 4D toric codes.</description>

      <title>Distributing entanglement at the quantum speed limit in Rydberg chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the transport of Rydberg excitations in chains of neutral atoms. We realize an effective flip-flop interaction using off-resonant driving fields. By tuning the relative distances between atoms and applying atom-selective detuning fields, we realize the perfect transport condition. This condition enables the transfer of a single Rydberg excitation from one end of the chain to the other, allowing the distribution of entanglement across the chain at the quantum speed limit. Through numerical simulations, we identify the set of control parameters that maximize the transport probability for experimentally relevant parameters. We study the various competing trade-offs involved in the hierarchy of approximations used to map the native Rydberg spin model onto the effective model driving spin transport. Our results suggest that entanglement can be distributed over chains of more than fifty atoms spanning hundreds of microns at room temperature. This study informs the selection of parameters for the experimental realization of perfect transport in Rydberg chains, providing a new approach to distribute entanglement among distant atoms in quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Impact of Heavy Noble Gases on the Magnetic Resonance Linewidth of Alkali-Metal Atoms: A Theoretical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance gyroscopes (NMRGs) employ noble-gas nuclear spins as inertial sensors and alkali-metal atoms as in-situ magnetometers. Heavy noble gases, particularly xenon, are widely used due to their large nuclear spin and strong spin-exchange coupling with alkali-metal atoms. However, their presence introduces additional collisional mechanisms that affect the alkali-metal magnetic resonance linewidth, thereby influencing magnetometer sensitivity and overall gyro performance. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework based on the density matrix formalism and master equation approach to quantitatively study how xenon-induced two-body and three-body interactions modify the linewidth of alkali-metal atoms under realistic NMRG conditions. Our analysis reveals that Xe atoms primarily broaden the linewidth via binary spindestruction collisions and van der Waals (vdW)-mediated F-damping processes, while the effect of Xe nuclear polarization is negligible at the ~1% level. We further demonstrate that nitrogen buffer gas plays a dual role: it directly contributes to alkali-metal spin relaxation through binary collisions and indirectly modulates vdW collision rates by altering molecular lifetimes. The interplay between these processes leads to an optimal nitrogen density that minimizes the linewidth. Additionally, we identify a temperature threshold above which light-narrowing emerges, with this threshold increasing alongside Xe density. These findings provide theoretical insight for optimizing spin relaxation control in alkali-metal magnetometers and improving NMRG performance.</description>

      <title>High-throughput spin-bath characterization of spin-defects in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detailed knowledge of the local environments of spin-defects in semiconductors, such as nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond or divacancies in silicon carbide, is crucial for optimizing control and entanglement protocols in quantum sensing and information applications. However, a direct experimental characterization of individual defect environments is not scalable, as spin bath measurements are extremely time consuming. In this work, we address the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering the atomic positions and hyperfine couplings of random nuclei surrounding spin-defects from sparse experimental coherence signals, which can be obtained in hours. To address the challenge to determine the number of isotopic nuclear spins along with their hyperfine couplings, we employ a trans-dimensional Bayesian approach that incorporates ab initio data. This approach provides posterior distributions of the numbers, hyperfine couplings, and locations of nuclear spins present in the sample. In addition to enabling high-throughput screening of spin-defects, we demonstrate how this trans-dimensional Bayesian approach can guide experimental design for dynamical decoupling experiments to detect nuclear spins within targeted hyperfine coupling regimes. While the primary focus is on accelerating spin-defect characterization, this Bayesian approach also lays the foundation for digital twin studies of spin-defects, where a virtual model of the spin-defect system evolves in real time with ongoing experimental measurements. Together, the set of tools we designed and applied paves the way for scalable deployment of spin-defects in semiconductors for quantum sensing and information applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Giant Atom Coupled with Disordered Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While ideal lattice models have been widely used to study giant-atom-lattice systems, they often neglect the disorder induced by defects during experimental fabrication. This work systematically explores the dynamics of a giant atom coupled to a disordered lattice characterized by random eigenfrequency fluctuations. By analyzing atomic excitation probabilities, photon dynamics, and energy spectra, we reveal that the system exhibits remarkable robustness when disorder is confined within a specific range. The atomic excitation probability remains stable, the lattice evolution process shows reproducibility, and the energy spectrum structure is minimally distorted. Notably, we introduce a quantitative parameter to measure non-Markovianity and demonstrate that disorder significantly influences the system's memory effects. These findings provide insights into the interplay between disorder, non-Markovianity, and photon dynamics, with potential applications in quantum information processing and the design of robust quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Continuous-variable Quantum Diffusion Model for State Generation and Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation and preservation of complex quantum states against environmental noise are paramount challenges in advancing continuous-variable (CV) quantum information processing. This paper introduces a novel framework based on continuous-variable quantum diffusion principles, synergizing them with CV quantum neural networks (CVQNNs) to address these dual challenges. For the task of state generation, our Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion Generative model (CVQD-G) employs a physically driven forward diffusion process using a thermal loss channel, which is then inverted by a learnable, parameter-efficient backward denoising process based on a CVQNN with time-embedding. This framework's capability is further extended for state recovery by the Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion Restoration model (CVQD-R), a specialized variant designed to restore quantum states, particularly coherent states with unknown parameters, from thermal degradation. Extensive numerical simulations validate these dual capabilities, demonstrating the high-fidelity generation of diverse Gaussian (coherent, squeezed) and non-Gaussian (Fock, cat) states, typically with fidelities exceeding 99%, and confirming the model's ability to robustly restore corrupted states. Furthermore, a comprehensive complexity analysis reveals favorable training and inference costs, highlighting the framework's efficiency, scalability, and its potential as a robust tool for quantum state engineering and noise mitigation in realistic CV quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A Qubit-Efficient Hybrid Quantum Encoding Mechanism for Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently embedding high-dimensional datasets onto noisy and low-qubit quantum systems is a significant barrier to practical Quantum Machine Learning (QML). Approaches such as quantum autoencoders can be constrained by current hardware capabilities and may exhibit vulnerabilities to reconstruction attacks due to their invertibility. We propose Quantum Principal Geodesic Analysis (qPGA), a novel, non-invertible method for dimensionality reduction and qubit-efficient encoding. Executed classically, qPGA leverages Riemannian geometry to project data onto the unit Hilbert sphere, generating outputs inherently suitable for quantum amplitude encoding. This technique preserves the neighborhood structure of high-dimensional datasets within a compact latent space, significantly reducing qubit requirements for amplitude encoding. We derive theoretical bounds quantifying qubit requirements for effective encoding onto noisy systems. Empirical results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 show that qPGA preserves local structure more effectively than both quantum and hybrid autoencoders. Additionally, we demonstrate that qPGA enhances resistance to reconstruction attacks due to its non-invertible nature. In downstream QML classification tasks, qPGA can achieve over 99% accuracy and F1-score on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, outperforming quantum-dependent baselines. Initial tests on real hardware and noisy simulators confirm its potential for noise-resilient performance, offering a scalable solution for advancing QML applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement across distant frequency bands is a crucial resource in quantum networking. However, directly entangling crossband photons, e.g. microwave and optical, is challenging. Furthermore, distributing crossband entanglement via direct quantum transduction is fundamentally limited, regardless of input engineering with unconstrained source brightness. We propose to utilize intraband entanglement to overcome such limits by a factor that scales up with the input intraband entanglement brightness. The proposed protocol relies only on off-the-shelf components and provides an advantage that is robust to a substantial amount of loss.</description>

      <title>Quantum Counting in the Rydberg Blockade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm for approximately counting the number of solutions to planar 2-satisfiability (2SAT) formulas natively on neutral atom quantum computers. Our algorithm maps Boolean variables to atomic registers arranged in space according to a given formula, so that 2SAT constraints are enforced via the Rydberg blockade between neighboring atoms. A quench under Rydberg dynamics of an initial computational basis state produces a superposition of all solutions after a sufficiently long evolution. For almost uniform superpositions, a polynomial number of measurements is enough to estimate the solution count up to any constant multiplicative factor via sampling based counting. We demonstrate numerically that this protocol leads to almost uniform solution sampling in 1D and 2D grids and that it produces accurate counts for 2SAT instances on punctured grids, suggesting its general applicability as a heuristic for #P-complete problems.</description>

Abstract: The intersection of quantum computing and quantum chemistry represents a promising frontier for achieving quantum utility in domains of both scientific and societal relevance. Owing to the exponential growth of classical resource requirements for simulating quantum systems, quantum chemistry has long been recognized as a natural candidate for quantum computation. This perspective focuses on identifying scientifically meaningful use cases where early fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are considered to be equipped with approximately 25--100 logical qubits, could deliver tangible impact. We highlight near- to mid-term opportunities in algorithm and software design, discuss representative chemical problems suited for quantum acceleration, and propose strategic roadmaps and collaborative pathways for advancing practical quantum utility in quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Gottesman-Knill Limit on One-way Communication Complexity: Tracing the Quantum Advantage down to Magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent influential result by Frenkel and Weiner establishes that in presence of shared randomness (SR), any input-output correlation, with a classical input provided to one party and a classical output produced by a distant party, achievable with a d-dimensional quantum system can always be reproduced by a d-dimensional classical system. In contrast, quantum systems are known to offer advantages in communication complexity tasks, which consider an additional input variable to the second party. Here, we show that, in presence of SR, any one-way communication complexity protocol implemented using a prime-dimensional quantum system can always be simulated exactly by communicating a classical system of the same dimension, whenever quantum protocols are restricted to stabilizer state preparations and stabilizer measurements. In direct analogy with the Gottesman-Knill theorem in quantum computation, which attributes quantum advantage to non-stabilizer (or magic) resources, our result identifies the same resources as essential for realizing quantum advantage in one-way communication complexity. We further present explicit tasks where `minimal magic' suffices to offer a provable quantum advantage, underscoring the efficient use of such resources in communication complexity.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Computing for Time-Dependent Ion-Atom Collision Dynamics: Applications to Charge Transfer Cross Section Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of ion-atom collisions remains a formidable challenge due to the complex interplay between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. We present a hybrid quantum-classical computing framework for simulating time-dependent ion-atom collision dynamics, within which two variational quantum time evolution algorithms are implemented. To validate our framework, we simulate the charge transfer dynamics and compute the corresponding cross sections for the proton-hydrogen collision system across an energy range of 1--25~keV. Our results accurately reproduce the charge transfer dynamics with high fidelity and exhibit very good agreement with available experimental and theoretical cross section data across the entire energy range. These results highlight the accuracy and applicability of our hybrid quantum-classical framework for scattering cross section calculations. Our work demonstrates an effective approach for mapping time-dependent many-body collision problems onto near-term quantum computing devices, and also provides promising directions for practical applications of universal quantum computing in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of thermodynamics: Maxwell relations for pair correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulators hold enormous promise for advancing the modelling of materials and understanding emergent physics, such as high temperature superconductivity and topological order. While correlation functions are, typically, straightforward to measure in quantum simulators, thermodynamic properties are not. This limits our ability to directly compare the results of quantum simulations to experiments on the materials being modelled. Maxwell relations are an extremely powerful tool for characterising complex materials, as they enable the determination of challenging-to-measure thermodynamic properties from more accessible ones. Here, we introduce generalised Maxwell relations that relate every thermodynamic quantity to a single local correlation function. We illustrate their utility by deducing the thermodynamic properties of several iconic quantum many-body models from pair correlation functions using the generalised Maxwell relations. We show that this {universal} approach is readily accessible in quantum simulators and suggest applications to condensed matter systems where thermodynamic measurements are challenging, such as atomically thin materials.</description>

      <title>Learning quantum tomography from incomplete measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit quantum tomography in an informationally incomplete scenario and propose improved state reconstruction methods using deep neural networks. In the first approach, the trained network predicts an optimal linear or quadratic reconstructor with coefficients depending only on the collection of (already taken) measurement operators. This effectively refines the undercomplete tomographic reconstructor based on pseudoinverse operation. The second, based on an LSTM recurrent network performs state reconstruction sequentially, thus is scalable. It can also optimize the measurement sequence, which suggests a no-free-lunch theorem for tomography: by narrowing the state space, we gain the possibility of more efficient tomography by learning the optimal sequence of measurements. Numerical experiments for a 2-qubit system show that both methods outperform standard maximum likelihood estimation and also scale to larger 3-qubit systems. Our results demonstrate that neural networks can effectively learn the underlying geometry of multi-qubit states using this for their reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Practical continuous-variable quantum key distribution with squeezed light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) has gathered significant interest for its potential to achieve high secret key rates and seamless integration with existing optical communication infrastructure. State-of-the-art CV-QKD systems primarily use coherent states for simplicity. However, squeezed states of light have been theoretically shown to offer significant advantages, including higher secret key rates, greater resilience to excess noise, and reduced requirements on information reconciliation efficiency. In this work, we experimentally verify these theoretical predictions and propose and demonstrate a practical squeezed-state CV-QKD system based on modern local-local oscillator and digital-signal-processing techniques. Operating over fibre channels and considering finite-size security against collective attacks we showed the advantages of our system over its coherent state counterpart. Our work paves the way for squeezed states to become practical resources for quantum key distribution and other quantum information protocols.</description>

      <title>Iterative Quantum Feature Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning models that leverage quantum circuits as quantum feature maps (QFMs) are recognized for their enhanced expressive power in learning tasks. Such models have demonstrated rigorous end-to-end quantum speedups for specific families of classification problems. However, deploying deep QFMs on real quantum hardware remains challenging due to circuit noise and hardware constraints. Additionally, variational quantum algorithms often suffer from computational bottlenecks, particularly in accurate gradient estimation, which significantly increases quantum resource demands during training. We propose Iterative Quantum Feature Maps (IQFMs), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that constructs a deep architecture by iteratively connecting shallow QFMs with classically computed augmentation weights. By incorporating contrastive learning and a layer-wise training mechanism, IQFMs effectively reduces quantum runtime and mitigates noise-induced degradation. In tasks involving noisy quantum data, numerical experiments show that IQFMs outperforms quantum convolutional neural networks, without requiring the optimization of variational quantum parameters. Even for a typical classical image classification benchmark, a carefully designed IQFMs achieves performance comparable to that of classical neural networks. This framework presents a promising path to address current limitations and harness the full potential of quantum-enhanced machine learning.</description>

      <title>Rabi transport and the other finite-size effects in one-dimensional discrete-time topological quantum walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates Rabi transport and finite-size effects in one-dimensional discrete-time topological quantum walks. We demonstrate the emergence of localized states at boundaries between topologically distinct phases and analyze how finite system sizes influence quantum walk dynamics. For finite lattices, we show that topology induces localized and bilocalized states, leading to Rabi-like transport as a result of degeneracy breaking due to finite-size effects. The study bridges the gap between topological protection and size-dependent dynamics, revealing transitions from ballistic motion to localized or oscillatory behavior based on the system's topological properties. Analytical and numerical methods are employed to explore the spectra and dynamics of quantum walks, highlighting the robustness of Rabi transport against disorder. The findings provide insights into controlled quantum transport and potential applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Scalable entangling gates on ion qubits via structured light addressing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in developing practical quantum processors is maintaining low control complexity while scaling to large numbers of qubits. Trapped-ion systems excel in small-scale operations and support rapid qubit scaling via long-chain architectures. However, their performance in larger systems is hindered by spectral crowding in radial motional modes, a problem that forces reliance on intricate pulse-shaping techniques to maintain gate fidelities. Here, we overcome this challenge by developing a novel trapped-ion processor with an individual-addressing system that generates steerable Hermite-Gaussian beam arrays. The transverse gradient of these beams couples qubits selectively to sparse axial motional modes, enabling to isolate a single mode as entanglement mediator. Leveraging this capability, we demonstrate addressable two-qubit entangling gates in chains up to six ions with fidelities consistently around 0.97, achieved without complex pulse shaping. Our method significantly reduces control overhead while preserving scalability, providing a crucial advance toward practical large-scale trapped-ion quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of discrete spacetimes with Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms offer the potential for significant computational advantages; however, in many cases, it remains unclear how these advantages can be practically realized. Causal Set Theory is a discrete, Lorentz-invariant approach to quantum gravity which may be well positioned to benefit from quantum computing. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm that investigates the dynamics of causal sets by sampling the space of causal sets, improving on classical methods. Our approach builds on the quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo technique developed by Layden et al. [Nature 619, 282 (2023)], adapting it to sample from the constrained spaces required for application. This is done by adding a constraint term to the Hamiltonian of the system. A qubit Hamiltonian representing the Benincasa-Dowker action (the causal set equivalent of the Einstein-Hilbert action) is also derived and used in the algorithm as the problem Hamiltonian. We achieve a super-quadratic quantum scaling advantage and, under some conditions, demonstrate a greater potential compared to classical approaches than previously observed in unconstrained QeMCMC implementations.</description>

      <title>From Worst-Case Hardness of $\mathsf{NP}$ to Quantum Cryptography via Quantum Indistinguishability Obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) has emerged as a powerful cryptographic primitive with many implications. While classical iO, combined with the infinitely-often worst-case hardness of $\mathsf{NP}$, is known to imply one-way functions (OWFs) and a range of advanced cryptographic primitives, the cryptographic implications of quantum iO remain poorly understood. In this work, we initiate a study of the power of quantum iO. We define several natural variants of quantum iO, distinguished by whether the obfuscation algorithm, evaluation algorithm, and description of obfuscated program are classical or quantum. For each variant, we identify quantum cryptographic primitives that can be constructed under the assumption of quantum iO and the infinitely-often quantum worst-case hardness of $\mathsf{NP}$ (i$.$e$.$, $\mathsf{NP}$ $\not\subseteq$ $\mathsf{i.o.BQP}$). In particular, we construct pseudorandom unitaries, QCCC quantum public-key encryption and (QCCC) quantum symmetric-key encryption, and several primitives implied by them such as one-way state generators, (efficiently-verifiable) one-way puzzles, and EFI pairs, etc. While our main focus is on quantum iO, even in the classical setting, our techniques yield a new and arguably simpler construction of OWFs from classical (imperfect) iO and the infinitely-often worst-case hardness of $\mathsf{NP}$.</description>

      <title>Isoprobability Models of Qubit Dynamics: Demonstration via Time-Dependent Phase Control on IBM Quantum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient quantum control is a cornerstone for the advancement of quantum technologies, from computation to sensing and communications. Several approaches in quantum control, e.g. optimal control and inverse engineering, use the pulse amplitude and frequency shaping as the control tools. Often, these approaches prescribe pulse shapes which are difficult or impossible to implement. To this end, we develop the concept of isoprobability classes of models of qubit dynamics, in which various pairs of time-dependent pulse amplitude and frequency generate the same transition probability profile (albeit different temporal evolutions toward this probability). In this manner, we introduce an additional degree of freedom, and hence flexibility in qubit control, as some models can be easier to implement than others. We demonstrate this approach with families of isoprobability models, which derive from the established Landau-Majorana-St\"uckelberg-Zener (LMSZ) and Allen-Eberly-Hioe (AEH) classes. We demonstrate the isoprobability performance of these models on an IBM Quantum processor. Instead of frequency (i.e. detuning) shaping, which is difficult to implement on this platform, we exploit the time-dependent phase of the driving field to induce an effective detuning. Indeed, the temporal derivative of the phase function emulates a variable detuning, thereby obviating the need for direct detuning control. The experimental validation of the isoprobability concept with the time-dependent phase control underscores the potential of this robust and accessible method for high-fidelity quantum operations, paving the way for scalable quantum control in a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Inner Product Estimation with Low-Depth Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed inner product estimation (DIPE) is a fundamental task in quantum information, aiming to estimate the inner product between two unknown quantum states prepared on distributed quantum platforms. Existing rigorous sample complexity analyses are limited to unitary $4$-designs, which present practical challenges for near-term quantum devices. This work addresses this challenge by exploring DIPE with low-depth quantum circuits. We first establish that DIPE with an arbitrary unitary $2$-design ensemble achieves an average sample complexity of $\Theta(\sqrt{2^n})$, where $n$ is the number of qubits. We then analyze ensembles below unitary $2$-designs -- specifically, the brickwork and local unitary $2$-design ensembles -- showing average sample complexities of $O(\sqrt{2.18^n})$ and $O(\sqrt{2.5^n})$, respectively. Furthermore, we analyze the state-dependent variance for the brickwork and Clifford ensembles. Remarkably, we find that DIPE with the global Clifford ensemble requires $\Theta(\sqrt{2^n})$ copies for arbitrary state pairs, with its efficiency further enhanced by the nonstabilizerness of the state pairs. Numerical simulations with GHZ states and Haar random states up to $26$ qubits show that low-depth circuit ensembles can match the performance of unitary $4$-designs in practice. Our findings offer theoretically guaranteed methods for implementing DIPE with experimentally feasible unitary ensembles.</description>

      <title>Numerical solution of quantum Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation has long served as a cornerstone for modeling magnetization dynamics in magnetic systems, yet its classical nature limits its applicability to inherently quantum phenomena such as entanglement and nonlocal correlations. Inspired by the need to incorporate quantum effects into spin dynamics, recently a quantum generalization of the LLG equation is proposed [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 266704 (2024)] which captures essential quantum behavior in many-body systems. In this work, we develop a robust numerical methodology tailored to this quantum LLG framework that not only handles the complexity of quantum many-body systems but also preserves the intrinsic mathematical structures and physical properties dictated by the equation. We apply the proposed method to a class of many-body quantum spin systems, which host topological states of matter, and demonstrate rich quantum behavior, including the emergence of long-time entangled states. This approach opens a pathway toward reliable simulations of quantum magnetism beyond classical approximations, potentially leading to new discoveries.</description>

      <title>Error recovery protocols within metastable Decoherence-Free Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum systems governed by quantum master equations can exhibit quantum metastability, where decoherence-free subspaces (DFS) remain approximately invariant for long transient times before relaxing to a unique steady state. In this work, we explore the use of such metastable DFS as code spaces for passive quantum error correction. We focus on two representative models: a two-qubit system under collective dissipation, and a nonlinear driven-dissipative Kerr resonator. After characterizing the parameter regimes that support metastability, we introduce and analyze a protocol for error recovery during the metastable dynamics. Using spectral properties of the Liouvillian, we characterize which types of errors can be possibly autonomously reversed. In particular, we show that in the qubit model, the state affected by either bit-flip error or spontaneous emission can be recovered up to a certain measure. Instead, phase-flip errors would require further strategies. For the bosonic system, we show that dephasing-induced errors on cat states can be partially recovered, with a trade-off between fidelity and recovery time. These findings highlight the limitations and capabilities of metastable DFS as a transient resource for error correction.</description>

      <title>Electric-field Quantum Sensing Exploiting a Photogenerated Charge-transfer Triplet State in a Molecular Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular spin systems are promising platforms for quantum sensing due to their chemically tunable Hamiltonians, enabling tailored coherence properties and interactions with external fields. However, electric field sensing remains challenging owing to typically weak spin-electric coupling (SEC) and limited directional sensitivity. Addressing these issues using heavy atoms exhibiting strong atomic spin-orbit couplings (SOC) often compromises spin coherence times. Here, we demonstrate coherent electric field sensing using a photogenerated charge-transfer (CT) spin triplet state in the organic molecule ACRSA (10-phenyl-10H,10' H-spiro\[acridine-9,9'-anthracen]-10'-one). By embedding electric field pulses within a Hahn echo sequence, we coherently manipulate the spin triplet and extract both the magnitude and directional dependence of its SEC. The measured SEC strength is approximately, comparable to values reported in systems with strong atomic SOC, illustrating that heavy atoms are not a prerequisite for electric-field sensitivity of spin states. Our findings position organic CT triplets as chemically versatile and directionally sensitive quantum sensors of E-fields that function without atomic-SOC-mediated mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the origin of bound state in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound state in the continuum (BIC) and quasi-BIC represent a remarkable class of wave functions that disobey conventional intuition by exhibiting spatially localized modes embedded in the continuum spectrum. In recent years, these states have found important applications in interdisciplinary systems as a non-radiating mode with ultra-long lifetime. In these applications, a key question is how to convert a quasi-BIC into an exact BIC, and what the general criterion is for this transition. In this work, we uncover its origin using two steps in a two-band model with an arbitrary confining potential. Firstly, we demonstrate that a bound state coupled to a continuum band can yield quasi-BIC. Then, we show that tuning the coupling between the bands can convert the quasi-BIC into an exact BIC. In our theory, the real and complex poles of the spectra have a clear physical meaning for the quasi- and exact BICs, and we give the general criterion for exact BICs. Unlike previous proposals, our theory requires neither symmetry protection nor topological constraints and can be extended to a multiband model, providing a new framework for realizing BICs and offering new insights for their design in different fields, including photonics, acoustics, ultracold atoms and Bose-Einstein condensate with and without many-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Transverse Polarization Gradient Entangling Gates for Trapped-Ion Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of entangling gates with individual addressing capability represents a crucial approach for implementing quantum computation in trapped ion crystals. Conventional entangling gate schemes typically rely on laser beam wave vectors to couple the ions' spin and motional degrees of freedom. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an alternative method that employs a polarization gradient field generated by a tightly focused laser beam, previously proposed as a Magnus-type quantum logic gate. Using this technique, we perform Raman operations on nuclear spin qubits encoded in 171Yb+ ions, generating spin-dependent forces along axial motional modes in a linear trap. By utilizing an acousto-optic deflector to create arbitrary spot pairs for individual ion addressing in two-ion (four-ion) chains, we achieve MS gates with fidelities exceeding 98.5% (97.2%). Further improvements in numerical aperture and laser power could reduce gate durations while enhancing fidelity. This method is compatible with, and can significantly simplify, optical tweezer gate proposals, where motional mode engineering enables scalable trapped-ion quantum computation. The technique can be extended to two-dimensional ion crystals, representing a key step toward large-scale trapped-ion quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Characterizing quantum resourcefulness via group-Fourier decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a general framework for studying the resourcefulness in pure states for quantum resource theories (QRTs) whose free operations arise from the unitary representation of a group. We argue that the group Fourier decompositions (GFDs) of a state, i.e., its projection onto the irreducible representations (irreps) of the Hilbert space, operator space, and tensor products thereof, constitute fingerprints of resourcefulness and complexity. By focusing on the norm of the irrep projections, dubbed GFD purities, we find that low-resource states live in the small dimensional irreps of operator space, whereas high-resource states have support in more, and higher dimensional ones. Such behavior not only resembles that appearing in classical harmonic analysis, but is also universal across the QRTs of entanglement, fermionic Gaussianity, spin coherence, and Clifford stabilizerness. To finish, we show that GFD purities carry operational meaning as they lead to resourcefulness witnesses as well as to notions of state compressibility.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Image Recognition Using Gaussian Boson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) has emerged as a promising quantum computing paradigm, demonstrating its potential in various applications. However, most existing works focus on theoretical aspects or simple tasks, with limited exploration of its capabilities in solving real-world practical problems. In this work, we propose a novel GBS-based image recognition scheme inspired by extreme learning machine (ELM) to enhance the performance of perceptron and implement it using our latest GBS device, Jiuzhang. Our approach utilizes an 8176-mode temporal-spatial hybrid encoding photonic processor, achieving approximately 2200 average photon clicks in the quantum computational advantage regime. We apply this scheme to classify images from the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, achieving a testing accuracy of 95.86% on MNIST and 85.95% on Fashion-MNIST. These results surpass those of classical method SVC with linear kernel and previous physical ELM-based experiments. Additionally, we explore the influence of three hyperparameters and the efficiency of GBS in our experiments. This work not only demonstrates the potential of GBS in real-world machine learning applications but also aims to inspire further advancements in powerful machine learning schemes utilizing GBS technology.</description>

      <title>Conservative quantum offline model-based optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) refers to the task of optimizing a black-box objective function using only a fixed set of prior input-output data, without any active experimentation. Recent work has introduced quantum extremal learning (QEL), which leverages the expressive power of variational quantum circuits to learn accurate surrogate functions by training on a few data points. However, as widely studied in the classical machine learning literature, predictive models may incorrectly extrapolate objective values in unexplored regions, leading to the selection of overly optimistic solutions. In this paper, we propose integrating QEL with conservative objective models (COM) - a regularization technique aimed at ensuring cautious predictions on out-of-distribution inputs. The resulting hybrid algorithm, COM-QEL, builds on the expressive power of quantum neural networks while safeguarding generalization via conservative modeling. Empirical results on benchmark optimization tasks demonstrate that COM-QEL reliably finds solutions with higher true objective values compared to the original QEL, validating its superiority for offline design problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resource Theories of Anyonic Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As information carriers for fault-tolerant quantum computing, systems composed of anyons exhibit non-tensor product state spaces due to their distinctive fusion rules, leading to fundamentally different entanglement properties from conventional quantum systems. However, a quantitative characterization of entanglement for general anyonic states remains elusive. In this Letter, within the framework of resource theory, we propose three measures that quantify total entanglement, conventional entanglement, and anyonic charge entanglement (ACE), respectively. We demonstrate that total entanglement can be decomposed into conventional entanglement and ACE, revealing distinct entanglement structures in anyonic systems compared to those in conventional quantum systems. We further illustrate a geometric interpretation of our ACE measure and establish its equivalence to a previously proposed probe of ACE, extending the known equivalence between the geometric interpretation and operational significance of bipartite correlations. Our work broadens the understanding of entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate cavity-free feedback cooling of the three lowest-lying collective modes of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a prolate harmonic trap. Using shadowgraph imaging as an \textit{in situ} probe of the atomic density, we measure the time-dependent centers-of-mass and widths of the condensate in two dimensions and use these measurements to damp oscillations in the two visible dipole modes and the low-frequency quadrupole mode. By inducing oscillations in the condensate, we show that we can efficiently damp the dipole modes to a final mean phonon occupancy per atom of $&lt;1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resource theories play a crucial role in characterizing states and properties essential for quantum information processing. A significant challenge is protecting resources from errors. We explore strategies for correcting quantum resources. We show that resource preserving operations in resource theory define a gauge freedom on code spaces, which allows for recovery strategies that can correct the resource while changing non-essential properties. This allows decoding to be simplified. The results are applicable to various resource theories and quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>Noncontextual Pauli Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextuality is a key feature of quantum mechanics, and identification of noncontextual subtheories of quantum mechanics is of both fundamental and practical importance. Recently, noncontextual Pauli Hamiltonians have been defined in the setting of variational quantum algorithms. In this work we rigorously establish a number of properties of noncontextual Pauli Hamiltonians. We prove that these Hamiltonians can be composed of more Pauli operators than diagonal Hamiltonians. This establishes that noncontextual Hamiltonians are able to describe a greater number of physical interactions. We then show that the eigenspaces admit an efficient classical description. We analyse the eigenspace of these Hamiltonians and prove that for every eigenvalue there exists an associated eigenvector whose stabilizer rank scales linearly with the number of qubits. We prove that further structure in these Hamiltonians allow us to derive where degeneracies in the eigenspectrum can arise. We thus open the field to a new class of efficiently simulatable states.</description>

      <title>Collapses in quantum-classical probabilistically checkable proofs and the quantum polynomial hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate structural properties of quantum proof systems by establishing collapse results that uncover simplifications in their complexity landscape. We extend classical results such as the Karp-Lipton theorem to quantum polynomial hierarchy with quantum proofs and establish uniqueness preservation for quantum-classical probabilistically checkable proof systems.
  Our main contributions are threefold. First, we prove that restricting quantum-classical PCP systems to uniqueness does not reduce computational power: $\mathsf{UniqueQCPCP} = \mathsf{QCPCP}$ under $\mathsf{BQ}$-operator and randomized reductions, demonstrating robustness similar to the $\mathsf{UniqueQCMA} = \mathsf{QCMA}$ result. Second, we establish a non-uniform quantum analogue of the Karp-Lipton theorem, showing that if $\mathsf{QMA} \subseteq \mathsf{BQP}/\mathsf{qpoly}$, then $\mathsf{QPH} \subseteq \mathsf{Q\Sigma}_2/\mathsf{qpoly}$, extending the classical collapse theorem to quantum complexity with quantum advice. Third, we introduce a consistent variant of the quantum polynomial hierarchy ($\mathsf{CQPH}$) with consistency constraints across interaction rounds while maintaining product-state proofs, proving its unconditional collapse $\mathsf{CQPH} = \mathsf{CQ\Sigma}_2$. This contrasts with prior work on quantum-entangled polynomial hierarchy, showing that consistency rather than entanglement drives the collapse.
  These results contribute to understanding structural boundaries in quantum complexity theory and the interplay between constraint types in quantum proof systems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Spin Defect Density in hBN via Raman and Photoluminescence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negatively charged boron vacancies ($\mathrm{V_B^-}$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are emerging as promising solid-state spin qubits due to their optical accessibility, structural simplicity, and compatibility with photonic platforms. However, quantifying the density of such defects in thin hBN flakes has remained elusive, limiting progress in device integration and reproducibility. Here, we present an all-optical method to quantify $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ defect density in hBN by correlating Raman and photoluminescence (PL) signatures with irradiation fluence. We identify two defect-induced Raman modes, D1 and D2, and assign them to vibrational modes of $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ using polarization-resolved Raman measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By adapting a numerical model originally developed for graphene, we establish an empirical relationship linking Raman (D1, $E_\mathrm{2g}$) and PL intensities to absolute defect densities. This method is universally applicable across various irradiation types and uniquely suited for thin flakes, where conventional techniques fail. Our approach enables accurate, direct, and non-destructive quantification of spin defect densities down to $10^{15}$ defects/ cm${}^3$, offering a powerful tool for optimizing and benchmarking hBN for quantum optical applications.</description>

      <title>Universal and Efficient Quantum State Verification via Schmidt Decomposition and Mutually Unbiased Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient verification of multipartite quantum states is crucial to many applications in quantum information processing. By virtue of Schmidt decomposition and mutually unbiased bases, here we propose a universal protocol to verify arbitrary multipartite pure quantum states using adaptive local projective measurements. Moreover, we establish a universal upper bound on the sample complexity that is independent of the local dimensions. Numerical calculations further indicate that Haar-random pure states can be verified with a constant sample cost, irrespective of the qudit number and local dimensions, even in the adversarial scenario in which the source cannot be trusted. As alternatives, we provide multiple simpler variants that can achieve similar high efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Weak unitary symmetries of open quantum dynamics: beyond quantum master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Markovian open quantum dynamics with weak unitary symmetries. Starting from the quantum master equation for the system alone, it is known that the joint dynamics of the system and its environment can be obtained by dilation, leading to a closed dynamics for a continuous matrix product state. Performing counting measurements on the environment gives rise to stochastic dynamics of quantum trajectories for the system, which when averaged yield back the quantum master equation. In this work, we identify necessary and sufficient conditions under which the dynamics of these different descriptions retain the weak symmetry of the quantum master equation and we characterise the resulting symmetries of the different descriptions in terms of their generators. We find that the joint dynamics always features a separable symmetry directly related to that of the quantum master equation, but for quantum trajectories the corresponding symmetry is present only if the counting measurement satisfies certain conditions.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Tunable Microwave Photon Detector Based on a Semiconductor Double Quantum Dot Coupled to a Superconducting High-Impedance Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-efficiency single-photon detection in the microwave domain is a key enabling technology for quantum sensing, communication, and information processing. However, the extremely low energy of microwave photons (~{\mu}eV) presents a fundamental challenge, preventing direct photon-to-charge conversion as achieved in optical systems using semiconductors. Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) charge qubits offer a compelling solution due to their highly tunable energy levels in the microwave regime, enabling coherent coupling with single photons. In this work, we demonstrate microwave photon detection with an efficiency approaching 70% in the single-photon regime. We use a hybrid system comprising a double quantum dot (DQD) charge qubit electrostatically defined in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, coupled to a high-impedance Josephson junction (JJ) array cavity. We systematically optimize the hybrid device architecture to maximize the conversion efficiency, leveraging the strong charge-photon coupling and the tunable DQD tunnel coupling rates. Incoming cavity photons coherently excite the DQD qubit, which in turn generates a measurable electrical current, realizing deterministic photon-to-charge conversion. Moreover, by exploiting the independent tunability of both the DQD transition energy and the cavity resonance frequency, we characterize the system efficiency over a range of 3-5.2 GHz. Our results establish semiconductor-based cavity-QED architectures as a scalable and versatile platform for efficient microwave photon detection, opening new avenues for quantum microwave optics and hybrid quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>The MORRIS Experiment: Magnetic Levitation as a New Probe of Non-Newtonian Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MORRIS (Magnetic Oscillatory Resonator for Rare-Interaction Studies) and propose the first tabletop search for non-Newtonian gravity due to a Yukawa-like fifth force using a magnetically levitated particle. Our experiment comprises a levitated sub-millimeter magnet in a superconducting trap that is driven by a time-periodic source. Featuring short-, medium-, and long-term stages, MORRIS will admit increasing sensitivities to the force coupling strength $\alpha$, optimally probing screening lengths of $\lambda \sim 1\,\mathrm{mm}$. Our short-term setup provides a proof-of-principle study, with our medium- and long-term stages respectively constraining $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-4}$ and $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-5}$, leading over existing bounds. Our projections are readily recastable to concrete models predicting the existence of fifth forces, and our statistical analysis is generally applicable to well-characterized sinusoidal driving forces. By leveraging ultralow dissipation and heavy test masses, MORRIS opens a new window onto tests of small-scale gravity and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Turquoise Magic Wavelength of the ${}^{87}$Sr Clock Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical lattice clocks of fermionic strontium offer a versatile platform for probing fundamental physics and developing quantum technologies. The bivalent electronic structure of strontium gives rise to a doubly-forbidden atomic transition that is accessible due to hyperfine mixing in fermionic strontium-87, thus resulting in a sub-millihertz natural linewidth. Currently, the most accurate optical lattice clocks operate on this narrow transition by tightly trapping strontium-87 atoms in a {\em magic} optical lattice at 813~nm. {\em Magic} wavelengths occur where the Stark shifts of both the ground and excited states are equivalent, thus eliminating any position and intensity-dependent broadening of the corresponding transition. Theoretical calculations of the electronic structure of strontium-87 have also predicted another {\em magic} wavelength of the clock transition at 497.01(57)~nm. In this work, we experimentally measure the novel {\em magic} wavelength to be $497.4363(3)$~nm. Compared to the 813~nm {\em magic} wavelength, 497~nm is closer to the strong 461~nm dipolar transition of strontium, resulting in larger atomic polarizability by an order of magnitude, providing deeper traps with less optical power. The proximity to the 461~transition also leads to an enhanced sensitivity of 334(10)~Hz/(nm\,$E_{R}$) at the {\em magic} wavelength.</description>

      <title>On the reconstruction map in JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An open question in AdS/CFT is how to reconstruct semiclassical bulk operators precisely enough that non-perturbative quantum effects can be computed. We propose a set of physically-motivated requirements for such a reconstruction map, and explicitly construct a map satisfying these requirements in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity. Our map is found by canonically quantizing "action-angle" variables for JT gravity, which are chosen to ensure that the spectrum of the fundamental quantum theory matches known results from the gravitational path integral. We then study unitary quantum dynamics in this theory, and obtain analytical predictions for the dynamics of the wormhole length, including its quantum fluctuations, leveraging techniques from quantum ergodicity theory. Level repulsion in the non-perturbative JT spectrum implies that the average wormhole length is non-monotonic in time, that fluctuations in wormhole length are non-perturbatively suppressed until nearly the Heisenberg time, and that the late-time-evolved Hartle-Hawking state has a heavy-tailed distribution of lengths. We discuss the implications of our results for the "complexity = volume" conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of transition-edge sensor (TES) single-photon detectors as a simultaneous target and sensor for direct dark matter searches, and report results from the first search of this kind. We perform a 489 h science run with a TES device optimized for the detection of 1064 nm photons, with a mass of ~0.2 ng and an energy threshold of ~0.3 eV, and set new limits on dark matter interactions with both electrons and nucleons for dark matter with mass below the MeV scale. With their excellent energy resolution, TESs enable search strategies that are complementary to recent results from superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors and kinetic inductance detectors. We show that next-generation TES arrays hold promise to probe new regions of light dark matter parameter space.</description>

      <title>Future prospect of anisotropic 2D tin sulfide (SnS) for emerging electronic and quantum device applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The family of anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) emerging materials is rapidly evolving due to their low crystal symmetry and in-plane structural anisotropy. Among these, 2D tin sulfide (SnS) has gained significant attention because of its distinctive crystalline symmetry and the resulting extraordinary anisotropic physical properties. This perspective explores recent developments in anisotropic 2D SnS. In particular, it highlights advances in isolating high-quality SnS monolayers (1L-SnS) and in applying advanced techniques for anisotropic characterization. The discussion continues with an overview of the anisotropic optical properties of SnS, followed by recent progress in emerging electronic device applications, including energy storage, neuromorphic (synaptic) systems, and quantum technologies. In addition to presenting significant research findings on SnS, this perspective outlines current limitations and discusses emerging opportunities and future prospects for its application in quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unravel the existence and nonequilibrium response of one-dimensional harmonically trapped droplet configurations in the presence of a central repulsive or attractive potential well mimicking the effect of a heavy impurity. For fixed negative chemical potentials, it is shown that droplets fragment into two for increasing repulsive potential heights, a process that occurs faster for larger widths. However, atoms from the droplet accumulate at the attractive potential, especially for wider ones, leading to a deformed droplet and eventually to the termination of the solution. Linearization analysis yields the underlying excitation spectrum which dictates stability and the behavior of the ensuing collective modes. Quenches in the potential height are used to demonstrate dynamical fragmentation of the droplet for repulsive potentials as well as self-evaporation along with droplet localization and eventual relaxation for longer evolution times in the case of attractive potential wells. The many-body character of the dynamics is explicated by evaluating the participating single-particle eigenstates manifesting the superposition nature of the droplet state. Our results should be detectable by current ultracold atom experiments and may inspire engineered droplet dynamics with the aid of external potentials.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Three Coupled Kerr Oscillators: Implications for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the classical dynamics of optical nonlinear Kerr couplers, focusing on their potential relevance to quantum computing applications. The system consists of three Kerr-type nonlinear oscillators arranged in two configurations: a triangular arrangement, where each oscillator is coupled to the others, and a sandwich arrangement, where only the middle oscillator interacts with the two outer ones. The system is driven by an external periodic field and includes dissipative processes. Its evolution is governed by six non-autonomous differential equations derived from a Kerr Hamiltonian with nonlinear coupling terms. We show that even for identical Kerr media, the interplay between nonlinear couplings and mismatched fundamental and pump frequencies leads to rich and complex dynamics, including the emergence of multiple stable attractors. These attractors are highly sensitive to both the coupling configuration and initial conditions. A key contribution of this work is a detailed stability analysis based on the numerical calculation of Lyapunov exponents, which reveals transitions from regular to chaotic dynamics as damping is reduced. We identify critical damping thresholds for the onset of chaos and characterize phenomena such as chaotic beats. These results offer insights for potential experimental realizations and are directly relevant to emerging quantum technologies, where Kerr parametric oscillators play a central role in quantum gates, error correction protocols, and quantum neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum vs. semiclassical description of in-QGP quarkonia in the quantum Brownian regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the range of validity of the semiclassical approximation of a quantum master equation designed to describe the $c\bar{c}$ dynamics in a quark gluon plasma at various temperatures, in the quantum Brownian regime. We perform a comparative study of various properties, e.g. the charmonia yield, of the Wigner density obtained with the Lindblad equation and with the associated semiclassical Fokker-Planck equation. The semiclassical description is found to reproduce with a remarkable accuracy the results obtained through the full quantum description. We show that, to a large extent, this can be attributed to the non-unitary components of the dynamics that result from the contact of the $c\bar{c}$ subsystem with the thermal bath, leading to a rapid classicalization of the subsystem.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we have presented the results for mode entanglement and its evolution in Ne, Mg, and Si isotopic chains. A detailed study has also been conducted on the role of nuclear forces with the assistance of the spin-tensor decomposition of two-body interaction into three components: central, spin-orbit, and tensor. This study can shed light on the high entanglement entropy observed for $N=Z$ nuclei and the importance of the tensor component on the proton-neutron entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Directional search for light dark matter with quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of dark matter (DM) stands as one of the most compelling indications of new physics in particle physics. Typically, the detection of wave-like DM involves quantum sensors, such as qubits or cavities. The phase of the sensors is usually discarded as the value of the phase itself is not physically meaningful. However, the difference of the phase between the sensors contains the information of the velocity and direction of the DM wind. We propose a measurement protocol to extract this information from the sensors using quantum states. Our method does not require specific experimental setups and can be applied to any type of DM detector as long as the data from the detectors can be taken quantum mechanically. We also show that our method does not spoil the sensitivity of the DM detectors and is superior to the classical method based on the correlations of the DM signals between the detectors.</description>

      <title>Decoherence and fidelity enhancement during shuttling of entangled spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shuttling of spin qubits between different locations is a key element in many prospective semiconductor systems for quantum information processing, but the shuttled qubits should be protected from decoherence created by time- and space-dependent noises. Since the paths of different spin qubits are interrelated, the noises acting on the shuttled spins exhibit complex and unusual correlations. We appraise the role of these correlations using the concept of trajectories on random sheets, and demonstrate that they can drastically affect efficiency of the coherence protection. These correlations can also be exploited to enhance the shuttling fidelity, and we show that by encoding logical qubit in a state of two consequtively shuttled entangled spins, high fidelity can be achieved even for very slow shuttling. We identify the conditions favoring this encoding, and quantify improvement in the shuttling fidelity in comparison with the single-spin shuttling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate narrow-line-mediated Sisyphus cooling of magnetically trapped strontium (Sr) in the $5s5p\,^{3}\textrm{P}_{2}$ state. A 641 nm standing-wave, blue-detuned from the $5s4d\,^{3}\textrm{D}_{3}$$\,\rightarrow$ $\,5p4d\,^{3}\textrm{F}_{4}$ transition, creates a dissipative optical lattice in the $^{3}\textrm{D}_{3}$ state. By combining Doppler cooling and Sisyphus cooling on the $5s5p\,^{3}\textrm{P}_{2}$$\,\rightarrow$ $5s4d\,^{3}\textrm{D}_{3}$ transition at 2.92 ${\mu}$m, we observed efficient cooling of magnetically trapped atoms. By optically pumping the atoms to the $5s5p\,^{3}\textrm{P}_{0}$ state, we facilitate continuous outcoupling via a moving optical lattice with two fold improvement in atom number. Our scheme applies to next-generation quantum sensors using continuous ultracold atomic beams.</description>

Abstract: Quantum ensemble systems arise in a variety of applications, including NMR spectroscopy and robust quantum control. While their theoretical properties have been extensively studied, relatively little attention has been given to the explicit construction of control inputs. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a fully implementable control strategy for a one-parameter family of driftless two-level quantum systems. The proposed method is supported by rigorous analysis that guarantees accurate approximation of target distributions on SU(2). Convergence properties are established analytically, and numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Fast readout of quantum dot spin qubits via Andreev spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin qubits in semiconducting quantum dots are currently limited by slow readout processes, which are orders of magnitude slower than gate operations. In contrast, Andreev spin qubits benefit from fast measurement schemes enabled by the large resonator couplings of superconducting qubits but suffer from reduced coherence during qubit operations. Here, we propose fast and high-fidelity measurement protocols based on an electrically-tunable coupling between quantum dot and Andreev spin qubits. In realistic devices, this coupling can be made sufficiently strong to enable high-fidelity readout well below microseconds, potentially enabling mid-circuit measurements. Crucially, the electrical tunability of our coupler permits to switch it off during idle periods, minimizing crosstalk and measurement back-action. Our approach is fully compatible with germanium-based devices and paves the way for scalable quantum computing architectures by leveraging the advantages of heterogeneous qubit implementations.</description>

      <title>Resonances of recurrence time of monitored quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19832v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recurrence time is the time a process first returns to its initial state. Using quantum walks on a graph, the recurrence time is defined through stroboscopic monitoring of the arrival of the particle to a node of the system. When the time interval between repeated measurements is tuned in such a way that eigenvalues of the unitary become degenerate, the mean recurrence time exhibits resonances. These resonances imply faster mean recurrence times, which were recorded on quantum computers. The resonance broadening is captured by a restart uncertainty relation [R. Yin, Q. Wang, S. Tornow, E. Barkai, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 122, e2402912121 (2025)]. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, we extend our investigation to include the impact of system size on the widened resonances, showing how the connectivity and energy spectrum structure of a system influence the restart uncertainty relation. Breaking the symmetry of the system, for example time-reversal symmetry breaking with a magnetic flux applied to a ring, removes the degeneracy of the eigenvalues of the unitary, hence modifying the mean recurrence time and the widening of the transitions, and this effect is studied in detail. The width of resonances studied here is related to the finite time resolution of relevant experiments on quantum computers, and to the restart paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum batteries are anticipated to achieve significant advancements in energy storage capacity. In classical batteries, the energy density at each subsystem reaches its maximum value, denoted as $E_C$, which is determined by dividing the maximum energy by the number of subsystems. We demonstrate that this limit can be surpassed in quantum batteries by protocols of Quantum Energy Teleportaion (QET), allowing for the energy density at a subsystem to exceed the value of $E_C$. Our protocol offers enhanced efficiency, reduces experimental complexity on quantum computers, and enables instantaneous energy charging through Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). Leveraging quantum entanglement, this protocol significantly improves quantum energy storage systems, promising advances in quantum computing and new technological applications. This work represents a crucial step towards revolutionizing quantum energy storage and transfer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any quantum computation consists of a sequence of unitary evolutions described by a finite set of Hamiltonians. When this set is taken to consist of only products of Pauli operators, we show that the minimal such set generating $\mathfrak{su}(2^{N})$ contains $2N+1$ elements. We provide a number of examples of such generating sets and furthermore provide an algorithm for producing a sequence of rotations corresponding to any given Pauli rotation, which is shown to have optimal complexity. We also observe that certain sets generate $\mathfrak{su}(2^{N})$ at a faster rate than others, and we show how this rate can be optimized by tuning the fraction of anticommuting pairs of generators. Finally, we briefly comment on implications for measurement-based and trapped ion quantum computation as well as the construction of fault-tolerant gate sets.</description>

Abstract: We describe an inexpensive and accessible instructional setup that explores particle trapping with a planar linear ion trap. The planar trap is constructed using standard printed circuit board manufacturing and is designed to trap macroscopic charged particles in air. Trapping, shuttling, and splitting are demonstrated to students using these particles, which are visible to the naked eye. Students control trap voltages and can compare properties of particle motion with an analytic model of the trap using a computer vision program for particle tracking. Learning outcomes include understanding the design considerations for planar AC traps, mechanisms underpinning particle ejection, the physics of micromotion, and methods of data analysis using standard computer vision libraries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomness is a cornerstone of science, underpinning fields such as statistics, information theory, dynamical systems, and thermodynamics. In quantum science, quantum randomness, especially random pure states, plays a pivotal role in fundamental questions like black hole physics and quantum complexity, as well as in practical applications such as quantum device benchmarking and quantum advantage certification. The conventional approach for generating genuine random states, called `deep thermalization', faces significant challenges, including scalability issues due to the need for a large ancilla system and susceptibility to attacks, as demonstrated in this work. We introduce holographic deep thermalization, a secure and hardware-efficient quantum random state generator. By adopting a sequential application of a scrambling-measure-reset process, it continuously trades space with time, and substantially reduces the required ancilla size to as small as a system-size independent constant; At the same time, it guarantees security by removing quantum correlation between the data system and attackers. Thanks to the resource reduction, our circuit-based implementation on IBM Quantum devices achieves genuine $5$-qubit random state generation utilizing only a total of $8$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Quantum Mpemba Effect in Markovian Systems and Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) describes the counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system farther from equilibrium reaches steady state faster than one closer to equilibrium. However, ambiguity in defining a suitable distance measure between quantum states has led to varied interpretations across different contexts. Here we propose the intrinsic quantum Mpemba effect (IQME), defined using the trajectory length traced by the quantum state as a more appropriate measure of distance--distinct from previous trajectory-independent metrics. By treating quantum states as points in a Riemannian space defined by statistical distance, the trajectory length emerges as a more natural and accurate characterization of the counterintuitive dynamics, drawing an analogy to the classical Brachistochrone problem. We demonstrate the existence of IQME in Markovian systems and extend its definition to quantum circuits, thereby establishing a unified framework applicable to both open and closed systems. Notably, we observe an IQME in a $U(1)$-symmetric circuit, offering new insights into the rates of quantum thermalization for different initial states. This work deepens our understanding of quantum state evolution and lays the foundation for accurately capturing novel quantum dynamical behaviour.</description>

Abstract: The quantum no-broadcasting theorem states that it is fundamentally impossible to perfectly replicate an arbitrary quantum state, even if correlations between the copies are allowed. While quantum broadcasting cannot occur through any physical process, it can be achieved via postprocessing of experimental data using a process called virtual quantum broadcasting (VQB). In this work, we report the experimental implementation of a quantum circuit based on the linear combination of unitaries, integrated with a post-processing protocol, to realize VQB in a nuclear magnetic resonance system. VQB can be expressed as a linear combination of two channels: the universal cloner, which broadcasts the target quantum state, and the universal antisymmetrizer, which reduces broadcasting error. We implement both channels within the same circuit and demonstrate that the universal cloner is the closest physical map to VQB. In addition, we show how the universal antisymmetrizer can be utilized to mitigate imperfections in the cloner, enabling near-ideal fidelity. Our method is applicable to broadcasting quantum systems of any dimension.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved spectral diffusion of a multimode mechanical memory</title>

Abstract: High-frequency phonons hold great promise as carriers of quantum information on-chip and as quantum memories. Due to their coherent interaction with several systems, their compact mode volume, and slow group velocity, multiple experiments have recently demonstrated coherent transport of information on-chip using phonon modes, interconnecting distinct quantum devices. Strongly confined phonons in waveguide-like geometries are particularly interesting because of their long lifetime. However, spectral diffusion has been observed to substantially limit their coherence times. Coupling to two-level systems is suspected to be a major contributor to the diffusion; however, to date, the origin and underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. Here, we perform a time-domain study on two adjacent mechanical modes (separated by around 5 MHz) and show that the frequency positions of the two modes are not correlated in time, in agreement with our theoretical model and Monte-Carlo simulations. This result is an important step in fully understanding the microscopic mechanisms of dephasing in mechanical quantum buses and memories.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of divacancies in 3C-, 4H- and 6H-SiC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The divacancy comprising two neighboring vacant sites in the SiC lattice is a promising defect for applications in quantum technology. So far, most work is concerned with the divacancy in 4H-SiC, whereas the divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC have received much less attention. Here, we outline arguments showing that the neutral charge state of the divacancies in the latter two polytypes is intrinsically stable, in contrast to that in 4H-SiC where the photoluminescence quenches in most materials for certain excitation energies (below approximately 1.3 eV). Divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC are anticipated to remain stable even with resonant excitation. We provide new ab initio calculation results for the charge transfer levels of divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC. Using the temperature dependence of the divacancy emission in 3C-SiC, we estimate the energy position of the (+|0) charge transfer level of the divacancy within the bandgap of this polytype and compare with theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Thermalization and irreversibility of an isolated quantum system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The irreversibility and thermalization of many-body systems can be attributed to the erasure of spread non-equilibrium state information by local operations. This thermalization mechanism can be demonstrated by the sequence $[\hat{O}^\dagger \hat{O}(t)]^N$, where $\hat{O}$ is a local operator, $\hat{O}(t) = e^{i\hat{H}t} \hat{O} e^{-i\hat{H}t}$, $\hat{H}$ is the system Hamiltonian, and $N$ denotes the number of repetitions. We begin by preparing a non-equilibrium initial state with an inhomogeneous particle number distribution in a one-dimensional Hubbard model. As particles propagate and interact within the lattice, the system evolves into a highly entangled quantum state, where the entanglement entropy satisfies a volume law, yet the information of the initial state remains well preserved. The local operator $\hat{O}$ erases part of the information in the entangled state, altering the interference of the system wavefunction and the disentangling process during time-reversed evolution. Repeatedly applying $\hat{O}^\dagger \hat{O}(t)$ leads to a monotonic increase in the entanglement entropy until it saturates at a steady value. By incorporating this information erasure mechanism into the one-dimensional Hubbard model, our numerical simulations demonstrate that in a completely isolated system, a thermalization process emerges. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of implementing related quantum simulation experiments on superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Optimizing two-qubit gates for ultracold atoms using Fermi-Hubbard models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices have emerged as a scalable and promising platform for quantum simulation and computation. However, gate speeds remain a significant limitation for practical applications. In this work, we employ quantum optimal control to design fast, collision-based two-qubit gates within a superlattice based on a Fermi-Hubbard description, reaching errors in the range of $10^{-3}$ for realistic parameters. Numerically optimizing the lattice depths and the scattering length, we effectively manipulate hopping and interaction strengths intrinsic to the Fermi-Hubbard model. Our results provide five times shorter gate durations by allowing for higher energy bands in the optimization, suggesting that standard modeling with a two-band Fermi-Hubbard model is insufficient for describing the dynamics of fast gates and we find that four to six bands are required. Additionally, we achieve non-adiabatic gates by employing time-dependent lattice depths rather than using only fixed depths. The optimized control pulses not only maintain high efficacy in the presence of laser intensity and phase noise but also result in negligible inter-well couplings.</description>

      <title>No-go theorem for environment-assisted invariance in non-unitary dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elucidate the requirements for quantum operations that achieve environment-assisted invariance (envariance), a symmetry of entanglement. While envariance has traditionally been studied within the framework of local unitary operations, we extend the analysis to consider non-unitary local operations. First, we investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. Furthermore, we prove that this also holds for the multipartite scenario. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations. In addition, we show that the static condition of the eternal black hole in AdS/CFT is violated when the CFTs are coupled to the external baths.</description>

      <title>Operator growth in many-body systems of higher spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study operator growth in many-body systems with on-site spins larger than $1/2$, considering both non-integrable and integrable regimes. Specifically, we compute Lanczos coefficients in the one- and two-dimensional Ising models for spin values $S=1/2$, $1$, and $3/2$, and observe asymptotically linear growth $b_n \sim n$. On the integrable side, we investigate the Potts model and find square-root growth $b_n \sim \sqrt{n}$. Both results are consistent with the predictions of the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. To analyze operator dynamics in this setting, we employ a generalized operator basis constructed from tensor products of shift and clock operators, extending the concept of Pauli strings to higher local dimensions. We further report that the recently introduced formalism of equivalence classes of Pauli strings can be naturally extended to this setting. This formalism enables the study of simulable Heisenberg dynamics by identifying dynamically isolated operator subspaces of moderate dimensionality. As an example, we introduce the Kitaev-Potts model with spin-$1$, where the identification of such a subspace allows for exact time evolution at a computational cost lower than that of exact diagonalization.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the progress on exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models from a perspective of their application to competing reactions of particle creation from a false vacuum. Such models generally predict that, even with identical initial conditions, and for nearly the same other particle parameters, a quantum coherent evolution results in a final particle distribution with significant asymmetry. We use an exact solution of the driven bosonic Tavis-Cummings model for two reaction pathways in order to quantify this effect, reveal a corresponding phase transition, and identify its universality class.</description>

      <title>Multimode Entangled Squeezed Light Generation and Propagation in a Coupled-Cavity Photonic Crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient and accurate method for modeling the generation and propagation of quantum states of light in lossy coupled-cavity systems. We apply our approach to the design and modeling of a multimode photonic crystal coupled-cavity system for the generation of entangled squeezed states of light on-chip. The system consists of a three-mode, three-defect resonant structure coupled to three coupled-resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) in a square lattice silicon photonic crystal slab. We model the system using a basis of 184 non-orthogonal lossy quasi-modes. A two-mode squeezed thermal state of light is generated via degenerate spontaneous four-wave mixing in the resonant structure, which is pumped with a Gaussian pulse via a pump-CROW. The generated entangled signal and idler pulses of light are coupled out of the resonant structure into the two output-CROWs. Due to careful design of the resonant structure and the CROWs, the signal and idler light in the two output CROWs remains entangled even after propagating tens of cavities down the CROWs. Our approach is general and computationally efficient and thus can be applied to modeling the generation and propagation of quantum states of light in a wide variety of coupled-cavity photonic structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Involving only the measurements of commuting observables - the problem-setting and the corresponding solution - quantum algorithms must be subject to classical logic. This allows us to flank their customary quantum description with a classical logic description. In the classical logic description of the quantum algorithm, it is as if the problem-solver knew in advance, before beginning her problem-solving action, one (any one) of the possible halves of the information that specifies the solution of the problem she will produce and measure in the future and could use this knowledge to produce the solution with fewer computation steps. This is naturally a causal loop whose retrocausal character turns out to be implicit in the very notion of quantum state superposition, both an essential ingredient of the quantum computational speedup and one of the pillars of quantum mechanics. More in general, these causal loops turn out to be implicit in quantum correlations and, under the quantum cosmological assumption, also in the correlations of macroscopic reality.</description>

      <title>Discovery of entanglement generation by elastic collision to realise the original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The amazing quantum effect of `entanglement' was discovered in the 1935 thought experiment by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen (`EPR'). The ensuing research opened up fundamental questions and led to experiments that proved that quantum theory cannot be completed by local hidden variables. Remarkably, EPR did not discuss how to create the entanglement in their thought experiment. Here I add this part. What is required in the original EPR thought experiment is a simple elastic particle collision, an unbalanced mass ratio of e.g. 1:3 and initial states that are position and momentum squeezed, respectively. In the limiting case of infinite squeeze factors, the measurement of the position or momentum of one particle allows an absolutely precise conclusion to be drawn about the value of the same quantity of the other particle. The EPR idea has never been tested in this way. I outline a way to do this.</description>

      <title>Adaptive quantum dynamics with the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation. This adaptive tVMC approach addresses numerical instabilities that arise when the variational ansatz is overparameterized or contains redundant degrees of freedom. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\"atze.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the implementation of a unitary gate on a qubit system S via a global energy-preserving operation acting on S and an auxiliary system B that can be seen as a battery. We derive a simple, asymptotically exact expression for the implementation error as a function of the battery state, which we refer to as the it Unitary Defect. Remarkably, this quantity is independent of the specific gate being implemented, highlighting a universal property of the battery itself. We show that minimizing the unitary defect, under given physical constraints on the battery state, is mathematically equivalent to solving a Lagrangian optimization problem, often corresponding to finding the ground state of a one-dimensional quantum system. Using this mapping, we identify optimal battery states that achieve the highest precision under constraints on energy, squared energy, number of levels and Quantum Fisher Information. Overall, our results provide an efficient method for establishing bounds on the physical requirements needed to implement a unitary gate via energy-preserving operations and for determining the corresponding optimal protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-quality quantum oscillators are preferred for precision sensing of external physical parameter because if the noise level due to interactions with the environment is too high, metrological information can be lost due to quantum decoherence. On the other hand, stronger interactions with a thermal environment could be seen a resource for new types of metrological schemes. We present a general amplification strategy that enables the detection zero-point fluctuations using low-quality quantum oscillators at finite temperature. We show that by injecting a controllable level of multiplicative frequency noise in a Brownian oscillator, quantum deviations from the virial theorem can be amplified by a parameter proportional to the strength of the frequency noise at constant temperature. As an application, we suggest a scheme in which the virial ratio is used as a witness of the quantum fluctuations of an unknown thermal bath, either by measuring the oscillator energy or the heat current flowing into an ancilla bath. Our work expands the metrological capacity of low-quality oscillators and can enable new measurements of the quantum properties of thermal environments by sensing their zero-point contributions to system variables.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the impact of coherent control errors on quantum state evolution by deriving a general norm inequality based on Gronwall's lemma. This inequality provides an explicit upper bound on the deviation between an ideal quantum state and one subject to arbitrary coherent perturbations, including both time-dependent and time-independent cases. The framework is broadly applicable, requiring no assumptions about the detailed structure of the perturbation and full dynamics of the quantum system. We apply this approach to analyze the robustness of Grover's search algorithm in the presence of coherent errors. Our results characterizes quantitative scaling relations between the error strength, algorithm runtime, and success probability, offering practical guidelines for the design of resilient quantum protocols. We further compare the effects of time-dependent and time-independent perturbations, showing the distinctive ways in which coherent errors accumulate in quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Q2SAR: A Quantum Multiple Kernel Learning Approach for Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is a cornerstone of computational drug discovery. This research demonstrates the successful application of a Quantum Multiple Kernel Learning (QMKL) framework to enhance QSAR classification, showing a notable performance improvement over classical methods. We apply this methodology to a dataset for identifying DYRK1A kinase inhibitors. The workflow involves converting SMILES representations into numerical molecular descriptors, reducing dimensionality via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on an optimized combination of multiple quantum and classical kernels. By benchmarking the QMKL-SVM against a classical Gradient Boosting model, we show that the quantum-enhanced approach achieves a superior AUC score, highlighting its potential to provide a quantum advantage in challenging cheminformatics classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Sensing Electric Currents in an a-IGZO TFT-Based Circuit Using a Quantum Diamond Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Diamond Microscope (QDM) is an emerging magnetic imaging tool enabling noninvasive characterization of electronic circuits through spatially mapping current densities. In this work, we demonstrate wafer-level current sensing of a current mirror circuit composed of 16 amorphous-indium-gallium-zinc oxide (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs). a-IGZO TFTs are promising for flexible electronics due to their high performance. Using QDM, we obtain two-dimensional (2D) magnetic field images produced by DC currents, from which accurate current density maps are extracted. Notably, QDM measurements agree well with conventional electrical probing measurements, and enable current sensing in internal circuit paths inaccessible via conventional methods. Our results highlight QDM's capability as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for the characterization of emerging semiconductor technologies, especially oxide-based TFTs. This approach provides essential insights to fabrication engineers, with potential to improve yield and reliability in flexible electronics manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Thermalization of Quantum Many-Body Scars in Kinetically Constrained Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomenon of quantum many-body scars (QMBS) has been studied both theoretically and experimentally, due to its unusual violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). In this paper, we extend the ETH to a new description based on the grand canonical ensemble to depict the thermal properties of QMBS models. For this purpose, we embed the dynamics of kinetically constrained systems within the Lindblad-like master equation, and demonstrate that the violation of the ETH by scar eigenstates is related to their slow decay in the corresponding dissipative process. Within this open system description, we reformulate the ETH to demonstrate that both scar eigenstates and thermal ones exhibit thermalization governed by grand canonical statistics. Consequently, our revised ETH unifies scars and thermal states under a cohesive thermodynamic rule. Our work resolves the fundamental tension between constraint-induced non-ergodicity and thermalization paradigms, establishing a unified route to generalized thermalization for quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement detection via third-order local invariants from randomized measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute all third-order local invariants accessible via randomised measurements and employ them to derive separability criteria. The reconstruction of the invariants yields experimentally accessible entanglement criteria for multipartite states with arbitrary local dimensions. The results show that third-order invariants capture inter-subsystem correlations beyond second-order spectral criteria within more feasible entanglement detection protocols than full tomography. As an example, Werner states in $d=3$ the entanglement is detected for $p&gt;\frac 12$ at the second-order correlations, and it is improved to $p&gt;\frac 1{\sqrt[3]{10}}$ at the third-order.</description>

      <title>Probing the dichotomy between Yu-Shiba-Rusinov and Majorana bound states via conductance, quantum noise and $\Delta_T$ noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16717v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate charge and spin conductance, charge and spin quantum noise, along with charge and spin $\Delta_T$ noise, as diagnostic tools to distinguish Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states from Majorana-bound states (MBS) in a one-dimensional metal/spin-flipper/metal/insulator/superconductor junction. YSR states arise from magnetic impurities acting as spin-flippers within a trivial s-wave superconducting gap, while MBS emerge in topological superconductors, often leading to ambiguity in experiments where magnetic impurities mimic zero-energy MBS signatures. By replacing the trivial superconductor with a topological one exhibiting triplet pairing (e.g., chiral p or spinless p-wave nanowires), we identify robust and distinguishing features of YSR and MBS states. Our analysis demonstrates that combined measurements of both charge and spin conductance, charge and spin quantum noise, and their $\Delta_T$ noise counterparts offer unique and reliable signatures to differentiate YSR states from genuine MBS, thereby reducing false-positive interpretations in topological superconductivity experiments.</description>

      <title>Dynamical quantum phase transition and thermal equilibrium in the lattice Thirring model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time evolution of the lattice Thirring model quenched out of equilibrium in both the critical and massive phases and study the appearance of dynamical quantum phase transitions, as nonanalyticities in the Loschmidt rate. Although the presence of a dynamical quantum phase transition in the model does not correspond to quenches across the critical line of the equilibrium phase diagram at zero temperature, we identify a threshold in the energy density of the initial state, necessary for a dynamical quantum phase transition to be present. Moreover, in the case of the gapped quench Hamiltonian, we unveil a connection of this threshold to a transition between different regions in the finite-temperature phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Rank-Preserving Index-Dependent Matrix Transformations: Applications to Clockwork and Deconstruction Theory Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a versatile framework of index-dependent element-wise matrix transformations, $b_{ij} = a_{ij} / g_f(i,j)$, with direct applications to hierarchy generating mass hierarchies in high-energy physics. This paper establishes the precise mathematical conditions on $g_f(i,j)$ that preserve the rank and nullity of the original matrix. Our study reveals that such transformations provide a powerful method for engineering specific properties of a matrix's null space; by appropriately selecting the function $g_f(i,j)$, one can generate null vectors (or eigenvectors) with diverse and controllable localization patterns. The broad applicability of this technique is discussed, with detailed examples drawn from high-energy physics. We demonstrate how our framework can be used to tailor 0-mode profiles and fermionic mass spectra in clockwork and dimensional deconstruction models, showing that the standard clockwork mechanism arises as a particular case $(g_f(i,j) = f^{(i-j)})$, thereby offering new tools for particle physics BSM model building. This work illustrates the potential of these transformations in model building across various fields where localized modes or specific spectral properties are crucial.</description>

      <title>Emergence of non-ergodic multifractal quantum states in geometrical fractals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate multifractality, a hallmark of non-interacting disordered metals which can potentially be observed in many-body localized states as well, is characterized by anomalous slow dynamics and appears relevant for many areas of quantum physics from measurement-driven systems to superconductivity. We propose a novel approach to achieve non-ergodic multifractal (NEM) states without disorder by iteratively introducing defects into a crystal lattice, reshaping it from a plain structure into fractal geometry. By comprehensive analysis of the Sierpi\'nski gasket case, we find a robust evidence of the emergence of NEM states that go beyond the conventional classification of quantum states and designate new pathways for quantum transport studies. We discuss potential experimental signatures of these states.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find that magnetic field induces a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. Experimentally, the thermal Hall angle is maximal at the temperature of peak longitudinal thermal conductivity. At this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions dominate over Umklapp and boundary scattering events. In the presence of a magnetic field, Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a phase, due to the difference in the spatial distributions of the positive charge of the nuclei and the negative charge of the electrons. Combined with unavoidable anharmonicity, the field-induced phase of the molecular wave-function gives rise to a geometric [Berry] phase for phonons and modifies three-phonon interference. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest displacement, $\delta u_m$, of phonons at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</description>

      <title>Neuralized Fermionic Tensor Networks for Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a class of neuralized fermionic tensor network states (NN-fTNS) that introduce non-linearity into fermionic tensor networks through configuration-dependent neural network transformations of the local tensors. The construction uses the fTNS algebra to implement a natural fermionic sign structure and is compatible with standard tensor network algorithms, but gains enhanced expressivity through the neural network parametrization. Using the 1D and 2D Fermi-Hubbard models as benchmarks, we demonstrate that NN-fTNS achieve order of magnitude improvements in the ground-state energy compared to pure fTNS with the same bond dimension, and can be systematically improved through both the tensor network bond dimension and the neural network parametrization. Compared to existing fermionic neural quantum states (NQS) based on Slater determinants and Pfaffians, NN-fTNS offer a physically motivated alternative fermionic structure. Furthermore, compared to such states, NN-fTNS naturally exhibit improved computational scaling and we demonstrate a construction that achieves linear scaling with the lattice size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for engineering two-dimensional (2D) sub-wavelength topological optical lattices using spatially dependent atomic dark states in a $\Lambda$-type configuration of the atom-light coupling. By properly designing the spatial profiles of the laser fields inducing coupling between the atomic internal states, we show how to generate sub-wavelength Kronig-Penney-like geometric scalar potential accompanied by narrow and strong patches of the synthetic magnetic field localized in the same areas as the scalar potential. These sharply peaked magnetic fluxes are compensated by a smooth background magnetic field of opposite sign, resulting in zero net flux per unit cell while still enabling topologically nontrivial band structures. Specifically, for sufficiently narrow peaks, their influence is minimum, and the behavior of the system in a remaining smooth background magnetic field resembles the Landau problem, allowing for the formation of nearly flat energy bands with unit Chern numbers. Numerical analysis confirms the existence of ideal Chern bands and the robustness of the topological phases against non-adiabatic effects and losses. This makes the scheme well-suited for simulating quantum Hall systems and fractional Chern insulators in ultracold atomic gases, offering a new platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases with high tunability.</description>

      <title>Optically tunable linear and nonlinear enhancement of index of refraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control of optical properties of materials by tuning their refractive index can revolutionize the current state-of-the-art technology to manipulate light propagation in the high loss media. Here we demonstrate active optical tuning of the plasmonic analog of \textit{enhancement of index of refraction} (EIR) in both linear and nonlinear regimes using a quantum mechanical approach. By employing a pump-probe scheme, we investigate the tuning of refractive index of the probe field by varying amplitude and phase of the pump source. In contrast to classical approach used in \cite{Panahpour2019}, we formulate both first- and second-order quantization to analyze nonlinear enhancement in the refractive index by modulating the response function of probe field. This approach enables indirect tuning of nonlinear modes and coherent control of the probe pulse under the coupling of linear plasmonic modes supported by two L-shaped nano-ellipsoids. Varying the pump amplitude not only shows a significant enhancement in the EIR in both regimes but also effectively suppresses optical losses with zero dispersion at the system's resonance frequency. Additionally, tuning pump phase induces a spectral shift in the frequency of the probe field which open new ways for active tuning of epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials. Our approach offers all-optical tuning of nonlinear refractive index which is essential for quantum technological applications. It also provides coherent control of optical properties of plasmonic nanostructures with applications in loss-compensated propagation and zero-index to high-refractive-index plasmonic metamaterials, as well as photonic switches.</description>

      <title>Detection of subsurface structures with a vehicle-based atom gravity gradiometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-precision mobile gravity gradiometers are very useful in geodesy and geophysics. Atom gravity gradiometers (AGGs) could be among the most accurate mobile gravity gradiometers but are currently constrained by the trade-off between portability and sensitivity. Here, we present a high-sensitivity mobile AGG featuring an ultra-compact sensor head with a volume of only 94 L. In the laboratory, it achieves a sensitivity of 77 E/$\sqrt{Hz}$ (1 E=1$\times10^{-9}$/s$^2$) and a long-term stability of better than 0.5 E. We integrated the instrument in a minivan, enabling efficient mobile field surveys with excellent maneuverability in confined spaces. Using this vehicular system, we surveyed the gravitational field over a set of subsurface structures within a small wooded area, successfully resolving their structural signatures with a signal-to-noise ratio of 57 and quantifying the water depth in a reservoir with an accuracy of $\pm$0.23 m. Compared with previous observations using a CG-5 gravimeter, the superior spatial resolution inherent in gradiometry is clearly demonstrated. This work paves the way for bring AGGs to practical field applications.</description>
