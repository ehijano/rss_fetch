      <title>$\widetilde{O}(T^{-1})$ Convergence to (Coarse) Correlated Equilibria in Full-Information General-Sum Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: No-regret learning has a long history of being closely connected to game theory. Recent works have devised uncoupled no-regret learning dynamics that, when adopted by all the players in normal-form games, converge to various equilibrium solutions at a near-optimal rate of $\widetilde{O}(T^{-1})$, a significant improvement over the $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate of classic no-regret learners. However, analogous convergence results are scarce in Markov games, a more generic setting that lays the foundation for multi-agent reinforcement learning. In this work, we close this gap by showing that the optimistic-follow-the-regularized-leader (OFTRL) algorithm, together with appropriate value update procedures, can find $\widetilde{O}(T^{-1})$-approximate (coarse) correlated equilibria in full-information general-sum Markov games within $T$ iterations. Numerical results are also included to corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Auctions: a new method for selling bbjects with bimodal density functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we define a new auction, called the Draw auction. It is based on the implementation of a draw when a minimum price of sale is not reached. We find that a Bayesian Nash equilibrium is reached in the Draw auction when each player bids his true personal valuation of the object. Furthermore, we show that the expected profit for the seller in the Draw auction is greater than in second price auctions, with or without minimum price of sale. We make this affirmation for objects whose valuation can be modeled as a bimodal density function in which the first mode is much greater than the second one. Regarding the Myerson auction, we show that the expected profit for the seller in the Draw auction is nearly as good as the expected profit in the optimal auction, with the difference that our method is much more simple to implement than Myerson's one. All these results are shown by computational tests, for whose development we have defined an algorithm to calculate Myerson auction.</description>

      <title>SACR\'E BLEU: Self-Assessed Creator Royalties \'Enforced by Balancing Liquidity Estimation &amp; Utility (A formal definition and analysis of Ethereum Request for Comment ERC-7526)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The secondary market for Ethereum non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has resulted in over $1.8bn being paid to creators in the form of a sales tax commonly called creator royalties. This was despite royalty payments being enforced by no more than social contract alone. Predictably, such an incentive structure led to zero-royalty alternatives becoming abundant and payments dwindled. A purely programmatic solution to royalty enforcement is hampered by the prevailing NFT standard, ERC-721, which is ignorant of sale values and royalty enforcement therefore relies on (potentially dishonest) third parties. We thus introduce an incentive-compatible mechanism for which there is a single rationalisable solution, in which royalties are paid in full, while maintaining full ERC-721 compatibility. The mechanism constitutes the core of ERC-7526.</description>

      <title>Strategic Bidding in Knapsack Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Knapsack Problem a set of indivisible objects, each with different values and sizes, must be packed into a fixed-size knapsack to maximize the total value. The knapsack problem is known to be an NP-hard problem even when there is full information regarding values and sizes. In many real-world situations, however, the values of objects are private information, which adds another dimension of complexity. In this paper we examine the knapsack problem with private information by investigating three practical auctions as possible candidates for payment rules in a setup where the knapsack owner sells the space to object owners via an auction. The three auctions are the discriminatory price, the generalized second-price and the uniform-price auctions. Using a Greedy algorithm for allocating objects, we analyze bidding behavior, revenue and efficiency of these three auctions using theory, lab experiments, and AI-enriched simulations. Our results suggest that the uniform-price auction has the highest level of truthful bidding and efficiency while the discriminatory price and the generalized second-price auctions are superior in terms of revenue generation.</description>

      <title>Formalizing Feint Actions, and Example Studies in Two-Player Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feint actions refer to a set of deceptive actions, which enable players to obtain temporal advantages from their opponents. Such actions are regarded as widely-used tactic in most non-deterministic Two-player Games (e.g. boxing and fencing). However, existing literature does not provide comprehensive and concrete formalization on Feint actions, and their implications on Two-Player Games. We argue that a full exploration on Feint actions is of great importance towards more realistic Two-player Games. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive and concrete formalization of Feint actions. The key idea of our work is to (1) allow automatic generation of Feint actions, via our proposed Palindrome-directed Generation of Feint actions; and (2) provide concrete principles to properly combine Feint and attack actions. Based on our formalization of Feint actions, we also explore the implications on the game strategy model, and provide optimizations to better incorporate Feint actions. Our experimental results shows that accounting for Feint actions in Non-Deterministic Games (1) brings overall benefits to the game design; and (2) has great benefits on on either game animations or strategy designs, which also introduces a great extent of randomness into randomness-demanded Game models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the first formalization, implementation and quantitative evaluation of Feint in Multi-Player Games. Our work first formalizes Feint from the perspective of Multi-Player Games, in terms of the temporal, spatial, and their collective impacts. The formalization is built upon Non-transitive Active Markov Game Model, where Feint can have a considerable amount of impacts. Then, our work considers practical implementation details of Feint in Multi-Player Games, under the state-of-the-art progress of multi-agent modeling to date (namely Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning). Finally, our work quantitatively examines the effectiveness of our design, and the results show that our design of Feint can (1) greatly improve the reward gains from the game; (2) significantly improve the diversity of Multi-Player Games; and (3) only incur negligible overheads in terms of time consumption. We conclude that our design of Feint is effective and practical, to make Multi-Player Games more interesting.</description>

      <title>Corruption-Robust Offline Two-Player Zero-Sum Markov Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study data corruption robustness in offline two-player zero-sum Markov games. Given a dataset of realized trajectories of two players, an adversary is allowed to modify an $\epsilon$-fraction of it. The learner's goal is to identify an approximate Nash Equilibrium policy pair from the corrupted data. We consider this problem in linear Markov games under different degrees of data coverage and corruption. We start by providing an information-theoretic lower bound on the suboptimality gap of any learner. Next, we propose robust versions of the Pessimistic Minimax Value Iteration algorithm, both under coverage on the corrupted data and under coverage only on the clean data, and show that they achieve (near)-optimal suboptimality gap bounds with respect to $\epsilon$. We note that we are the first to provide such a characterization of the problem of learning approximate Nash Equilibrium policies in offline two-player zero-sum Markov games under data corruption.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Bayesian Epistemology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One aspect of the algorithmic lens in theoretical computer science is a view on other scientific disciplines that focuses on satisfactory solutions that adhere to real-world constraints, as opposed to solutions that would be optimal ignoring such constraints. The algorithmic lens has provided a unique and important perspective on many academic fields, including molecular biology, ecology, neuroscience, quantum physics, economics, and social science.
  This thesis applies the algorithmic lens to Bayesian epistemology. Traditional Bayesian epistemology provides a comprehensive framework for how an individual's beliefs should evolve upon receiving new information. However, these methods typically assume an exhaustive model of such information, including the correlation structure between different pieces of evidence. In reality, individuals might lack such an exhaustive model, while still needing to form beliefs. Beyond such informational constraints, an individual may be bounded by limited computation, or by limited communication with agents that have access to information, or by the strategic behavior of such agents. Even when these restrictions prevent the formation of a *perfectly* accurate belief, arriving at a *reasonably* accurate belief remains crucial. In this thesis, we establish fundamental possibility and impossibility results about belief formation under a variety of restrictions, and lay the groundwork for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Multi-Apartment Rent Division</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rent division is the well-studied problem of fairly assigning rooms and dividing rent among a set of roommates within a single apartment. A shortcoming of existing solutions is that renters are assumed to be considering apartments in isolation, whereas in reality, renters can choose among multiple apartments. In this paper, we generalize the rent division problem to the multi-apartment setting, where the goal is to both fairly choose an apartment among a set of alternatives and fairly assign rooms and rents within the chosen apartment. Our main contribution is a generalization of envy-freeness called rearrangeable envy-freeness. We show that a solution satisfying rearrangeable envy-freeness is guaranteed to exist and that it is possible to optimize over all rearrangeable envy-free solutions in polynomial time. We also define an even stronger fairness notion called universal envy-freeness and study its existence when values are drawn randomly.</description>

      <title>Data Monetization Pathways and Complex Dynamic Game Equilibrium Analysis in the Energy Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the most critical production factor in the era of the digital economy, data will have a significant impact on social production and development. Energy enterprises possess data that is interconnected with multiple industries, characterized by diverse needs, sensitivity, and long-term nature. The path to monetizing energy enterprises' data is challenging yet crucial. This paper explores the game-theoretic aspects of the data monetization process in energy enterprises by considering the relationships between enterprises and trading platforms. We construct a class of game decision models and study their equilibrium strategies. Our analysis shows that enterprises and platforms can adjust respective benefits by regulating the wholesale price of data and the intensity of data value mining to form a benign equilibrium state. Furthermore, by integrating nonlinear dynamical theory, we discuss the dynamic characteristics present in multi-period repeated game processes. We find that decision-makers should keep the adjustment parameters and initial states within reasonable ranges in multi-period dynamic decision-making to avoid market failure. Finally, based on the theoretical and numerical analysis, we provide decision insights and recommendations for enterprise decision-making to facilitate data monetization through strategic interactions with trading platforms.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Information Disclosure in Optimal Auctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a joint design problem where a seller can design both the signal structures for the agents to learn their values, and the allocation and payment rules for selling the item. In his seminal work, Myerson (1981) shows how to design the optimal auction with exogenous signals. We show that the problem becomes NP-hard when the seller also has the ability to design the signal structures. Our main result is a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for computing the optimal joint design with at most an $\epsilon$ multiplicative loss in expected revenue. Moreover, we show that in our joint design problem, the seller can significantly reduce the information rent of the agents by providing partial information, which ensures a revenue that is at least $1 - \frac{1}{e}$ of the optimal welfare for all valuation distributions.</description>

      <title>Tractable Local Equilibria in Non-Concave Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Online Gradient Descent and other no-regret learning procedures are known to efficiently converge to coarse correlated equilibrium in games where each agent's utility is concave in their own strategy, this is not the case when the utilities are non-concave, a situation that is common in machine learning applications where the agents' strategies are parameterized by deep neural networks, or the agents' utilities are computed by a neural network, or both. Indeed, non-concave games present a host of game-theoretic and optimization challenges: (i) Nash equilibria may fail to exist; (ii) local Nash equilibria exist but are intractable; and (iii) mixed Nash, correlated, and coarse correlated equilibria have infinite support in general, and are intractable. To sidestep these challenges we propose a new solution concept, termed $(\varepsilon, \Phi(\delta))$-local equilibrium, which generalizes local Nash equilibrium in non-concave games, as well as (coarse) correlated equilibrium in concave games. Importantly, we show that two instantiations of this solution concept capture the convergence guarantees of Online Gradient Descent and no-regret learning, which we show efficiently converge to this type of equilibrium in non-concave games with smooth utilities.</description>

      <title>An Algorithmic Theory of Simplicity in Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing body of work in economics and computation focuses on the trade-off between implementability and simplicity in mechanism design. The goal is to develop a theory that not only allows to design an incentive structure easy to grasp for imperfectly rational agents, but also understand the ensuing limitations on the class of mechanisms that enforce it. In this context, the concept of OSP mechanisms has assumed a prominent role since they provably account for the absence of contingent reasoning skills, a specific cognitive limitation. For single-dimensional agents, it is known that OSP mechanisms need to use certain greedy algorithms.
  In this work, we introduce a notion that interpolates between OSP and SOSP, a more stringent notion where agents only plan a subset of their own future moves. We provide an algorithmic characterization of this novel class of mechanisms for single-dimensional domains and binary allocation problems, that precisely measures the interplay between simplicity and implementability. We build on this to show how mechanisms based on reverse greedy algorithms (a.k.a., deferred acceptance auctions) are algorithmically more robust to imperfectly rationality than those adopting greedy algorithms.</description>

      <title>Learning How to Strategically Disclose Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strategic information disclosure, in its simplest form, considers a game between an information provider (sender) who has access to some private information that an information receiver is interested in. While the receiver takes an action that affects the utilities of both players, the sender can design information (or modify beliefs) of the receiver through signal commitment, hence posing a Stackelberg game. However, obtaining a Stackelberg equilibrium for this game traditionally requires the sender to have access to the receiver's objective. In this work, we consider an online version of information design where a sender interacts with a receiver of an unknown type who is adversarially chosen at each round. Restricting attention to Gaussian prior and quadratic costs for the sender and the receiver, we show that $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret is achievable with full information feedback, where $T$ is the total number of interactions between the sender and the receiver. Further, we propose a novel parametrization that allows the sender to achieve $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret for a general convex utility function. We then consider the Bayesian Persuasion problem with an additional cost term in the objective function, which penalizes signaling policies that are more informative and obtain $\mathcal{O}(\log(T))$ regret. Finally, we establish a sublinear regret bound for the partial information feedback setting and provide simulations to support our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Measures of relevance to the success of streaming platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital streaming platforms, including Twitch, Spotify, Netflix, Disney, and Kindle, have emerged as one of the main sources of entertainment with significant growth potential. Many of these platforms distribute royalties among streamers, artists, producers, or writers based on their impact. In this paper, we measure the relevance of each of these contributors to the overall success of the platform, which is information that can play a key role in revenue allocation. We perform an axiomatic analysis to provide normative foundations for three relevance metrics: the uniform, the proportional, and the subscriber-proportional indicators. The last two indicators implement the so-called pro-rata and user-centric models, which are extensively applied to distribute revenues in the music streaming market. The axioms we propose formalize different principles of fairness, stability, and non-manipulability, and are tailor-made for the streaming context. We complete our analysis with a case study that measures the influence of the 19 most-followed streamers worldwide on the Twitch platform.</description>

      <title>Distributed Nash Equilibrium Seeking over Time-Varying Directed Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02323v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study distributed algorithms for finding a Nash equilibrium (NE) in a class of non-cooperative convex games under partial information. Specifically, each agent has access only to its own smooth local cost function and can receive information from its neighbors in a time-varying directed communication network. To this end, we propose a distributed gradient play algorithm to compute a NE by utilizing local information exchange among the players. In this algorithm, every agent performs a gradient step to minimize its own cost function while sharing and retrieving information locally among its neighbors. The existing methods impose strong assumptions such as balancedness of the mixing matrices and global knowledge of the network communication structure, including Perron-Frobenius eigenvector of the adjacency matrix and other graph connectivity constants. In contrast, our approach relies only on a reasonable and widely-used assumption of row-stochasticity of the mixing matrices. We analyze the algorithm for time-varying directed graphs and prove its convergence to the NE, when the agents' cost functions are strongly convex and have Lipschitz continuous gradients. Numerical simulations are performed for a Nash-Cournot game to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

Abstract: A Search and Rescue game (SR game) is a new type of game on a graph that has quickly found applications in scheduling, object detection, and adaptive search. In this paper, we broaden the definition of SR games by putting them into the context of ordered sets and Bayesian networks, extending known solutions of these games and opening up the way to further applications.</description>
