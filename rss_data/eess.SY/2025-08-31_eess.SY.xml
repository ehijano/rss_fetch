      <title>Traffic State Estimation in Congestion to Extend Applicability of DFOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a traffic state estimation (TSE) method in congestion for distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS). DFOS detects vehicle driving vibrations along the optical fiber and obtains their trajectories in the spatiotemporal plane. From these trajectories, DFOS provides mean velocities for real-time spatially continuous traffic monitoring without dead zones. However, when vehicle vibration intensities are insufficiently low due to slow speed, trajectories cannot be obtained, leading to missing values in mean velocity data. It restricts DFOS applicability in severe congestion. Therefore, this paper proposes a missing value imputation method based on data assimilation. Our proposed method is validated on two expressways in Japan with the reference data. The results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) of the imputed mean velocities to the reference increases only by 1.5 km/h as compared with the MAE of non-missing values. This study enhances the wide-range applicability of DFOS in practical cases.</description>

      <title>$H_\infty$ Performance Analysis for Almost Periodic Piecewise Linear Systems with Application to Roll-to-Roll Manufacturing Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An almost periodic piecewise linear system (APPLS) is a type of piecewise linear system where the system cyclically switches between different modes, each with an uncertain but bounded dwell-time. Process regulation, especially disturbance rejection, is critical to the performance of these advanced systems. However, a method to guarantee disturbance rejection has not been developed. The objective of this study is to develop an $H_\infty$ performance analysis method for APPLSs, building on which an algorithm to synthesize practical $H_\infty$ controllers is proposed. As an application, the developed methods are demonstrated with an advanced manufacturing system -- roll-to-roll (R2R) dry transfer of two-dimensional materials and printed flexible electronics. Experimental results show that the proposed method enables a less conservative and much better performing $H_\infty$ controller compared with a baseline $H_\infty$ controller that does not account for the uncertain system switching structure.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Sensing Enhanced UAV Path-Following and Obstacle Avoidance with Variable Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high mobility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enables them to be used in various civilian fields, such as rescue and cargo transport. Path-following is a crucial way to perform these tasks while sensing and collision avoidance are essential for safe flight. In this paper, we investigate how to efficiently and accurately achieve path-following, obstacle sensing and avoidance subtasks, as well as their conflict-free fusion scheduling. Firstly, a high precision deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based UAV formation path-following model is developed, and the reward function with adaptive weights is designed from the perspective of distance and velocity errors. Then, we use integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) signals to detect the obstacle and derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for obstacle sensing by information-level fusion, based on which we propose the variable formation enhanced obstacle position estimation (VFEO) algorithm. In addition, an online obstacle avoidance scheme without pretraining is designed to solve the sparse reward. Finally, with the aid of null space based (NSB) behavioral method, we present a hierarchical subtasks fusion strategy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the subtask algorithms and the hierarchical fusion strategy.</description>

      <title>State and Input Constrained Model Reference Adaptive Control with Robustness and Feasibility Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) for uncertain linear time-invariant (LTI) plants with user-defined state and input constraints in the presence of unmatched bounded disturbances. Unlike popular optimization-based approaches for constrained control, such as model predictive control (MPC) and control barrier function (CBF) that solve a constrained optimization problem at each step using the system model, our approach is optimization-free and adaptive; it combines a saturated adaptive controller with a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF)-based design to ensure that the plant state and input always stay within pre-specified bounds despite the presence of unmatched disturbances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that considers both state and input constraints for control of uncertain systems with disturbances and provides sufficient feasibility conditions to check for the existence of an admissible control policy. Simulation results, including a comparison with a robust MRAC, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Model Reference Adaptive Control with Time-Varying State and Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a model reference adaptive control (MRAC) framework for uncertain linear time-invariant (LTI) systems subject to user-defined, time-varying state and input constraints. The proposed design seamlessly integrates a time-varying barrier Lyapunov function (TVBLF) to enforce state constraints with a time-varying saturation function to handle input limits. These time-varying constraints can be designed as performance functions to shape transient and steady-state behaviors for both state and input. A key contribution is the derivation of a verifiable, offline feasibility condition to check the existence of a valid control policy for a given set of constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first adaptive control methodology to simultaneously handle both time-varying state and input constraints without resorting to online optimization. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed constrained MRAC scheme.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Dead-Zone Dual Sliding Mode Observer for Reliable Electrochemical Model-Based SOC Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate state of charge (SOC) estimation is critical for ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles and energy storage systems. Electrochemical models provide high fidelity for SOC estimation but introduce challenges due to parameter variations, nonlinearities, and computational complexity. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive dead-zone dual sliding mode observer(SMO) based on an improved electrochemical single-particle model. The algorithm integrates a state observer for SOC estimation and a parameter observer for online parameter adaptation. A Lyapunov-derived adaptive dead-zone is introduced to ensure stability, activating parameter updates only when the terminal voltage error lies within a rigorously defined bound. The proposed method was validated under constant-current and UDDS dynamic conditions. Results demonstrate that the adaptive dead-zone dual SMO achieves superior accuracy compared with conventional dual SMO and equivalent circuit model-based EKF methods, maintaining SOC estimation errors within 0.2% under correct initialization and below 1% under a 30% initial SOC error, with rapid convergence. Computational efficiency analysis further shows that the adaptive dead-zone dual sliding mode observer reduces execution time compared with the conventional dual SMO by limiting unnecessary parameter updates, highlighting its suitability for real-time battery management applications. Moreover, robustness under battery aging was confirmed using a cycle-aging model, where the adaptive dead-zone dual SMO maintained stable SOC estimation despite parameter drift. These findings indicate that the proposed method offers a reliable, accurate, and computationally efficient solution for SOC estimation.</description>

      <title>Adapting to Change: A Comparison of Continual and Transfer Learning for Modeling Building Thermal Dynamics under Concept Drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) is currently the most effective approach for modeling building thermal dynamics when only limited data are available. TL uses a pretrained model that is fine-tuned to a specific target building. However, it remains unclear how to proceed after initial fine-tuning, as more operational measurement data are collected over time. This challenge becomes even more complex when the dynamics of the building change, for example, after a retrofit or a change in occupancy. In Machine Learning literature, Continual Learning (CL) methods are used to update models of changing systems. TL approaches can also address this challenge by reusing the pretrained model at each update step and fine-tuning it with new measurement data. A comprehensive study on how to incorporate new measurement data over time to improve prediction accuracy and address the challenges of concept drifts (changes in dynamics) for building thermal dynamics is still missing.
  Therefore, this study compares several CL and TL strategies, as well as a model trained from scratch, for thermal dynamics modeling during building operation. The methods are evaluated using 5--7 years of simulated data representative of single-family houses in Central Europe, including scenarios with concept drifts from retrofits and changes in occupancy. We propose a CL strategy (Seasonal Memory Learning) that provides greater accuracy improvements than existing CL and TL methods, while maintaining low computational effort. SML outperformed the benchmark of initial fine-tuning by 28.1\% without concept drifts and 34.9\% with concept drifts.</description>

      <title>Chance-Constrained DC Optimal Power Flow Using Constraint-Informed Statistical Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chance-constrained optimization has emerged as a promising framework for managing uncertainties in power systems. This work advances its application to the DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) model, developing a novel approach to uncertainty modeling and estimation. Current methods typically tackle these problems by first modeling random nodal injections using high-dimensional statistical distributions that scale with the number of buses, followed by deriving deterministic reformulations of the probabilistic constraints. We propose an alternative methodology that exploits the constraint structure to inform the uncertainties to be estimated, enabling significant dimensionality reduction. Rather than learning joint distributions of net-load forecast errors across units, we instead directly model the one-dimensional aggregate system forecast error and two-dimensional line errors weighted by power transfer distribution factors. We evaluate our approach under both Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in statistical accuracy and optimization performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Transferring the driveshaft inertia to the grid via the DC-link in MV drive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a control approach that renders the driveshaft inertia completely available on the grid side and enhances the fault ride-through behavior of medium-voltage (MV) drive systems. Two main contributions are presented. First, we show how the rotational inertia of the driveline shaft can be synchronously coupled to the grid through a modification of the speed control reference signal and through an adapted DC-link control strategy. For the latter, we pursue two alternatives: one based on conventional cascaded control and another based on synchronous machine (SM) model matching. Second, we demonstrate that both the standard phase-locked loop (PLL) and the matching control approach can be interpreted, via the ray-circle complementarity, as feedback optimization schemes with distinct steady-state maps. This perspective allows us to revisit matching control, reveal its embedded PLL, highlight its current-limiting and tracking capabilities, and provide an extensive simulation study.</description>

      <title>DynaMark: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Dynamic Watermarking in Industrial Machine Tool Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industry 4.0's highly networked Machine Tool Controllers (MTCs) are prime targets for replay attacks that use outdated sensor data to manipulate actuators. Dynamic watermarking can reveal such tampering, but current schemes assume linear-Gaussian dynamics and use constant watermark statistics, making them vulnerable to the time-varying, partly proprietary behavior of MTCs. We close this gap with DynaMark, a reinforcement learning framework that models dynamic watermarking as a Markov decision process (MDP). It learns an adaptive policy online that dynamically adapts the covariance of a zero-mean Gaussian watermark using available measurements and detector feedback, without needing system knowledge. DynaMark maximizes a unique reward function balancing control performance, energy consumption, and detection confidence dynamically. We develop a Bayesian belief updating mechanism for real-time detection confidence in linear systems. This approach, independent of specific system assumptions, underpins the MDP for systems with linear dynamics. On a Siemens Sinumerik 828D controller digital twin, DynaMark achieves a reduction in watermark energy by 70% while preserving the nominal trajectory, compared to constant variance baselines. It also maintains an average detection delay equivalent to one sampling interval. A physical stepper-motor testbed validates these findings, rapidly triggering alarms with less control performance decline and exceeding existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>QuadKAN: KAN-Enhanced Quadruped Motion Control via End-to-End Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning (RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Observer Design for Optical Flow-Based Visual-Inertial Odometry with Almost-Global Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel cascaded observer architecture that combines optical flow and IMU measurements to perform continuous monocular visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The proposed solution estimates body-frame velocity and gravity direction simultaneously by fusing velocity direction information from optical flow measurements with gyro and accelerometer data. This fusion is achieved using a globally exponentially stable Riccati observer, which operates under persistently exciting translational motion conditions. The estimated gravity direction in the body frame is then employed, along with an optional magnetometer measurement, to design a complementary observer on $\mathbf{SO}(3)$ for attitude estimation. The resulting interconnected observer architecture is shown to be almost globally asymptotically stable. To extract the velocity direction from sparse optical flow data, a gradient descent algorithm is developed to solve a constrained minimization problem on the unit sphere. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is validated through simulation results.</description>

      <title>On Zero-sum Game Representation for Replicator Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Replicator dynamics have widely been used in evolutionary game theory to model how strategy frequencies evolve over time in large populations. The so-called payoff matrix encodes the pairwise fitness that each strategy obtains when interacting with every other strategy, and it solely determines the replicator dynamics. If the payoff matrix is unknown, we show in this paper that it cannot be inferred from observed strategy frequencies alone -- distinct payoff matrices can induce the same replicator dynamics. We thus look for a canonical representative of the payoff matrix in the equivalence class. The main result of the paper is to show that for every polynomial replicator dynamics (i.e., the vector field is a polynomial), there always exists a skew-symmetric, polynomial payoff matrix that can induce the given dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Fundamental Convergence Rate Bound for Gradient Based Online Optimization Algorithms with Exact Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider algorithms with integral action for solving online optimization problems characterized by quadratic cost functions with a time-varying optimal point described by an $(n-1)$th order polynomial. Using a version of the internal model principle, the optimization algorithms under consideration are required to incorporate a discrete time $n$-th order integrator in order to achieve exact tracking. By using results on an optimal gain margin problem, we obtain a fundamental convergence rate bound for the class of linear gradient based algorithms exactly tracking a time-varying optimal point. This convergence rate bound is given by $ \left(\frac{\sqrt{\kappa} - 1 }{\sqrt{\kappa} + 1}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number for the set of cost functions under consideration. Using our approach, we also construct algorithms which achieve the optimal convergence rate as well as zero steady-state error when tracking a time-varying optimal point.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Model Predictive Path Integral Control for Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to motion planning and decision-making for automated vehicles, using a multi-modal Model Predictive Path Integral control algorithm. The method samples with Sobol sequences around the prior input and incorporates analytical solutions for collision avoidance. By leveraging multiple modes, the multi-modal control algorithm explores diverse trajectories, such as manoeuvring around obstacles or stopping safely before them, mitigating the risk of sub-optimal solutions. A non-linear single-track vehicle model with a Fiala tyre serves as the prediction model, and tyre force constraints within the friction circle are enforced to ensure vehicle stability during evasive manoeuvres. The optimised steering angle and longitudinal acceleration are computed to generate a collision-free trajectory and to control the vehicle. In a high-fidelity simulation environment, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can successfully avoid obstacles, keeping the vehicle stable while driving a double lane change manoeuvre on high and low-friction road surfaces and occlusion scenarios with moving obstacles, outperforming a standard Model Predictive Path Integral approach.</description>

      <title>Incremental Policy Iteration for Unknown Nonlinear Systems with Stability and Performance Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a general incremental policy iteration adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm for model-free robust optimal control of unknown nonlinear systems. The approach integrates recursive least squares estimation with linear ADP principles, which greatly simplifies the implementation while preserving adaptive learning capabilities. In particular, we develop a sufficient condition for selecting a discount factor such that it allows learning the optimal policy starting with an initial policy that is not necessarily stabilizing. Moreover, we characterize the robust stability of the closed-loop system and the near-optimality of iterative policies. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Passivity Analysis for Nonlinear Consensus on Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a passivity-based analysis for the nonlinear output agreement problem in network systems over directed graphs. We reformulate the problem as a convergence analysis on the agreement submanifold. First, we establish how passivity properties of individual agents and controllers determine the passivity of their associated system relations. Building on this, we introduce the concept of submanifold-constrained passivity and develop a novel compensation theorem that ensures output convergence to the agreement submanifold. Unlike previous approaches, our approach can analyze the network system with arbitrary digraphs and any passive agents. We apply this framework to analyze the output agreement problem for network systems consisting of nonlinear and passive agents. Numerical examples support our results.</description>

      <title>Beyond expected value: geometric mean optimization for long-term policy performance in reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable. In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate. To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms conventional RL methods.</description>

      <title>The Rosario Dataset v2: Multimodal Dataset for Agricultural Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-modal dataset collected in a soybean crop field, comprising over two hours of recorded data from sensors such as stereo infrared camera, color camera, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GNSS (Single Point Positioning, Real-Time Kinematic and Post-Processed Kinematic), and wheel odometry. This dataset captures key challenges inherent to robotics in agricultural environments, including variations in natural lighting, motion blur, rough terrain, and long, perceptually aliased sequences. By addressing these complexities, the dataset aims to support the development and benchmarking of advanced algorithms for localization, mapping, perception, and navigation in agricultural robotics. The platform and data collection system is designed to meet the key requirements for evaluating multi-modal SLAM systems, including hardware synchronization of sensors, 6-DOF ground truth and loops on long trajectories.
  We run multimodal state-of-the art SLAM methods on the dataset, showcasing the existing limitations in their application on agricultural settings. The dataset and utilities to work with it are released on https://cifasis.github.io/rosariov2/.</description>

      <title>Hull Clustering with Blended Representative Periods for Energy System Optimization Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing integration of renewable energy sources into power systems requires planning models to account for not only demand variability but also fluctuations in renewable availability during operational periods. Capturing this temporal detail over long planning horizons can be computationally demanding or even intractable. A common approach to address this challenge is to approximate the problem using a reduced set of selected time periods, known as representative periods (RPs). However, using too few RPs can significantly degrade solution quality. In this paper, we propose a novel method -- hull clustering with blended RPs -- that enhances traditional clustering-based RP approaches in two key ways. First, instead of selecting typical cluster centers (e.g., centroids or medoids) as RPs, our method is based on extreme points, which are more likely to be constraint-binding. Second, it represents base periods as weighted combinations of RPs (e.g., convex or conic blends), enabling a more accurate approximation of the full time horizon with fewer RPs. Through two case studies based on data from the European network operators, we demonstrate that hull clustering with blended RPs outperforms traditional RP techniques in both regret and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Soft Inducement Framework for Incentive-Aided Steering of No-Regret Players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a steering problem in a mediator-augmented two-player normal-form game, where the mediator aims to guide players toward a specific action profile through information and incentive design. We first characterize the games for which successful steering is possible. Moreover, we establish that steering players to any desired action profile is not always achievable with information design alone, nor when accompanied with sublinear payment schemes. Consequently, we derive a lower bound on the constant payments required per round to achieve this goal. To address these limitations incurred with information design, we introduce an augmented approach that involves a one-shot information design phase before the start of the repeated game, transforming the prior interaction into a Stackelberg game. Finally, we theoretically demonstrate that this approach improves the convergence rate of players' action profiles to the target point by a constant factor with high probability, and support it with empirical results.</description>

      <title>A Dual Ensemble Kalman Filter Approach to Robust Control of Nonlinear Systems: An Application to Partial Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of data-driven robust control design for nonlinear systems, for instance, obtained when discretizing nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). A robust learning control approach is developed for nonlinear affine in control systems based on Lyapunov redesign technique. The robust control is developed as a sum of an optimal learning control which stabilizes the system in absence of disturbances, and an additive Lyapunov-based robustification term which handles the effects of disturbances. The dual ensemble Kalman filter (dual EnKF) algorithm is utilized in the optimal control design methodology. A simulation study is done on the heat equation and Burgers partial differential equation.</description>

      <title>A Single Subject Machine Learning Based Classification of Motor Imagery EEGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motor Imagery-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) are systems that detect and interpret brain activity patterns linked to the mental visualization of movement, and then translate these into instructions for controlling external robotic or domotic devices. Such devices have the potential to be useful in a broad variety of applications. While implementing a system that would help individuals restore some freedom levels, the interpretation of (Electroencephalography) EEG data remains a complex and unsolved problem. In the literature, the classification of left and right imagined movements has been extensively studied. This study introduces a novel pipeline that makes use of machine learning techniques for classifying MI EEG data. The entire framework is capable of accurately categorizing left and imagined motions, as well as rest phases, for a set of 52 subjects who performed a MI task. We trained a within subject model on each individual subject. The methodology has been offline evaluated and compared to four studies that are currently the state-of-the-art regarding the specified dataset. The results show that our proposed framework could be used with MI-BCI systems in light of its failsafe classification performances, i.e. 99.5% in accuracy</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Flexibility Aggregation of DERs for Ancillary Services Provision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a grid-aware probabilistic approach to compute the aggregated flexibility at the grid connection point (GCP) of active distribution networks (ADNs) to allow the participation of DERs in ancillary services (AS) markets. Specifically an optimal power flow (OPF) method using a linear network model is used to compute the aggregated capability for the provision of multiple AS. We start from the method proposed in [1] and extend it to allow for optimizing the provision of multiple services simultaneously, ensure cost-effectiveness of the used DERs and handle uncertainties in a probabilistic way. The allocation of individual DERs power flexibilities accounts for the operational costs associated to the provision of different services and ensures cost-effectiveness while maximizing the value of the advertised aggregated flexibility, assuming known service prices. Empirical uncertainty sets are obtained to achieve a predefined coverage of the probability distribution in line with recent developments in the Nordic AS markets. Finally, a feeder-decomposition approach is proposed to ensure the methods applicability to realistic distribution networks with a large number of buses. Different case studies show the effectiveness of the method, highlight the importance of accounting for network constraints and illustrate its applicability to realistic distribution systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Model Predictive Control of Charging Energy Hubs with Conformal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an online energy management system for an energy hub where electric vehicles are charged combining on-site photovoltaic generation and battery energy storage with the power grid, with the objective to decide on the battery (dis)charging to minimize the costs of operation. To this end, we devise a scenario-based stochastic model predictive control (MPC) scheme that leverages probabilistic 24-hour-ahead forecasts of charging load, solar generation and day-ahead electricity prices to achieve a cost-optimal operation of the energy hub. The probabilistic forecasts leverage conformal prediction providing calibrated distribution-free confidence intervals starting from a machine learning model that generates no uncertainty quantification. We showcase our controller by running it over a 280-day evaluation in a closed-loop simulated environment to compare the observed cost of two scenario-based MPCs with two deterministic alternatives: a version with point forecast and a version with perfect forecast. Our results indicate that, compared to the perfect forecast implementation, our proposed scenario-based MPCs are 13% more expensive, and 1% better than their deterministic point-forecast counterpart</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel hybrid AI method combining H filtering and an adaptive linear neuron network for flicker component estimation in power distribution systems.The proposed method leverages the robustness of the H filter to extract the voltage envelope under uncertain and noisy conditions followed by the use of ADALINE to accurately identify flicker frequencies embedded in the envelope.This synergy enables efficient time domain estimation with rapid convergence and noise resilience addressing key limitations of existing frequency domain approaches.Unlike conventional techniques this hybrid AI model handles complex power disturbances without prior knowledge of noise characteristics or extensive training.To validate the method performance we conduct simulation studies based on IEC Standard 61000 4 15 supported by statistical analysis Monte Carlo simulations and real world data.Results demonstrate superior accuracy robustness and reduced computational load compared to Fast Fourier Transform and Discrete Wavelet Transform based estimators.</description>

      <title>The impact of heatwave-driven air conditioning adoption on electricity demand: A spatio-temporal case study for Germany</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intensifying heatwaves driven by climate change are accelerating the adoption of mobile air conditioning (AC) systems. A rapid mass adoption of such AC systems could create additional stress on electricity grids and the power system. This study presents a novel method to estimate the electricity demand from AC systems both at the system level and at high temporal and spatial granularity. We apply the method to a near-future heatwave scenario in Germany in which household AC adoption increases from the current 19% to 35% during a heatwave similar to the one of July 2025. We analyze the effects for 196,428 grid cells of one square kilometer across Germany, by combining weather data, census data, socio-demographic assumptions, mobility patterns, and temperature-dependent AC activation functions. We find that electricity demand of newly purchased mobile AC systems could increase the peak load by over 12.9 GW, with urban hot-spots reaching 5.2 MW per square kilometer. The temporal pattern creates a pronounced afternoon peak that coincides with lower photovoltaic generation, potentially exacerbating power system stability challenges. Our findings underscore the urgency for proactive energy system planning to manage emerging demand peaks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper generalizes the control barrier function framework by replacing scalar-valued functions with matrix-valued ones. Specifically, we develop barrier conditions for safe sets defined by matrix inequalities -- both semidefinite and indefinite. Matrix inequalities can be used to describe a richer class of safe sets, including nonsmooth ones. The safety filters constructed from our proposed matrix control barrier functions via semidefinite programming (CBF-SDP) are shown to be continuous. Our matrix formulation naturally provides a continuous safety filter for Boolean-based control barrier functions, notably for disjunctions (OR), without relaxing the safe set. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with applications in drone network connectivity maintenance and nonsmooth obstacle avoidance, both in simulations and hardware experiments.</description>

Abstract: We develop a novel switching dynamics that converges to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of a nonlinear optimisation problem. This new approach is particularly notable for its lower dimensionality compared to conventional primal-dual dynamics, as it focuses exclusively on estimating the primal variable. Our method is successfully illustrated on general quadratic optimisation problems, the minimisation of the classical Rosenbrock function, and a nonconvex optimisation problem stemming from the control of energy-efficient buildings.</description>

Additionally, we propose a novel robust control strategy combining the nominal model with dual feedforward control to form a feedback structure. Numerical comparison demonstrates the approach's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Distributed Constrained Online Nonconvex Optimization with Compressed Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers distributed online nonconvex optimization with time-varying inequality constraints over a network of agents. For a time-varying graph, we propose a distributed online primal-dual algorithm with compressed communication to efficiently utilize communication resources. We show that the proposed algorithm establishes an $\mathcal{O}( {{T^{\max \{ {1 - {\theta_1},{\theta_1}} \}}}} )$ network regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}( {T^{1 - {\theta_1}/2}} )$ network cumulative constraint violation bound, where $T$ is the number of iterations and ${\theta_1} \in ( {0,1} )$ is a user-defined trade-off parameter. When Slater's condition holds (i.e, there is a point that strictly satisfies the inequality constraints at all iterations), the network cumulative constraint violation bound is reduced to $\mathcal{O}( {T^{1 - {\theta_1}}} )$. These bounds are comparable to the state-of-the-art results established by existing distributed online algorithms with perfect communication for distributed online convex optimization with (time-varying) inequality constraints. Finally, a simulation example is presented to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Resource Allocation for QoS and Stability in Dynamic VLC-NOMA Networks via MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visible Light Communication (VLC) combined with Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) offers a promising solution for dense indoor wireless networks. Yet, managing resources effectively is challenged by VLC network dynamic conditions involving user mobility and light dimming. In addition to satisfying Quality of Service (QoS) and network stability requirements. Traditional resource allocation methods and simpler RL approaches struggle to jointly optimize QoS and stability under the dynamic conditions of mobile VLC-NOMA networks. This paper presents MARL frameworks tailored to perform complex joint optimization of resource allocation (NOMA power, user scheduling) and network stability (interference, handovers), considering heterogeneous QoS, user mobility, and dimming in VLC-NOMA systems. Our MARL frameworks capture dynamic channel conditions and diverse user QoS , enabling effective joint optimization. In these frameworks, VLC access points (APs) act as intelligent agents, learning to allocate power and schedule users to satisfy diverse requirements while maintaining network stability by managing interference and minimizing disruptive handovers. We conduct a comparative analysis of two key MARL paradigms: 1) Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) and 2) Centralized Training with Centralized Execution (CTCE). Comprehensive simulations validate the effectiveness of both tailored MARL frameworks and demonstrate an ability to handle complex optimization. The results show key trade-offs, as the CTDE approach achieved approximately 16\% higher for High priority (HP) user QoS satisfaction, while the CTCE approach yielded nearly 7 dB higher average SINR and 12\% lower ping-pong handover ratio, offering valuable insights into the performance differences between these paradigms in complex VLC-NOMA network scenarios.</description>

      <title>AI Simulation by Digital Twins: Systematic Survey, Reference Framework, and Mapping to a Standardized Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Insufficient data volume and quality are particularly pressing challenges in the adoption of modern subsymbolic AI. To alleviate these challenges, AI simulation uses virtual training environments in which AI agents can be safely and efficiently developed with simulated, synthetic data. Digital twins open new avenues in AI simulation, as these high-fidelity virtual replicas of physical systems are equipped with state-of-the-art simulators and the ability to further interact with the physical system for additional data collection. In this article, we report on our systematic survey of digital twin-enabled AI simulation. By analyzing 22 primary studies, we identify technological trends and derive a reference framework to situate digital twins and AI components. Based on our findings, we derive a reference framework and provide architectural guidelines by mapping it onto the ISO 23247 reference architecture for digital twins. Finally, we identify challenges and research opportunities for prospective researchers.</description>

      <title>Ontology Neural Network and ORTSF: A Framework for Topological Reasoning and Delay-Robust Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advancement of autonomous robotic systems has led to impressive capabilities in perception, localization, mapping, and control. Yet, a fundamental gap remains: existing frameworks excel at geometric reasoning and dynamic stability but fall short in representing and preserving relational semantics, contextual reasoning, and cognitive transparency essential for collaboration in dynamic, human-centric environments. This paper introduces a unified architecture comprising the Ontology Neural Network (ONN) and the Ontological Real-Time Semantic Fabric (ORTSF) to address this gap. The ONN formalizes relational semantic reasoning as a dynamic topological process. By embedding Forman-Ricci curvature, persistent homology, and semantic tensor structures within a unified loss formulation, ONN ensures that relational integrity and topological coherence are preserved as scenes evolve over time. The ORTSF transforms reasoning traces into actionable control commands while compensating for system delays. It integrates predictive and delay-aware operators that ensure phase margin preservation and continuity of control signals, even under significant latency conditions. Empirical studies demonstrate the ONN + ORTSF framework's ability to unify semantic cognition and robust control, providing a mathematically principled and practically viable solution for cognitive robotics.</description>

      <title>PUB: A Plasma-Propelled Ultra-Quiet Blimp with Two-DOF Vector Thrusting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents the design and control of a Plasma-propelled Ultra-silence Blimp (PUB), a novel aerial robot employing plasma vector propulsion for ultra-quiet flight without mechanical propellers. The system utilizes a helium-lift platform for extended endurance and a four-layer ring asymmetric capacitor to generate ionic wind thrust. The modular propulsion units allow flexible configuration to meet mission-specific requirements, while a two-degree-of-freedom (DOF) head enables thrust vector control. A closed-loop slip control scheme is implemented for stable maneuvering. Flight experiments demonstrate full-envelope capability, including take-off, climb, hover, descent, and smooth landing, confirming the feasibility of plasma vector propulsion, the effectiveness of DOF vector control, and the stability of the control system. Owing to its low acoustic signature, structural simplicity, and high maneuverability, PUB is well suited for noise-sensitive, enclosed, and near-space applications.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Optimisation of Ride-Pooling Personalised Fares in a Stochastic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ride-pooling systems, to succeed, must provide an attractive service, namely compensate perceived costs with an appealing price. However, because of a strong heterogeneity in a value-of-time, each traveller has his own acceptable price, unknown to the operator. Here, we show that individual acceptance levels can be learned by the operator (over $90\%$ accuracy for pooled travellers in $10$ days) to optimise personalised fares. We propose an adaptive pricing policy, where every day the operator constructs an offer that progressively meets travellers' expectations and attracts a growing demand. Our results suggest that operators, by learning behavioural traits of individual travellers, may improve performance not only for travellers (increased utility) but also for themselves (increased profit). Moreover, such knowledge allows the operator to remove inefficient pooled rides and focus on attractive and profitable combinations.</description>
