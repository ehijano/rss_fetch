      <title>Prefetching Cache Optimization Using Graph Neural Networks: A Modular Framework and Conceptual Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Caching and prefetching techniques are fundamental to modern computing, serving to bridge the growing performance gap between processors and memory. Traditional prefetching strategies are often limited by their reliance on predefined heuristics or simplified statistical models, which fail to capture the complex, non-linear dependencies in modern data access patterns. This paper introduces a modular framework leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model and predict access patterns within graph-structured data, focusing on web navigation and hierarchical file systems. The toolchain consists of: a route mapper for extracting structural information, a graph constructor for creating graph representations, a walk session generator for simulating user behaviors, and a gnn prefetch module for training and inference. We provide a detailed conceptual analysis showing how GNN-based approaches can outperform conventional methods by learning intricate dependencies. This work offers both theoretical foundations and a practical, replicable pipeline for future research in graph-driven systems optimization.</description>

      <title>Iterative Layer Pruning for Efficient Translation Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed many areas of natural language processing, including machine translation. However, efficient deployment of LLMs remains challenging due to their intensive computational requirements. In this paper, we address this challenge and present our submissions to the Model Compression track at the Conference on Machine Translation (WMT 2025). In our experiments, we investigate iterative layer pruning guided by layer importance analysis. We evaluate this method using the Aya-Expanse-8B model for translation from Czech to German, and from English to Egyptian Arabic. Our approach achieves substantial reductions in model size and inference time, while maintaining the translation quality of the baseline models.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Inference Placement for Deep Learning across Edge and Cloud Platforms: A Multi-Objective Optimization Perspective and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge intelligent applications like VR/AR and language model based chatbots have become widespread with the rapid expansion of IoT and mobile devices. However, constrained edge devices often cannot serve the increasingly large and complex deep learning (DL) models. To mitigate these challenges, researchers have proposed optimizing and offloading partitions of DL models among user devices, edge servers, and the cloud. In this setting, users can take advantage of different services to support their intelligent applications. For example, edge resources offer low response latency. In contrast, cloud platforms provide low monetary cost computation resources for computation-intensive workloads. However, communication between DL model partitions can introduce transmission bottlenecks and pose risks of data leakage. Recent research aims to balance accuracy, computation delay, transmission delay, and privacy concerns. They address these issues with model compression, model distillation, transmission compression, and model architecture adaptations, including internal classifiers. This survey contextualizes the state-of-the-art model offloading methods and model adaptation techniques by studying their implication to a multi-objective optimization comprising inference latency, data privacy, and resource monetary cost.</description>

      <title>A Data-driven ML Approach for Maximizing Performance in LLM-Adapter Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-adapters have become increasingly common, providing lightweight specialization of large-scale models. Serving hundreds or thousands of these adapters on a single GPU allows request aggregation, increasing throughput, but may also cause request starvation if GPU memory limits are exceeded. To address this issue, this study focuses on determining the joint configuration of concurrent and parallel adapters that maximizes GPU throughput without inducing starvation, given heterogeneous adapter and traffic properties. We propose a data-driven ML approach leveraging interpretable models to tackle this caching problem and introduce the first Digital Twin capable of reproducing an LLM-adapter serving system, enabling efficient training data generation. Experiments with the vLLM framework and LoRA adapters show that the Digital Twin reproduces throughput within 5.1% of real results, while the ML approach predicts optimal numbers of concurrent and parallel adapters with an error of at most 7.2% under heterogeneous, real-world workloads.</description>

      <title>Bandwidth Efficient Livestreaming in Mobile Wireless Networks: A Peer-to-Peer ACIDE Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14283v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In mobile wireless networks, livestreaming in high user density areas presents two typical challenges: the wireless bandwidth is depleted and the number of users is limited. In this study, a media distribution model utilizing peer to peer communications, Active Control in an Intelligent and Distributed Environment, is proposed for bandwidth efficient livestreaming. The basic idea is to group users with identical livestream interest in a cluster of n peers. Instead of sending n copies of a livestream package, only one copy is sent to the cluster. A package is divided into n blocks. Each user receives one block from the base station and the remaining n-1 blocks from the other peers. Two optimization problems are addressed. The first problem is minimizing the bandwidth needed to guarantee a continuous live media play on all peers. A solution is proposed to find the optimal block sizes such that the wireless bandwidth is minimized. The second problem is maximizing the number of peers admitted to a cluster, given a fixed wireless bandwidth. This problem is NP-complete and a greedy strategy is proposed to calculate a feasible solution for peer selection. The proposed model improves the bandwidth efficiency and allows more users to be served.</description>

      <title>TraDE: Network and Traffic-aware Adaptive Scheduling for Microservices Under Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition from monolithic architecture to microservices has enhanced flexibility in application design and its scalable execution. This approach typically uses a computing cluster managed by a container orchestration platform to deploy microservices. However, this shift introduces significant challenges, particularly in the efficient scheduling of containerized services. These challenges are compounded by unpredictable scenarios such as dynamic incoming workloads with various execution traffic and variable communication delays among cluster nodes. Existing works often overlook the real-time traffic impacts of dynamic requests on running microservices, as well as the varied communication delays across cluster nodes. Consequently, even optimally deployed microservices could suffer from significant performance degradation over time. To address these issues, we propose a network and traffic-aware adaptive scheduling framework, TraDE, which can adaptively redeploy microservice instances to maintain desired performance amid changing traffic and network conditions within the hosting cluster. We have implemented TraDE as an extension to the Kubernetes platform. Additionally, we deployed realistic microservice applications in a real compute cluster and conducted extensive experiments to assess our framework's performance in various scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of TraDE in rescheduling running microservices to enhance end-to-end performance while maintaining a high goodput ratio. Compared with the existing method NetMARKS, TraDE outperforms it by reducing the average response time of the application by up to 48.3%, and improving the throughput by up to 1.2-1.5x across workloads while maintaining a goodput ratio of 95.36%, and showing robust adaptive capability to meet QoS targets under sustained workloads and dynamic networking conditions.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Approximate Caching for Faster Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves the reliability of large language model (LLM) answers by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG increases the end-to-end inference time since looking for relevant documents from large vector databases is computationally expensive. To address this, we introduce Proximity, an approximate key-value cache that optimizes the RAG workflow by leveraging similarities in user queries. Instead of treating each query independently, Proximity reuses previously retrieved documents when similar queries appear, substantially reducing the reliance on expensive vector database lookups. To efficiently scale, Proximity employs a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) scheme that enables fast cache lookups while preserving retrieval accuracy. We evaluate Proximity using the MMLU and MedRAG question-answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Proximity with our LSH scheme and a realistically-skewed MedRAG workload reduces database calls by 77.2% while maintaining database recall and test accuracy. We experiment with different similarity tolerances and cache capacities, and show that the time spent within the Proximity cache remains low and constant (4.8 microseconds) even as the cache grows substantially in size. Our results demonstrate that approximate caching is a practical and effective strategy for optimizing RAG-based systems.</description>

      <title>FalconFS: Distributed File System for Large-Scale Deep Learning Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Client-side metadata caching has long been considered an effective method for accelerating metadata operations in distributed file systems (DFSs). However, we have found that client-side state (e.g., caching) is not only ineffective but also consumes valuable memory resources in the deep learning pipelines. We thus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the stateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side path resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server side using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS also boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides easy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show that FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\times$ throughput for small file read/write and up to 12.81$\times$ throughput for deep learning model training. FalconFS has been running in Huawei autonomous driving system's production environment with 10,000 NPUs for one year and has been open-sourced.</description>
