      <title>On the role of Electronic Doorway States in the Secondary Electron Emission from Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of secondary low-energy electron emission from graphene and graphite. By applying a coincidence detection of the primary scattered and an emitted secondary electron, we disentangle specific features otherwise hidden in the essentially featureless secondary electron spectrum. Hand-in-hand with density functional theory calculations, we show that this slow electron emission is governed not only by the density of states in the occupied and unoccupied band structure but is also modulated by the coupling of levels above the vacuum energy to free-vacuum states. This implies electronic doorway states which facilitate efficient propagation of electrons from the solid to vacuum, some of which only open for samples with more than 5 layers.</description>

      <title>Effects of disorder on the quantum transport properties in topologically nontrivial metal PbTaSe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak antilocalization (WAL), an increase in the electrical conductivity at low temperatures associated with the suppression of electron localization due to quantum interference effects, is often observed in topological materials. In this study, we report the observation of WAL in topologically nontrivial metal PbTaSe$_{2}$ at low temperatures. In the pristine sample, we identified the presence of WAL, which is attributed to the topologically protected backscattering. In order to investigate the influence of disorder on the WAL, we successively introduced controlled amounts of disorder by H$^{+}$-irradiation. As disorder increases, the dip-like magnetoresistance caused by WAL changes to a linear magnetoresistance(MR), and eventually to a quadratic MR as the electronic system becomes highly localized. This research unveils the significance of disorder in shaping the quantum transport characteristics of topological materials.</description>

      <title>Diabatic error and propagation of Majorana zero modes in interacting quantum dots systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental progress in realizing Majorana zero modes (MZMs) using quantum dot systems, we investigate the diabatic errors associated with the movement of those MZMs. The movement is achieved by tuning time-dependent gate potentials applied to individual quantum dots, effectively creating a moving potential wall. To probe the optimized movement of MZMs, we calculate the experimentally accessible local density-of-states and time-dependent fidelity using many-body time-dependent numerical methods. Our analysis reveals that an optimal potential wall height is crucial to preserve the well-localized nature of the MZM during its movement. Moreover, for the first time, we analyze diabatic errors in realistic quantum-dot systems, incorporating the effects of repulsive Coulomb interactions and disorder in both hopping and pairing terms. Additionally, we provide a comparative study of diabatic errors arising from the simultaneous versus sequential tuning of multiple gates during the MZMs movement. Finally, we estimate the time scale required for MZM transfer in a six-quantum-dot system, demonstrating that MZM movement is feasible and can be completed well within the qubit's operational lifetime in practical quantum-dot setups.</description>

      <title>Skyrmionium Dynamics and Stability on One Dimensional Anisotropy Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a skyrmionium driven over a periodic anisotropy pattern, which consists of disorder free regions and disordered regions. For small defect densities, the skyrmionium flows for an extended range of currents, and there is a critical current above which it transforms into a skyrmion. For increased amounts of quenched disorder, the current needed for the skyrmionium to transform into a skyrmion decreases, and there is a critical disorder density above which a moving skyrmionium is not stable. In the moving state, the skyrmionium to skyrmion transformation leads to a drop in the velocity and the onset of a finite skyrmion Hall angle. We also find a reentrance effect in which the pinned skyrmionium transforms into a skyrmion just above depinning, restabilizes into skyrmionium at larger drives, and becomes unstable again at large currents. We also show that adding a transverse shaking drive can increase the lifetime of a moving skyrmionium by reducing the effect of the pinning in the direction of the drive.</description>

      <title>Heat Conduction and Thermal Switching Performance of Surface Plasmon Polaritons in Ag2Se Quantum Dot Composite Polymer Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To stabilize the working temperature of an equipment, a solid-state thermal resistor is usually a requisite, which could adjust its heat conductance continuously according to the temperature. In this work, the thermal conductivity and the thermal switching performances of surface plasmon polaritons in the polymer films filled with Ag2Se quantum dots (QDs) were theoretically analyzed, and a theoretical model was also derived to reveal the dependence of the thermal conductivity on the temperature and the structure of a composite film, which is verified to be effective by numerical calculations. It shows that the thermal conductivity will decrease following ~t-3exp({\zeta}/Td) rule under the thin film limit, here t, d and T are film thickness, diameter of QDs and temperature, respectively, and {\zeta} is a constant. A high thermal conductivity could be only realized at a device with a size lager than millimeter scale, due to the need of avoiding boundary scatterings of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). At the millimeter scale, the thermal conductivity could be reduced by 100 times by increasing temperature from 300 to 400 K, which suggests a very high thermal switching ratio almost in all kinds of solid-state thermal resistor. This study brings new insights in designing thermal resistor and understanding heat conduction in films by adjusting its structures.</description>

      <title>Flux-Driven Circular Current in a Non-Hermitian Dimerized Aharonov-Bohm Ring: Impact of Physical Gain and Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we explore magnetic response of a dimerized ring subjected to Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux and environmental interactions. Specifically, we introduce an imaginary site potential on the odd lattice sites to represent physical gain and loss, while the even lattice sites remain unperturbed. We investigate the induced current resulting from the AB flux in both real and imaginary eigenspaces, aiming to enhance this current significantly by adjusting the gain/loss parameter ($d$). Our analysis focuses on how exceptional points in the real and imaginary eigenenergy spaces contribute to notable increases in current at specific $d$ values, and the emergence of purely real current when the imaginary current vanishes. We focus on how the converging and diverging nature of the energy spectrum leads to gradual increases and decreases in the current. Additionally, we study the interplay between the correlations of dimerized hopping integrals and the gain-loss parameter, which affects the current and highlights key features associated with these physical parameters. Furthermore, we consider how system size impacts our findings. These investigations may reveal unconventional characteristics in various loop configurations, potentially paving the way for new research directions.</description>

      <title>The Layer Hall Effect without External Electric Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layer Hall effect is an intriguing phenomenon observed in magnetic topological layered materials, where the Hall response arises from the opposite deflection of electrons on top and bottom layers. To realize layer Hall effect, space-time $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is typically broken by applying an external electric field. In this work, we propose a new mechanism to realize the layer Hall effect by introducing inequivalent exchange fields on both surfaces of a topological insulator thin film, in the absence of an electric field. This approach yields a distinct Hall response compared to the conventional electric-field-induced layer Hall effect, particularly with respect to the Fermi level. Taking the topological insulator Sb$_2$Te$_3$ as a concrete example, we demonstrate the feasibility of inducing the layer Hall effect only by coupling the top and bottom surfaces of Sb$_2$Te$_3$ with different magnetic insulators. Notably, we show that both built-in electric-field-induced and inequivalent exchange-fields-induced layer Hall effects can be achieved by tuning the stacking order between Sb$_2$Te$_3$ and the magnetic layers. Given the well-established experimental techniques for fabricating topological insulator thin films, our work offers a viable pathway for realizing layer Hall effect without external electric field.</description>

      <title>The role of antisymmetric orbitals and electron-electron interactions on the two-particle spin and valley blockade in graphene double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an experimental study of spin and valley blockade in two-electron bilayer graphene (BLG) double quantum dots (DQDs) and explore the limits set by asymmetric orbitals and electronelectron interactions. The results obtained from magnetotransport measurements on two-electron BLG DQDs, where the resonant tunneling transport involves both orbital symmetric and antisymmetric two-particle states, show a rich level spectrum. We observe a magnetic field tunable spin and valley blockade, which is limited by the orbital splitting, the strength of the electron-electron interaction and the difference in the valley g-factors between the symmetric and antisymmetric twoparticle orbital states. Our conclusions are supported by simulations based on rate equations, which allow the identification of prominent interdot transitions associated with the transition from single to two-particle states observed in the experiment.</description>

      <title>Switching Graphitic Polytypes in Elastically Coupled Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals polytypes are commensurate configurations of two-dimensional layers with discrete crystalline symmetries and distinct stacking-dependent properties. In graphitic polytypes, the different stacking arrangements of graphene sheets exhibit rich electronic phases, such as intrinsic electric polarizations, orbital magnetizations, superconductivity, and anomalous fractional Hall states. Switching between these metastable periodic configurations by controlling interlayer shifts unlocks intriguing multiferroic responses. Here, we report super-lubricant arrays of polytypes (SLAP) devices, with nanometer-scale islands of Bernal polytypes that switch into Rhombohedral crystals and vice versa under a shear force as low as 6 nano-Newtons. We assemble these four-layer SLAP structures by aligning a pair of graphene bilayers above and under circular cavities in a misaligned spacer layer. Using local current measurements, we detect the shifts between the active bilayers and reveal long-range elastic relaxations outside the cavities that enable efficient nucleation and spontaneous sliding of stacking dislocation inside the islands. We demonstrate configurable, deterministic, and robust polytype switching by confining these boundary strips in narrow cavity channels that connect the islands. Such controlled switching between elastically-coupled single-crystalline islands is appealing for novel multiferroic SlideTronic applications.</description>

      <title>Striped twisted state in the orientational epitaxy on quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal "twisted" geometry of a crystalline layer on a crystal is long known, but that on a quasicrystal is still unknown and open. We predict analytically that the layer equilibrium configuration will generally exhibit a nonzero misfit angle. The theory perfectly agrees with numerical optimization of a colloid monolayer on a quasiperiodic decagonal optical lattice. Strikingly different from crystal-on-crystal epitaxy, the structure of the novel emerging twisted state exhibits an unexpected stripe pattern. Its high anisotropy should reflect on the tribomechanical properties of this unconventional interface.</description>

      <title>Flat Band and Many-body Gap in Chirally Twisted Triple Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the band structures of chirally twisted triple bilayer graphene. The new kind of moir\'e structure, formed by three pieces of helically stacked Bernal bilayer graphene, has flat bands at charge neutral point based on the continuum approximation. We experimentally confirm the existence of flat bands and directly acquire the gap in-between flat bands as well as between the flat bands and dispersive bands from the capacitance measurements. We discover a finite gap even at zero perpendicular electric field, possibly induced by the Coulomb interaction and ferromagnetism. Our quantitative study not only provides solid evidence for the flat-band and interesting physics, but also introduces a quantitative approach to explore phenomena of similar moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Intraband motion impact to the polarization dynamics in 2D semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the generation of microscopic polarization in two-dimensional semiconductors under intense optical fields in the nonresonant regime. We demonstrate that the intraband motion of quasiparticles, driven by the electric field of the laser pulse, contributes substantially to the system's polarization. The effects of intraband motion are analyzed using the semiconductor Bloch equations. We propose a method for solving these equations by considering them in a reference frame moving along the trajectories of the quasiparticles in momentum space. We demonstrate the developed technique on transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers irradiated by strong circularly polarized infrared light. The solution is provided in the form of a power series expansion by a small parameter that naturally emerges in the system. The implications of the results are examined, and the limitations of the approach are discussed.</description>

      <title>Couplings between Photons and Ensemble of Emitters in a High-$Q$ Cavity at Mesoscopic Excitation Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the coupling between an ensemble of individual emitters and multiple photons in a high-$Q$ cavity at the mesoscopic excitation level. The master equation theory is used to calculate the emission spectrum of the cavity QED system. The increasing excitation level not only pumps the system to the high-energy multi-emitter-photon states, but also introduces the pump-induced dephasing that suppresses the coherent energy exchange (coupling) between photons and emitters. When the emitter lifetime exceeds a threshold, we observe the mesoscopic excitation level i.e., the system is pumped to high energy states whilst the coherent couplings between these states are not yet suppressed. The mesoscopic excitation enables the couplings between multi-emitter-photon states, and thereby, paves the way to building quantum photonic devices based on multiple photons and nonlinear effects.</description>

      <title>Switching spin filling sequence in a bilayer graphene quantum dot through trigonal warping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a switchable electron shell structure in a bilayer graphene quantum dot by manipulating the trigonal warping effect upon electrical gating. Under a small perpendicular electric field, the lowest s-shell is sequentially filled with two spin-up and two spin-down electrons of opposite valleys. When increasing the electric field, an additional three-fold minivalley degeneracy is generated so that the s-shell can be filled with 12 electrons with the first/last 6 electrons having the same spin polarization. The switched spin filling sequence demonstrates the possibility of using the trigonal warping effect to electrically access and manipulate the spin degree of freedom in bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Observation of magnetic skyrmion lattice in Cr$_{0.82}$Mn$_{0.18}$Ge by small-angle neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incommensurate magnetic phases in chiral cubic crystals are an established source of topological spin textures such as skyrmion and hedgehog lattices, with potential applications in spintronics and information storage. We report a comprehensive small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) study on the $B20$-type chiral magnet Cr$_{0.82}$Mn$_{0.18}$Ge, exploring its magnetic phase diagram and confirming the stabilization of a skyrmion lattice under low magnetic fields. Our results reveal a helical ground state with a decreasing pitch from 40 nm to 35 nm upon cooling, and a skyrmion phase stable in applied magnetic fields of 10-30 mT, and over an unusually wide temperature range for chiral magnets of 6 K ($\sim T_\textrm{C}/2 &lt; T &lt; T_\textrm{C}$, $T_\textrm{C}=13$ K). The skyrmion lattice forms a standard two-dimensional hexagonal coordination that can be trained into a single domain, distinguishing it from the three-dimensional hedgehog lattice observed in MnGe-based systems. Additionally, we demonstrate the persistence of a metastable SkL at 2 K, even at zero field. These findings advance our understanding of magnetic textures in Cr-based $B20$ compounds, highlighting Cr$_{0.82}$Mn$_{0.18}$Ge~as a promising material for further exploration in topological magnetism.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium effects in spin-torque oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the cornerstones of spintronics is the application of a spin-transfer torque to a nanomagnet, driving the magnetization of the nanomagnet into a steady-state precession and realizing a spin-torque oscillator. Such a steady state, sustained by a balance between driving and dissipation, could be a textbook example for a nonequilibrium situation. Nevertheless, most theoretical descriptions of spin-torque oscillators simply assume local equilibrium. Here, based on a simple model, we investigate the relevance of nonequilibrium effects in spin-torque oscillators. We use a nonequilibrium Keldysh description, which allows us to treat the effects of spin relaxation, and find that, in the absence of spin relaxation, persistent precessions of the magnetization are not allowed, if magnetic anisotropies are absent. However, introducing spin relaxation enables persistent precessions, where the strength of the spin relaxation has quantitative and qualitative effects on the magnetization dynamics. In the presence of magnetic anisotropy, we find that persistent precessions are allowed even if spin relaxation is absent, but spin relaxation causes a nonlinear relation between the oscillator power and the applied voltage bias. Finally, we consider an alternative spin relaxation mechanism and study the resulting magnetization precessions, highlighting the importance of understanding the exact nature of the relaxation in nanomagnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The directional coupler is a fundamental element of wave-based circuits. The state of the art for the spin-wave directional couplers consists mostly of macroscopic waveguides or two-dimensional planar systems. In this Letter, we present the design of the nanoscale spin-wave vertical directional coupler with a very high efficiency exceeding 99.5%. We demonstrate that the operation of the coupler can be controlled by the magnitude of the external magnetic field. Moreover, it can perform multiplexing and demultiplexing of the spin-wave signal. Such a device ought to become an essential element of the three-dimensional magnonic circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) present new possibilities for designing novel electronic devices. An efficient contacting scheme is required to take advantage of exceptional opto-electronic properties of TMDCs in future electronic devices. This is however challenging for TMDCs, mostly due to the typically high Schottky barrier formed between a metal and a semiconductor. Here we investigate different approaches for contacting MoS$_{2}$, utilizing both metallic gold and semimetallic bismuth as contact materials. The collected I-V characteristics of Bi-contacted devices are compared with the performance of traditional gold contacts. The method of AFM ironing, which we used to enhance the parameters of gold contacts, is also described. Additionally, we show preliminary results regarding an optical response for both types of samples.</description>

      <title>Micromagnetic formalism for magnetic multipoles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster magnetic multipoles are order parameters that describe the symmetry of spin arrangements in magnetic materials. High-order multipoles are particularly important in non-collinear antiferromagnets, where they determine key physical properties such as the anomalous Hall effect and the magneto-optical Kerr effect. Although non-uniform multipole states have been observed at the micrometer scale, their mesoscopic properties remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a general micromagnetic formalism for cluster magnetic multipoles, enabling the study of the spin dynamics in non-uniform multipole systems. As an example, we apply this formalism to investigate magnetic-octupole domain-wall dynamics in the non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn. Our results capture key features of domain-wall motion, including deformation and the emergence of effective inertial mass. This study provides a general framework for studying the dynamics of high-order cluster magnetic multipoles, which is essential for determining the mesoscopic physical properties of non-collinear magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Influence of carrier density and disorder on the Quantum Hall plateau widths in epitaxial graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its discovery, graphene has been one of the most prominent 2D materials due to its unique properties and broad range of possible applications. In particular, the half-integer Quantum Hall Effect (HI-QHE) characterized by the quantization of Hall resistivity as a function of applied magnetic field, offers opportunities for advancements in quantum metrology and the understanding of topological quantum states in this 2D material. While the role of disorder in stabilizing quantum Hall plateaus (QHPs) is widely recognized, the precise interplay between the plateaus width, disorder, mobility and carrier density remains less explored. In this work, we investigate the width of the $\nu=6$ QHP in epitaxial graphene Hall bars, focusing on two distinct regions of the device with markedly different electronic mobilities. Depending on the storage conditions, it is possible to modify the carrier density of graphene QHE devices and consequently increase or reduce the mobility. Our experiments reveal mobility variations of up to 200$\%$ from their initial value. In particular, the sample storage time and ambient conditions cause also noticeable changes in the positions and extension of the QHPs. Our results show that the QHP extension for $\nu=6$ differs significantly between the two regions, influenced by both mobility and disorder, rather than solely by carrier density. Transport simulations based on the Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism with Anderson disorder in a scaled model reveal the critical role of impurities in shaping graphene transport properties defining the extension of the QHPs. This study provides valuable insights into the interplay between mobility, disorder, and quantum transport in graphene systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study exciton quantum transfer along a molecular chain whilst accounting for the effects of permanent dipoles that are induced by charge displacements in the molecular orbitals. These effects are typically neglected as they do not arise in atomic quantum optics; however, they can play an important role in molecular systems. We also consider novel collective photon-assisted transport and compare it against the scaling of phonon-assisted transport in chains featuring permanent dipoles, and determine a linear scaling with the number of dipoles, akin to single-excitation superradiance. We further demonstrate how permanent dipoles, dipoles can preferentially arrange energy eigenstates to support excitation transport. Finally, we show how permanent dipoles can enhance the ability of the molecular chain to support excitation transport compared to that of systems that do not possess permanent dipoles across a range of environmental and system configurations.</description>

      <title>Probing electric field tunable multiband superconductivity in alternating twisted quadralayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alternating twisted multilayer graphene presents a compelling multiband system for exploring superconductivity. Here we investigate robust superconductivity in alternating twisted quadralayer graphene, elucidating carrier contributions from both flat and dispersive bands. The superconductivity is robust, with a strong electrical field tunability, a maximum BKT transition temperature of 1.6 K, and high critical magnetic fields beyond the Pauli limit. We disentangle the carrier density of Dirac bands and flat bands from the Landau fan diagram. Moreover, we could estimate the flatband Fermi velocity from the obtained high critical current near half filling when superconductivity is killed at finite magnetic fields, and further quantify the superfluid stiffness from the low critical current in the superconducting regime. Our results exhibit the electric field tunable coupling strength within the superconducting phase, revealing unconventional properties with vanishing Fermi velocity and large superfluid stiffness. These phenomena, attributed to substantial quantum metric contributions, offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying unconventional superconductivity in moire systems.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Induced Second-Order Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to the conventional (first-order) non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in a $d$-dimensional system with linear size $L$, the $n$th-order (higher-order) NHSE is characterized by skin modes localized at lower-dimensional boundaries of dimension $(d-n)$. The total number of these modes scales linearly with the system size $L$. Significant progress has been made in understanding higher-order NHSE in non-interacting systems. In this work, we demonstrate the many-body interaction induced second-order skin effect in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian bosonic system. Specifically, we construct a non-Hermitian square lattice that incorporates nonreciprocal single-boson hopping, onsite many-body interactions and two-boson pairing hopping. In the absence of interactions, no second-order NHSE is observed. However, with the inclusion of interactions, we identify interaction-induced skin modes for in-gap doublon states (i.e., bound pairs of bosons) localized at the corners of the lattice, while the bulk doublon states remain extended. These corner-localized skin modes arise from the interplay between interaction-induced edge states, localized along one-dimensional boundaries, and the nonreciprocal hopping along these boundaries. Furthermore, the number of corner skin modes scales linearly with the system size, confirming the presence of second-order NHSE in this interacting system. Our findings introduce a novel approach to realizing higher-order skin effects by leveraging interactions.</description>

      <title>Comparison of NiFeCr and NiFe in ferromagnetic Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic materials are under consideration for applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. Some memory applications rely on the ability to reverse the magnetization direction of a "soft" magnetic layer within the junction using a small local magnetic field generated on the chip. It is crucial, therefore, to find a suitable soft magnetic material with a low switching field and low switching energy. A popular magnetic material for such applications is Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$, also known as Permalloy, however Permalloy has a rather large magnetization, leading to large magnetic switching energies. In this work we explore Cr-doped Permalloy, specifically Ni$_{73}$Fe$_{18}$Cr$_{9}$, which has a saturation magnetization just under two-thirds that of Permalloy. Josephson junctions containing this NiFeCr alloy undergo a 0-$\pi$ transition at a NiFeCr thickness of 2.3 nm, and the critical supercurrent decays in the alloy over a short characteristic length of 0.36 nm. Switching fields of a few millitesla are promising, but the short decay length and overall small values of the critical current in the Josephson junctions may preclude the use of NiFeCr in current cryogenic memory technologies.</description>

      <title>On the origin of heating-induced stiffening and enthalpic reinforcement in elastomeric nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite a century of use, the mechanism of nanoparticle-driven mechanical reinforcement of elastomers is unresolved. A major hypothesis attributes it to glassy interparticle bridges, supported by an observed inversion of the variation of the modulus E(T) on heating -- from entropic stiffening in elastomers to enthalpic softening in nanocomposites. Here, molecular simulations reveal that this instead arises from a bulk-modulus mediated competition between elastomer and nanoparticulate networks over preferred nonequilibrium densities under deformation. A theory accounting for softening of the bulk modulus on heating quantitatively predicts the simulated E(T) inversion, suggesting that reinforcement is driven by a volume-competition mechanism unique to co-continuous systems of soft and rigid networks.</description>

      <title>Large Anomalous Hall Effect in a Noncoplanar Magnetic Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) occurs in magnetic systems and also unexpectedly in non-magnetic materials adjacent to magnetic insulators via the heterointerface interactions. However, the AHE in heterostructures induced by magnetic proximity effect remains quite weak, restricting their practical device applications. Here, we report a large intrinsic AHE with a resistivity of 142 n{\Omega} cm at 5 K in noncoplanar magnetic heterostructures of Cr5Te6/Pt. This is the record-high AHE value among all the magnetic insulators/heavy metal heterostructures. A reversal of the AHE signal occurs due to the reconstruction of Berry curvature at the Fermi surface, which is verified by the first-principles calculations. Topological spin textures at the interface are directly visualized via high-magnetic-field magnetic force microscopy, which accounts for the large AHE, as confirmed by the atomic simulations. These findings open a new avenue for exploring large anomalous Hall response in heterointerfaces and facilitate the potential applications in topological spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Revealing Point Group Symmetry of Rare-earth Dopants via Polarization-resolved Single-particle Microspectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The local point group symmetry of luminescent centers, such as defects, impurities, and dopant ions within a crystal, dictates their optical transition properties. While conventional low-temperature spectroscopy quantifies point group symmetry by enumerating the splitting of optical transitions, it fails to capture vectorial symmetry information, such as the orientation of symmetry axes. Here, we establish a quantitative link between point group symmetry, crystal symmetry, optical transition dipole orientation, and polarized luminescence in rare-earth-doped single-particle crystals using computational electromagnetism. Combined with room-temperature single-particle polarization spectroscopy, we resolve the magnetic dipole orientations from individual optical transition of dopant ions in single microcrystal, enabling precise identification of point group symmetry and its axes. We observe single-particle chirality arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking of intrinsically chiral space group during crystallization. Based on point group and crystal symmetries, we present a practical scheme to optical sensing the 3D orientation of rare-earth-doped single particles in dynamic environments by using two arbitrarily transition bands from single-view polarization spectra. Our computational electromagnetism framework not only elucidates polarized luminescence but also provides insights into optimizing dipole orientation-dependent energy transfer for designing ultra-bright rare-earth-doped nanocrystals, such as F\"orster resonance energy transfer, and can interpret enhanced linear polarization in extreme optical phenomena like stimulated emission, superradiance, and superfluorescence following dipole-coherent radiation in single emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase change materials are exploited in several enabling technologies such as storage class memories, neuromorphic devices and memories embedded in microcontrollers. A key functional property for these applications is the fast crystal nucleation and growth in the supercool liquid phase. Over the last decade, atomistic simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have provided crucial insights on the early stage of this process. These simulations are, however, restricted to a few hundred atoms for at most a few ns. More recently, the scope of the DFT simulations have been greatly extended by leveraging on machine learning techniques. In this paper, we show that the exploitation of a recently devised neural network potential for the prototypical phase change compound Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$, allows simulating the crystallization process in a multimillion atom model at the length and time scales of the real memory devices. The simulations provide a vivid atomistic picture of the subtle interplay between crystal nucleation and crystal growth from the crystal/amorphous rim. Moreover, the simulations have allowed quantifying the distribution of point defects controlling electronic transport, in a very large crystallite grown at the real conditions of the set process of the device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral densities encode essential information about system-environment interactions in open-quantum systems, playing a pivotal role in shaping the system's dynamics. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to reconstruct key environmental features, going beyond the weak-coupling regime by simulating the system's dynamics using the reaction coordinate mapping. For a dissipative spin-boson model with a structured spectral density expressed as a sum of Lorentzian peaks, we demonstrate that the time evolution of a system observable can be used by a neural network to classify the spectral density as comprising one, two, or three Lorentzian peaks and accurately predict their central frequency.</description>

      <title>Zero-temperature phase-flip rate in a biased parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07562v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A parametrically driven oscillator has two stable vibrational states at half the modulation frequency. The states have opposite phase and equal amplitudes. An extra drive at half the modulation frequency provides an effective bias that lifts the state symmetry. Quantum fluctuations lead to switching between the states, i.e., to phase-flip transitions. We develop a semiclassical approach that allows us to find the dependence of the switching rates on the amplitude of the bias and the parameters of the modulating field. We find that the rate of switching from a ''shallow'' state can become anomalously small at certain parameter values, leading to an efficient localization in this state. This is a consequence of the change of the topology of the oscillator phase trajectories. The results pave the way for implementing nonreciprocal quantum Ising systems based on parametric oscillators.</description>

      <title>A minimal model of inelastic tunneling of vibrating magnetic molecules on superconducting substrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10852v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient method of calculating the vibrational spectrum of a magnetic molecule adsorbed on a superconductor, directly related to the first derivative of the tunneling $IV$ curve. The work is motivated by a recent scanning-tunneling spectroscopy of lead phthalocyanine on superconducting Pb(100), showing a wealth of vibrational excitations, the number of which highly exceeds molecular vibrations typically encountered on normal metals. We design a minimal model which represents the inelastic transitions by the spectral function of a frontier orbital of the molecule in isolation. The model allows for an exact solution; otherwise the full correlated superconducting problem would be hard to treat. The model parameters are supplied from an ab-initio calculation, where the presence of the surface on the deformation of molecular geometry can be taken into account. The spectral function of the highest-occupied molecular orbital of the anionic PbPc$^{1-}$ shows the best agreement with the experimental reference among other molecular charge states and orbitals. The method allows to include multiple vibrational transitions straightforwardly.</description>

      <title>Giant High-order Nonlinear and Nonreciprocal Electrical Transports Induced by Valley Flipping in Bernal Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the electrical transport properties of the mini-valley polarized state proposed recently in slightly doped Bernal Bilayer Graphene (BLG) in large electric displacement fields. By minimizing the Hartree-Fock energy functional, we first confirm the appearance of mini-valley polarized phase. At the low carrier doping regime, the 1-pocket state will be stabilized where only one of the trigonal-wrapping-induced Fermi pockets near the atomic-valley center is filled. Then we study the electrical transport of the 1-pocket state by solving the Boltzmann equation. We find that the valley polarization could be easily flopped by an in-plane electrical field, which will lead to hysteresis loop in the direct current (DC) $I-V$ curves. Such irreversible current responses in the DC limit will directly induce strong nonlinear and nonreciprocal alternating current (AC) responses, which has been already observed in the recent experiments on BLG.</description>

      <title>Quadrupolar resonance spectroscopy of individual nuclei using a room-temperature quantum sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear quadrupolar resonance (NQR) spectroscopy reveals chemical bonding patterns in materials and molecules through the unique coupling between nuclear spins and local fields. However, traditional NQR techniques require macroscopic ensembles of nuclei to yield a detectable signal, which precludes the study of individual molecules and obscures molecule-to-molecule variations due to local perturbations or deformations. Optically active electronic spin qubits, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, facilitate the detection and control of individual nuclei through their local magnetic couplings. Here, we use NV centers to perform NQR spectroscopy on their associated nitrogen-14 ($^{14}$N) nuclei at room temperature. In mapping the nuclear quadrupolar Hamiltonian, we resolve minute variations between individual nuclei. The measurements further reveal correlations between the parameters in the NV center's electronic spin Hamiltonian and the $^{14}$N quadropolar Hamiltonian, as well as a previously unreported Hamiltonian term that results from symmetry breaking. We further design pulse sequences to initialize, readout, and control the quantum evolution of the $^{14}$N nuclear state using the nuclear quadrupolar Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Entangelment Entropy on Generalized Brillouin Zone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model from the perspective of the Generalized Brillouin Zone (GBZ). The non-Bloch entanglement entropy is defined on a quasi-reciprocal lattice, obtained by performing an ordinary Fourier transformation on the non-Bloch Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that the broken bulk-boundary correspondence is recovered in terms of the non-Bloch entanglement entropy. When the GBZ is circular, we show that the non-Bloch entanglement entropy is well-defined (real and positive-definite) in large parameter regions, except close to the exceptional points (EPs). In the critical region, we found that each Fermi point contributes precisely 1 to the central charge $c$ of the logarithmic scaling. At the EP, the central charge becomes negative due to the presence of the exceptional bound state. For the case of non-circular GBZ, long-range hopping emerges in the quasi-reciprocal lattice, and the von Neumann entropy on the GBZ is no longer real. However, the non-Bloch edge entanglement entropy remains real, which serves as a reliable topological indicator and respects the bulk-boundary correspondence. We compute the topological phase diagram, and reveal the critical behavior along the exceptional phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuation as an Observable for Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17023v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, is a powerful approach to understanding quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit a universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that, for generic lattice systems of interacting particles, the corner charge fluctuation is directly related to quantum geometry. We first provide a practical scheme to isolate the corner contribution on lattices, and analytically prove that its angle-dependence in the small-angle limit measures exclusively the integrated quantum metric. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically, while numerical verification for various Chern insulator models further demonstrate the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, for free fermions, we unveil an intimate connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</description>

      <title>Effects of heating strategies and ballistic transport on the transient thermal conduction in 3D FinFETs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently capturing the three-dimensional spatiotemporal distributions of temperature is of great significance for alleviating hotspot issues in 3D FinFETs. However, most previous thermal simulations mainly focused on the steady-state problem with continuous heating. Few studies are conducted for the transient thermal conduction in 3D FinFETs with non-continuous heating, which is actually closer to the reality. To investigate the effects of heating strategies on the transient micro/nano scale thermal conduction in 3D FinFETs, three heating strategies are considered, including `Continuous', `Intermittent' and `Alternating' heating. A comparison is made between the phonon BTE solutions and the data predicted by the macroscopic diffusion equation, where the effect of boundary scattering on phonon transport is added into the effective thermal conductivity. Numerical results show that it is not easy to accurately capture the heat conduction in 3D FinFETs by the macroscopic diffusion equation, especially near the hotspot areas where ballistic phonon transport dominates and the temperature diffusion is no longer valid. Different heating strategies have great influence on the peak temperature rise and transient thermal dissipation process. Compared to `Intermittent' or `Continuous' heating, the temperature variance of `Alternating' heating is smaller.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Coulomb liquid phase in few-electron droplets</title>

Abstract: Emergence of universal collective behaviour from interactions within a sufficiently large group of elementary constituents is a fundamental scientific paradigm. In physics, correlations in fluctuating microscopic observables can provide key information about collective states of matter such as deconfined quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions or expanding quantum degenerate gases. Mesoscopic colliders, through shot-noise measurements, have provided smoking-gun evidence on the nature of exotic electronic excitations such as fractional charges, levitons and anyon statistics. Yet, bridging the gap between two-particle collisions and the emergence of collectivity as the number of interacting particles increases remains a challenging task at the microscopic level. Here we demonstrate all-body correlations in the partitioning of electron droplets containing up to N = 5 electrons, driven by a moving potential well through a Y-junction in a semiconductor device. Analyzing the partitioning data using high-order multivariate cumulants and finite-size scaling towards the thermodynamic limit reveals distinctive fingerprints of a strongly-correlated Coulomb liquid. These fingerprints agree well with a universal limit where the partitioning of a droplet is predicted by a single collective variable. Our electron-droplet collider provides critical insight into the interplay of confinement and interaction effects in small electron systems and highlights a new way to study engineered states of matter.</description>

      <title>Topological orbital Hall effect caused by skyrmions and antiferromagnetic skyrmions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological Hall effect is a hallmark of topologically non-trivial magnetic textures such as magnetic skyrmions. It quantifies the transverse electric current that is generated once an electric field is applied and occurs as a consequence of the emergent magnetic field of the skyrmion. Likewise, an orbital magnetization is generated. Here we show that the charge currents are orbital polarized even though the conduction electrons couple to the skyrmion texture via their spin. The topological Hall effect is accompanied by a topological orbital Hall effect even for s electrons without spin-orbit coupling. As we show, antiferromagnetic skyrmions and antiferromagnetic bimerons that have a compensated emergent field, exhibit a topological orbital Hall conductivity that is not accompanied by charge transport and can be orders of magnitude larger than the topological spin Hall conductivity. Skyrmionic textures serve as generators of orbital currents that can transport information and give rise to considerable orbital torques.</description>

      <title>Thickness dependence of the mechanical properties of piezoelectric high-$Q_m$ nanomechanical resonators made from aluminium nitride</title>

Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators with high quality factors (\Qm{}) enable mechanics-based quantum technologies, in particular quantum sensing and quantum transduction. High-\Qm{} nanomechanical resonators in the kHz to MHz frequency range can be realized in tensile-strained thin films that allow the use of dissipation dilution techniques to drastically increase \Qm{}. In our work, we study the material properties of tensile-strained piezoelectric films made from aluminium nitride (AlN). We characterize crystalline AlN films with a thickness ranging from \SI{45}{\nano\meter} to \SI{295}{\nano\meter}, which are directly grown on Si(111) by metal-organic vapour-phase epitaxy. We report on the crystal quality and surface roughness, the piezoelectric response, and the residual and released stress of the AlN thin films. Importantly, we determine the intrinsic quality factor of the films at room temperature in high vacuum. We fabricate and characterize AlN nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution to enhance the intrinsic quality factor by utilizing the tensile strain in the film. We find that AlN nanomechanical resonators below \SI{200}{\nano\meter} thickness exhibit the highest \Qf{}-product, on the order of $10^{12}$\,Hz. We discuss possible strategies to optimize the material growth that should lead to devices that reach even higher \Qf{}-products. This will pave the way for future advancements of optoelectromechanical quantum devices made from tensile-strained piezoelectric AlN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 1T$^{\prime}$ phase of the monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides has recently attracted attention for its potential in nanoelectronic applications. This study proves the topological behavior of this material using spin texture, Berry curvature, and Hall conductivity using linear response theory. The spin texture in momentum space reveals a helical spin configuration with spin-momentum locking. Berry curvature distributions around the Dirac points highlight the influence of $\alpha$ parameter demonstrating a topological phase transition in 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$. For $\alpha&lt;1$ the spin-resolved Hall conductivity dominates, corresponding to a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase, while for $\alpha&gt;1$, valley-resolved Hall conductivity prevails, indicating a transition to a band insulator (BI) phase. Further analysis explores the spin-valley-resolved Hall conductivity and Chern numbers across varying values of $\alpha$, $V$, and Fermi energy, uncovering regions of trivial topological phases (TTP) and the role of the edge modes. Finally, the Nernst coefficients (spin, valley, and total) are investigated at room temperature, revealing significant spin and valley-dependent transport properties. The zero total Nernst coefficient across energy ranges suggests strong cancellation between spin and valley contributions, providing insights into the material's potential for thermoelectric applications and spintronic devices</description>

Abstract: By analyzing the spin-group symmetry of magnons, we establish two generalized Onsager's relations in the magnon Hall effect, which reveals the rich and complicated structures of the magnon Berry curvature in the parameter space of different types of the exchange coupling. As an important consequence, we find that the isotropic exchange coupling is equally important as the DzyaloshinskiiMoriya (DM) interaction in determining the magnon Hall effect, and it can transform to the latter under proper gauge transformation. Moreover, the diagonal and off-diagonal part of the symmetric anisotropic exchange coupling together can support the magnon Hall effect without the DM interaction. Both features are exemplified in ferromagnetic honeycomb lattices. Our work lays the ground for decoding the coupling between magnon transport and different types of exchange interactions.</description>

Abstract: Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which support flat Chern bands with enhanced interaction effects, realize a platform for fractional Chern insulators and fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) insulators. A recent experiment has reported the emergence of a FQSH insulator protected by spin-Sz conservation at a moir\'e lattice filling factor {\nu}=3 in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2. Theoretical studies have proposed both time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric ground states as possible candidates for the observed FQSH insulator, but the nature of the state remains unexplored. Here we report the observation of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at generic fillings in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2 from {\nu}&lt;1 all the way to {\nu}&gt;6 except at {\nu}=2, 4, and 6. Although zero Hall response is observed at {\nu}=3 for magnetic fields higher than 20 mT, a finite anomalous Hall response accompanied by a magnetic hysteresis is observed at lower magnetic fields, demonstrating spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our work shows the tendency towards ferromagnetism by doping the first three pairs of conjugate Chern bands in the material; it also sheds light on the nature of the FQSH insulator at {\nu}=3.</description>

Abstract: A general principle of condensed matter physics prohibits the electric current in equilibrium. This prevents a zero-resistance state realized solely under a finite electric current, namely unidirectional superconductivity. In this paper, we propose a setup to realize the unidirectional superconductivity as a nonequilibrium steady state. We focus on the in-plane transport of atomically thin bilayer superconductors lacking the in-plane inversion symmetry and introduce dissipation by applying the out-of-plane electric field and current. By analyzing the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations, we show that locally stable steady-state solutions appear only under the in-plane supercurrent when the out-of-plane electric field exceeds a threshold value. Our system also realizes the dissipation-induced superconducting diode effect up to 100% efficiency by purely electric means.</description>

Abstract: We show that topological flat minibands can be engineered in a class of narrow gap semiconductor films using only an external electrostatic superlattice potential. We demonstrate that, for realistic material parameters, these bands are capable of hosting correlated topological phases such as integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states and composite Fermi liquid phases at zero magnetic field. Our results provide a path towards the realization of fractionalized topological states in a broad range of materials.</description>

      <title>Automation of Quantum Dot Measurement Analysis via Explainable Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: The rapid development of quantum dot (QD) devices for quantum computing has necessitated more efficient and automated methods for device characterization and tuning. This work demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of applying explainable machine learning techniques to the analysis of quantum dot measurements, paving the way for further advances in automated and transparent QD device tuning. Many of the measurements acquired during the tuning process come in the form of images that need to be properly analyzed to guide the subsequent tuning steps. By design, features present in such images capture certain behaviors or states of the measured QD devices. When considered carefully, such features can aid the control and calibration of QD devices. An important example of such images are so-called $\textit{triangle plots}$, which visually represent current flow and reveal characteristics important for QD device calibration. While image-based classification tools, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be used to verify whether a given measurement is $\textit{good}$ and thus warrants the initiation of the next phase of tuning, they do not provide any insights into how the device should be adjusted in the case of $\textit{bad}$ images. This is because CNNs sacrifice prediction and model intelligibility for high accuracy. To ameliorate this trade-off, a recent study introduced an image vectorization approach that relies on the Gabor wavelet transform (Schug $\textit{et al.}$ 2024 $\textit{Proc. XAI4Sci: Explainable Machine Learning for Sciences Workshop (AAAI 2024) (Vancouver, Canada)}$ pp 1-6). Here we propose an alternative vectorization method that involves mathematical modeling of synthetic triangles to mimic the experimental data. Using explainable boosting machines, we show that this new method offers superior explainability of model prediction without sacrificing accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Initializing the ground state of a quantum bit (qubit) based on Majorana zero modes is one of the most pressing issues for future topological quantum computers. We explore a protocol for initializing such topological qubits based on magnet-superconductor hybrid networks by coupling magnetic chains to a single molecule magnet. The parity of the Majorana state is converted to the presence or absence of a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state at the molecule. The coupling can be activated by switching the spin state of the molecule, allowing the ground-state parity of the chain to be controlled. We demonstrate that initialization with either parity for a Majorana qubit can be achieved. We then introduce the augmented Majorana qubit, which includes the state of the molecule in the definition of the logical qubit. Using this definition we can initialize a qubit without high-precision timing.</description>

      <title>InAs on Insulator: A New Platform for Cryogenic Hybrid Superconducting Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits based on hybrid InAs Josephson Junctions (JJs) play a starring role in the design of fast and ultra-low power consumption solid-state quantum electronics and exploring novel physical phenomena. Conventionally, 3D substrates, 2D quantum wells (QWs), and 1D nanowires (NWs) made of InAs are employed to create superconducting circuits with hybrid JJs. Each platform has its advantages and disadvantages. Here, we proposed the InAs-on-insulator (InAsOI) as a groundbreaking platform for developing superconducting electronics. An epilayer of semiconducting InAs with different electron densities was grown onto an InAlAs metamorphic buffer layer, efficiently used as a cryogenic insulator to decouple adjacent devices electrically. JJs with various lengths and widths were fabricated employing Al as a superconductor and InAs with different electron densities. We achieved a switching current density of 7.3 uA/um, a critical voltage of 50-to-80 uV, and a critical temperature equal to that of the superconductor used. For all the JJs, the switching current follows a characteristic Fraunhofer pattern with an out-of-plane magnetic field. These achievements enable the use of InAsOI to design and fabricate surface-exposed Josephson Field Effect Transistors with high critical current densities and superior gating properties.</description>

      <title>Correlation stabilized anomalous Hall crystal in bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When the charge density is sufficiently low, interacting two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) would undergo a phase transition from homogeneous Fermi liquid to an electronic crystal state, known as Wigner crystal. Besides conventional 2DEG, various topological fermionic excitations may also be realized in 2D materials. For example, ``high-order" Dirac fermions exhibiting nontrivial Berry phases may approximately characterize the low-energy excitations in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG). In this work, we develop a beyond-mean-field theoretical framework to study the interacting ground states and single-particle excitations in slightly charge-doped RMG under vertical electric field. We find that transitions from Fermi liquid to trivial Wigner-crystal states would occur at critical carrier density $\sim 10^{10}\,\textrm{cm}^{-2}$ for all $n$-layer RMG (with $n=2, 3, 4, 5, 6$) which are approximately described by $n$-order Dirac-fermion models. Most saliently, using a more realistic modeling of bilayer graphene including trigonal warping effects, we find that an anomalous Hall crystal state with spontaneous quantized anomalous Hall conductivity would emerge when the carrier density is below $\sim 1\times 10^{11}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$, and it becomes the unique ground state over trivial Wigner crystal when the density is further lower. Counter intuitively, such topological anomalous Hall crystal becomes more stable than the trivial Wigner crystal due to the lower correlation energy gained from dynamical charge fluctuations, which is beyond mean-field description. Our work suggests that slightly carrier-doped bilayer graphene is one of the most promising candidates to realize anomalous Hall crystal. Moreover, the method developed in this work can be readily applied to other interacting 2D systems including moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic favourability of 1T phase over 1H phase in group III metal monochalcogenide zigzag nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Owing to the promising optoelectric and thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) group III-VI materials (MXs), their nanoribbons (NRs) have attracted notable attention as an emerging class of quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) nanostructures. Due to the fact that the most stable 2D monolayer polymorph of MXs is the 1H phase, to date, existing studies in the literature have predominantly focused on the NRs formed from 1H phase MXs. Nevertheless, NRs of the 1T phase have received little to no attention. Employing ab initio simulations based on density functional theory, we systematically compared the thermodynamic stability of hydrogen passivated and unpassivated 1T and 1H ZNRs of GaS, GaSe, and InSe. Our results reveal that 1T phase MX ZNRs are thermodynamically favorable at widths up to 34 nm, a range that is realizable through contemporary experimental fabrication techniques. Furthermore, unlike metallic 1H ZNRs, 1T ZNRs remain semiconductor and retain a Mexican-hat-shaped top valence band without any built-in potential between the edges. Complementarily, hydrogenation energies of 1T InSe ZNRs are positive, and due to the edge-localized states, the 1T unpassivated ZNRs possess nearly flat top valence bands. Our findings serve as a compass for subsequent synthesis pathways of group III-VI NRs.</description>

      <title>Striped Spin Density Wave in a Graphene/Black Phosphorous Heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A bilayer formed by stacking two distinct materials creates a moir\'e lattice, which can serve as a platform for novel electronic phases. In this work we study a unique example of such a system: the graphene-black phosphorus heterostructure (G/BP), which has been suggested to have an intricate band structure. Most notably, the valence band hosts a quasi-one-dimensional region in the Brillouin zone of high density of states, suggesting that various many-body electronic phases are likely to emerge. We derive an effective tight-binding model that reproduces this band structure, and explore the emergent broken-symmetry phases when interactions are introduced. Employing a mean-field analysis, we find that the favored ground-state exhibits a striped spin density wave (SDW) order, characterized by either one of two-fold degenerate wave-vectors that are tunable by gating. Further exploring the phase-diagram controlled by gate voltage and the interaction strength, we find that the SDW-ordered state undergoes a metal to insulator transition via an intermediate metallic phase which supports striped SDW correlations. Possible experimental signatures are discussed, in particular a highly anisotropic dispersion of the collective excitations which should be manifested in electric and thermal transport.</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier-phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring a specific hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05055).</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. II. Numerically exact quantum dynamics in the slow-phonon regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05054), we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side after a couple of phonon periods. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum-classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamic Theory of Proximity Ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proximity ferroelectricity has recently been reported as a new design paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a non-ferroelectric polar material becomes a ferroelectric by interfacing with a thin ferroelectric layer. Strongly polar materials, such as AlN and ZnO, which were previously unswitchable with an external field below their dielectric breakdown fields, can now be switched with practical coercive fields when they are in intimate proximity to a switchable ferroelectric. Here, we develop a general Landau-Ginzburg theory of proximity ferroelectricity in multilayers of non-ferroelectrics and ferroelectrics to analyze their switchability and coercive fields. The theory predicts regimes of both "proximity switching" where the multilayers collectively switch, as well as "proximity suppression" where they collectively do not switch. The mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity is an internal electric field determined by the polarization of the layers and their relative thickness in a self-consistent manner that renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier. Further reduction in the coercive field emerges from charged defects in the bulk that act as nucleation centers. The application of the theory to proximity ferroelectricity in Alx-1ScxN/AlN and Zn1-xMgxO/ZnO bilayers is demonstrated. The theory further predicts that multilayers of dielectric/ferroelectric and paraelectric/ferroelectric layers can potentially result in induced ferroelectricity in the dielectric or paraelectric layers, resulting in the entire stack being switched, an exciting avenue for new discoveries. This thawing of "frozen ferroelectrics", paraelectrics and potentially dielectrics, promises a large class of new ferroelectrics with exciting prospects for previously unrealizable domain-patterned optoelectronic and memory technologies.</description>
