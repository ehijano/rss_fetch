      <title>Spin order, spin excitations, and RIXS spectra of spin-1/2 tetramer chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spin dynamics of a 1D spin-1/2 Heisenberg tetramer chain. Employing a combination of Density Matrix Renormalization Group, quantum renormalization group, and perturbation theory techniques, we compute the energy levels and the quantum phase diagram, analyze the phase transitions, and evaluate the $L$ and $K$ -edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectrum of fractionalized and collective (single and multi-particle) excitations. Our calculations suggest that the chain can transition between a hidden $Z_2\times Z_2$ discrete symmetry preserving tetramer phase and a Haldane phase with non-vanishing string order that breaks the hidden symmetry. These two gapped phases are intervened by an intermediate deconfined quantum critical state comprising of free spins and three-site doublets, which is a gapless critical phase with deconfined spinons. We find that the tetramer chain can support fractionalized (spinon) and collective (triplon and quinton) excitations. In the ferromagnetic intra-tetramer limit, the chain can support a quinton excitation which has a five-fold degenerate excited state. String order parameter calculations suggest CuInVO$_5$ to be in a Haldane-like phase whose $L$ -edge RIXS spectrum can support observable triplon and quinton excitations. We also identify possible two-particle excitations (two-singlon, two-triplon, triplon-quinton, and two-quinton excitations) resulting from the double spin-flip effect in the $K$ -edge RIXS spectrum.</description>

      <title>Antiferro octupolar order in the 5d$^1$ double perovskite Sr$_2$MgReO$_6$ and its spectroscopic signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Hidden"-order phases with high-rank multipolar order parameters have been recently detected in several cubic double perovskites of 5$d$ transition metals. Here, by constructing and solving an ab initio low-energy Hamiltonian, we show that an antiferroic order of magnetic octupoles also forms in the tetragonal 5d$^1$ double perovskite Sr$_2$MgReO$_6$. The low-temperature order in this material is determined by a tetragonal crystal field dominating over exchange interactions. This results in a well isolated crystal-field doublet ground state hosting octupolar low-energy degrees of freedom. Very weak dipole moments entangled with the primary octupole order parameters are induced by admixture of the excited $j1/2$ spin-orbit multiplet. We show that the octupolar order leads to characteristic quasi-gapless magnetic excitation spectra as well as to the intensity of superstructural neutron diffraction reflexes peaking at large scattering momenta.</description>

      <title>$\textit{PY-BerryAHC}$: An $\textit{ab-initio}$ python 3 code to calculate Berry Curvature dependent Anomalous Hall Conductivity in any material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in materials has long been a topic of debate. Studies reveal that AHC originates from the Berry curvature ($\boldsymbol\Omega$) of Bloch states. Accurate computation of AHC is crucial for predicting material properties and guiding experimental studies in topological and spintronic applications. Traditional approaches often rely on wannier interpolation, which can introduce inaccuracies and computational overhead. Also, reliability of the wannierization technique becomes questionable when the bands are highly entangled and dispersive. This demands the calculation of AHC using the $\textit{first-principle}$ approach. Here, we present $\textit{PY-BerryAHC}$, a Python 3 based code that directly computes $\boldsymbol\Omega$ and AHC using WIEN2k output. Since, WIEN2k employs an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method, $\textit{PY-BerryAHC}$ provides highly accurate AHC results. The code efficiently handles large $\textbf{k}$-grids by parallelizing $\boldsymbol\Omega$ computations over $\textbf{k}$-points. Also, it stores band-resolved $\boldsymbol\Omega$ in a binary file, thereby greatly reducing the required storage memory and allowing fast post-processing to compute AHC. $\textit{PY-BerryAHC}$ has been validated on well-known materials exhibiting AHC. These include- Fe, Fe$_3$Ge &amp; Co$_2$FeAl. At 300 K, the calculated magnitude of $\sigma_{xy}$ for Fe &amp; Fe$_3$Ge is found to be 744 $S/cm$ &amp; 311 $S/cm$, respectively. For Co$_2$FeAl, the magnitude of $\sigma_{xy}$ is obtained to be $\sim$56 $S/cm$ and is found to be constant with the change in temperature from 0-300 K. These results are in good agreement with previously reported theoretical and experimental data. This ensures the accuracy, reliability and efficiency of the code. The code is also provided with a post-processing tool to visualize $\boldsymbol\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Chemical Pressure Tuning of Multipolar and Magnetic Orders in Ba$_2$(Cd$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$)ReO$_6$ Double Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double perovskite compounds containing 5d transition metal elements have been extensively studied as platforms for multipolar order phenomena stemming from spin-orbit-entangled 5d electrons. In this study, we examine the interplay between crystal structure, multipolar order, and magnetic order in solid solutions of double perovskites with the 5d1 electronic configuration: Ba2CdReO6 and Ba2CaReO6, which exhibit distinct electronic orders. The substitution of larger Ca2+ ions for Cd2+ in Ba2CdReO6, systematically increases the lattice constant with increasing the amount of substitution x. Although the spin-orbit-entangled J = 3/2 state remains intact upon substitution, both the quadrupolar order below Tq = 25 K and the canted antiferro-magnetic (AFM) order below Tm = 12 K in Ba2CdReO6 are progressively suppressed as x increases. Magnetization measurements reveal that the canted AFM order is suppressed at x = 0.6, transitioning to a colinear AFM order, while the quadrupolar order persists up to x = 0.9. The experimental electronic phase diagram, summarizing the dependence of electronic orders on lattice constants, aligns well with the theoretical phase diagram considering electric quadrupolar interactions [G. Chen et al., Phys. Rev. B 82, 174440 (2010)]. This correspondence confirms that chemical pressure induced by substitution effectively tunes the interaction between 5d electrons. The results highlight the potential of chemical pressure to modulate multipolar interactions, paving the way for novel multipolar properties in 5d electron systems.</description>

      <title>Universality of the topological phase transition in the interacting Haldane model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Haldane model is a standard tight-binding model describing electrons hopping on a hexagonal lattice subject to a transverse, dipolar magnetic field. We consider its interacting version for values of the interaction strength that are small compared to the bandwidth. We study the critical case at the transition between the trivial and the `topological' insulating phases, and we rigorously establish that the transverse conductivity on the dressed critical line is quantized at a half-integer multiple of $e^2/h$: this is the average of the integer values of the Hall conductivity in the insulating phases on either side of the dressed critical line. Together with previous results, this fully characterizes the nature of the phase transition between different Hall plateaus and proves its universality with respect to many-body interactions. The proof is based on a combination of constructive renormalization group methods and exact lattice Ward identities.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phases of Higher Dimensional Floquet CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical phases of Floquet Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) in space-time dimensions greater than two. Building upon our previous work [1] which introduced quaternionic representations for studying Floquet dynamics in higher-dimensional CFTs, we now explore more general square pulse drive protocols that go beyond a single SU(1,1) subgroup. We demonstrate that, for multi-step drive protocols, the system exhibits distinct dynamical phases characterized by the nature of the eigenvalues of the quaternionic matrix representing time evolution in a single cycle, leading to different stroboscopic responses. Our analysis establishes a fundamental geometric interpretation where these dynamical phases directly correspond to the presence or absence of Killing horizons in the base space of the CFT and in a higher dimensional AdS space on which a putative dual lives. The heating phase is associated with a non-extremal horizon, the critical phase with an extremal horizon which disappears in the non heating phase. We develop perturbative approaches to compute the Floquet Hamiltonians in different regimes and show, how tuning drive parameters can lead to horizons, providing a geometric framework for understanding heating phenomena in driven conformal systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Generation of Higher-order Spin-Orbit Couplings, Topology and Persistent Spin Texture in Light-Irradiated Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets have been identified as the third category of magnetic materials, exhibiting momentum-dependent spin splitting characterized by even powers of momentum. In this study, we show that when subjected to elliptically polarized light, these materials serve as an exemplary framework for the dynamic generation of topological bands featuring higher-order spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Notably, while the generated Zeeman field remains invariant to the particular altermagnetic ordering, the induced higher-order SOCs are related to the magnitude and symmetry of the altermagnetic order. Specifically, we show that an altermagnet exhibiting $k^n$-spin splitting can generate spin-orbit couplings up to $k^{n-1}$. In the limit of circularly polarized light, the only correction is $k^{n-1}$, with all lower-order contributions being nullified. Interestingly, light-induced SOCs significantly impact the low-energy band topology, where their Chern numbers change by $\Delta C =\pm 1,2,3$ for $d,g,f$-wave altermagnets. Finally, we find a critical field in which a persistent spin texture is realized, a highly desirable state with predicted infinite spin lifetime. Our work showcases light as a powerful, controllable tool for engineering complex and exciting phenomena in altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Bose ladder with extended range density-density interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When hard-core bosons on a two-leg ladder get frustrated by ring exchange interactions, the elusive d-wave Bose liquid (DBL) can be stabilized, a bosonic analog of a correlated metal. Here, we analyze the effect of extended Hubbard interactions on the DBL phase. Strikingly, these interactions are found to act in favor of the exotic Bose liquid. This observation is of immediate relevance for physical systems in which non-local exchange processes occur as a consequence of extended-range density-density interactions. Our observation also helps to achieve DBL physics in a synthetic-dimension ladder, where on-site interactions translate into non-local interactions along a synthetic rung. In this context, we also consider the extreme limit, in which the local hardcore constraint is elevated to an effective rung blockade. In addition to the enhancement of DBL physics due to extended-range density-density interactions, we also find signatures of an interesting intermediate phase between the superfluid and the DBL regime. This phase, labeled as the density modulated s-wave paired (DMSP) phase, combines features of density wave and s-wave pairing. Our results offer new insights into the physics of frustrated bosons by highlighting the influence of density-density interaction and rung-blockade.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Driven Transition of Particles from Dispersive to Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) play a crucial role in condensed matter physics, offering an ideal platform to study strong correlation effects and enabling applications in diffraction-free photonics and quantum devices. However, the study and application of FB properties are susceptible to interference from dispersive bands. Here, we explore the impact of bond dissipation on systems hosting both flat and dispersive bands by calculating the steady-state density matrix. We demonstrate that bond dissipation can drive particles from dispersive bands into FBs and establish the general conditions for this phenomenon to occur. Our results demonstrate that dissipation can facilitate FB preparation, property measurement, and utilization. This opens a new avenue for exploring FB physics in open quantum systems, with potential implications for strongly correlated physics.</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization, Matrix Product States and Conformal Perturbation Theory Study of a 3D Ising Fuzzy Sphere Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical studies of phase transitions in statistical and quantum lattice models provide crucial insights into the corresponding Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). In higher dimensions, comparing finite-volume numerical results to infinite-volume CFT data is facilitated by choosing the sphere $S^{d-1}$ as the spatial manifold. Recently, the fuzzy sphere regulator in Ref. [Zhu et al, Phys. Rev. X 13 021009 (2023)] has enabled such studies with exact rotational invariance, yielding impressive agreement with known 3D Ising CFT predictions, as well as new results. However, systematic improvements and a deeper understanding of finite-size corrections remain essential. In this work, we revisit the fuzzy sphere regulator, focusing on the original Ising model, with two main goals. First, we assess the robustness of this approach using Conformal Perturbation Theory (CPT), to which we provide a detailed guidebook. We demonstrate how CPT provides a unified framework for determining the critical point, the speed of light, and residual deviations from CFT predictions. Applying this framework, we study finite-size corrections and clarify the role of tuning the model in minimizing these effects. Second, we develop a novel method for extracting Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients from fuzzy sphere data. This method leverages the sensitivity of energy levels to detuning from criticality, providing new insights into level mixing and avoided crossings in finite systems. Our work also includes validation of CPT in a 1+1D Ising model away from the integrable limit.</description>

      <title>Density Matrix Renormalization Group study of superconducting pairing near the quarter-filled Wigner crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charge ordering is often found in the phase diagram of unconventional superconductors in close proximity to the superconducting state. This has led to the suggestion that fluctuations of charge order can mediate superconducting pairing. While several mechanisms can lead to charge order, one common mechanism is the long-range Coulomb interaction, resulting in a Wigner crystal charge ordered state. For an electron density of 0.5 per site we investigate the extended Hubbard model on the two-dimensional square lattice using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods. Our results show that the strength of pairing decreases with the nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction strength $V$ and remains weaker than the tendency of pairing for non-interacting electrons.</description>

Abstract: The phase diagram of the $S\!=\!1/2$ easy-axis triangular-lattice $J_1\!-\!J_2$ model is investigated using the density-matrix renormalization group and analytical insights. We find a significant spin-liquid region extending from the Heisenberg limit and residing between the Y phase-known as the magnetic analogue of the "supersolid"-and collinear stripe phase. The order parameters of the supersolid are analyzed and an understanding of its lack of ferromagnetic moment is suggested.</description>

      <title>Axionic quantum criticality of generalized Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a field-theoretic description for $d$-dimensional interacting nodal semimetals, featuring dispersion that scales with the linear and $n$th power of momentum along $d_L$ and $d_M$ mutually orthogonal directions around a few isolated points in the reciprocal space, respectively, with $d_L+d_M=d$, and residing at the brink of isotropic insulation, described by $N_b$-component bosonic order parameter fields. The resulting renormalization group (RG) procedure, tailored to capture the associated quantum critical phenomena, is controlled by a ``small" parameter $\epsilon=2-d_M$ and $1/N_f$, where $N_f$ is the number of identical fermion copies (flavor number) when in conjunction $d_L=1$. When applied to three-dimensional interacting general Weyl semimetals ($d_L=1$ and $d_M=2$), characterized by the Abelian monopole charge $n&gt;1$, living at the shore of the axionic insulation ($N_b=2$), a leading-order RG analysis suggests the Gaussian nature of the underlying quantum phase transition, around which the critical exponents assume mean-field values. A traditional field-theoretic RG analysis yields the same outcomes for simple Weyl semimetals ($n=1$, $d_L=3$, and $d_M=0$). Consequently, emergent marginal Fermi liquids showcase only logarithmic corrections to physical observables at intermediate scales of measurements.</description>

      <title>FuzzifiED : Julia package for numerics on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Julia package FuzzifiED aims at simplifying the numerical calculations on the fuzzy sphere. It supports exact diagonalisation (ED) and density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) calculations. FuzzifiED can also apply to generic fermionic and bosonic models. This documentation provides a review of the fuzzy sphere regularisation and an instruction for using FuzzifiED for numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrating a Black Hole with Inhomogeneous Quantum Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum quench processes in (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) in which the initial thermal equilibrium (Gibbs) state is time-evolved by spatially inhomogeneous Hamiltonians, the so-called M\"obius and sine-square-deformed (SSD) Hamiltonians. We found that, when the quench is induced by the SSD Hamiltonian, almost all the degrees of freedom are asymptotically gathered at a single point, resulting in a point-like excitation. This excitation, which we dub black hole-like excitation, carries as much information as the total thermal entropy. In contrast, other parts of the system approach the low-entropy (low-temperature) state at late times. For the quench by the M\"obius Hamiltonian, we instead found an eternal periodic oscillation of physical quantities such as von Neumann entropy for subsystems. When the CFT admits a holographic dual description, the SSD quench induces a time-dependent, inhomogeneous deformation of the bulk black hole horizon, which, at late enough times, ``touches'' the boundary. Our quench setups can be used as a way to create low-temperature states, and, also, simulate the formation and evaporation processes of black holes.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Induced Bistability of Fermionic Atoms Coupled to a Dissipative Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the steady state phase diagram of fermionic atoms subjected to an optical lattice and coupled to a high finesse optical cavity with photon losses. The coupling between the atoms and the cavity field is induced by a transverse pump beam. Taking fluctuations around the mean-field solutions into account, we find that a transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths two self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a bistability. We show that the bistable behavior is induced by the atoms-cavity fluctuations and is not captured by the mean-field approach.</description>

      <title>The boundary entropy function for interface conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05381v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: {In 1+1 dimensional conformal field theory with a boundary the boundary contribution to the entanglement entropy is determined by a single number $g$ effectively counting the boundary degrees of freedom. In contrast, in 1+1 dimensional interface CFTs the corresponding quantity is a non-trivial {\it function} depending on the position of the interval relative to the interface, giving access to much more detailed information about the defect. In this work we determined this $g$-function in several examples using holography and derive some of its basic properties from holography and strong subadditivity.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo study on Heisenberg model with local dipolar interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aharony and Fisher showed that non-local dipolar effects in magnetism destabilize the Heisenberg fixed point in real ferromagnets, leading to a new fixed point, called the dipolar fixed point. The non-perturbative nature of the new fixed point, however, has not been uncovered for many decades. Inspired by the recent understanding that the dipolar fixed point is scale-invariant but not conformal invariant, we perform the Monte Carlo simulation of the local Heisenberg-dipolar model on the lattice of $40^3$ by introducing the local cost function parameterized by a parameter $\lambda$ and study its critical exponents, which should become identical to the dipolar fixed point of Aharony and Fisher in the infinite coupling limit $\lambda = \infty$. We find that the critical exponents become noticeably different from those of the Heisenberg fixed point for a finite coupling constant $\lambda=8$ (e.g. $\nu=0.601(2)(^{+0}_{-2})$ in the local Heisenberg-dipolar model while $\nu=0.712(1)(^{+3}_{-0})$ in the Heisenberg model), and the spin correlation function has a feature that it becomes divergence-free, implying the lack of conformal invariance.</description>
