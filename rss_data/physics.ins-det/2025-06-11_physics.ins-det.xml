      <title>Design, development and commissioning of a new towing tank at the University of Southampton: A decade of endeavour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The University of Southampton in the United Kingdom is worldly renowned in the naval architecture domain. For several decades, the researchers in hydrodynamics have been discussing the need of a middle-sized towing tank to accommodate the teaching, research and commercial experiments that previously had to be outsourced. In the early 2010s, the renovation of the Boldrewood campus was decided and opened the way for the construction of this 138 m long, 6 m wide and 3.5 m deep facility. Commissioned in 2022, the tank is equipped with a 12 independent paddles wavemaker and an innovative carriage capable of speeds of up to 10 m/s. The design, construction and commissioning of the experimental facility were subject to many hurdles and delays that are described here. Details about the technical solutions and chosen equipment are provided. Validation experiments are also described.</description>

      <title>Observation of a low energy nuclear recoil peak in the neutron calibration data of an Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ crystal in CRESST-III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current generation of cryogenic solid state detectors used in direct dark matter and CE\textnu NS searches typically reach energy thresholds of $\mathcal{O}$(10)$\,$eV for nuclear recoils. For a reliable calibration in this energy regime a method has been proposed, providing mono-energetic nuclear recoils at low energies $\sim\,$100$\,$eV$\,$-$\,$1$\,$keV. In this work we report on the observation of a peak at (1113.6$^{+6.5}_{-6.5}$)$\,$eV in the data of an Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ crystal in CRESST-III, which was irradiated with neutrons from an AmBe calibration source. We attribute this mono-energetic peak to the radiative capture of thermal neutrons on $^{27}$Al and the subsequent de-excitation via single $\gamma$-emission. We compare the measured results with the outcome of Geant4 simulations and investigate the possibility to make use of this effect for the energy calibration of Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ detectors at low energies. We further investigate the possibility of a shift in the expected energy scale of this effect caused by the creation of defects in the target crystal.</description>

      <title>Optimization of target film materials and protective coatings for sealed neutron generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnesium target film has better thermal stability and neutron yield than titanium target, making it a potential neutron generator target film material. The radiation resistance of elemental magnesium targets is relatively weak, and their radiation resistance can be improved by alloying magnesium target films. The irradiation damage of pure magnesium targets and magnesium alloy target films was studied using SRIM. The results indicate that the irradiation damage of magnesium alloy target films (magnesium-niobium, magnesium-zirconium alloys) is lower than that of pure magnesium targets. In addition, under the same alloy ratio, the radiation resistance of magnesium-niobium alloy target film is better than that of magnesium-zirconium alloy. In order to further in-vestigate the performance of magnesium alloy target films, the incident ion energy, protective coatings (nickel oxide, aluminum oxide, palladium oxide), magnesium alloy target films, and alloy doping ratios (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0) were changed. After calculating the effects of the above conditions on the neutron generator yield, sputtering yield, and considering irradiation damage, it was determined that a magnesium-zirconium alloy with a doping rate of 0.2 and a nickel oxide protective coating with a thickness of 7.5 nm are potential target film materials for the neutron generator.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic systems for the TUCAN EDM experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TUCAN (TRIUMF UltraCold Advanced Neutron) Collaboration is completing a new ultracold neutron (UCN) source. The UCN source will deliver UCNs to a neutron electric dipole moment (EDM) experiment. The EDM experiment is projected to be capable of an uncertainty of $1\times 10^{-27}~e$cm, competitive with other planned projects, and a factor of ten more precise than the present world's best. The TUCAN source is based on a UCN production volume of superfluid helium (He-II), held at 1~K, and coupled to a proton-driven spallation target. The production rate in the source is expected to be in excess of $10^7$~UCN/s; since UCN losses can be small in superfluid helium, this should allow us to build up a large number of UCNs. The spallation-driven superfluid helium technology is the principal aspect making the TUCAN project unique. The superfluid production volume was recently cooled, for the first time, and successfully filled with superfluid helium. The design principles of the UCN source are described, along with some of the challenging cryogenic milestones that were recently passed.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for the Cluster Reconstruction in the CALIFA Calorimeter at R3B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The R3B experiment at FAIR studies nuclear reactions using high-energy radioactive beams. One key detector in R3B is the CALIFA calorimeter consisting of 2544 CsI(Tl) scintillator crystals designed to detect light charged particles and gamma rays with an energy resolution in the per cent range after Doppler correction. Precise cluster reconstruction from sparse hit patterns is a crucial requirement. Standard algorithms typically use fixed cluster sizes or geometric thresholds. To enhance performance, advanced machine learning techniques such as agglomerative clustering were implemented to use the full multi-dimensional parameter space including geometry, energy and time of individual interactions. An Edge Detection Neural Network exhibited significant differences. This study, based on Geant4 simulations, demonstrates improvements in cluster reconstruction efficiency of more than 30%, showcasing the potential of machine learning in nuclear physics experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SARA is the system of plastic scintillators coupled with silicon photomultipliers that will take part in the AEgIS experiment at CERN, measuring the time-of-flight of antihydrogen as it falls through a moir\'e deflectometer. Its development focused on simplicity, versatility and economy of the design and was supported by both physical tests and finite elements numerical simulations. The instrument's structure pairs the utilization of the scintillators as structural components with custom made 3D printed corner elements and the electronics allows to select between coincidence discrimination made on each scintillator and made between different scintillators.</description>

      <title>Detection of Ultra-Trace Heavy metals in Aerosols with pg^m3 Sensitivity Using Filament-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy metal pollution, particularly in the form of airborne aerosols such as lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and cobalt (Co), poses serious health and environmental risks, necessitating highly sensitive remote detection techniques. In this study, Filament-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy (FIFS) was employed to detect ultra-trace concentrations of heavy metal aerosols with high sensitivity and stability. By systematically optimizing the balance between filament length and detection distance, the optimal detection distance under the current experimental conditions was determined. With a detection distance of 10 m, this work achieved a minimum detectable concentration of 0.47 pg m^-3 for Pb and an extrapolated limit of detection (LOD) of 0.3 pg m^-3, with excellent signal stability (RSD &lt; 7%) over a concentration range from 0.47 pg m^-3 to 0.47 g m^-3. Additionally, Cd, Hg, and Co aerosols were also successfully detected under the same conditions, with detection limits of 2 pg m^-3, 0.25 pg m^-3, and 3 pg m^-3, respectively, further confirming the versatility of FIFS in detecting diverse heavy metals. Theoretical predictions suggest that increasing laser power could further enhance the detection capability. These results highlight the ultra-sensitive remote detection capability of FIFS for heavy metal aerosol detection and provide valuable insights for optimizing system parameters to enhance its application performance in environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Optimization and validation of charge transport simulation for hybrid pixel detectors incorporating the repulsion effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For emerging applications of hybrid pixel detectors which require high spatial resolution, e.g., subpixel interpolation in X-ray imaging and deep learning-based electron localization, accurate modeling of charge transport processes in the sensor is highly demanded. To address this, two open-source, time-stepping Monte Carlo simulation methods have been developed, both explicitly incorporating charge repulsion, which are found necessary for accurate simulation when charge sharing becomes important. The first method employs brute-force calculations accelerated by GPU computing to model charge carrier dynamics, including drift, diffusion, and repulsion. The second utilizes a simplified spherical model that significantly reduces computational complexity. A parameterization scheme of the charge transport behaviors has been developed to enable efficient and rapid generation of X-ray simulation events. Both methods were rigorously validated using experimental data collected with a monochromatic X-ray beam at the METROLOGIE beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron, demonstrating excellent agreement with measured pixel-energy spectra across various sensor thicknesses, bias voltages, and photon energies. Furthermore, the impact of the repulsion effect on charge carrier distributions was quantitatively evaluated. The potential applications of these simulation methods for different particle detections and detector technologies are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport for $e/\pi^0$ Particle Classification in LArTPC Neutrino Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient classification of electromagnetic activity from $\pi^0$ and electrons remains an open problem in the reconstruction of neutrino interactions in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detectors. We address this problem using the mathematical framework of Optimal Transport (OT), which has been successfully employed for event classification in other HEP contexts and is ideally suited to the high-resolution calorimetry of LArTPCs. Using a publicly available simulated dataset from the MicroBooNE collaboration, we show that OT methods achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction performance in $e/\pi^0$ classification. The success of this first application indicates the broader promise of OT methods for LArTPC-based neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Development of a Photon-Counting Deadtime Noise Model that Extends Dynamic Range and Resolution in Atmospheric Lidar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work derives and validates a noise model that encapsulates deadtime of non-paralyzable detectors with random photon arrivals to enable advanced processing, like maximum-likelihood estimation, of high resolution atmospheric lidar profiles while accounting for deadtime bias. This estimator was validated across a wide dynamic range at high resolution (4 millimeters in range, 17 milliseconds in time). Experiments demonstrate that the noise model outperforms the current state-of-the-art for very short time-of-flight (2 nanoseconds) and extended targets (1 microsecond). The proposed noise model also produces accurate deadtime correction for very short integration times. This work sets the foundation for further study into accurate retrievals of high flux and dynamic atmospheric features, e.g., clouds and aerosol layers.</description>

      <title>Apparatus for the measurement of birefringence maps of optical materials: the case of crystalline silicon for Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein Telescope (ET) is expected to achieve sensitivity improvements exceeding an order of magnitude compared to current gravitational-wave detectors. The rigorous characterization in optical birefringence of materials and coatings has become a critical task for next-generation detectors, especially since this birefringence is generally spatially non-uniform. A highly sensitive optical polarimeter has been developed at the Department of Physics and Earth Sciences of the University of Ferrara and INFN - Ferrara Section, Italy, aimed at performing two-dimensional birefringence mapping of substrates. In this paper we describe the design and working principle of the system and present results for crystalline silicon, a candidate material for substrates in the low-frequency (LF) interferometers of ET. We find that the birefringence is of order $10^{-7}$ for commercially available samples and is position dependent in the silicon (100)-oriented samples, with variations in both magnitude and axis orientation. We also measure the intrinsic birefringence of the (110) surface. Implications for the performance of gravitational-wave interferometers are discussed.</description>

      <title>Mathematical proof of errors in Capasso's excess noise factor formula for an n-step staircase multiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state devices such as multistep staircase avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are analogues to the photomultiplier tubes and are considered as a cascade-amplifier. The major source of internal noise in these APDs is due to the randomness in their stepwise impact ionization. Recent literature on staircase APDs by research groups such as Campbell and co-workers have reported the theoretical estimates of total excess noise factors using Capasso's excess noise factor formula. This formula is based on Friis' total noise factor formula for cascade networks. This article proves that Capasso's formula for a staircase APD, erroneously considers the power gains in Friis' total noise factor formula as the gains.</description>

      <title>Corrections to Friis noise factor formulas for cascade networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The signal-to-noise ratio of a multistage cascade network is often estimated using the well-known Friis' formulas for noise factors (or the noise figures in decibels). However, this article addresses the major errors in Friis' noise factor formulas for higher stages. Additionally, we re-derive the correct formulas to calculate the stage-wise noise factors for cascade networks from the basic definition of noise factors. We then present a comparison of our derived formulas with Friis' noise factor formulas. Contrary to Friis' formula, we define the total noise factor of an n-stage cascade network as the product of its stage-wise noise factors. We further validate our derived formulas for a cascade network by correlating them with the expressions for a staircase avalanche photodiode.</description>

      <title>Thermal Management Design and Key Technology Validation for PandaX Underground Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scale of liquid xenon experiments for rare events searching is expanding, which is planned even to fifty tons level. The detector and distillation tower require a reliable cooling source with large cooling power at liquid xenon temperature range. Pulse tube refrigerators and GM refrigerators, which were widely used in previous detectors, have the disadvantages of small cooling power, large space occupation, and non-standby mutuality, which become bottlenecks of the experiment scale expansion. In this study, an auto-cascade refrigerator with ethanol coolant is developed, and the heat transfer effect is improved by adopting the concentric shaft heat exchanger and after-pumping heat transfer scheme. The 2.5 kW stable cooling power is obtained at 155 K. Further, the feasibility and key technology of the centralized cooling system of 5 kw at 160 K is discussed. The study can simplify liquid xenon experimental auxiliary devices, which will be helpful for the PandaX-xT experiment scheme and its laboratory infrastructure design.</description>

      <title>Qualification of Bump Bonding in CMS Inner Tracker Pixel Modules for the Phase-2 Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To fully exploit the increased luminosity of the HL-LHC, the CMS Inner Tracker is undergoing a major upgrade to withstand extreme radiation levels and data rates, while improving granularity and reducing material budget. The upgraded modules employ thin planar and 3D silicon pixel sensors, bump bonded to a new radiation-hard readout chip, the CROC, designed in 65 nm CMOS technology and powered via a serial scheme. Ensuring the quality of bump bonding between sensors and readout chips is critical for efficient detector operation. This work presents the qualification procedures developed to identify missing or defective bumps using multiple test methods, including crosstalk analysis, reverse/forward bias testing, and X-ray or beta source imaging. Results from prototype modules are presented, and advantages and limitations of each method are discussed.</description>

      <title>The QTF-Backbone: Proposal for a Nationwide Optical Fibre Backbone in Germany for Quantum Technology and Time and Frequency Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent breakthroughs in the distribution of quantum information and high-precision time and frequency (T&amp;F) signals over long-haul optical fibre networks have transformative potential for physically secure communications, resilience of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and fundamental physics. However, so far these capabilities remain confined to isolated testbeds, with quantum and T&amp;F signals accessible, for example in Germany, to only a few institutions.
  We propose the QTF-Backbone: a dedicated national fibre-optic infrastructure in Germany for the networked distribution of quantum and T&amp;F signals using dark fibres and specialized hardware. The QTF-Backbone is planned as a four-phase deployment over ten years to ensure scalable, sustainable access for research institutions and industry. The concept builds on successful demonstrations of high-TRL time and frequency distribution across Europe, including PTB-MPQ links in Germany, REFIMEVE in France, and the Italian LIFT network. The QTF-Backbone will enable transformative R&amp;D, support a nationwide QTF ecosystem, and ensure the transition from innovation to deployment. As a national and European hub, it will position Germany and Europe at the forefront of quantum networking, as well as time and frequency transfer.</description>

      <title>OmniJet-${\alpha}_C$: Learning point cloud calorimeter simulations using generative transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the first use of generative transformers for generating calorimeter showers as point clouds in a high-granularity calorimeter. Using the tokenizer and generative part of the OmniJet-${\alpha}$ model, we represent the hits in the detector as sequences of integers. This model allows variable-length sequences, which means that it supports realistic shower development and does not need to be conditioned on the number of hits. Since the tokenization represents the showers as point clouds, the model learns the geometry of the showers without being restricted to any particular voxel grid.</description>

      <title>DeepExtractor: Time-domain reconstruction of signals and glitches in gravitational wave data with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, detect faint signals from distant astrophysical events. However, their high sensitivity also makes them susceptible to background noise, which can obscure these signals. This noise often includes transient artifacts called 'glitches', that can mimic genuine astrophysical signals or mask their true characteristics. In this study, we present DeepExtractor, a deep learning framework that is designed to reconstruct signals and glitches with power exceeding interferometer noise, regardless of their source. We design DeepExtractor to model the inherent noise distribution of GW detectors, following conventional assumptions that the noise is Gaussian and stationary over short time scales. It operates by predicting and subtracting the noise component of the data, retaining only the clean reconstruction of signal or glitch. We focus on applications related to glitches and validate DeepExtractor's effectiveness through three experiments: (1) reconstructing simulated glitches injected into simulated detector noise, (2) comparing its performance with the state-of-the-art BayesWave algorithm, and (3) analyzing real data from the Gravity Spy dataset to demonstrate effective glitch subtraction from LIGO strain data. We further demonstrate its potential by reconstructing three real GW events from LIGO's third observing run, without being trained on GW waveforms. Our proposed model achieves a median mismatch of only 0.9% for simulated glitches, outperforming several deep learning baselines. Additionally, DeepExtractor surpasses BayesWave in glitch recovery, offering a dramatic computational speedup by reconstructing one glitch sample in approximately 0.1 seconds on a CPU, compared to BayesWave's processing time of approximately one hour per glitch.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrical cavity design that bypasses mode mixings in axion haloscope experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microwave cavities used in axion haloscope experiments typically employ a tuning rod as a means to widen the range of resonance frequencies at which it is sensitive to axion-to-photon conversion. A realistic tuning mechanism requires a gap between the cavity end caps and the tuning rod to ensure movement, and causes some modes to hybridize with the resonant mode that is being tracked for the experiment. These so-called mode mixings lead to gaps in the frequency range that practically lose sensitivity to axions. In order to solve this problem, we present a cavity design which, for two tuning rod configurations corresponding to a lower and higher frequency range, have a dielectric rod inserted at a specific location that makes the cavity asymmetrical. Moving the tuning rod closer to the dielectric insert changes the location and frequency of the mode mixing compared to when it is farther away from it. This design is easily realizable in practical experiments and makes possible an axion dark matter search with minimal loss in sensitivity due to mode mixings. We also show that the same design has the same desired effect when cavity dimensions are scaled down to be smaller and are at higher resonance frequencies.</description>
