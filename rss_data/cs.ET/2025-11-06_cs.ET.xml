      <title>NF-SecRIS: RIS-Assisted Near-Field Physical Layer Security via Secure Location Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 6G wireless networks impose extremely high requirements on physical layer secure communication. However, the existing solutions usually can only achieve one-dimensional physical layer security (PLS) in the angle dimension, and cannot achieve PLS in the range dimension. In this paper, we propose the NF-SecRIS system, the first range-angle-dependent (2D) PLS near-field communication system based on ultra-large-scale reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). We propose the secure location modulation scheme to synthesize the near-field spatial-temporal coding pattern of RIS with extremely low complexity. It ensures that only legitimate user can receive the raw constellations, while potential eavesdroppers at other ranges or angles can only receive the obfuscated constellations. NF-SecRIS operates without requiring synchronization with either transmitter or receiver. We implement a prototype of NF-SecRIS and conduct comprehensive experiments with multiple modulation schemes. The results show that the bit error rate (BER) of legitimate user is below 10^{-4}, while eavesdroppers at other ranges or angles suffer from BER exceeding 40%. It validates the implementation of 2D PLS in near-field communications.</description>

      <title>QAGT-MLP: An Attention-Based Graph Transformer for Small and Large-Scale Quantum Error Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noisy quantum devices demand error-mitigation techniques to be accurate yet simple and efficient in terms of number of shots and processing time. Many established approaches (e.g., extrapolation and quasi-probability cancellation) impose substantial execution or calibration overheads, while existing learning-based methods have difficulty scaling to large and deep circuits. In this research, we introduce QAGT-MLP: an attention-based graph transformer tailored for small- and large-scale quantum error mitigation (QEM). QAGT-MLP encodes each quantum circuit as a graph whose nodes represent gate instances and whose edges capture qubit connectivity and causal adjacency. A dual-path attention module extracts features around measured qubits at two scales or contexts: 1) graph-wide global structural context; and 2) fine-grained local lightcone context. These learned representations are concatenated with circuit-level descriptor features and the circuit noisy expected values, then they are passed to a lightweight MLP to predict the noise-mitigated values. On large-scale 100-qubit Trotterized 1D Transverse-Field Ising Models -- TFIM circuits -- the proposed QAGT-MLP outperformed state-of-the-art learning baselines in terms of mean error and error variability, demonstrating strong validity and applicability in real-world QEM scenarios under matched shot budgets. By using attention to fuse global structures with local lightcone neighborhoods, QAGT-MLP achieves high mitigation quality without the increasing noise scaling or resource demand required by classical QEM pipelines, while still offering a scalable and practical path to QEM in modern and future quantum workloads.</description>

      <title>LLM-enhanced Air Quality Monitoring Interface via Model Context Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air quality monitoring is central to environmental sustainability and public health, yet traditional systems remain difficult for non-expert users to interpret due to complex visualizations, limited interactivity, and high deployment costs. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to make sensor data more accessible, but their tendency to produce hallucinations limits reliability in safety-critical domains. To address these challenges, we present an LLM-enhanced Air Monitoring Interface (AMI) that integrates real-time sensor data with a conversational interface via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Our system grounds LLM outputs in live environmental data, enabling accurate, context-aware responses while reducing hallucination risk. The architecture combines a Django-based backend, a responsive user dashboard, and a secure MCP server that exposes system functions as discoverable tools, allowing the LLM to act as an active operator rather than a passive responder. Expert evaluation demonstrated high factual accuracy (4.78), completeness (4.82), and minimal hallucinations (4.84), on a scale of 5, supported by inter-rater reliability analysis. These results highlight the potential of combining LLMs with standardized tool protocols to create reliable, secure, and user-friendly interfaces for real-time environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Driven Pavement Health Monitoring and Maintenance Optimization Using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pavement infrastructure monitoring is challenged by complex spatial dependencies, changing environmental conditions, and non-linear deterioration across road networks. Traditional Pavement Management Systems (PMS) remain largely reactive, lacking real-time intelligence for failure prevention and optimal maintenance planning. To address this, we propose a unified Digital Twin (DT) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for scalable, data-driven pavement health monitoring and predictive maintenance. Pavement segments and spatial relations are modeled as graph nodes and edges, while real-time UAV, sensor, and LiDAR data stream into the DT. The inductive GNN learns deterioration patterns from graph-structured inputs to forecast distress and enable proactive interventions. Trained on a real-world-inspired dataset with segment attributes and dynamic connectivity, our model achieves an R2 of 0.3798, outperforming baseline regressors and effectively capturing non-linear degradation. We also develop an interactive dashboard and reinforcement learning module for simulation, visualization, and adaptive maintenance planning. This DT-GNN integration enhances forecasting precision and establishes a closed feedback loop for continuous improvement, positioning the approach as a foundation for proactive, intelligent, and sustainable pavement management, with future extensions toward real-world deployment, multi-agent coordination, and smart-city integration.</description>

      <title>Analog-to-Digital Converter Based on Voltage-controlled Superconducting Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for cryogenic electronics in superconducting and quantum computing systems calls for ultra energy efficient data conversion architectures that remain functional at deep cryogenic temperatures.In this work, we present the first design of a voltage-controlled superconducting flash analog-to-digital converter (ADC) based on a novel quantum enhanced Josephson junction field effect transistor (JJFET).Exploiting its strong gate tunability and transistor-like behavior, the JJFET offers a scalable alternative to conventional current controlled superconducting devices while aligning naturally with CMOS style design methodologies.Building on our previously developed Verilog A compact model calibrated to experimental data, we design and simulate a three bit JJFET based flash ADC.The core comparator block is realized through careful bias current selection and augmented with a three terminal nanocryotron to precisely define reference voltages.Cascaded JJFET comparators ensure robust voltage gain, cascadability, and logic level restoration across stages.Simulation results demonstrate accurate quantization behavior with ultra-low power dissipation, underscoring the feasibility of voltage driven superconducting mixed signal circuits.This work establishes a critical step toward unifying superconducting logic and data conversion, paving the way for scalable cryogenic architectures in quantum classical co-processors, low-power AI accelerators, and next generation energy constrained computing platforms.</description>

      <title>HERP: Hardware for Energy Efficient and Realtime DB Search and Cluster Expansion in Proteomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Database (DB) search and clustering are fundamental in proteomics but conventional full clustering and search approaches demand high resources and incur long latency. We propose a lightweight incremental clustering and highly parallelizable DB search platform tailored for resource-constrained environments, delivering low energy and latency without compromising performance. By leveraging mass-spectrometry insights, we employ bucket-wise parallelization and query scheduling to reduce latency. A one-time hardware initialization with pre-clustered proteomics data enables continuous DB search and local re-clustering, offering a more practical and efficient alternative to clustering from scratch. Heuristics from pre-clustered data guide incremental clustering, accelerating the process by 20x with only a 0.3% increase in clustering error. DB search results overlap by 96% with state-of-the-art tools, validating search quality. The hardware leverages a 3T 2M T J SOT-CAM at the 7nm node with a compute-in-memory design. For the human genome draft dataset (131GB), setup requires 1.19mJ for 2M spectra, while a 1000 query search consumes 1.1{\mu}J. Bucket-wise parallelization further achieves 100x speedup.</description>

      <title>MetaFed: Advancing Privacy, Performance, and Sustainability in Federated Metaverse Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of immersive Metaverse applications introduces complex challenges at the intersection of performance, privacy, and environmental sustainability. Centralized architectures fall short in addressing these demands, often resulting in elevated energy consumption, latency, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes MetaFed, a decentralized federated learning (FL) framework that enables sustainable and intelligent resource orchestration for Metaverse environments. MetaFed integrates (i) multi-agent reinforcement learning for dynamic client selection, (ii) privacy-preserving FL using homomorphic encryption, and (iii) carbon-aware scheduling aligned with renewable energy availability. Evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 using lightweight ResNet architectures demonstrate that MetaFed achieves up to 25% reduction in carbon emissions compared to conventional approaches, while maintaining high accuracy and minimal communication overhead. These results highlight MetaFed as a scalable solution for building environmentally responsible and privacy-compliant Metaverse infrastructures.</description>
