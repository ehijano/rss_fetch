      <description>arXiv:2503.05744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The natural interactive materials under far-from-equilibrium conditions have significantly inspired advances in synthetic biomimetic materials. In artificial systems, gradient diffusion serves as the primary means of interaction between individuals, lacking directionality, sufficient interaction ranges and transmission rates. Here, we present a method for constructing highly directed, communicative structures via optical feedback in light responsive materials. We showcase a photomechanical operator system comprising a baffle and a soft actuator. Positive and negative operators are configured to induce light-triggered deformations, alternately interrupting the passage of two light beams in a closed feedback loop. The fundamental functionalities of this optically interconnected material loop include homeostasis-like self-oscillation and signal transmission from one material to another via light. Refinements in alignment facilitate remote sensing, fiber-optic/long-distance communication, and adaptation. These proof-of-concept demonstrations outline a versatile design framework for light-mediated communication among responsive materials, with broad applicability across diverse materials.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond Temporal Phase-Resolved Nonlinear Optical Spectroscopy in Molecules with Lock-in Enabled Phase Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an experiment to measure the emitted real-time electric field from an ultrafast third-order nonlinear optical interaction in molecules, using a phase-tracked spectral interferometry scheme. By combining a software lock-in amplification based spectrometer with spectral interferometry, we measure the electric field of the nonlinear optical signal from rotationally excited gas-phase molecules. The lock-in spectrometer allows selective measurement of signals of interest with improved signal-to-noise ratio, while rejecting any unwanted incoherent background. The nonlinear optical signal interferes with a known reference pulse on the spectrometer, which allows measurement of ultraweak signal electric fields. Further, we show that lock-in detection enables correction of slow interferometric drifts by utilizing a multidimensional measurement space. Thus, interferometric stability is achieved without the need for active stabilization, which typically utilizes an independent phase drift measurement. We present data from an experiment in impulsively aligned molecules that demonstrates the important features of our scheme. The scheme can be applied to study ultrafast dynamics in laser excited systems in the gas, liquid, and solid phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Optical Visualization of Carrier Surfing in 2D Monolayers Driven by Surface Acoustic Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge carrier transport is pivotal in advancing nanoelectronics. Despite progress in exciton transport within ultra-thin semiconductors, the intertwined transport of free carriers and excitons presents challenges. Surface Acoustic Waves (SAWs) offer a compelling solution, enabling remote, real-time control of excitonic states at room temperature via surfing carriers in 2D materials, a relatively unexplored domain. SAWs create a versatile platform for tailoring excitonic states from microwave to optical frequencies. This study first demonstrates a simple route to visualize directional light transport and carriers drift driven by non-perfect Rayleigh-SAWs. We observed a maximum drift velocity of ~16.4 um/s for ionized carriers with SAW, significantly surpassing their natural movement in monolayers, though free electrons drift remains in the order of ~103 m/s. Enhanced exciton emission was achieved through standing SAWs, generating periodic oscillations. By combining traveling and standing wave portions, controllable, on-demand single-chip emission is feasible. Our findings open avenues for light manipulation, photonic circuits, and on-chip communications technologies.</description>

      <title>Error Source Sensitivity Analysis in Model-Based Coherence Scanning Interferometry for Thin Film Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing processes, silicon dioxide films are commonly used as barrier layers, insulating layers, and protective layers. Coherence scanning interferometry (CSI) offers thin film thickness measurements with a millimeter-scale field of view and micrometer-scale lateral resolution. When the film thickness is less than the coherence length of a CSI system, a model-based film thickness measurement method is typically employed, which relies on a priori information about the thin film and the instrument. This study quantitatively analyzes how the accuracy of a priori information would affect the accuracy of thickness measurement when using a model-based CSI method. The influence factors include camera noise, numerical aperture (NA), pupil apodization, light source spectrum, and thin film refractive index. A series of SiO$_2$/Si thin films with varying thicknesses are analyzed by combining simulation and experimental approaches. The results reveal that the accuracy of thickness measurements exhibits varying sensitivity to different a priori information. The refractive index of the thin film is identified as the most sensitive source of error, where 1\% deviation in refractive index may cause 1\% relative thickness error, whereas 5\% deviation in NA results in less than 1\% relative thickness error. The simulation and experimental results show good agreement, validating the correctness and effectiveness of this study.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Light Localization via Coherent Control: The Interplay of Transmission, Absorption and Disorder in Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the dynamic relationship between the Lyapunov exponent, absorption, and structural disorder to exploit localization phenomena in photonic crystals. We study systems where random variations in the refractive index of one of the bilayers introduce disorder, while a defect layer features non-uniform doping with $\Lambda$-type atoms and enables coherent modulation of effective refractive index. The coherent control permits the active tuning of absorption, Lyapunov exponent, and localization characteristics in disordered regimes. A striking contrast in the absorption and Lyapunov spectra is observed for band gap and band edge frequencies, highlighting distinct localization behaviors. These findings advance understanding of light-matter interactions and field localization in disordered systems, offering pathways for tailored photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Full Polarization Control of Photons with Evanescent Wave Coupling in the Ultra Subwavelength Gap of Photonic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization of photons plays a key role in quantum optics and light-matter interactions, however, it is difficult to control in nanosystems since the eigenstate of a nanophotonic cavity is usually fixed and linearly polarized. Here we reveal polarization control of photons using photonic molecules (PMs) that host supermodes of two coupled nanobeam cavities. In contrast to conventional PMs in a 2D photonic crystal slab, for the two 1D photonic crystal nanobeam cavities the shift and gap between them can be tuned continuously. With an ultra subwavelength gap, the coupling between the two cavities is dominated by the evanescent wave coupling in the surrounding environment, rather not the emission wave coupling for conventional PMs. As such, non-Hermiticity of the system becomes pronounced, and the supermodes consist of a non-trivial phase difference between bare eigenstates that supports elliptical polarization. We observe that both the polarization degree and polarization angle of the antisymmetric mode strongly depend on the shift and gap between the two cavities, exhibiting polarization states from linear to circular. This full polarization control indicates great potential of PMs in quantum optical devices and spin-resolved cavity quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Twist-enabled Transmissive Metasurface with Co-polarized Geometric Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces have offered unprecedented control over electromagnetic (EM) waves across a wide range of frequency spectrum by manipulating its phase, amplitude, and polarization at subwavelength scales. Full wavefront control using metasurfaces requires 2{\pi} phase modulation, which is essential for advanced optical and photonic engineering. Common approaches, such as the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phases and resonant phases, face stringent limitations: PB phases essentially depend on circular polarization conversion, while resonant phases are inherently narrowband and require a complex design process. To overcome these challenges, we propose a broadband metasurface with a co-polarized transmissive geometric phase that achieves 2{\pi} phase coverage while conserving the circular polarization of incident EM waves. This co-polarized phase is enabled by a local twist angle between the upper and lower metallic patterns, forming a branch cut in the parameter space determined by the twist angle and frequency. The branch cut connects phase singularities of opposite chirality, ensuring broadband 2{\pi} phase coverage. We experimentally validate the presence of the branch cut and demonstrate broadband generation of arbitrary orbital angular momentum (OAM) for co-polarized output. Our approach provides a versatile method for designing broadband metasurfaces without altering circular polarizations, paving the way for development of compact optical and photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Flat-Band Lasing in Silicon Waveguide-Integrated Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic flat bands are crucial for enabling strong localization of light and enhancing light-matter interactions, as well as tailoring the angular distribution of emission from photonic structures. These unique properties open pathways for developing robust photonic devices, efficient nonlinear optical processes, and novel platforms for exploring topological and quantum phenomena. So far, experimental realizations of lasing in photonic flat bands have been limited to structures that emulate geometrically frustrated lattices in the tight-binding, i.e. short-range coupling, regime. Here, we consider a periodic metasurface with long-range couplings combined with guided modes and report experimental observation of lasing in photonic nearly flat modes. By carefully tuning the thickness of the guiding layer and periodicities, the observed flat lasing spectrum extends up to approximately \( k_{y} = 2 \,\mu\text{m}^{-1} \) in reciprocal space. Simulations show that the observed modes exhibit localization in both the waveguiding and active layers. In addition, we observe accidental bound states in the continuum (BICs) at the lasing frequencies, manifesting through polarization vortices with a topological charge \(|q|\)= 1.</description>

      <title>Construction of Optical Spatiotemporal Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The creation and manipulation of photonic skyrmions provide a novel degree of freedom for light-matter interactions, optical communication and nanometrology. Since the localized vortex within skyrmions arises from the twist and curl of the phase structure, the orbital angular momentum of light is essential for their construction. While numerous skyrmionic textures have been proposed, they are formed within the spatial domain and induced by the longitudinal orbital angular momentum. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally observe spatiotemporal skyrmions within a picosecond pulse wavepacket, generated through vectorial sculpturing of spatiotemporal wavepackets. The skyrmionic textures emerge within the spatiotemporal distribution of a vector field encompass all possible polarization states. Constructed upon the transverse orbital angular momentum, spatiotemporal skyrmions, in contrast to spatial skyrmions, exhibit no helical twisting perpendicular to the skyrmion plane, demonstrating enhanced stability to deformations or perturbations. These results expand the skyrmion family and offer new insights into optical quasiparticles, potentially leading to advanced applications in optical metrology, sensing, and data storage.</description>

      <title>Streaming Self-Corrected Dual-Comb Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we radically simplify coherently averaged dual-comb spectroscopy by introducing a real-time self-correction system: a radio frequency system-on-chip computes each incoming dual-comb interferogram's phase, frequency, and arrival time, calculates changes in the combs' carrier-envelope offset frequencies and repetition rates, and immediately phase-corrects the incoming interferogram data stream. The algorithm supports up to 0.3 GHz interferogram frequency bandwidth and thus combines fast measurement times (corresponding to high detunings) with broadband optical detection. Using the system, we achieve comb-resolved spectroscopy with Fourier-limited linewidth, coherent averaging over arbitrarily long durations, and a signal-to-noise ratio of up to 2100. Iodine and acetylene spectroscopy yields excellent agreement with literature over an optical bandwidth of more than 10 THz in the visible and near-infrared. Our approach only requires three optical and three electronic components and makes instantaneous dual-comb spectroscopy available to everyday applications.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Deep Learning Network for Photon-Level Block Compressed Sensing Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal deep learning network for photon-level Block Compressed Sensing Imaging, aimed to address challenges such as signal loss, artifacts, and noise interference in large-pixel dynamic imaging and tracking at the photon level. This approach combines information in the time and frequency domains with a U-Net-LSTM deep learning model, significantly improving the restoration quality of dynamic target images at high frame rates. The experimental results demonstrate that dynamic target imaging with an average photon number of less than 10 per pixel can be achieved using 16-channel parallel detection, where the pixel size is 256*256 and the frame rate is 200 fps.. Compared to conventional Block Compressed Sensing Imaging, this method increases the peak signal-to-noise ratio to 38.66 dB and improves the structural similarity index to 0.96. In the presence of a dynamic scattering medium and a static complex background, we successfully achieved imaging and tracking of two targets undergoing complex motion. Even in scenarios where the targets overlap or obstruct each other, we can still reconstruct clear images of each individual target separately.. This method provides an effective solution for large-pixel dynamic target recognition, tracking, and real-time imaging in complex environments, offering promising applications in remote sensing, military reconnaissance, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Probing Topological Anderson Transition in Quasiperiodic Photonic Lattices via Chiral Displacement and Wavelength Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of topology and disorder in quantum dynamics has recently attracted significant attention across diverse platforms, including solid-state devices, ultracold atoms, and photonic systems. Here, we report on a topological Anderson transition caused by quasiperiodic inter-cell coupling disorder in photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.</description>

      <title>Time- and frequency-resolved dynamics of resonant two-photon terahertz quantum cascade lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-photon terahertz (THz) quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) can immensely improve the conventional applications of THz frequency sources and open windows to new applications due to their ability to generate quantum-entangled twin photon beams. The rich intrinsic non-linearity in a two-photon THz QCL arises from cascaded photon transitions, leading to time-resolved and frequency-resolved dynamics that are less predictable. This work investigates the time- and frequency-resolved dynamics of a resonant two-photon THz QCL by numerically solving the coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations. Our findings indicate that the output intensity is significantly higher, and the emission spectra are much broader in a two-photon THz QCL than in a conventional one-photon THz QCL. Additionally, a pronounced Risken-Nummedal-Graham-Haken (RNGH) instability onsets for a resonant two-photon QCL at a smaller pumping current. We also observe an increase in the number of lasing modes, as well as a higher power per line in a resonant two-photon QCL. Furthermore, Rabi splitting is observed in the emission spectra at high pumping currents.</description>

      <title>High-Luminosity meV-Resolution Single-Shot Hard X-ray Spectrograph for Cavity-Based X-ray Free-Electron Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity-based x-ray free-electron lasers (CBXFELs) represent a possible realization of fully coherent hard x-ray sources having high spectral brilliance along with a narrow spectral bandwidth of $\simeq 1 - 50$~meV, a high repetition pulse rate of $\simeq 1$~MHz, and good stability. A diagnostic tool is required to measure CBXFEL spectra with meV resolution and high luminosity on a shot-to-shot basis. We have designed a high-luminosity single-shot hard x-ray spectrograph that images 9.831-keV x-rays in a $\simeq 200$~meV spectral window with a spectral resolution of a few meV. The spectrograph is designed around angular dispersion of x-rays in Bragg diffraction from crystals. It operates close to design specifications, exhibiting a linear dispersion rate of $\simeq$~1.4~$\mu$m/meV and a $\simeq$~200-meV window of high-fidelity spectral imaging. The experimentally demonstrated spectral resolution is $\simeq 20$~meV; this resolution is twice as low as expected from theory primarily because the spectrograph is highly sensitive to crystal angular instabilities. The experiment was performed at the bending magnet x-ray optics testing beamline 1-BM at the Advanced Photon Source.</description>

      <title>Imperfect detectors for adversarial tasks with applications to quantum key distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Security analyses in quantum key distribution (QKD) and other adversarial quantum tasks often assume perfect device models. However, real-world implementations often deviate from these models. Thus, it is important to develop security proofs that account for such deviations from ideality. In this work, we develop a general framework for analysing imperfect threshold detectors, treating uncharacterised device parameters such as dark counts and detection efficiencies as adversarially controlled within some ranges. This approach enables a rigorous worst-case analysis, ensuring security proofs remain valid under realistic conditions. Our results strengthen the connection between theoretical security and practical implementations by introducing a flexible framework for integrating detector imperfections into adversarial quantum protocols.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Transfer of Chiral Edge States in Topological Type-II Hyperbolic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of hyperbolic lattice, a discretized regularization of non-Euclidean space with constant negative curvature, has provided an unprecedented platform to extend topological phases of matter from Euclidean to non-Euclidean spaces. To date, however, all previous hyperbolic topological states are limited to conventional type-I hyperbolic lattice with a single edge, leaving the dynamic transfer of hyperbolic topological states between different edges completely unresolved. Here, by extending the hyperbolic topological physics from the conventional type-I hyperbolic lattices to the newfangled type-II hyperbolic lattices, we report the type-II hyperbolic Chern insulator featuring outer and inner chiral edge states and demonstrate their dynamic transfer across the bulk to the opposite edge via two distinct mechanisms: anti-parity-time phase transition and Landau-Zener single-band pumping. Our work lays the foundation for further exploring the dynamic evolution of hyperbolic topological effects, with the final goal of inspiring applications leveraging dynamic manipulations of the hyperbolic topological states.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Coherence Peak in Near-Field Radiative Heat Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancement and peaks in near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) typically arise due to surface phonon-polaritons, plasmon-polaritons, and electromagnetic (EM) modes in structured materials. However, the role of material quantum coherence in enhancing near-field radiative heat transfer remains unexplored. Here, we unravel that NFRHT in superconductor-ferromagnetic systems displays a unique peak at the superconducting phase transition that originates from the quantum coherence of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in superconductors. Our theory takes into account evanescent EM radiation emanating from fluctuating currents comprising Cooper pairs and Bogoliubov quasiparticles in stark contrast to the current-current correlations induced by electrons in conventional materials. Our proposed NFRHT configuration exploits ferromagnetic resonance at frequencies deep inside the superconducting band gap to isolate this superconducting coherence peak. Furthermore, we reveal that Cooper pairs and Bogoliubov quasiparticles have opposite effects on near-field thermal radiation and isolate their effects on many-body radiative heat transfer near superconductors. Our proposed phenomenon can have applications for developing thermal isolators and heat sinks in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Topology of Non-Hermitian Brillouin Klein Bottles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are prominent non-Hermitian band degeneracies that give rise to a variety of intriguing and unconventional phenomena. Similar to Weyl and Dirac points, EPs carry topological charges and comply with the celebrated fermion doubling theorems in lattices. Beyond these characteristics, EPs exhibit more exotic topological properties, particularly non-Abelian braiding topologies not seen in conventional degeneracies. Here, we investigate these foundational concepts of EPs in two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices where the fundamental domain of the Brillouin zone is a Klein bottle, rather than a torus assumed in previous studies. We find that EPs do not necessarily appear in pairs with opposite topological charges in the Brillouin Klein bottle, thus violating the fermion doubling theorem. The violation occurs because, without crossing the boundary, the sum of the topological charges of EPs is in fact an even number rather than zero. Moreover, we uncover unique braiding topologies of EPs that cannot be captured by existing theories. Specifically, the composite braidings around all EPs equals the braiding along the boundary of the Brillouin Klein bottle. This novel braiding topology further confirms the failure of the fermion doubling theorem, and allows us to explore the non-Abelian braidings of EPs beyond the scope of topological charges. Our work highlights the fundamental role of Brillouin-zone topology in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present paper deals with the study of the fluence rate over both healthy and tumor tissues in the presence of focal laser ablation (FLA). We propose new analytical solutions for the coupled partial differential equations (PDE) system, which includes the transport equation modeling the light penetration into biological tissue, the bioheat equation modeling the heat transfer and its respective damage. The present building could be the first step to the knowledge of the mathematical framework for biothermophysical problems, as well as the main key to simplify the numerical calculation due to its no cost. We derive exact solutions and simulate results from them. We discuss the potential physical contributions and present respective conclusions about (1) the validness of the diffusion approximation of the radiative transfer equation; (2) the local behavior of the source of scattered photons; (3) the unsteady-state of the fluence rate; and (4) the boundedness of the critical time of the thermal damage to the cancerous tissue. We also discuss some controversial and diverging hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Modeling Realistic Dynamics of Nanoparticle Dimers for Magneto-Optical Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to optical matter often involve complex illumination fields with costly and unstable setups, requiring strong gradient forces, high-intensity laser spots that could harm samples, and substrate support. For binding, attractive inter-particle forces may not be sufficient to assemble systems due to unbalanced components such as centrifugal forces or collisions. In previous work, magneto-optical nanoparticles illuminated with two counter-propagating circularly polarized waves were optically bound under quasi-static conditions. However, the dynamics of such nano systems were not thoroughly considered. Here, a general framework to study magneto-optical (MO) matter is introduced, controllable by static magnetic fields. Dynamic binding between two n-doped InSb nanoparticles, which exhibit surface plasmons at THz frequencies, is recreated. Additionally, the reported examples may represent a novel approach of low-energy illumination sources without gradient components. This numerical framework, grounded in Langevin dynamics and realistic collision phenomena, serves as a robust and universal tool for exploring various optomechanical designs. The impact of thermal noise, collision types, initial conditions, and resonance excitation on a dimer system is examined. Dimers tuned initially at magneto-optical resonance can bind in stable, average positions even when particle-particle collisions are present. The current methodology provides essential knowledge for studying optical binding and the dynamics of any small-scale cluster of interacting sub-units.</description>

      <title>Infrared Bolometers Based on 40-nm-Thick Nano-Thermoelectric Silicon Membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of the-art infrared photodetectors operating in the mid- and long-wavelength infrared (MWIR and LWIR) are largely dominated by cryogenically cooled quantum sensors when the target is the highest sensitivity and detection speeds. Nano-thermoelectrics provide a route towards competitive uncooled infrared bolometer technology that can obtain high speed and sensitivity, low-power operation, and cost-effectiveness. We demonstrate nano-thermoelectric LWIR bolometers with fast and high-sensitivity response to LWIR around 10 $\mu$m. These devices are based on ultra-thin silicon membranes that utilize the dimensional scaling of silicon nanomembranes in thermoelectric elements and are combined with metallic nanomembranes with subwavelength absorber structures. The fast device performance stems from a low heat capacity design where the thermoelectric beams act both as mechanical supports and transducer elements. Furthermore, by scaling down the thickness of the thermoelectric beams the thermal conductivity is reduced owing to enhanced phonon boundary scattering, resulting in increased sensitivity. The nano-thermoelectric LWIR bolometers are based on 40-nm-thick n- and p-type silicon membranes with LWIR (voltage) responsivities up to 1636 V/W and 1350 V/W and time constants in the range of 300-600 $\mu$s, resulting in specific detectivities up to $1.56\times10^8$ cmHz$^{1/2}$/W. We also investigate the use of a heavily doped N++ substrate to increase optical cavity back reflection, resulting in an increased Si substrate reflectance from 30% to 70%-75% for wavelengths between 8-10 $\mu$m, resulting in an increase in device responsivity by approximately 20%.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy for Fast Quantitative Phase Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In computational phase imaging with a microscope equipped with an array of light emitting diodes as illumination unit, conventional Fourier ptychographic microscopy achieves high resolution and wide-field reconstructions but is constrained by a lengthy acquisition time. Conversely, differential phase contrast (DPC) offers fast imaging but is limited in resolution. Here, we introduce perturbative Fourier ptychographic microscopy (pFPM). pFPM is an extension of DPC that incorporates dark-field illumination to enable fast, high-resolution, wide-field quantitative phase imaging with few measurements. We interpret DPC as the initial iteration of a Gauss-Newton algorithm with quadratic regularization and generalize it to multiple iterations and more sophisticated regularizers. This broader framework is not restricted to bright-field measurements and allows us to overcome resolution limitations of DPC. We develop tailored annular dark-field illumination patterns that align with the perturbative interpretation and lead to an improvement in the quality of reconstruction with respect to other common illumination schemes. Consequently, our methodology combines an enhanced phase reconstruction algorithm with a specialized illumination strategy and offers significant advantages in both imaging speed and resolution.</description>

Abstract: The intrinsic complexity of nonlinear optical phenomena offers a fundamentally new resource to analog brain-inspired computing, with the potential to address the pressing energy requirements of artificial intelligence. We introduce and investigate the concept of nonlinear inference capacity in optical neuromorphic computing in highly nonlinear fiber-based optical Extreme Learning Machines. We demonstrate that this capacity scales with nonlinearity to the point where it surpasses the performance of a deep neural network model with five hidden layers on a scalable nonlinear classification benchmark. By comparing normal and anomalous dispersion fibers under various operating conditions and against digital classifiers, we observe a direct correlation between the system's nonlinear dynamics and its classification performance. Our findings suggest that image recognition tasks, such as MNIST, are incomplete in showcasing deep computing capabilities in analog hardware. Our approach provides a framework for evaluating and comparing computational capabilities, particularly their ability to emulate deep networks, across different physical and digital platforms, paving the way for a more generalized set of benchmarks for unconventional, physics-inspired computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Dammann Metasurface Route to Overcoming the Uniformity Defects in Two-Dimensional Beam Multipliers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dammann gratings - beam-shaping optical elements acting as beam multipliers with equal-power beams - are a key element in three-dimensional imaging based on structured light and beam combiners for high-power laser applications. However, two-dimensional Dammann grating structures suffer from a significant reduction of the uniformity among the diffraction orders. Here, we report Dammann metasurfaces based on the geometric phase as the structure realization for the target phase profile, which outperform the capabilities of Dammann gratings by overcoming the uniformity defects in their two-dimensional diffraction patterns. We showed that two-dimensional Dammann metasurfaces exhibit high uniformity and diffraction efficiency, in contrast to Dammann gratings, by overcoming the uniformity defects via a robust and highly precise phase imprint. Moreover, Dammann metasurfaces outperform their grating counterparts by exhibiting a polarization-independent response and a broadband operation. This study reveals that by providing physics-driven solutions, metasurfaces can outperform the capabilities of their bulk optics counterparts while facilitating virtually flat, ultrathin, and lightweight optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14349v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials which exhibit the Pockels effect are notable for their strong electro-optic interaction and rapid response times and are therefore used extensively in classical electro-optic components for data and telecommunication applications. Yet many materials optimized for room-temperature operation see their Pockels coefficients at cryogenic temperatures significantly reduced - a major hurdle for emerging quantum technologies which have even more rigorous demands than their classical counterpart. A noted example is $\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$, which features the strongest effective Pockels coefficient at room temperature, only to see it reduced to a third (i.e. $\mathrm{r_{eff}} \approx$ 170 pm/V) at a few Kelvin. Here, we show that this behaviour is not inherent and can even be reversed: Strontium titanate ($\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$), a material normally not featuring a Pockels coefficient, can be engineered to exhibit an $\mathrm{r_{eff}}$ of 345 pm/V at cryogenic temperatures - a record value in any thin-film electro-optic material. By adjusting the stoichiometry, we can increase the Curie temperature and realise a ferroelectric phase that yields a high Pockels coefficient, yet with limited optical losses - on the order of decibels per centimetre. Our findings position $\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ as one of the most promising materials for cryogenic quantum photonics applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional hexagonal materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit valley degrees of freedom, offering fascinating potential for valley-based quantum computing and optoelectronics. In nonlinear optics, the K and K' valleys provide excitation resonances that can be used for ultrafast control of excitons, Bloch oscillations, and Floquet physics. Under intense laser fields, however, the role of coherent carrier dynamics away from the K/K' valleys is largely unexplored. In this study, we observe quantum interferences in high harmonic generation from monolayer $WS_2$ as laser fields drive electrons from the valleys across the full Brillouin zone. In the perturbative regime, interband resonances at the valleys enhance high harmonic generation through multi-photon excitations. In the strong-field regime, the high harmonic spectrum is sensitively controlled by light-driven quantum interferences between the interband valley resonances and intraband currents originating from electrons occupying various points in the Brillouin zone, also away from K/K' valleys such as $\Gamma$ and M. Our experimental observations are in strong agreement with quantum simulations, validating their interpretation. This work proposes new routes for harnessing laser-driven quantum interference in two-dimensional hexagonal systems and all-optical techniques to occupy and read-out electronic structures in the full Brillouin zone via strong-field nonlinear optics, advancing quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03812v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Widefield microscopy is widely used for non-invasive imaging of biological structures at subcellular resolution. When applied to complex specimen, its image quality is degraded by sample-induced optical aberration. Adaptive optics can correct wavefront distortion and restore diffraction-limited resolution but require wavefront sensing and corrective devices, increasing system complexity and cost. Here, we describe a self-supervised machine learning algorithm, CoCoA, that performs joint wavefront estimation and three-dimensional structural information extraction from a single input 3D image stack without the need for external training dataset. We implemented CoCoA for widefield imaging of mouse brain tissues and validated its performance with direct-wavefront-sensing-based adaptive optics. Importantly, we systematically explored and quantitatively characterized the limiting factors of CoCoA's performance. Using CoCoA, we demonstrated the first in vivo widefield mouse brain imaging using machine-learning-based adaptive optics. Incorporating coordinate-based neural representations and a forward physics model, the self-supervised scheme of CoCoA should be applicable to microscopy modalities in general.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new class of functional correlated disordered materials, termed Gyromorphs, which uniquely combine liquid-like translational disorder with quasi-long-range rotational order, induced by a ring of $G$ delta peaks in their structure factor. We generate gyromorphs in $2d$ and $3d$ by spectral optimization methods, verifying that they display strong discrete rotational order but no long-range translational order, while maintaining rotational isotropy at short range for sufficiently large $G$. We show that they are distinct from quasicrystals, which we argue are akin to Fourier ''duals'' of gyromorphs. Using a coupled dipoles approximation, we show that these structures outperform quasicrystals, stealthy hyperuniformity, and Vogel spirals in the formation of low-index-contrast isotropic bandgaps in $2d$, for both scalar and vector waves, and open complete isotropic bandgaps in $3d$. Finally, we introduce ''polygyromorphs'' with several rotational symmetries at different length scales (i.e., multiple rings of delta peaks), enabling the formation of multiple bandgaps in a single structure, thereby paving the way for fine control over optical properties.</description>

      <title>A simple model for entangled photon generation in resonant structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05516</link>

Abstract: The ability to engineer pairs of entangled photons is essential to quantum information science, and generating these states using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in nano- and micrometer-scale materials offers numerous advantages. To properly engineer such sources, a reliable model describing nano- and micrometer-scale SPDC is necessary; however, such a theoretical description remains a challenge. Here, we propose and derive a simplified model to describe SPDC in resonant structures, which considers the generation of photon pairs and the resonant enhancement of spectral bands to be separate processes, even though they actually occur simultaneously. We compare our simplified model to both the rigorous theory of SPDC in an etalon - a simple example of a resonant structure - and our experiments on SPDC in etalons and find agreement for low-gain SPDC. By simplifying the calculations required to generate photon pairs, our model promises to make designing complex resonant structures easier, and it promises to hasten the iteration of designs across the field of quantum state engineering.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen and hydrogen intercalation into crystalline fullerite C$_{60}$ and photoluminescent studies in a wide temperature range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical properties of fullerite C$_{60}$ single crystals saturated with hydrogen and nitrogen molecules were studied in the temperature range from 20 K to 230 K using the spectral-luminescent method. Saturation was carried out under a pressure of 30 atm at various temperatures from 470 K to 720 K. At saturation temperatures above 520 K for hydrogen and 690 K for nitrogen, chemical interaction of impurity molecules and the fullerene matrix occurs, forming new chemical compounds. The results of a study of the photoluminescent properties of a new substances are presented for the first time.</description>
