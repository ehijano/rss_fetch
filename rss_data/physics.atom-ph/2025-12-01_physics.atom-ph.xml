      <title>Phase evolution of superposition target states in adiabatic population transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) when the final state is a superposition of two non-degenerate states. The system consists of four states coupled by two light fields. We find the relative phase of the final superposition depends on relative amplitude, width and timing of the adiabatic transfer pulses. We discuss these results in the context of experiments measuring symmetry violation in atomic and molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Relativistic recoil as a key to the fine-structure puzzle in muonic $^{90}\text{Zr}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-standing fine-structure anomaly in muonic $^{90}$Zr is resolved through a rigorous treatment of the relativistic-recoil effect. From a fit of ab initio QED calculations of the muonic $^{90}$Zr spectrum to precision measurements performed four decades ago, we extract a significantly more precise root-mean-square (rms) charge radius with 6-fold improvement in quality of the fit. A 2-parameter Fermi (2pF) distribution is assumed to model the nuclear charge density and yields a best-fit value of rms charge radius of $r_\text{rms}[^{90}\text{Zr}]=4.2732(7)$ fm ($\chi^2 /{\text{DoF}} = 0.995$), in agreement with the previous muonic spectroscopy value, but a factor $6$ more precise, and 3$\sigma$ larger than the accepted literature value. Additionally, the same analysis has been performed for $^{120}$Sn, where the extracted value of $r_\text{rms}[^{120}\text{Sn}]=4.6518(34)$ fm ($\chi^2 /{\text{DoF}} = 0.88$) is consistent with the accepted value. These results confirm our assumption that the muonic fine-structure puzzle arose from an incomplete treatment of QED effects and their uncertainties.</description>

      <title>A permanent-magnet Zeeman slower and magneto-optical trap for calcium atoms for ultracold Rydberg physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the construction and characterization of an experimental setup for producing a cold gas of $^{40}$Ca atoms and excite them to high Rydberg states with a resonant three-photon-excitation scheme. The apparatus comprises four stages, each designed in-house. An oven heated to $\sim 500^\circ$C generates an atomic beam that is collimated by a capillary stack. The beam is sent into a passive, permanent-magnet-based Zeeman slower that reduces the atomic velocity to $30$ m/s. The slow atoms are captured in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) and cooled to $1.0(3)$ mK with a trapping time of $16(2)$ ms. Ground-state atoms in the cold gas are excited to high Rydberg states via resonant excitation through the intermediate $4s4p\, ^1P_1$ and $4s4d\, ^1D_2$ states. The MOT is operated at the center of an electrode stack, which serves to apply continuous and pulsed electric fields and field-ionize the Rydberg atoms for detection. We benchmark our MOT against previous implementations and find its performance consistent with state-of-the-art results in terms of temperature and trapping lifetime. Finally, we demonstrate Rydberg spectroscopy of calcium, confirming the system's suitability for ultracold Rydberg physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary control of the temporal waveform of photons during spontaneous emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of the temporal waveform and Fock state statistics of photons produced during spontaneous emission from single quantum emitters provides a crucial tool in the establishment of hybrid quantum systems, optimal state transfer and interferometric stability of network architectures based on flying qubits. We describe a method to generate photons of any temporal waveform from emitters of any lifetime. Our broadly applicable approach has only two requirements for a candidate qudit: (1) control of the phase-parity and (2) modulation of the amplitude of a field coupling a ground state to an excited manifold which produces a photon during relaxation. We detail how to find optimal excitation pulse shapes, both numerically and experimentally, by employing variational algorithms to feedback on atomic populations. Additionally, we develop Quantum Monte Carlo based tools to determine emission statistics and establish techniques for optimal post-selection to ensure maximum fidelity of photon generation protocols. We situate our work in the context of other prior research on bespoke single photon sources and networking including post-emission pulse shaping, temporal gating and cavity-based methods. In comparison, our free-space process has greater flexibility in producing any waveform, requires less infrastructure and can be readily applied across a wide domain of emitters of any frequency or lifetime. We demonstrate temporal waveform shaping in $^{174}$Yb$^+$ trapped ions. Using feedforward validation of photon waveforms, we estimate an achievable process fidelity of at least $\approx$0.996.</description>

      <title>Superradiant decay in non-Markovian Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An array of initially excited emitters coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide exhibits superradiant decay under the Born-Markov approximation, manifested as a coherent burst of photons in the output field. In this work, we employ tensor-network methods to investigate its non-Markovian dynamics induced by finite time delays in photon exchange among the emitters. We find that the superradiant burst breaks into a structured train of correlated photons, each intensity peak corresponding to a specific photon number. We quantify the emitter-photon and emitter-emitter entanglement generated during this process and show that the latter emerges in the long-time limit, as part of the excitation becomes trapped within the emitters' singlet subspace. We finally consider the decay of the system's most radiant state, the symmetric Dicke state, and show that time delay can lead to decay rates exceeding those predicted by the Markovian approximation.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of argon gas breakdown with symmetric and asymmetric electrode configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Paschen law relates the breakdown voltage of a gas to the product of gas pressure and inter-electrode distance, predicting a characteristic minimum voltage at a specific pd value. In this study, the role of electrode configurations (symmetric and asymmetric) and inter-electrode spacing on the gas breakdown processes (or Paschen Law) is examined. Numerous sets of experiments are performed with both symmetric and asymmetric electrode configurations of different sizes to obtain Paschen curves at different inter-electrode distances. The experimentally obtained Paschen's curves for different electrode configurations are fitted using a proposed modified empirical relation for breakdown voltage, incorporating variable power-law dependencies and fitting parameters to better capture the observed deviations. Upon closer inspection, we observed that the breakdown voltage and the corresponding pd value are influenced by both electrode configurations and the inter-electrode discharge gap. The variation in breakdown voltage and pd minima for different electrode configurations is explained by analyzing the electric field distributions between the electrodes (cathode and anode) for an applied voltage.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space fragmentation in driven-dephasing Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the onset and mechanism of Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) in a chain of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms subject to local dephasing. It is found that the emergence of multiple long-lived metastable states is fundamentally tied to HSF of the driven-dephasing Rydberg atom system. We demonstrate that the manifesting HSF is captured by a dephasing PXP model that supports multiple degenerate zero modes. These modes form disconnected, block-diagonal subspaces of maximally mixed states, which consist of many-body spin states sharing the same symmetry. A key result is the identification of the underlying symmetry in the HSF, where conserved quantities in each subspace are defined by the consecutive double excitation addressing operator. Moreover, we show explicitly that the number of the fragmented Hilbert space grows exponentially with the chain length, following a modified Fibonacci sequence. Our work provides insights into many-body dynamics under dynamical constraints and opens avenues for controlling and manipulating HSF in Rydberg atom systems.</description>

      <title>Wideband search for axionlike dark matter using octupolar nuclei in a crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most of the matter in the universe is in the form of dark matter, that has evaded detection so far. ALPs -- ultralight axionlike particles -- are a class of dark matter candidates that produce measurable signatures in the form of oscillating violations of discrete symmetries in nuclei. We report results from a search for an oscillating parity-odd time-reversal-odd nuclear Schiff moment of $^{153}$Eu ions in a crystal, which leads to constraints on ALP-gluon coupling strength across a wide band spanning eight decades in ALP mass.</description>

      <title>Puzzling Isotonic Odd-Even Staggering of Charge Radii in Deformed Rare Earth Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nuclear charge radius is a fundamental observable that encodes key aspects of nuclear structure, deformation, and pairing. Isotonic (constant neutron number) systematics in the deformed rare-earth region have long suggested that odd-$Z$ nuclei are more compact than their even-$Z$ neighbors - except for Lu, whose recommended radius appeared anomalously large relative to Yb and Hf. We report a high-precision determination of the natural-abundance-averaged Lu-Yb charge-radius difference using extreme-ultraviolet spectroscopy of highly charged Na-like and Mg-like ions, supported by high-accuracy relativistic atomic-structure calculations - a recently introduced method with the unique ability to measure inter-element charge radius differences. Combined with muonic-atom and optical isotope-shift data, our result resolves the longstanding Lu inversion anomaly and reestablishes a pronounced odd-even staggering along the $N=94$ isotonic chain. The magnitude of this staggering is unexpectedly large, far exceeding that observed in semi-magic nuclei and in deformed isotopic sequences. State-of-the-art nuclear density functional theory calculations, including quantified uncertainties, fail to reproduce this enhancement, possibly indicating missing structural effects in current models. Our work demonstrates the power of highly charged ions for precise, element-crossing charge-radius measurements and provides stringent new constraints for future theoretical and experimental studies of nuclear-size systematics.</description>

      <title>Production and stabilization of a spin mixture of ultracold dipolar Bose gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixtures of ultracold gases with long-range interactions are expected to open new avenues in the study of quantum matter. Natural candidates for this research are spin mixtures of atomic species with large magnetic moments. However, the lifetime of such assemblies can be strongly affected by the dipolar relaxation that occurs in spin-flip collisions. Here we present experimental results for a mixture composed of the two lowest Zeeman states of $^{162}$Dy atoms, that act as dark states with respect to a light-induced quadratic Zeeman effect. We show that, due to an interference phenomenon, the rate for such inelastic processes is dramatically reduced with respect to the Wigner threshold law. Additionally, we determine the scattering lengths characterizing the s-wave interaction between these states, providing all necessary data to predict the miscibility range of the mixture, depending on its dimensionality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optically addressable solid-state spins have been extensively studied for quantum technologies, offering unique advantages for quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Advancing these applications is generally limited by finding materials that simultaneously provide lifetime-limited optical and long spin coherences. Here, we introduce $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$ ions doped into a CaWO$_4$ crystal. We perform high-resolution spectroscopy of the excited state, and demonstrate all-optical coherent control of the electron-nuclear spin ensemble. We find narrow inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transitions of 185 MHz and radiative-lifetime-limited coherence time up to 0.75~ms. Next to this, we measure a spin-transition ensemble line width of 5 kHz and electron-nuclear spin coherence time reaching 0.15~seconds at zero magnetic field between 50~mK and 1~K temperatures. These results demonstrate the potential of $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$ as a low-noise platform for building quantum technologies with ensemble-based memories, microwave-to-optical transducers, and optically addressable single-ion spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Superradiant Peak Emission in Spatially Extended Emitter Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum optics, superradiance is a phenomenon in which a system of $N$ fully excited quantum emitters radiate intense flashes of light during collective decay. However, computing its peak intensity exactly for many spatially separated emitters remains challenging due to the exponential growth of the underlying Hilbert space with system size $N$. Based on third-order cumulant expansion methods, we present general scaling laws for the expononent of the peak emission rate as a function of the emitter number in free-space emitter arrays and arrays coupled to one-dimensional waveguide reservoirs. We find, that for 1D chains in free-space the peak emission rate scales linearly with $N$, while for 2D and 3D arrays with finite emitter spacing it scales superlinearly but sub-quadratically. For emitter chains coupled to waveguide reservoirs we find that the peak emission rate scales quadratically with $N$.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of electrically levitated nanoparticle-ion systems: Motional dynamics and sympathetic cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory describing the quantum coupled dynamics of the center-of-mass motion of a nanoparticle and an ensemble of ions co-trapped in a dual-frequency linear Paul trap. We first derive analytical expressions for the motional frequencies and classical trajectories of both nanoparticle and ions. We then derive a quantum master equation for the ion-nanoparticle system and quantify the sympathetic cooling of the nanoparticle motion enabled by its Coulomb coupling to a continuously Doppler-cooled ion. We predict that motional cooling down to sub-kelvin temperatures is achievable in state-of-the-art experiments even in the absence of motional feedback and in the presence of micromotion. We then extend our analysis to an ensemble of $N$ ions, predicting a linear increase of the cooling rate as a function of $N$ and motional cooling of the nanoparticle down to tenths of millikelvin in current experimental platforms. Our work establishes the theoretical toolbox needed to explore the ion-assisted preparation of non-Gaussian motional states of levitated nanoparticles.</description>
