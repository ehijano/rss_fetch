      <title>Topological transition as a percolation of the Berry curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first study the importance of the sign of the Berry curvature in the Euler characteristic of the two-dimensional topological material with two bands. Then we report an observation of a character of the topological transition as a percolation of the sign of the Berry curvature. The Berry curvature F has peaks at the Dirac points, enabling us to divide the Brillouin zone into two regions depending on the sign of the F: one with the same sign with a peak and the other with the opposite sign. We observed that when the Chern number is non-zero, the oppositely signed regions are localized. In contrast, in the case of a trivial topology, the oppositely signed regions are delocalized dominantly. Therefore, the oppositely signed region will percolate under the topological phase transition from non-trivial to trivial. We checked this for several models including the Haldane model, the extended Haldane model, and the QWZ model. Our observation may serve as a novel feature of the topological phase transition.</description>

      <title>Electrical Detection of Magnetization Switching in Single-Molecule Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) with chemically tailorable properties are potential building blocks for quantum computing, high-density magnetic memory, and spintronics.1 2 3,4 These applications require isolated or few molecules on substrates, but studies of SMMs have mainly focused on bulk crystals. Moreover, fabrication of SMM-based devices and electrical detection of the SMM magnetic state are still coveted milestones that have so far been achieved mainly for double-decker rare-earth phthalocyanines at temperatures below 1 K.5-8 Here we demonstrate electrical detection of magnetization switching for a modification of the archetypal SMM Mn12, up to 70 K, based on the supramolecular spin valve effect5 with graphene quantum dots9. Notably, the exchange interaction between the molecules and the graphene, as well as the dot-mediated intermolecular interaction, can be directly extracted from the electrical response, opening the way to an effective characterization of the quantum properties of different types of SMMs in a wide temperature range.</description>

      <title>Realization of topological phase in a chiral honeycomb lattice model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate topological properties of a chiral honeycomb lattice model with next-nearest-neighbor hoppings characterized by the reflection symmetry breaking. Topological nontriviality is detected by analyzing effective Dirac Hamiltonian, and confirmed by numerical and analytical study of the emergence of topological edge states at the boundaries between topologically distinct regions. We have also discovered that a novel asymmetric edge current attributable to chirality can be excited without any involved phase shifts in input sources to pick up one of the pseudospin components.</description>

      <title>Floquet Engineering of Relativistic Electrons using Propagating Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the electronic states of quantum materials influenced by waves V(Qx-omega t) propagating through them. These waves can include laser light, polaritons, acoustic waves, and sliding density waves, whose speed may vary widely. Since these waves are periodic in both space and time, the electrons in the materials form Floquet-Bloch states when influenced by the waves. We investigate band engineering by these waves, using three-dimensional (3D) Dirac electrons in circularly polarized laser wave as a case study. We classify the fields by their speed into time, light and space-like waves, and find that the electronic states are distinctive in the three cases. We demonstrate phase transitions of the electronic bands and discover emergent Floquet Weyl bands, which potentially become Type-II in the vicinity of the transition. The effect of Floquet band engineering is enhanced by Lorentz contraction, which is maximized when the wave speed approaches the Fermi velocity. Additionally, we discuss the geometric nature of the response currents.</description>

      <title>Spin-wave Goos-H\"{a}nchen effect induced by 360 degree domain walls in magnetic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, lateral displacements of transmitted and reflected spin waves at a 360 degree domain wall (360DW), which is referred to as the spin-wave Goos-H\"{a}nchen effect (SWGHE), are systematically investigated in magnetic heterostructures with perpendicular easy/hard axis and wall-extension direction. Similar to the counterpart at heterochiral interfaces, the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (IDMI) originating from a heavy-metal substrate is important for the emergence of SWGHE. More interestingly, the SWGHE can even survive in ferromagnets with biaxial anisotropy (either intrinsic or caused by shape anisotropy) in the absence of IDMI due to the unique 360DW-induced potentials which are distinct to the well-known P\"{o}schl-Teller ones. Numerics shows that these lateral displacements are generally fractions of the spin-wave wavelength. They can be further enhanced by an array of well-separated 360DWs thus provide a large variety for spin-wave manipulation.</description>

      <title>All-electrical operation of a spin qubit coupled to a high-Q resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building a practical quantum processor involves integrating millions of physical qubits along with the necessary components for individual qubit manipulation and readout. Arrays of gated silicon spins offer a promising route toward achieving this goal. Optimized radio frequency resonators with high internal quality factor are based on superconducting inductors and enable fast spin readout. All-electrical spin control and gate-dispersive readout remove the need for additional device components and simplify scaling. However, superconducting high-Q tank circuits are susceptible to crosstalk induced ringup from electrical qubit control pulses, which causes fluctuations of the quantum dot potential and is suspected to degrade qubit performance. Here, we report on the coherent and all-electrical control of a hole spin qubit at 1.5K, integrated into a silicon fin field-effect transistor and connected to a niobium nitride nanowire inductor gate-sensor. Our experiments show that qubit control pulses with their broad range of higher harmonics ring up the tank when the control pulse spectrum overlaps with the tank resonance. This can cause a reduction of the readout visibility if the tank ringing amplitude exceeds the excited state splitting of the quantum dot, lifting Pauli spin blockade and thus leading to state preparation and measurement errors. We demonstrate how to circumvent these effects by engineering control pulses around the tank resonances. Importantly, we find that the ringup does not limit the spin coherence time, indicating that efficient high-Q resonators in gate-sensing are compatible with all-electrical spin control.</description>

      <title>In-plane dielectric constant and conductivity of confined water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water is essential for almost every aspect of life on our planet and, unsurprisingly, its properties have been studied in great detail. However, disproportionately little remains known about the electrical properties of interfacial and strongly confined water where its structure deviates from that of bulk water, becoming distinctly layered. The structural change is expected to affect water's conductivity and particularly its polarizability, which in turn modifies intermolecular forces that play a crucial role in many physical and chemical processes. Here we use scanning dielectric microscopy to probe the in-plane electrical properties of water confined between atomically flat surfaces separated by distances down to 1 nm. For confinement exceeding a few nm, water exhibits an in-plane dielectric constant close to that of bulk water and its proton conductivity is notably enhanced, gradually increasing with decreasing water thickness. This trend abruptly changes when the confined water becomes only a few molecules thick. Its in-plane dielectric constant reaches giant, ferroelectric-like values of about 1,000 whereas the conductivity peaks at a few S/m, close to values characteristic of superionic liquids. We attribute the enhancement to strongly disordered hydrogen bonding induced by the few-layer confinement, which facilitates both easier in-plane polarization of molecular dipoles and faster proton exchange. This insight into the electrical properties of nanoconfined water is important for understanding many phenomena that occur at aqueous interfaces and in nanoscale pores.</description>

      <title>On the temporal bandwidth of consecutive polariton amplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of organic polaritonics has led to the realisation of all-optical transistors, logic gates, and single photon-switches operating at room temperature. In this Letter, we develop a microscopic theory accounting for thermalisation, vibron-relaxation, and radiative and ballistic polariton losses to investigate the intrinsic limitations of the temporal separation of consecutive polariton condensates. We test and verify our theoretical predictions using an optical pump-pump configuration with different pulse width and unravel the importance of lateral ballistic losses in defining the upper limit of the temporal bandwidth, reaching ~240 GHz.</description>

      <title>Andreev Reflection in the Quantum Hall Regime at an Al/InAs Junction on a Cleaved Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have fabricated a superconductor/semiconductor junction composed of Al and InAs using cleaved edge overgrowth (CEO). By exploiting the unique geometry with a thin Al/Pt/Al trilayer formed on the side surface of an in-situ cleaved heterostructure wafer containing an InAs quantum well (QW), we achieve a superconducting critical field of $\sim 5$~T, allowing superconductivity and quantum Hall (QH) effects to coexist down to filling factor $\nu = 3$. Andreev reflection at zero magnetic field shows a conductance enhancement that is limited solely by the Fermi velocity mismatch, demonstrating a virtually barrier-free, high-quality S/Sm junction. Bias spectroscopy in the QH regime reveals a clear bias dependence indicating the superconducting gap, with the reduced downstream resistance demonstrating that the electron-hole Andreev conversion probability consistently exceeds 50\%. Our results, obtained in a new experimental regime characterized by a clean edge-contacted junction, a much smaller superconducting gap, and a narrow superconducting electrode less than the coherence length, open a new avenue for both theoretical and experimental studies of the interplay between superconductivity and QH effects and the engineering of exotic quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Persistent nodal magnon-photon polariton in ferromagnetic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points with coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors are spectral singularities in the parameter space, achieving which often needs fine-tuning of parameters in quantum systems. We predict a persistent realization of nodal magnon-photon polariton, i.e., a polariton without any gap splitting in a thin ferromagnetic insulator film sandwiched by two normal metals, which persistently exists when the ferromagnet is sufficiently thick $\sim 100$~nm. We perform the model calculation beyond the perturbation theory using a classical approach, develop a quantum scheme able to account for the Ohmic dissipation, and find ultrastrong coupling with coupling strength comparable to the bare magnon frequency. Via revealing a simple conversion relation we extend this formalism to superconductors and predict the gap opened by the ultrastrong coupling strongly depends on the direction of polariton propagation. Our findings may help search for robust non-Hermitian topological phases in magnonic and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of the electron and hole Land\'e g-factors in CsPbI3 nanocrystals in a glass matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent spin dynamics of electrons and holes in CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals in a glass matrix are studied by the time-resolved Faraday ellipticity technique in magnetic fields up to 430 mT across a temperature range from 6 K up to 120 K. The Land\'e g-factors and spin dephasing times are evaluated from the observed Larmor precession of electron and hole spins. The nanocrystal size in the three studied samples varies from about 8 to 16 nm, resulting in exciton transition varying from 1.69 to 1.78 eV at the temperature of 6 K, allowing us to study the corresponding energy dependence of the g-factors. The electron g-factor decreases with increasing confinement energy in the NCs as result of NC size reduction, and also with increasing temperature. The hole g-factor shows the opposite trend. A model analysis shows that the variation of g-factors with NC size arises from the transition energy dependence of the g-factors, which becomes strongly renormalized by temperature.</description>

      <title>Clock Transitions Generated by Defects in Silica Glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clock transitions (CTs) in spin systems, which occur at avoided level crossings, enhance quantum coherence lifetimes T$_2$ because the transition becomes immune to the decohering effects of magnetic field fluctuations to first order. We present the first electron-spin resonance (ESR) characterization of CTs in certain defect-rich silica glasses, noting coherence times up to 16 $\mu$s at the CTs. We find CT behavior at zero magnetic field in borosilicate and aluminosilicate glasses, but not in a variety of silica glasses lacking boron or aluminum. Annealing reduces or eliminates the zero-field signal. Since boron and aluminum have the same valence and are acceptors when substituted for silicon, we suggest the observed CT behavior could be generated by a spin-1 boron vacancy center within the borosilicate glass, and similarly, an aluminum-vacancy center in the aluminosilicate glass.</description>

Abstract: Since the discovery of two-dimensional ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials, the van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures constructed by ferroelectric and ferromagnetic monolayers have soon become the ideal platforms to achieve converse magnetoelectric functions at the nanoscale, namely to use electric field to control magnetization. In this Letter, by employing density functional theory calculations and dynamic simulations of atomic spin model, we study the key role of interfacial Dzyaloshinshii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in CrI$_3$-In$_2$Se$_3$ vdW heterostructures. Our work demonstrates feasible DMI torques pumped by ferroelectric switching, which can drive current-free and low-energy consumption domain wall motion. Moreover, such interfacial DMI can also significantly enlarge the Walker field in magnetic field-driven domain wall technique.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced dynamical self-organized twisted-bilayer lattices in Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating crystal bilayers twisted with respect to each other would lead to large periodic supercell structures, which can support a wide range of novel electron correlated phenomena, where the full understanding is still under debate. Here, we propose a new scheme to realize a nonlinearity-induced dynamical self-organized twisted-bilayer lattice in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The key idea here is to utilize the nonlinear effect from the intrinsic atomic interactions to couple different layers and induce a dynamical self-organized supercell structure, dramatically distinct from the conventional wisdom to achieve the static twisted-bilayer lattices. To illustrate that, we study the dynamics of a two-component BEC and show that the nonlinear interaction effect naturally emerged in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation of interacting bosonic ultracold atoms can dynamically induce both periodic (commensurable) and aperiodic (incommensurable) moir\'{e} structures. One of the interesting moir\'{e} phenomena, i.e., the flat-band physics, is shown through investigating the dynamics of the wave packet of BEC. Our proposal can be implemented using available state-of-the-art experimental techniques and reveal a profound connection between the nonlinearity and twistronics in cold atom quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature efficient single-photon generation from CdSe/ZnS nanoplateletes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the search for materials for quantum information science applications, colloidal semiconductor nanoplatelets (NPLs) have emerged as a highly promising new class of materials due to their interesting optical properties, such as narrow emission linewidth and fast photoluminescence (PL) lifetimes at room temperature. So far only few works focused on the quantum properties of their emission, however, NPLs, with their atomic-scale thickness and one-dimensional quantum confinement, are promising candidates for single-photon sources. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature single-photon emission from core/shell CdSe/ZnS NPLs, which feature 8$x$20 nm$^2$ surface area and 1 nm shell. The limited surface area ensures effective Auger non-radiative recombination, resulting in highly efficient single-photon generation with values of photon purity as low as $g^{(2)}(\tau)=0.04$. The observed long-period blinking and bleaching, typical of such thin shells, can be easily reduced by increasing the shell thickness. This work establishes NPLs as new single-photon sources very well suited for integration into quantum photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Electrical control of magnons in multiferroic NiI$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered van der Waals two-dimensional (2D) magnets are a cornerstone of ultrathin spintronic and magnonic devices. The recent discovery of a 2D multiferroic with strong magnetoelectric coupling in NiI$_2$ offers a promising platform for the electrical control of spin-wave transport. In this work, using ab initio calculations, we investigate how the magnonic properties of monolayer NiI$_2$ can be controlled using an external electric field. We show that the emergence of a ferroelectric polarization leads to an energy splitting in the magnon spectrum, thus establishing a way to detect the electric polarization experimentally. We also show the modulation of the magnon splitting and the energy position of the singularities in magnon DOS by an electric field due to the strong magnetoelectric coupling. Our results highlight the interplay between ferroelectricity and magnons in van der Waals multiferroics and pave the way to design electrically tunable magnetic devices at the 2D limit.</description>

      <title>Slow decay rate of correlations induced by long-range extended Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the impact of long-range Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction in the extended XY model on the phase diagram as well as the static and dynamical properties of quantum and classical correlation functions. It is known that in the nearest-neighbor XY model with DM interaction, the transition from the gapless chiral phase to a gapped one occurs when the strengths of the DM interaction and anisotropy coincide. We exhibit that the critical line gets modified with the range of interactions which decay according to power-law. Specifically, instead of being gapless in the presence of a strong DM interaction, a gapped region emerges which grows with the increase of the moderate fall-off rate (quasi-long range regime) in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. The gapless chiral phase can also be separated from a gapped one by the decay patterns of quantum mutual information and classical correlation with distant sites of the ground state which are independent of the fall-off rate in the gapless zone. We observe that the corresponding critical lines that depend on the fall-off rate can also be determined from the effective central charge involved in the scaling of entanglement entropy. We illustrate that in a non-equilibrium setting, the relaxation dynamics of classical correlation, the decay rate of total correlation, and the growth rate of entanglement entropy can be employed to uncover whether the evolving Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian corresponding to the initial state are gapped or gapless.</description>

      <title>Dephasing-assisted transport in a tight-binding chain with a linear potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An environment interacting with a quantum system can enhance transport through the suppression of quantum effects responsible for localization. In this paper, we study the interplay between bulk dephasing and a linear potential in a boundary-driven tight-binding chain. A linear potential induces Wannier-Stark localization in the absence of noise, while dephasing induces diffusive transport in the absence of a tilt. We derive an approximate expression for the steady-state current as a function of both dephasing and tilt which closely matches the exact solution for a wide range of parameters. From it, we find that the maximum current occurs for a dephasing rate equal to the period of Bloch oscillations in the Wannier-Stark localized system. We also find that the current displays a maximum as a function of the system size, provided that the total potential tilt across the chain remains constant. Our results can be verified in current experimental platforms and represents a step forward in analytical studies of environment-assisted transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron spin resonance (ESR) is a powerful tool for characterizing and manipulating spin systems, but commercial ESR spectrometers can be expensive and designed to work in narrow frequency bands. This work presents an inexpensive spectrometer that, when coupled with easy-to-design resonators, enables ESR over a broad frequency range, including at frequencies outside the standard bands. It can operate at either a single frequency or at two frequencies simultaneously. The spectrometer is built from off-the-shelf parts and controlled by a field programmable gate array (FPGA), and new capabilities can be easily added by reconfiguring the FPGA and adding or swapping components. We demonstrate the capabilities of the spectrometer using the molecular nanomagnet Cr$_7$Mn.</description>

      <title>Quantization of intra- and inter-band Berry phases in the shift current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of the shift current is thus far geometrical without being topological. This means that the real-space displacement/shift of a photoexcited quasiparticle depends on the geometric Berry phase, but the Berry phase is not quantized to a rational multiple of $2\pi$. I rectify this status quo by introducing a new class of topological insulators whose band topology is \textit{only} compatible with a non-centrosymmetric space group. For such insulators, it is impossible to continuously tune the $\boldsymbol{k}$-dependent shift vector to zero throughout the Brillouin zone. Suitably averaged, the shift vector is quantized to a rational multiple of a Bravais lattice vector. Even with wide band gaps, the frequency-integrated shift conductivity greatly exceeds $e^3/h^2$, and is at least three orders of magnitude larger than the conductivity of the prototypical ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$. The large conductivity is attributed to an interplay between quantized intra- and inter-band Berry phases. In particular, topological defects of the inter-band Berry phase can enhance the shift current, even for unpolarized insulators with negligible intra-band Berry phase.</description>

      <title>The quantum geometric origin of capacitance in insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In band insulators, where the Fermi surface is absent, adiabatic transport is allowed only due to the geometry of the Hilbert space. By driving the system at a small but finite frequency $\omega$, transport is still expected to depend sensitively on the quantum geometry. Here we show that this expectation is correct and can be made precise by expressing the Kubo formula for conductivity as the variation of the \emph{time-dependent polarization} with respect to the applied field. In particular, a little appreciated effect is that at linear order in frequency, the longitudinal conductivity results from an intrinsic capacitance, determined by the ratio of the quantum metric and the spectral gap. We demonstrate that this intrinsic capacitance has a measurable effect in a wide range of insulators with non-negligible metric, including the electron gas in a quantizing magnetic field, the gapped bands of hBN-aligned twisted bilayer graphene, and obstructed atomic insulators such as diamond whose large refractive index has a topological origin. We also discuss the influence of quantum geometry on the dielectric constant.</description>

      <title>Magnon spin photogalvanic effect induced by Aharonov-Casher phase</title>

Abstract: Magnons are electrically neutral bosonic quasiparticles emerging as collective spin excitations of magnetically ordered materials, and play a central role in the next-generation spintronics owing to its obviating Joule heating. A difficult obstacle for quantum magnonics is that the magnons do not couple to the external electric field directly so that a direct electric manipulation via bias or gate voltage as in conventional charge-based devices seems not applicable. In this work, we propose a new mechanism in which magnons can be excited and controlled by electric field of light directly. Since the electric field of light can be tuned in a wide and easy way, the proposal is of great interest in realistic applications. We call it as the magnon spin photogalvanic effect (SPGE), which comes from five contributions: the Drude, Berry curvature dipole (BCD), injection, shift, and rectification, with distinct geometric origins. We further show that the responses to linearly-polarized or circularly-polarized light are determined by band-resolved quantum metric or Berry curvature, the two combined together just comprise of a quantum geometric tensor. The proposed magnon SPGE can be measured by a characterized topological phase transition. We also discuss a breathing kagome-lattice model of ferromagnets and suggest possible candidate materials to implement it.</description>

      <title>Circuit-theoretic phenomenological model of an electrostatic gate-controlled bi-SQUID</title>

Abstract: A numerical model based on a lumped circuit element approximation for a bi-superconducting quantum interference device (bi-SQUID) operating in the presence of an external magnetic field is presented in this paper. Included in the model is the novel ability to capture the resultant behaviour of the device when a strong electric field is applied to its Josephson junctions by utilising gate electrodes. The model is used to simulate an all-metallic SNS (Al-Cu-Al) bi-SQUID, where good agreement is observed between the simulated results and the experimental data. The results discussed in this work suggest that the primary consequences of the superconducting field effect induced by the gating of the Josephson junctions are accounted for in our minimal model; namely, the suppression of the junctions super-current. Although based on a simplified semi-empirical model, our results may guide the search for a microscopic origin of this effect by providing a means to model the voltage response of gated SQUIDs. Also, the possible applications of this effect regarding the operation of SQUIDs as ultra-high precision sensors, where the performance of such devices can be improved via careful tuning of the applied gate voltages, are discussed at the end of the paper.</description>

Abstract: The p-wave Cooper-pairing instability in superfluid $^{3}$He, characterized by a parity-breaking excitation gap, is regarded as one of the most rich and complex phenomena in physics. The possibility of a counterpart unconventional p-wave ordering of interacting fermions, in which a Fermi surface spontaneously breaks the parity symmetry, has been an open problem for many decades. Here we identify the realization of the counterpart of p-wave superfluidity in magnetism. We demonstrate a strong parity-breaking and anisotropic symmetry lowering of spin-polarized and time-reversal symmetric Fermi surfaces in a representative p-wave magnet CeNiAsO. As a direct experimental signature we predict a large spontaneous anisotropy of the resistivity. Abundant and robust realizations of the unconventional p-wave magnetism can be identified from suitable non-relativistic crystal-lattice and spin symmetries, without requiring strong correlations and extreme external conditions. This opens new prospects in fields ranging from topological phenomena to spintronics.</description>

Abstract: Heterostructures of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are emerging as a promising platform for investigating exotic correlated states of matter. Here, we propose to engineer Bose-Fermi mixtures in these systems by coupling inter-layer excitons to doped charges in a trilayer structure. Their interactions are determined by the inter-layer trion, whose spin-selective nature allows excitons to mediate an attractive interaction between charge carriers of only one spin species. Remarkably, we find that this causes the system to become unstable to topological p+ip superconductivity at low temperatures. We then demonstrate a general mechanism to develop and control this unconventional state by tuning the trion binding energy using a solid-state Feshbach resonance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The even denominator fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states $\nu=5/2$ and $\nu=7/2$ have been long predicted to host non-abelian quasiparticles (QPs). Their present energy-carrying neutral modes are hidden from customary conductance measurements and thus motivate thermal transport measurements, which are sensitive to all energy-carrying modes. While past `two-terminal' thermal conductance ($k_{2t}T$) measurements already proved the non-Abelian nature of the $\nu=5/2$ FQH state, they might have been prone to a lack of thermal equilibration among the counter-propagating edge modes. Here, we report a novel thermal Hall conductance measurement of the $\nu=5/2$ and $\nu=7/2$ states, being insensitive to equilibration among edge modes. We verify the state's non-Abelian nature, with both states supporting a single upstream Majorana edge mode (hence, a particle-hole Pfaffian order). While current numerical works predict a different topological order, this contribution should motivate further theoretical work.</description>

Abstract: Random vacancies in a graphene monolayer induce defect states that are known to form a narrow impurity band centered around zero energy at half-filling. We use a space-resolved formulation of the quantum metric and establish a strong enhancement of the electronic correlations in this impurity band. The enhancement is primarily due to strong correlations between pairs of vacancies situated on different sublattices at anomalously large spatial distances. We trace the strong enhancement to both the multifractal vacancy wave functions, which ties the system exactly at the Anderson insulator transition for all defect concentrations, and preserving the chiral symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Spin pumping effect is a sensitive and well-established experimental method in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials. We propose that spin pumping effect can be a valuable probe for non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behaviors at the 2D interface of magnetic heterostructures. We show that the modulations of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) exhibiting power-law scalings in frequency and temperature for NFL metals induced near a quantum critical point (QCP). The exponents are universal parameters inherited from the QCP and reflect the non-quasiparticle nature of spin relaxation in NFLs. We demonstrate the divergent FMR modulations with a particular focus on the Ising nematic QCP at both zero and finite temperatures, which contradicts the conventional Gilbert damping mechanism in normal Fermi liquids. Our theoretical proposal could potentially catalyze a surge in research harnessing insights from spin-dependent non-equilibrium physics at nanoscale, primarily developed for room-temperature functioning spin devices in the rapidly progressing field of spintronics, to access magnetic properties in strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photon-resolved Floquet theory keeps track of the photon exchange of a quantum system with a coherent driving field. It thus complements the standard full-counting statistics that counts the number of photons exchanged with incoherent photon modes giving rise to dissipation. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework describing both situations. We develop methods suitable for an analytical evaluation of low-order cumulants of photonic probability distributions. Within this framework we analyze the two-mode Jaynes-Cummings model to demonstrate that the Photon-resolved Floquet theory and the standard full-counting statistics make consistent statistical predictions. Interestingly, we find that the photon-flux fluctuations diverge for vanishing dissipation, which can be related to an entanglement effect between the driven matter system and the driving field. To substantiate our results, we use our framework to describe efficient photon up-conversion in an ac-driven lambda system, that is characterized by a high signal-to-noise ratio. As the framework is non-perturbative and predicts fluctuations, it paves the way towards non-perturbative spectroscopy, which will assist to improve metrological methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium steady state of the anisotropic open quantum Rabi model, which exhibits first-order and second-order dissipative phase transitions upon varying the degree of anisotropy between the coupling strengths of rotating and counterrotating terms. Using both semiclassical and quantum approaches, we find a rich phase diagram resulting from the interplay between the anisotropy and the dissipation. First, there exists a bistable phase where both the normal and superradiant phases are stable. Second, there are multicritical points where the phase boundaries for the first- and second-order phase transitions meet. We show that a new set of critical exponents governs the scaling of the multicritical points. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of observing the multicritical transitions and bistability using a pair of trapped ions where the anisotropy can be tuned by controlling the intensity of the Raman transitions. Our study enlarges the scope of critical phenomena that may occur in finite-component quantum systems, which could be useful for applications in critical quantum sensing.</description>

Abstract: The Casimir effect is known to be induced from photon fields confined by a small volume, and also its fermionic counterpart has been predicted in a wide range of quantum systems. Here, we investigate what types of Casimir effects can occur from quark fields in dense and thin quark matter. In particular, in the dual chiral density wave, which is a possible ground state of dense quark matter, we find that the Casimir energy oscillates as a function of the thickness of matter. This oscillating Casimir effect is regarded as an analog of that in Weyl semimetals and is attributed to the Weyl points in the momentum space of quark fields. In addition, we show that an oscillation is also induced from the quark Fermi sea, and the total Casimir energy is composed of multiple oscillations.</description>

Abstract: The notion of the flow introduced by Kitaev is a manifestly topological formulation of the winding number on a real lattice. First, we show in this paper that the flow is quite useful for practical numerical computations for systems without translational invariance. Second, we extend it to three dimensions. Namely, we derive a formula of the flow on a three-dimensional lattice, which corresponds to the conventional winding number when systems have translational invariance.</description>

      <title>ACE: A general-purpose non-Markovian open quantum systems simulation toolkit based on process tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a general-purpose computational toolkit for simulating open quantum systems, which provides numerically exact solutions for composites of zero-dimensional quantum systems that may be strongly coupled to multiple, quite general non-Markovian environments. It is based on process tensor matrix product operators (PT-MPOs), which efficiently encapsulate environment influences. The code features implementations of several PT-MPO algorithms, in particular, Automated Compression of Environments (ACE) for general environments comprised of independent modes as well as schemes for generalized spin boson models. The latter includes a divide-and-conquer scheme for periodic PT-MPOs, which enable million time step simulations for realistic models. PT-MPOs can be precalculated and reused for efficiently probing different time-dependent system Hamiltonians. They can also be stacked together and combined to provide numerically complete solutions of small networks of open quantum systems. The code is written in C++ and is fully controllable by configuration files, for which we have developed a versatile and compact human-readable format.</description>

      <title>Retinomorphic Machine Vision in a Network Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing prevalence of AI, demand increases for efficient machine learning hardware. Physical systems are sought which combine image feature detection with the essential nonlinearity for tasks such as image classification. Existing physical hardware typically detects features linearly, then employs digital processing for nonlinear activation. Biological vision systems excel at nonlinear image processing. The retina detects features in ganglion cells via lateral inhibition, where neighbouring cells nonlinearly compete for activation.
  We present a bio-inspired 'retinomorphic' machine vision platform using an on-chip semiconductor network laser. The system detects multiple features in parallel via spatially-overlapping lasing modes, with integrated nonlinearity provided by antagonistic gain competition between modes - a photonic analogue of retinal inhibition. Parallel feature-detection enhances efficiency relative to feature-detection schemes which operate sequentially or via multiple device copies, with Si-compatible processing and a compact micron-scale footprint relative to existing mm-scale systems. We report 98.05% accuracy on MNIST-digits and 87.85% on Fashion-MNIST, with strong performance on short training datasets.</description>
