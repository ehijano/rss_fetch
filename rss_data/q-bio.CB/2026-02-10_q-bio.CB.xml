      <title>Randomness-aware multiscale models of glioma invasion and treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a stochastic multiscale model for glioma growth and invasion in the brain, incorporating the effects of therapeutic interventions. The model accounts for tumor cell migration influenced by brain tissue heterogeneity and anti-crowding mechanisms, while explicitly addressing treatment-related uncertainties through stochastic processes. Starting from a microscopic description of individual cell dynamics, we derive the corresponding system of macroscopic random reaction-diffusion-taxis equations governing cell density and tissue evolution. Finally, we conduct several numerical experiments to assess the efficacy of different treatment protocols, evaluated with respect to both established and newly proposed clinical criteria and measurable outcomes.</description>

      <title>How negative feedback from filamentous actin affects cell shapes and motility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crawling motility of many eukaryotic cells is driven by filamentous actin (F-actin), and regulated by a network of signaling proteins and lipids (including small GTPases). The tangle of positive and negative feedback loops gives rise to various experimentally observed dynamic patterns (``actin waves''). Here we consider a recent prototypical model for actin waves in which F-actin exerts negative feedback onto a GTPase. Guided by recent numerical PDE bifurcation analysis in Hughes (2025) and Hughes et al (2026), we explore cell shapes and motility associated with polar, oscillatory, and traveling waves solutions of a mass-conserved partial differential equation (PDE) model. We use Morpheus (cellular Potts) simulations to investigate the implications of such regimes of behavior on the shapes and motion of cells, and on transitions between modes of behavior. The model demonstrates various cell states, including resting (spatially uniform GTPase), polar cells (static ``zones'' of GTPase), and traveling waves along the cell edge. In some parameter regimes, such states can coexist, so that cells can transition from one behavior to another in response to noisy stimuli.</description>
