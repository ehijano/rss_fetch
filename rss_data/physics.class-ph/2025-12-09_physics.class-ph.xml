      <title>Finite Volume Thermodynamics of an Ideal Gas in a Periodic Box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approach to the thermodynamic limit of a non-relativistic ideal gas in a periodic box is investigated. The single particle wave function obeys twisted boundary condition, $\psi(L)=e^{i\theta}\psi(0)$ for which the free particle spectrum is constructed in terms of the twist angle, $\theta$. The exact density of states is utilized to construct finite-size corrections of thermodynamic observables. Leading finite volume corrections in the free energy do not arise due to the boundary -- its implication for mixing entropy is examined. Finite volume corrections to the average energy, its fluctuations and the pressure are also examined with corrections arising exclusively through the boundary condition. However, the equation of state, the ratio of pressure to energy density, remains unmodified by the boundary.</description>

      <title>Kirchhoff`s Forgotten Contributions to Electromagnetism: Continuity Equation versus Displacement Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1857, Kirchhoff published two seminal papers on the motion of electricity in wires. In that work, he was the first to derive what we now call the telegrapher`s equations, which describes the propagation of electromagnetic signals along a cable at the speed of light, in some conditions. How was Kirchhoff able to describe electromagnetic propagation as early as 1857, when the notion of displacement current which is believed to be the essential ingredient for the propagation of electric and magnetic fields was not introduced by Maxwell until 1861 and fully explained later in 1865? In this paper, we show that Kirchhoff was the first, in his 1857 paper, to introduce the continuity equation when discussing electromagnetic propagation. We argue that the continuity equation used by Kirchhoff is a more fundamental concept now as it was in 1865 than displacement current. In our view, the dynamics of charged particles can be formulated without invoking fields, but the dynamics of fields cannot be formulated without a continuity equation describing the properties of matter.</description>

      <title>On Spavieri's conundrum or the shadow of the twin paradox -- A submission to the One-Way Linear Effect (OWLE) Award</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We deal with a problem concerning a supposed inconsistency in the special relativistic treatment of the so-called linear Sagnac effect. It is shown that, under modern clothes, the root of the difficulty perceived by some authors lies in their uneasiness with the standard solution of the twin paradox. In particular, since the linear Sagnac effect is an absolute effect, no tinkering with conventionality of simultaneity, so far as it preserves the physical content of special relativity, would get us out of the supposed trouble.</description>

      <title>A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Model in the Book</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06651v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective indirect timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron pencil beam.
  I propose a capacitor model of a RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing model in the Book, interpret it and provide understanding of it. Furthermore, I analyze the latter, finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line, corresponding to the duration of electron pencil bunches or beams. The present article touches the topics of getting circle on resonance limit and of deflection sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Halide Perovskite-Chalcohalide Nanocrystal Heterostructures as a Platform for the Synthesis and Investigation of the CsPbCl3-CsPbI3 Epitaxial Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Halide exchange in lead-based halide perovskites has been studied extensively. While mixed Cl-Br or Br-I alloy compositions can be formed with no miscibility gaps, this is precluded for mixed Cl-I compositions, due to the large difference in Cl and I ionic radii. Here, we exploit perovskite-chalcohalide CsPbCl3-Pb4S3Cl2 heterostructures to study the Cl-I exchange and isolate new types of intermediate structures. The epitaxial interface between the Pb4S3Cl2 chalcohalide and the CsPbCl3 perovskite domain significantly influences the intermediate stages of halide exchange in the perovskite domain, leading to coexisting CsPbCl3 and CsPbI3 domains, thereby delivering segmented CsPbI3-CsPbCl3-Pb4S3Cl2 energetically favorable heterostructures, with partial iodide alloying of the CsPbCl3 domain and at the perovskite-chalcohalide interface. The I:CsPbCl3 domain between CsPbI3 and Pb4S3Cl2 enables a gradual lattice expansion across the heterostructure. This design accommodates interfacial strain, with a 5.6% mismatch at the CsPbCl3-CsPbI3 interface and a 3.4% mismatch at the perovskite-chalcohalide interface. Full halide exchange leads to CsPbI3-Pb4S3Cl2 heterostructures. Both in intermediate and fully exchanged heterostructures, the CsPbI3 domain is emissive. In the intermediate structures, the band alignment between the two perovskite domains is type-I, with carriers photogenerated in the CsPbCl3 domain quickly transferring to the CsPbI3 domain, where they can recombine radiatively.</description>

      <title>Parametric Design of a Cable-Driven Coaxial Spherical Parallel Mechanism for Ultrasound Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Haptic interfaces play a critical role in medical teleoperation by enabling surgeons to interact with remote environments through realistic force and motion feedback. Achieving high fidelity in such systems requires balancing performance trade-off among workspace, dexterity, stiffness, inertia, and bandwidth, particularly in applications demanding pure rotational motion. This paper presents the design methodology and kinematic analysis of a Cable-Driven Coaxial Spherical Parallel Mechanism (CDC-SPM) developed to address these challenges. The proposed cable-driven interface design allows for reducing the mass placed at the robot arm end-effector, thereby minimizing inertial loads, enhancing stiffness, and improving dynamic responsiveness. Through parallel and coaxial actuation, the mechanism achieves decoupled rotational degrees of freedom with isotropic force and torque transmission. Simulation and analysis demonstrate that the CDC-SPM provides accurate, responsive, and safe motion characteristics suitable for high-precision haptic applications. These results highlight the mechanism's potential for medical teleoperation tasks such as ultrasound imaging, where precise and intuitive manipulation is essential.</description>

      <title>Resultant Delta-V Estimation from EDR Data Recorded in Automobiles that have Undergone Impact-Induced Yaw Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are several references in the public literature that discuss the effect impact-induced yaw motion has on the measurement of acceleration, vis-\`a-vis accelerometers, in automobile collisions [1], [2], [3], [4]. It is well-understood that direct integration of accelerometer data does not provide accurate velocity components for a vehicle undergoing appreciable rotational motion whether the accelerometers are installed at the vehicle center of gravity or not. Direct integration of accelerometer data is, nonetheless, how event data recorders (EDRs) calculate Delta-V components and care must be taken on the part of the analyst in interpreting this information when the vehicle from which it came was known to have experienced significant yaw motion. As such, in this paper we set out to: (1) examine whether the correct resultant Delta-V at the center of gravity can be determined from the directly-integrated EDR Delta-V components, and (2) to assess what useful Delta-V information can be readily gotten from EDRs that are typically not installed at the vehicle center of gravity.</description>

      <title>Water wave scattering by a surface-mounted rectangular anisotropic elastic plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of water wave scattering by a rectangular anisotropic elastic plate mounted on the ocean surface, with either free or clamped edges. The problem is obtained as an expansion over the dry modes of the elastic plate, which are computed using a Rayleigh--Ritz method. In turn, the component diffraction and radiation problems are solved by formulating a boundary integral equation and solving numerically using a constant panel method. The results are presented to highlight the resonant responses of the plate under different forcing scenarios. In particular, we illustrate how the excitation of certain modes can be forbidden due to symmetry.</description>
