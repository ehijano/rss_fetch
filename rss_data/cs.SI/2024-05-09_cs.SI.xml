      <title>SoMeR: Multi-View User Representation Learning for Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User representation learning aims to capture user preferences, interests, and behaviors in low-dimensional vector representations. These representations have widespread applications in recommendation systems and advertising; however, existing methods typically rely on specific features like text content, activity patterns, or platform metadata, failing to holistically model user behavior across different modalities. To address this limitation, we propose SoMeR, a Social Media user Representation learning framework that incorporates temporal activities, text content, profile information, and network interactions to learn comprehensive user portraits. SoMeR encodes user post streams as sequences of timestamped textual features, uses transformers to embed this along with profile data, and jointly trains with link prediction and contrastive learning objectives to capture user similarity. We demonstrate SoMeR's versatility through two applications: 1) Identifying inauthentic accounts involved in coordinated influence operations by detecting users posting similar content simultaneously, and 2) Measuring increased polarization in online discussions after major events by quantifying how users with different beliefs moved farther apart in the embedding space. SoMeR's ability to holistically model users enables new solutions to important problems around disinformation, societal tensions, and online behavior understanding.</description>

      <title>Learning Social Graph for Inactive User Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social relations have been widely incorporated into recommender systems to alleviate data sparsity problem. However, raw social relations don't always benefit recommendation due to their inferior quality and insufficient quantity, especially for inactive users, whose interacted items are limited. In this paper, we propose a novel social recommendation method called LSIR (\textbf{L}earning \textbf{S}ocial Graph for \textbf{I}nactive User \textbf{R}ecommendation) that learns an optimal social graph structure for social recommendation, especially for inactive users. LSIR recursively aggregates user and item embeddings to collaboratively encode item and user features. Then, graph structure learning (GSL) is employed to refine the raw user-user social graph, by removing noisy edges and adding new edges based on the enhanced embeddings. Meanwhile, mimic learning is implemented to guide active users in mimicking inactive users during model training, which improves the construction of new edges for inactive users. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LSIR achieves significant improvements of up to 129.58\% on NDCG in inactive user recommendation. Our code is available at~\url{https://github.com/liun-online/LSIR}.</description>

      <title>Mutual information and the encoding of contingency tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutual information is commonly used as a measure of similarity between competing labelings of a given set of objects, for example to quantify performance in classification and community detection tasks. As argued recently, however, the mutual information as conventionally defined can return biased results because it neglects the information cost of the so-called contingency table, a crucial component of the similarity calculation. In principle the bias can be rectified by subtracting the appropriate information cost, leading to the modified measure known as the reduced mutual information, but in practice one can only ever compute an upper bound on this information cost, and the value of the reduced mutual information depends crucially on how good a bound is established. In this paper we describe an improved method for encoding contingency tables that gives a substantially better bound in typical use cases, and approaches the ideal value in the common case where the labelings are closely similar, as we demonstrate with extensive numerical results.</description>

      <title>LayerPlexRank: Exploring Node Centrality and Layer Influence through Algebraic Connectivity in Multiplex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the calculation of centrality in complex networks becomes increasingly vital across technological, biological, and social systems, precise and scalable ranking methods are essential for understanding these networks. This paper introduces LayerPlexRank, an algorithm that simultaneously assesses node centrality and layer influence in multiplex networks using algebraic connectivity metrics. This method enhances the robustness of the ranking algorithm by effectively assessing structural changes across layers using random walk, considering the overall connectivity of the graph. We substantiate the utility of LayerPlexRank with theoretical analyses and empirical validations on varied real-world datasets, contrasting it with established centrality measures.</description>

      <title>Private Online Community Detection for Censored Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the private online change detection problem for dynamic communities, using a censored block model (CBM). Focusing on the notion of edge differential privacy (DP), we seek to understand the fundamental tradeoffs between the privacy budget, detection delay, and exact community recovery of community labels. We establish the theoretical lower bound on the delay in detecting changes privately and propose an algorithm capable of identifying changes in the community structure, while maintaining user privacy. Further, we provide theoretical guarantees for the effectiveness of our proposed method by showing necessary and sufficient conditions on change detection and exact recovery under edge DP. Simulation and real data examples are provided to validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Robust Reward Placement under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reward placement is a common optimization problem in network diffusion processes, where a number of rewards are to be placed in a network so as to maximize the total reward obtained as agents move randomly in it. In many settings, the precise mobility network might be one of several possible, based on parameters outside our control, such as the weather conditions affecting peoples' transportation means. Solutions to the reward placement problem must thus be robust to this uncertainty, by achieving a high utility in all possible networks. To study such scenarios, we introduce the Robust Reward Placement problem (RRP). Agents move randomly on a Markovian Mobility Model that has a predetermined set of locations but its precise connectivity is unknown and chosen adversarialy from a known set $\Pi$ of candidates. Network optimization is achieved by selecting a set of reward states, and the goal is to maximize the minimum, among all candidates, ratio of rewards obtained over the optimal solution for each candidate. We first prove that RRP is NP-hard and inapproximable in general. We then develop $\Psi$-Saturate, a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm that achieves an $\epsilon$-additive approximation by exceeding the budget constraint by a factor that scales as $O(ln|\Pi|/\epsilon)$. In addition, we present several heuristics, most prominently one inspired from a dynamic programming algorithm for the max-min 0-1 Knapsack problem. We corroborate our theoretical findings with an experimental evaluation of the methods in both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Spectral Triadic Decompositions of Real-World Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in mathematics and network analysis is to find conditions under which a graph can be partitioned into smaller pieces. The most important tool for this partitioning is the Fiedler vector or discrete Cheeger inequality. These results relate the graph spectrum (eigenvalues of the normalized adjacency matrix) to the ability to break a graph into two pieces, with few edge deletions. An entire subfield of mathematics, called spectral graph theory, has emerged from these results. Yet these results do not say anything about the rich community structure exhibited by real-world networks, which typically have a significant fraction of edges contained in numerous densely clustered blocks. Inspired by the properties of real-world networks, we discover a new spectral condition that relates eigenvalue powers to a network decomposition into densely clustered blocks. We call this the \emph{spectral triadic decomposition}. Our relationship exactly predicts the existence of community structure, as commonly seen in real networked data. Our proof provides an efficient algorithm to produce the spectral triadic decomposition. We observe on numerous social, coauthorship, and citation network datasets that these decompositions have significant correlation with semantically meaningful communities.</description>

      <title>Temporal Dynamics of Coordinated Online Behavior: Stability, Archetypes, and Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale online campaigns, malicious or otherwise, require a significant degree of coordination among participants, which sparked interest in the study of coordinated online behavior. State-of-the-art methods for detecting coordinated behavior perform static analyses, disregarding the temporal dynamics of coordination. Here, we carry out the first dynamic analysis of coordinated behavior. To reach our goal we build a multiplex temporal network and we perform dynamic community detection to identify groups of users that exhibited coordinated behaviors in time. Thanks to our novel approach we find that: (i) coordinated communities feature variable degrees of temporal instability; (ii) dynamic analyses are needed to account for such instability, and results of static analyses can be unreliable and scarcely representative of unstable communities; (iii) some users exhibit distinct archetypal behaviors that have important practical implications; (iv) content and network characteristics contribute to explaining why users leave and join coordinated communities. Our results demonstrate the advantages of dynamic analyses and open up new directions of research on the unfolding of online debates, on the strategies of coordinated communities, and on the patterns of online influence.</description>

      <title>On the Potential of an Independent Avatar to Augment Metaverse Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a computational modelling approach which targets capturing the specifics on how to virtually augment a Metaverse user's available social time capacity via using an independent and autonomous version of her digital representation in the Metaverse. We motivate why this is a fundamental building block to model large-scale social networks in the Metaverse, and emerging properties herein. We envision a Metaverse-focused extension of the traditional avatar concept: An avatar can be as well programmed to operate independently when its user is not controlling it directly, thus turning it into an agent-based digital human representation. This way, we highlight how such an independent avatar could help its user to better navigate their social relationships and optimize their socializing time in the Metaverse by (partly) offloading some interactions to the avatar. We model the setting and identify the characteristic variables by using selected concepts from social sciences: ego networks, social presence, and social cues. Then, we formulate the problem of maximizing the user's non-avatar-mediated spare time as a linear optimization. Finally, we analyze the feasible region of the problem and we present some initial insights on the spare time that can be achieved for different parameter values of the avatar-mediated interactions.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Security and Utility in Next-Generation Epidemic Risk Mitigation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.08069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epidemics like the recent COVID-19 require proactive contact tracing and epidemiological analysis to predict and subsequently contain infection transmissions. The proactive measures require large scale data collection, which simultaneously raise concerns regarding users' privacy. Digital contact tracing systems developed in response to COVID-19 either collected extensive data for effective analytics at the cost of users' privacy or collected minimal data for the sake of user privacy but were ineffective in predicting and mitigating the epidemic risks. We present Silmarillion--in preparation for future epidemics--a system that reconciles user's privacy with rich data collection for higher utility. In Silmarillion, user devices record Bluetooth encounters with beacons installed in strategic locations. The beacons further enrich the encounters with geo-location, location type, and environment conditions at the beacon installation site. This enriched information enables detailed scientific analysis of disease parameters as well as more accurate personalized exposure risk notification. At the same time, Silmarillion provides privacy to all participants and non-participants at the same level as that guaranteed in digital and manual contact tracing. We describe the design of Silmarillion and its communication protocols that ensure user privacy and data security. We also evaluate a prototype of Silmarillion built using low-end IoT boards, showing that the power consumption and user latencies are adequately low for a practical deployment. Finally, we briefly report on a small-scale deployment within a university building as a proof-of-concept.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Heterophily into Graph Neural Networks for Graph Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.07678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often assume strong homophily for graph classification, seldom considering heterophily, which means connected nodes tend to have different class labels and dissimilar features. In real-world scenarios, graphs may have nodes that exhibit both homophily and heterophily. Failing to generalize to this setting makes many GNNs underperform in graph classification. In this paper, we address this limitation by identifying three effective designs and develop a novel GNN architecture called IHGNN (short for Incorporating Heterophily into Graph Neural Networks). These designs include the combination of integration and separation of the ego- and neighbor-embeddings of nodes, adaptive aggregation of node embeddings from different layers, and differentiation between different node embeddings for constructing the graph-level readout function. We empirically validate IHGNN on various graph datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art GNNs for graph classification.</description>

      <title>Network science Ising states of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network science provides very powerful tools for extracting information from interacting data. Although recently the unsupervised detection of phases of matter using machine learning has raised significant interest, the full prediction power of network science has not yet been systematically explored in this context. Here we fill this gap by providing an in-depth statistical, combinatorial, geometrical and topological characterization of 2D Ising snapshot networks (IsingNets) extracted from Monte Carlo simulations of the $2$D Ising model at different temperatures, going across the phase transition. Our analysis reveals the complex organization properties of IsingNets in both the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases and demonstrates the significant deviations of the IsingNets with respect to randomized null models. In particular percolation properties of the IsingNets reflect the existence of the symmetry between configurations with opposite magnetization below the critical temperature and the very compact nature of the two emerging giant clusters revealed by our persistent homology analysis of the IsingNets. Moreover, the IsingNets display a very broad degree distribution and significant degree-degree correlations and weight-degree correlations demonstrating that they encode relevant information present in the configuration space of the $2$D Ising model. The geometrical organization of the critical IsingNets is reflected in their spectral properties deviating from the one of the null model. This work reveals the important insights that network science can bring to the characterization of phases of matter. The set of tools described hereby can be applied as well to numerical and experimental data.</description>
