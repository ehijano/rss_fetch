      <title>Decision problems on geometric tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study decision problems on geometric tilings. First, we study a variant of the Domino problem where square tiles are replaced by geometric tiles of arbitrary shape. We show that, under some weak assumptions, this variant is undecidable regardless of the shapes, extending previous results on rhombus tiles. This result holds even when the geometric tiling is forced to belong to a fixed set.Second, we consider the problem of deciding whether a geometric subshift has finite local complexity, which is a common assumption when studying geometric tilings. We show that it is undecidable even in a simple setting (square shapes with small modifications).</description>

      <title>Algorithmic methods of finite discrete structures. Hamiltonian cycle of a complete graph and the Traveling salesman problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The monography considers the problem of constructing a Hamiltonian cycle in a complete graph. A rule for constructing a Hamiltonian cycle based on isometric cycles of a graph is established. An algorithm for constructing a Hamiltonian cycle based on ring summation of isometric cycles of a graph is presented. Based on the matrix of distances between vertices, the weight of each cycle is determined as an additive sum of the weights of its edges. To construct an optimal route of a graph, the basic idea of finding an optimal route between four vertices is used. Further successive constructions are aimed at joining an adjacent isometric cycle with an increase in the number of vertices by one unit. The recursive process continues until all vertices of the graph are connected. Based on the introduced mathematical apparatus, the monography presents a new algorithm for solving the symmetric Traveling salesman problem. Some examples of solving the problem are provided.</description>

      <title>Cops against a cheating robber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a cheating robot version of Cops and Robber, first introduced by Huggan and Nowakowski, where both the cops and the robber move simultaneously, but the robber is allowed to react to the cops' moves. For conciseness, we refer to this game as Cops and Cheating Robot. The cheating robot number for a graph is the fewest number of cops needed to win on the graph. We introduce a new parameter for this variation, called the push number, which gives the value for the minimum number of cops that move onto the robber's vertex given that there are a cheating robot number of cops on the graph. After producing some elementary results on the push number, we use it to give a relationship between Cops and Cheating Robot and Surrounding Cops and Robbers. We investigate the cheating robot number for planar graphs and give a tight bound for bipartite planar graphs. We show that determining whether a graph has a cheating robot number at most fixed $k$ can be done in polynomial time. We also obtain bounds on the cheating robot number for strong and lexicographic products of graphs.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration of labeled matchings in triangular grid graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new reconfiguration problem of matchings in a triangular grid graph. In this problem, we are given a nearly perfect matching in which each matching edge is labeled, and aim to transform it to a target matching by sliding edges one by one. This problem is motivated to investigate the solvability of a sliding-block puzzle called ``Gourds'' on a hexagonal grid board, introduced by Hamersma et al. [ISAAC 2020]. The main contribution of this paper is to prove that, if a triangular grid graph is factor-critical and has a vertex of degree $6$, then any two matchings can be reconfigured to each other. Moreover, for a triangular grid graph (which may not have a degree-6 vertex), we present another sufficient condition using the local connectivity. Both of our results provide broad sufficient conditions for the solvability of the Gourds puzzle on a hexagonal grid board with holes, where Hamersma et al. left it as an open question.</description>

      <title>Abelian and stochastic sandpile models on complete bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the sandpile model, vertices of a graph are allocated grains of sand. At each unit of time, a grain is added to a randomly chosen vertex. If that causes its number of grains to exceed its degree, that vertex is called unstable, and topples. In the Abelian sandpile model (ASM), topplings are deterministic, whereas in the stochastic sandpile model (SSM) they are random. We study the ASM and SSM on complete bipartite graphs. For the SSM, we provide a stochastic version of Dhar's burning algorithm to check if a given (stable) configuration is recurrent or not, with linear complexity. We also exhibit a bijection between sorted recurrent configurations and pairs of compatible Ferrers diagrams. We then provide a similar bijection for the ASM, and also interpret its recurrent configurations in terms of labelled Motzkin paths.</description>

      <title>Extended Deep Submodular Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel category of set functions called Extended Deep Submodular functions (EDSFs), which are neural network-representable. EDSFs serve as an extension of Deep Submodular Functions (DSFs), inheriting crucial properties from DSFs while addressing innate limitations. It is known that DSFs can represent a limiting subset of submodular functions. In contrast, through an analysis of polymatroid properties, we establish that EDSFs possess the capability to represent all monotone submodular functions, a notable enhancement compared to DSFs. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that EDSFs can represent any monotone set function, indicating the family of EDSFs is equivalent to the family of all monotone set functions. Additionally, we prove that EDSFs maintain the concavity inherent in DSFs when the components of the input vector are non-negative real numbers-an essential feature in certain combinatorial optimization problems. Through extensive experiments, we illustrate that EDSFs exhibit significantly lower empirical generalization error than DSFs in the learning of coverage functions. This suggests that EDSFs present a promising advancement in the representation and learning of set functions with improved generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>The repetition threshold for ternary rich words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2014, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold for infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of length $n$ contain $n$ distinct nonempty palindromic factors. In 2020, Currie, Mol, and Rampersad proved a conjecture of Baranwal and Shallit that the repetition threshold for binary rich words is $2 + \sqrt{2}/2$. In this paper, we prove a structure theorem for $16/7$-power-free ternary rich words. Using the structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich words is $1 + 1/(3 - \mu) \approx 2.25876324$, where $\mu$ is the unique real root of the polynomial $x^3 - 2x^2 - 1$.</description>

      <title>On polynomials associated to Voronoi diagrams of point sets and crossing numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three polynomials are defined for given sets $S$ of $n$ points in general position in the plane: The Voronoi polynomial with coefficients the numbers of vertices of the order-$k$ Voronoi diagrams of $S$, the circle polynomial with coefficients the numbers of circles through three points of $S$ enclosing $k$ points of $S$, and the $E_{\leq k}$ polynomial with coefficients the numbers of (at most $k$)-edges of $S$. We present several formulas for the rectilinear crossing number of $S$ in terms of these polynomials and their roots. We also prove that the roots of the Voronoi polynomial lie on the unit circle if, and only if, $S$ is in convex position. Further, we present bounds on the location of the roots of these polynomials.</description>

      <title>The Density Formula: One Lemma to Bound Them All</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Density Formula for (topological) drawings of graphs in the plane or on the sphere, which relates the number of edges, vertices, crossings, and sizes of cells in the drawing. We demonstrate its capability by providing several applications: we prove tight upper bounds on the edge density of various beyond-planar graph classes, including so-called $k$-planar graphs with $k=1,2$, fan-crossing / fan-planar graphs, $k$-bend RAC-graphs with $k=0,1,2$, quasiplanar graphs, and $k^+$-real face graphs. In some cases ($1$-bend and $2$-bend RAC-graphs and fan-crossing / fan-planar graphs), we thereby obtain the first tight upper bounds on the edge density of the respective graph classes. In other cases, we give new streamlined and significantly shorter proofs for bounds that were already known in the literature. Thanks to the Density Formula, all of our proofs are mostly elementary counting and mostly circumvent the typical intricate case analysis found in earlier proofs. Further, in some cases (simple and non-homotopic quasiplanar graphs), our alternative proofs using the Density Formula lead to the first tight lower bound examples.</description>
