      <title>Soliton dynamics in random fields: The Benjamin-Ono equation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algebraic soliton interactions with a periodic or quasi-periodic random force are investigated using the Benjamin-Ono equation. The random force is modeled as a Fourier series with a finite number of modes and random phases uniformly distributed, while its frequency spectrum has a Gaussian shape centered at a peak frequency. The expected value of the averaged soliton wave field is computed asymptotically and compared with numerical results, showing strong agreement. We identify parameter regimes where the averaged soliton field splits into two steady pulses and a regime where the soliton field splits into two solitons traveling in opposite directions. In the latter case, the averaged soliton speeds are variable. In both scenarios, the soliton field is damped by the external force. Additionally, we identify a regime where the averaged soliton exhibits the following behavior: it splits into two distinct solitons and then recombines to form a single soliton. This motion is periodic over time.</description>

      <title>Navigating with Stability: Local Minima, Patterns, and Evolution in a Gradient Damage Fracture Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In phase-field theories of brittle fracture, crack initiation, growth and path selection are investigated using non-convex energy functionals and a stability criterion. The lack of convexity with respect to the state poses difficulties to monolithic solvers that aim to solve for kinematic and internal variables, simultaneously. In this paper, we inquire into the effectiveness of quasi-Newton algorithms as an alternative to conventional Newton-Raphson solvers. These algorithms improve convergence by constructing a positive definite approximation of the Hessian, bargaining improved convergence with the risk of missing bifurcation points and stability thresholds. Our study focuses on one-dimensional phase-field fracture models of brittle thin films on elastic foundations. Within this framework, in the absence of irreversibility constraint, we construct an equilibrium map that represents all stable and unstable equilibrium states as a function of the external load, using well-known branch-following bifurcation techniques. Our main finding is that quasi-Newton algorithms fail to select stable evolution paths without exact second variation information. To solve this issue, we perform a spectral analysis of the full Hessian, providing optimal perturbations that enable quasi-Newton methods to follow a stable and potentially unique path for crack evolution. Finally, we discuss the stability issues and optimal perturbations in the case when the damage irreversibility is present, changing the topological structure of the set of admissible perturbations from a linear vector space to a convex cone.</description>

      <title>Stability of moving N\'eel walls in ferromagnetic thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies moving 180-degree N\'eel walls in ferromagnetic thin films under the reduced model for the in-plane magnetization proposed by Capella, Melcher and Otto [5], in the case when a sufficiently weak external magnetic field is applied. It is shown that the linearization around the moving N\'eel wall's phase determines a spectral problem that is a relatively bounded perturbation of the linearization around the static N\'eel wall, which is the solution when the external magnetic field is set to zero and which is spectrally stable. Uniform resolvent-type estimates for the linearized operator around the static wall are established in order to prove the spectral stability of the moving wall upon application of perturbation theory for linear operators. The spectral analysis is the basis to prove, in turn, both the decaying properties of the generated semigroup and the nonlinear stability of the moving N\'eel wall under small perturbations, in the case of a sufficiently weak external magnetic field. The stability of the static N\'eel wall, which was established in a companion paper [4], plays a key role to obtain the main result.</description>

      <title>Slip-dominated structural transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use molecular dynamics to show that plastic slip is a crucial component of the transformation mechanism of a square-to-triangular structural transition. The latter is a stylized analog of many other reconstructive phase transitions. To justify our conclusions we use a novel atomistically-informed mesoscopic representation of the field of lattice distortions in molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach reveals a hidden alternating slip distribution behind the seemingly homogeneous product phase which points to the fact that lattice invariant shears play a central role in this class of phase transformations. While the underlying pattern of anti-parallel displacements may also be interpreted as microscopic shuffling, its precise crystallographic nature strongly suggests the plasticity-centered interpretation.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic parameterization of positive streamer heads in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of streamers is determined at their heads, for individual streamers as well as in collective phenomena, such as streamer trees or coronas or streamer bursts ahead of lighting leaders. Some properties of the streamer heads, such as velocity v and radius R now can be measured quite well, but this is very challenging for others such as the maximal electric field, the charge content at the streamer head and the degree of chemical excitation and ionization in the streamer channel. Here we develop, test and evaluate a macroscopic approximation for positive streamer heads in air that relates macroscopic streamer head properties to each other. In particular, we find that velocity v, radius R and background field E_bg determine the complete profile of streamer heads with photoionization, if they propagate steadily. We also revisit Naidis' approximate relation between v, R and the maximal field E_max. The approximate head model consists of three first-order ordinary differential equations along the streamer axis. It is derived from the classical fluid model for streamer discharges by assuming axisymmetry, steady streamer propagation (with constant velocity and shape), and a (semi-)spherical shape of the charge layer. The model shows good agreement with solutions of the classical fluid model, even when it is applied to accelerating streamers. Therefore the model can be used for evaluations of experiments, like measurements of the maximal electric field, and it could be a valuable tool in constructing reduced models for the collective dynamics of many streamer discharges.</description>
