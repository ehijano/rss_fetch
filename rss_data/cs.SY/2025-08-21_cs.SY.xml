      <title>LyLA-Therm: Lyapunov-based Langevin Adaptive Thermodynamic Neural Network Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic principles can be employed to design parameter update laws that address challenges such as the exploration vs. exploitation dilemma. In this paper, inspired by the Langevin equation, an update law is developed for a Lyapunov-based DNN control method, taking the form of a stochastic differential equation. The drift term is designed to minimize the system's generalized internal energy, while the diffusion term is governed by a user-selected generalized temperature law, allowing for more controlled fluctuations. The minimization of generalized internal energy in this design fulfills the exploitation objective, while the temperature-based stochastic noise ensures sufficient exploration. Using a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed Lyapunov-based Langevin Adaptive Thermodynamic (LyLA-Therm) neural network controller achieves probabilistic convergence of the tracking and parameter estimation errors to an ultimate bound. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with the LyLA-Therm architecture achieving up to 20.66% improvement in tracking errors, up to 20.89% improvement in function approximation errors, and up to 11.31% improvement in off-trajectory function approximation errors compared to the baseline deterministic approach.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving Optimal Kron-based Reduction of Radial Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network reduction simplifies complex electrical networks to address computational challenges of large-scale transmission and distribution grids. Traditional network reduction methods are often based on a predefined set of nodes or lines to remain in the reduced network. This paper builds upon previous work on Optimal Kron-based Reduction of Networks (Opti-KRON), which was formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), to enhance the framework in two aspects. First, the scalability is improved via a cutting plane restriction, tightened Big~M bounds, and a zero-injection node reduction stage. Next, we introduce a radiality-preservation step to identify and recover nodes whose restoration ensures radiality of the reduced network. The model is validated through its application to the 533-bus distribution test system and a 3499-bus realistic test feeder for a set of representative loading scenarios. In the 533-bus system, an 85% reduction was achieved with a maximum voltage error below 0.0025 p.u., while in the 3499-bus feeder, over 94% reduction was obtained with maximum voltage errors below 0.002 p.u. Additionally, we show that the radialization step accelerates the runtime of optimal voltage control problems when applied to Kron-reduced networks.</description>

      <title>Discrete VHCs for Propeller Motion of a Devil-Stick using purely Impulsive Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control problem of realizing propeller motion of a devil-stick in the vertical plane using impulsive forces applied normal to the stick is considered. This problem is an example of underactuated robotic juggling and has not been considered in the literature before. Inspired by virtual holonomic constraints, the concept of discrete virtual holonomic constraints (DVHC) is introduced for the first time to solve this orbital stabilization problem. At the discrete instants when impulsive inputs are applied, the location of the center-of-mass of the devil-stick is specified in terms of its orientation angle. This yields the discrete zero dynamics (DZD), which provides conditions for stable propeller motion. In the limiting case, when the rotation angle between successive applications of impulsive inputs is chosen to be arbitrarily small, the problem reduces to that of propeller motion under continuous forcing. A controller that enforces the DVHC, and an orbit stabilizing controller based on the impulse controlled Poincar\'e map approach are presented. The efficacy of the approach to trajectory design and stabilization is validated through simulations.</description>

      <title>Smart Charging Impact Analysis using Clustering Methods and Real-world Distribution Feeders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anticipated widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates a critical evaluation of existing power distribution infrastructures, as EV integration imposes additional stress on distribution networks that can lead to component overloading and power quality degradation. Implementing smart charging mechanisms can mitigate these adverse effects and defer or even avoid upgrades. This study assesses the performance of two smart charging strategies - Time of Use (TOU) pricing and Load Balancing (LB) on seven representative real-world feeders identified using k-means clustering. A time series-based steady-state load flow analysis was conducted on these feeders to simulate the impact of EV charging under both strategies across four different EV enrollment scenarios and three representative days to capture seasonal load characteristics. A grid upgrade strategy has been proposed to strengthen the power grid to support EV integration with minimal cost. Results demonstrate that both TOU and LB strategies effectively manage the additional EV load with reduced upgrade requirement and cost to existing infrastructure compared to the case without smart charging strategies and LB outperforms TOU when the customer enrollment levels are high. These findings support the viability of smart charging in facilitating EV integration while maintaining distribution network reliability and reducing investment cost.</description>

      <title>Locally Differentially Private Multi-Sensor Fusion Estimation With System Intrinsic Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the privacy-preserving multi-sensor fusion estimation (MSFE) problem with differential privacy considerations. Most existing research efforts are directed towards the exploration of traditional differential privacy, also referred to as centralized differential privacy (CDP). It is important to note that CDP is tailored to protect the privacy of statistical data at fusion center such as averages and sums rather than individual data at sensors, which renders it inappropriate for MSFE. Additionally, the definitions and assumptions of CDP are primarily applicable for large-scale systems that require statistical results mentioned above. Therefore, to address these limitations, this paper introduces a more recent advancement known as \emph{local differential privacy (LDP)} to enhance the privacy of MSFE. We provide some rigorous definitions about LDP based on the intrinsic properties of MSFE rather than directly presenting the assumptions under CDP. Subsequently, the LDP is proved to be realized with system intrinsic randomness, which is useful and has never been considered before. Furthermore, the Gaussian mechanism is designed when the intrinsic randomness is insufficient. The lower bound of the covariance for extra injected Gaussian noises is determined by integrating system information with privacy budgets. Moreover, the optimal fusion estimators under intrinsic and extra disturbances are respectively designed in the linear minimum variance sense. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified through numerical simulations, encompassing both one-dimensional and high-dimensional scenarios.</description>

      <title>Why we need a standardized state of health definition for electric vehicle battery packs -- a proposal for energy- and capacity-based metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Range and performance are key customer-relevant properties of electric vehicles. Both degrade over time due to battery aging, thus impacting business decisions throughout a vehicle's lifecycle, such as efficient utilization and asset valuation. For practical assessment, aging is often simplified into a single figure of merit - the state of health - typically defined by the battery pack's remaining capacity or energy. However, no standardized method for measuring the state of health at the vehicle level has been established, leaving both academia and industry without a clear consensus. Ultimately, standardization is crucial to increase transparency and build confidence in the long-term reliability of electric vehicles' battery packs. In this article, we propose a standard measurement procedure for assessing the capacity- and energy-based state of health, leveraging onboard charging to enable reproducibility and scalability. Additionally, we demonstrate how differential voltage analysis can provide deeper insights into battery aging at the vehicle level.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Abstraction and Synthesis for Stochastic Systems with Unknown Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the automated abstraction-based synthesis of correct-by-construction control policies for stochastic dynamical systems with unknown dynamics. Our approach is to learn an abstraction from sampled data, which is represented in the form of a finite Markov decision process (MDP). In this paper, we present a data-driven technique for constructing finite-state interval MDP (IMDP) abstractions of stochastic systems with unknown nonlinear dynamics. As a distinguishing and novel feature, our technique only requires (1) noisy state-input-state observations and (2) an upper bound on the system's Lipschitz constant. Combined with standard model-checking techniques, our IMDP abstractions enable the synthesis of policies that satisfy probabilistic temporal properties (such as "reach-while-avoid") with a predefined confidence. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and SOS-based Stability Verification of a Neural-Network-Based Controller for a Two-wheeled Inverted Pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work newly establishes the feasibility and practical value of a sum of squares (SOS)-based stability verification procedure for applied control problems utilizing neural-network-based controllers (NNCs). It successfully verifies closed-loop stability properties of a NNC synthesized using a generalizable procedure to imitate a robust, tube-based model predictive controller (MPC) for a two-wheeled inverted pendulum demonstrator system. This is achieved by first developing a state estimator and control-oriented model for the two-wheeled inverted pendulum. Next, this control-oriented model is used to synthesize a baseline linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) and a robust, tube-based MPC, which is computationally too demanding for real-time execution on the demonstrator system's embedded hardware. The generalizable synthesis procedure generates an NNC imitating the robust, tube-based MPC. Via an SOS-based stability verification procedure, a certificate of local asymptotic stability and a relevant inner estimate of the region of attraction (RoA) are obtained for the closed-loop system incorporating this NNC. Finally, experimental results on the physical two-wheeled inverted pendulum demonstrate that the NNC both stabilizes the system, and improves the control performance compared to the baseline LQR in both regulation and reference-tracking tasks.</description>

      <title>A Central Chilled Water Plant Model for Designing Learning-Based Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a framework of modeling a central chilled
  water plant (CCWP) that consists of an aggregate
  cooling coil, a number of heterogeneous chillers and
  cooling towers, and a chilled water-based thermal
  energy storage system. We improve upon existing component
  models from the open literature using a constrained
  optimization-based framework to ensure that the models
  respect capacities of all the heat exchangers (cooling
  coils, chillers, and cooling towers) irrespective of
  the inputs provided. As a result, the proposed model has a wider
  range of validity compared to existing models; the
  latter can produce highly erroneous outputs when inputs are not
  within normal operating range. This
  feature is essential for training learning-based
  controllers that can choose inputs beyond normal operating conditions and is lacking in currently available
  models. The overall plant model is
  implemented in Matlab and is made publicly
  available. Simulation of a CCWP with closed loop
  control is provided as an illustration.</description>

      <title>A 16.28 ppm/{\deg}C Temperature Coefficient, 0.5V Low-Voltage CMOS Voltage Reference with Curvature Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a fully-integrated CMOS voltage reference designed in a 90 nm process node using low voltage threshold (LVT) transistor models. The voltage reference leverages subthreshold operation and near-weak inversion characteristics, backed by an all-region MOSFET model. The proposed design achieves a very low operating supply voltage of 0.5 V and a remarkably low temperature coefficient of 16.28 ppm/{\deg}C through the mutual compensation of CTAT, PTAT, and curvature-correction currents, over a wide range from -40 {\deg}C to 130 {\deg}C. A stable reference voltage of 205 mV is generated with a line sensitivity of 1.65 %/V and a power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) of -50 dB at 10 kHz. The circuit achieves all these parameters while maintaining a good power efficiency, consuming only 0.67 {\mu}W.</description>

      <title>Holo-Artisan: A Personalized Multi-User Holographic Experience for Virtual Museums on the Edge Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Holo-Artisan, a novel system architecture enabling immersive multi-user experiences in virtual museums through true holographic displays and personalized edge intelligence. In our design, local edge computing nodes process real-time user data -- including pose, facial expression, and voice -- for multiple visitors concurrently. Generative AI models then drive digital artworks (e.g., a volumetric Mona Lisa) to respond uniquely to each viewer. For instance, the Mona Lisa can return a smile to one visitor while engaging in a spoken Q\&amp;A with another, all in real time. A cloud-assisted collaboration platform composes these interactions in a shared scene using a universal scene description, and employs ray tracing to render high-fidelity, personalized views with a direct pipeline to glasses-free holographic displays. To preserve user privacy and continuously improve personalization, we integrate federated learning (FL) -- edge devices locally fine-tune AI models and share only model updates for aggregation. This edge-centric approach minimizes latency and bandwidth usage, ensuring a synchronized shared experience with individual customization. Through Holo-Artisan, static museum exhibits are transformed into dynamic, living artworks that engage each visitor in a personal dialogue, heralding a new paradigm of cultural heritage interaction.</description>

      <title>A Vision-Based Shared-Control Teleoperation Scheme for Controlling the Robotic Arm of a Four-Legged Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations. However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces. Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot, demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Federated System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems. We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant, this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d. random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components, representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics. We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of participating clients increases.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of Linear Adaptive Filters driven by the Ergodic Chaotic Logistic Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic dynamical systems are increasingly considered for use in coding and transmission systems. This stems from their parameter sensitivity and spectral characteristics. The latter are relevant for channel estimation methods. In particular the logistic map $f_\lambda =\lambda x\left( 1-x\right) $ has been employed in chaotic coding and spread spectrum transmission systems. For $\lambda =4$ the statistical properties of sequences generated by $f_4$ are considered as ideal drive signals for channel estimation schemes. This assumption is proven in the present paper. To this end the higher order statistical moments and the autocorrelation of time series generated by $f_4$ are derived. It is shown that for $\lambda =4$ the zero mean time series is uncorrelated. The adaptation performance of finite impulse response (FIR) digital adaptive filters (DAF) used for channel estimation is analyzed. It is shown that using zero mean sequences of $f_4$ leads to the maximal possible FIR DAF performance. An optimal value for the damping parameter in the LMS scheme is derived that leads to the maximal performance and ensures stability. The analytic considerations are confirmed by simulation results.</description>

      <title>Integrated Take-off Management and Trajectory Optimization for Merging Control in Urban Air Mobility Corridors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has the potential to revolutionize daily transportation, offering rapid and efficient aerial mobility services. Take-off and merging phases are critical for air corridor operations, requiring the coordination of take-off aircraft and corridor traffic while ensuring safety and seamless transition. This paper proposes an integrated take-off management and trajectory optimization for merging control in UAM corridors. We first introduce a novel take-off airspace design. To our knowledge, this paper is one of the first to propose a structured design for take-off airspace. Based on the take-off airspace design, we devise a hierarchical coordinated take-off and merging management (HCTMM) strategy. To be specific, the take-off airspace design can simplify aircraft dynamics and thus reduce the dimensionality of the trajectory optimization problem whilst mitigating obstacle avoidance complexities. The HCTMM strategy strictly ensures safety and improves the efficiency of take-off and merging operations. At the tactical level, a scheduling algorithm coordinates aircraft take-off times and selects dynamic merging points to reduce conflicts and ensure smooth take-off and merging processes. At the operational level, a trajectory optimization strategy ensures that each aircraft reaches the dynamic merging point efficiently while satisfying safety constraints. Simulation results show that, compared to representative strategies with fixed or dynamic merging points, the HCTMM strategy significantly improves operational efficiency and reduces computational burden, while ensuring safety under various corridor traffic conditions. Further results confirm the scalability of the HCTMM strategy and the computational efficiency enabled by the proposed take-off airspace design.</description>

      <title>A Solvable Molecular Switch Model for Stable Temporal Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus, the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we design a novel class of online distributed optimization algorithms leveraging control theoretical techniques. We start by focusing on quadratic costs, and assuming to know an internal model of their variation. In this set-up, we formulate the algorithm design as a robust control problem, showing that it yields a fully distributed algorithm. We also provide a distributed routine to acquire the internal model. We show that the algorithm converges exactly to the sequence of optimal solutions. We empirically evaluate the performance of the algorithm for different choices of parameters. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of the algorithm for quadratic problems with inexact internal model and non-quadratic problems, and show that it outperforms alternative algorithms in both scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address distributed learning problems over undirected networks. Specifically, we focus on designing a novel ADMM-based algorithm that is jointly computation- and communication-efficient. Our design guarantees computational efficiency by allowing agents to use stochastic gradients during local training. Moreover, communication efficiency is achieved as follows: i) the agents perform multiple training epochs between communication rounds, and ii) compressed transmissions are used. We prove exact linear convergence of the algorithm in the strongly convex setting. We corroborate our theoretical results by numerical comparisons with state of the art techniques on a classification task.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Utilizing Dynamic Coupling in Free-Floating Space Manipulators for On-Orbit Servicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a dynamic coupling-informed trajectory optimization algorithm for free-floating space manipulator systems (SMSs). Dynamic coupling between the base and the manipulator arms plays a critical role in influencing the system's behavior. While prior research has predominantly focused on minimizing this coupling, often overlooking its potential advantages, this work investigates how dynamic coupling can instead be leveraged to improve trajectory planning. Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the dynamic coupling matrix is employed to identify the dominant components governing coupling behavior. A quantitative metric is then formulated to characterize the strength and directionality of the coupling and is incorporated into a trajectory optimization framework. To assess the feasibility of the optimized trajectory, a sliding mode control-based tracking controller is designed to generate the required joint torque inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that explicitly accounting for dynamic coupling in trajectory planning enables more informed and potentially more efficient operation, offering new directions for the control of free-floating SMSs.</description>

      <title>Utility-Scale Bifacial Solar Photovoltaic System: Optimum Sizing and Techno-Economic Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical monofacial solar photovoltaic systems have gained prevalence and are widely reported in the literature because they have a lower initial cost compared with bifacial systems. However, limited investigation of both systems has been done on a utility scale with different performance indicators. This paper introduces a multifaceted comparative analysis including various aspects like energy generation, reliability, environmental effect, economic viability, and footprint area. Real measured data, including ambient temperature, solar irradiance, and a utility-scale load, were used for studying both systems in the City of Detroit. The optimal system sizing and energy management strategy are attained using the Whale optimization algorithm. Minimizing the loss of power supply probability and sizing the number of photovoltaic panels (NPV) are carried out for both cases. Results revealed that the bifacial solar system generates more power with a lower NPV, a smaller installation area, and hence a lower levelized cost of energy for the entire project lifetime compared to the monofacial system. Accordingly, the bifacial system outlined in this paper is recommended and can be implemented in various locations to establish a sustainable solar energy system that is economically feasible with clean energy production for the entire project's lifespan.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the solutions for minimizing renewable energy (RE) curtailment in the Texas Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid. By utilizing current and future planning data from ERCOT and the System Advisor Model from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, we examine how future renewable energy (RE) initiatives, combined with utility-scale energy storage, can reduce CO2 emissions while reshaping Texas's energy mix. The study projects the energy landscape from 2023 to 2033, considering the planned phase-out of fossil fuel plants and the integration of new wind/solar projects. By comparing emissions under different load scenarios, with and without storage, we demonstrate storage's role in optimizing RE utilization. The findings of this paper provide actionable guidance for energy stakeholders, underscoring the need to expand wind and solar projects with strategic storage solutions to maximize Texas's RE capacity and substantially reduce CO2 emissions.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Performance and Impact of PV Technologies on Storage in Hybrid Renewable Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional monofacial photovoltaic (mPV) systems are commonly adopted and well-documented because of their lower upfront costs in comparison to bifacial photovoltaic (bPV) systems. This study investigates how PV technologies impact energy storage in grid-scale hybrid renewable systems, focusing on optimizing and assessing the performance of mPV and bPV technologies integrated with pumped storage hydropower. Using Ludington City, Michigan as a case study and analyzing realworld data such as solar irradiance, ambient temperature, and utility-scale load profiles, the research highlights the operational and economic benefits of bPV systems. The results reveal that bPV systems can pump approximately 10.38% more water annually to the upper reservoir while achieving a lower levelized cost of energy ($0.0578/kWh for bPV vs. $0.0672/kWh for mPV). This study underscores the outstanding potential of bPV systems in enhancing energy storage and management strategies, contributing to a more sustainable and resilient renewable energy future.</description>

      <title>A Time Splitting Based Optimization Method for Nonlinear MHE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moving Horizon Estimation~(MHE) is essentially an optimization-based approach designed to estimate the states of dynamic systems within a moving time horizon. Traditional MHE solutions become computationally prohibitive due to the \textit{curse of dimensionality} arising from increasing problem complexity and growing length of time horizon. To address this issue, we propose novel computationally efficient algorithms for solving nonlinear MHE problems. Specifically, we first introduce a distributed reformulation utilizing a time-splitting technique. Leveraging this reformulation, we develop the Efficient Gauss-Newton Augmented Lagrangian Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (ALADIN) to achieve computational efficiency. Additionally, to accommodate limited computational capabilities inherent in some sub-problem solvers, we propose the Efficient Sensitivity Assisted ALADIN, which enables sub-problems to be solved inexactly without hindering computational efficiency. Furthermore, recognizing scenarios where sub-problem solvers possess no computational power, we propose a Distributed Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) that relies solely on first- and second-order information of local objective functions. We demonstrate the performance and advantages of our proposed methods through numerical experiments on differential drive robots case, a practical nonlinear MHE problem. Our results demonstrate that the three proposed algorithms achieve computational efficiency while preserving high accuracy, thereby satisfying the real-time requirements of MHE.</description>

Abstract: The growing integration of power electronic converter-interfaced distributed energy resources into modern power systems presents significant challenges for system monitoring, protection, and control. Grid impedance plays a critical role in the operation and stability assessment of grid-connected inverter systems. This study presents a real-time grid impedance estimation method based on the Discrete Fourier Transform. The proposed method is integrated with the Advanced Angle Estimation Kalman Filter using a Linear Quadratic Regulator current controller (AAEKF-LQR), assisting the use of impedance information for accurate instantaneous phase angle estimation. Simulation results confirm that the proposed impedance estimation method interacts effectively with the AAEKF-LQR controller, maintaining stable system performance under weak grid conditions. The approach also demonstrates the ability to deliver fast and accurate impedance estimation during operational variations in grid conditions, thereby supporting stable inverter operation.</description>

      <title>Monotone Neural Control Barrier Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a neurosymbolic framework for synthesizing and verifying safety controllers in high-dimensional monotone dynamical systems using only linear sample complexity, without requiring explicit models or conservative Lipschitz bounds. The approach combines the expressiveness of neural networks with the rigor of symbolic reasoning via barrier certificates, functional analogs of inductive invariants that formally guarantee safety. Prior data-driven methods often treat dynamics as black-box models, relying on dense state-space discretization or Lipschitz overapproximations, leading to exponential sample complexity. In contrast, monotonicity -- a pervasive structural property in many real-world systems -- provides a symbolic scaffold that simplifies both learning and verification. Exploiting order preservation reduces verification to localized boundary checks, transforming a high-dimensional problem into a tractable, low-dimensional one. Barrier certificates are synthesized using monotone neural networks -- architectures with embedded monotonicity constraints -- trained via gradient-based optimization guided by barrier conditions. This enables scalable, formally sound verification directly from simulation data, bridging black-box learning and formal guarantees within a unified neurosymbolic framework. Empirical results on three large-scale benchmarks -- a 1,000-dimensional freeway traffic model, a 50-dimensional urban traffic network, and a 13,000-dimensional power grid -- demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the approach in real-world, safety-critical systems.</description>

      <title>DCT-MARL: A Dynamic Communication Topology-Based MARL Algorithm for Connected Vehicle Platoon Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of vehicular communication facilities and autonomous driving technologies, connected vehicle platooning has emerged as a promising approach to improve traffic efficiency and driving safety. Reliable Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication is critical to achieving efficient cooperative control. However, in the real-world traffic environment, V2V communication may suffer from time-varying delay and packet loss, leading to degraded control performance and even safety risks. To mitigate the adverse effects of non-ideal communication, this paper proposes a Dynamic Communication Topology based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (DCT-MARL) algorithm for robust cooperative platoon control. Specifically, the state space is augmented with historical control action and delay to enhance robustness against communication delay. To mitigate the impact of packet loss, a multi-key gated communication mechanism is introduced, which dynamically adjusts the communication topology based on the correlation between vehicles and their current communication status. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DCT-MARL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of string stability and driving comfort, validating its superior robustness and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Power System Stability Considering Multiple Time-Scale Dynamics: Insights into Hopf Bifurcations in Presence of GFL and GFM IBRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real power systems exhibit dynamics that evolve across a wide range of time scales, from very fast to very slow phenomena. Historically, incorporating these wide-ranging dynamics into a single model has been impractical. As a result, power engineers rely on time-scale decomposition to simplify models. When fast phenomena are evaluated, slow dynamics are neglected (assumed stable), and vice versa. This paper challenges this paradigm by showing the importance of assessing power system stability while considering multiple time scales simultaneously. Using the concept of Hopf bifurcations, it exemplifies instability issues that would be missed if multi-time-scale dynamics are not considered. Although this work employs both grid-following and grid-forming inverter-based resource models, it is not a direct comparison. Instead, it presents a case study demonstrating how one technology can complement the other from a multi time-scale dynamics perspective.</description>

      <title>Recursive Gaussian Process Regression with Integrated Monotonicity Assumptions for Control Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an extension to the recursive Gaussian Process (RGP) regression that enables the satisfaction of inequality constraints and is well suited for a real-time execution in control applications. The soft inequality constraints are integrated by introducing an additional extended Kalman Filter (EKF) update step using pseudo-measurements. The sequential formulation of the algorithm and several developed heuristics ensure both the performance and a low computational effort of the algorithm. A special focus lies on an efficient consideration of monotonicity assumptions for GPs in the form of inequality constraints. The algorithm is statistically validated in simulations, where the possible advantages in comparison with the standard RGP algorithm become obvious. The paper is concluded with a successful experimental validation of the developed algorithm for the monotonicity-preserving learning of heat transfer values for the control of a vapor compression cycle evaporator, leveraging a previously published partial input output linearization (IOL).</description>

      <title>Polytope Volume Monitoring Problem: Formulation and Solution via Parametric Linear Program Based Control Barrier Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the latest research on feasible space monitoring of multiple control barrier functions (CBFs) as well as polytopic collision avoidance, this paper studies the Polytope Volume Monitoring (PVM) problem, whose goal is to design a control law for inputs of nonlinear systems to prevent the volume of some state-dependent polytope from decreasing to zero. Recent studies have explored the idea of applying Chebyshev ball method in optimization theory to solve the case study of PVM; however, the underlying difficulties caused by nonsmoothness have not been addressed. This paper continues the study on this topic, where our main contribution is to establish the relationship between nonsmooth CBF and parametric optimization theory through directional derivatives for the first time, to solve PVM problems more conveniently. In detail, inspired by Chebyshev ball approach, a parametric linear program (PLP) based nonsmooth barrier function candidate is established for PVM, and then, sufficient conditions for it to be a nonsmooth CBF are proposed, based on which a quadratic program (QP) based safety filter with guaranteed feasibility is proposed to address PVM problems. Finally, a numerical simulation example is given to show the efficiency of the proposed safety filter.</description>

      <title>Online Convex Optimization and Integral Quadratic Constraints: An automated approach to regret analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for analyzing dynamic regret of first-order constrained online convex optimization algorithms for strongly convex and Lipschitz-smooth objectives. Crucially, we provide a general analysis that is applicable to a wide range of first-order algorithms that can be expressed as an interconnection of a linear dynamical system in feedback with a first-order oracle. By leveraging Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs), we derive a semi-definite program which, when feasible, provides a regret guarantee for the online algorithm. For this, the concept of variational IQCs is introduced as the generalization of IQCs to time-varying monotone operators. Our bounds capture the temporal rate of change of the problem in the form of the path length of the time-varying minimizer and the objective function variation. In contrast to standard results in OCO, our results do not require nerither the assumption of gradient boundedness, nor that of a bounded feasible set. Numerical analyses showcase the ability of the approach to capture the dependence of the regret on the function class condition number.</description>

      <title>Linear time-and-space-invariant relaxation systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper generalizes the physical property of relaxation from linear time-invariant (LTI) to linear time-and-space-invariant (LTSI) systems. It is shown that the defining features of relaxation -- complete monotonicity, passivity, and memory-based storage -- carry over seamlessly to the spatio-temporal domain. An LTSI system is shown to be of relaxation type if and only if its associated spatio-temporal Hankel operator is cyclically monotone. This implies the existence of an intrinsic quadratic storage functional defined uniquely by past inputs, independently of any state-space realization. As in the LTI case, LTSI relaxation systems are shown to be those systems for which the state-space concept of storage coincides with the input-output concept of fading memory functional.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Foundation Models for IoT: Taxonomy and Criteria-Based Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have gained growing interest in the IoT domain due to their reduced reliance on labeled data and strong generalizability across tasks, which address key limitations of traditional machine learning approaches. However, most existing foundation model based methods are developed for specific IoT tasks, making it difficult to compare approaches across IoT domains and limiting guidance for applying them to new tasks. This survey aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of current methodologies and organizing them around four shared performance objectives by different domains: efficiency, context-awareness, safety, and security &amp; privacy. For each objective, we review representative works, summarize commonly-used techniques and evaluation metrics. This objective-centric organization enables meaningful cross-domain comparisons and offers practical insights for selecting and designing foundation model based solutions for new IoT tasks. We conclude with key directions for future research to guide both practitioners and researchers in advancing the use of foundation models in IoT applications.</description>

      <title>A MILP-Based Solution to Multi-Agent Motion Planning and Collision Avoidance in Constrained Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) for multi-agent motion planning that embeds Polytopic Action-based Motion Planning (PAAMP) into a sequence-then-solve pipeline. Region sequences confine each agent to adjacent convex polytopes, while a big-M hyperplane model enforces inter-agent separation. Collision constraints are applied only to agents sharing or neighboring a region, which reduces binary variables exponentially compared with naive formulations. An L1 path-length-plus-acceleration cost yields smooth trajectories. We prove finite-time convergence and demonstrate on representative multi-agent scenarios with obstacles that our formulation produces collision-free trajectories an order of magnitude faster than an unstructured MILP baseline.</description>

      <title>A "good regulator theorem" for embodied agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a classic paper, Conant and Ashby claimed that "every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system." Artificial Life has produced many examples of systems that perform tasks with apparently no model in sight; these suggest Conant and Ashby's theorem doesn't easily generalise beyond its restricted setup. Nevertheless, here we show that a similar intuition can be fleshed out in a different way: whenever an agent is able to perform a regulation task, it is possible for an observer to interpret it as having "beliefs" about its environment, which it "updates" in response to sensory input. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more sophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more broadly applicable. However, it necessitates a change in perspective, in that the observer plays an essential role in the theory: models are not a mere property of the system but are imposed on it from outside. Our theorem holds regardless of whether the system is regulating its environment in a classic control theory setup, or whether it's regulating its own internal state; the model is of its environment either way. The model might be trivial, however, and this is how the apparent counterexamples are resolved.</description>
