      <title>Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Tensor Network Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a powerful tool for sampling from complex probability distributions. Despite its versatility, MCMC often suffers from strong autocorrelation and the negative sign problem, leading to slowing down the convergence of statistical error. We propose a novel MCMC formulation based on tensor network representations to reduce the population variance and mitigate these issues systematically. By introducing stochastic projectors into the tensor network framework and employing Markov chain sampling, our method eliminates the systematic error associated with low-rank approximation in tensor contraction while maintaining the high accuracy of the tensor network method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the two-dimensional Ising model, achieving an exponential reduction in statistical error with increasing bond dimension cutoff. Furthermore, we address the sign problem in systems with negative weights, showing significant improvements in average signs as bond dimension cutoff increases. The proposed framework provides a robust solution for accurate statistical estimation in complex systems, paving the way for broader applications in computational physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium steady state of Brownian motion in an intermittent potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the steady state distribution $P_{\text{SSD}}(\boldsymbol{X})$ of the position of a Brownian particle under an intermittent confining potential that switches on and off with a constant rate $\gamma$. We assume the external potential $U(\boldsymbol{x})$ to be smooth and have a unique global minimum at $\boldsymbol{x} = \boldsymbol{x}_0$, and in dimension $d&gt;1$ we additionally assume that $U(\boldsymbol{x})$ is central. We focus on the rapid-switching limit $\gamma \to \infty$. Typical fluctuations follow a Boltzmann distribution $P_{\text{SSD}}(\boldsymbol{X}) \sim e^{- U_{\text{eff}}(\boldsymbol{X}) / D}$, with an effective potential $U_{\text{eff}}(\boldsymbol{X}) = U(\boldsymbol{X})/2$, where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. However, we also calculate the tails of $P_{\text{SSD}}(\boldsymbol{X})$ which behave very differently. In the far tails $|\boldsymbol{X}| \to \infty$, a universal behavior $P_{\text{SSD}}\left(\boldsymbol{X}\right)\sim e^{-\sqrt{\gamma/D} \, \left|\boldsymbol{X}-\boldsymbol{x}_{0}\right|}$ emerges, that is independent of the trapping potential. The mean first-passage time to reach position $\boldsymbol{X}$ is given, in the leading order, by $\sim 1/P_{\text{SSD}}(\boldsymbol{X})$. This coincides with the Arrhenius law (for the effective potential $U_{\text{eff}}$) for $\boldsymbol{X} \simeq \boldsymbol{x}_0$, but deviates from it elsewhere. We give explicit results for the harmonic potential. Finally, we extend our results to periodic one-dimensional systems. Here we find that in the limit of $\gamma \to \infty$ and $D \to 0$, the logarithm of $P_{\text{SSD}}(X)$ exhibits a singularity which we interpret as a first-order dynamical phase transition (DPT). This DPT occurs in absence of any external drift. We also calculate the nonzero probability current in the steady state that is a result of the nonequilibrium nature of the system.</description>

      <title>Information thermodynamics for Markov jump processes coupled to underdamped diffusion: Application to nanoelectromechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the principles of information thermodynamics to study energy and information exchanges between coupled systems composed of one part undergoing a Markov jump process and another underdamped diffusion. We derive integral fluctuation theorems for the partial entropy production of each subsystem and analyze two distinct regimes. First, when the inertial dynamics is slow compared to the discrete-state transitions, we show that the steady-state energy and information flows vanish at the leading order in an adiabatic approximation, if the underdamped subsystem is governed purely by conservative forces. To capture the non-zero contributions, we consistently derive dynamical equations valid to higher order. Second, in the limit of infinite mass, the underdamped dynamics becomes a deterministic Hamiltonian dynamics driving the jump processes, we capture the next-order correction beyond this limit. We apply our framework to study self-oscillations in the single-electron shuttle - a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) - from a measurement-feedback perspective. We find that energy flows dominate over information flows in the self-oscillating regime, and study the efficiency with which this NEMS converts electrical work into mechanical oscillations.</description>

      <title>From dynamical to steady-state many-body metrology: Precision limits and their attainability with two-body interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the estimation of an unknown parameter $\theta$ via a many-body probe. The probe is initially prepared in a product state and many-body interactions enhance its $\theta$-sensitivity during the dynamics and/or in the steady state. We present bounds on the Quantum Fisher Information, and corresponding optimal interacting Hamiltonians, for two paradigmatic scenarios for encoding $\theta$: (i) via unitary Hamiltonian dynamics (dynamical metrology), and (ii) in the Gibbs and diagonal ensembles (time-averaged dephased state), two ubiquitous steady states of many-body open dynamics. We then move to the specific problem of estimating the strength of a magnetic field via interacting spins and derive two-body interacting Hamiltonians that can approach the fundamental precision bounds. In this case, we additionally analyze the transient regime leading to the steady states and characterize tradeoffs between equilibration times and measurement precision. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive picture of the potential of many-body control in quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>String-like Rearrangements Induce Mobility in Supercooled Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical heterogeneity is a signature phenomenon of deeply supercooled liquids and glasses. Here, we demonstrate that the spatiotemporal correlations between local relaxation events that underpin it are the result of local relaxation events raising the likelihood that other relaxation events subsequently occur nearby, confirming a widely held, but until now unsubstantiated, belief that dynamical facilitation is responsible for dynamical heterogeneity. We find that mobility is propagated through the entrainment of particles into elementary string-like rearrangements, known as microstrings, and not through perturbing the structure surrounding these rearrangements.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study of Disordered Noninteracting Chains Coupled to a Local Lindblad Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disorder can prevent many-body quantum systems from reaching thermal equilibrium, leading to a many-body localized phase. Recent works suggest that nonperturbative effects caused by rare regions of low disorder may destabilize the localized phase. However, numerical simulations of interacting systems are generically possible only for small system sizes, where finite-size effects might dominate. Here we perform a numerical investigation of noninteracting disordered spin chains coupled to a local Lindblad bath at the boundary. Our results reveal strong finite-size effects in the Lindbladian gap in both bath-coupled Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models, leading to a non-monotonic behavior with the system size. We discuss the relaxation properties of a simple toy model coupled to local Lindblad baths, connecting its features to those of noninteracting localized chains. We comment on the implications of our findings for many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Relations of society concepts and religions from Wikipedia networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Google matrix of directed networks of Wikipedia articles related to 8 recent Wikipedia language editions representing different cultures (English, Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Chinese). Using the reduced Google matrix algorithm we determine relations and interactions of 23 society concepts and 17 religions represented by their respective articles for each of the 8 editions. The effective Markov transitions are found to be more intense inside the two blocks of society concepts and religions while transitions between the blocks are significantly reduced. We establish 5 poles of influence for society concepts (Law, Society, Communism, Liberalism, Capitalism) as well as 5 poles for religions (Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Chinese folk religion) and determine how they affect other entries. We compute inter edition correlations for different key quantities providing a quantitative analysis of the differences or the proximity of views of the 8 cultures with respect to the selected society concepts and religions.</description>

      <title>Classical Shadows with Improved Median-of-Means Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical shadows protocol, introduced by Huang et al. [Nat. Phys. 16, 1050 (2020)], makes use of the median-of-means (MoM) estimator to efficiently estimate the expectation values of $M$ observables with failure probability $\delta$ using only $\mathcal{O}(\log(M/\delta))$ measurements. In their analysis, Huang et al. used loose constants in their asymptotic performance bounds for simplicity. However, the specific values of these constants can significantly affect the number of shots used in practical implementations. To address this, we studied a modified MoM estimator proposed by Minsker [PMLR 195, 5925 (2023)] that uses optimal constants and involves a U-statistic over the data set. For efficient estimation, we implemented two types of incomplete U-statistics estimators, the first based on random sampling and the second based on cyclically permuted sampling. We compared the performance of the original and modified estimators when used with the classical shadows protocol with single-qubit Clifford unitaries (Pauli measurements) for an Ising spin chain, and global Clifford unitaries (Clifford measurements) for the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. While the original estimator outperformed the modified estimators for Pauli measurements, the modified estimators showed improved performance over the original estimator for Clifford measurements. Our findings highlight the importance of tailoring estimators to specific measurement settings to optimize the performance of the classical shadows protocol in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Critical Micelle Concentration of Nonionic and Ionic Surfactants by Self-Consistent Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and understanding its relationship with both the intrinsic molecular structures and environmental conditions are crucial for the rational design of surfactants. Here, we develop a self-consistent field theory which unifies the study of CMC, micellar structure and kinetic pathway of micellization in one framework. The long-range electrostatic interactions are accurately treated, which not only makes the theory applicable to both nonionic and ionic surfactants but also enables us to capture a variety of salt effects. The effectiveness and versatility of the theory is verified by applying it to three types of commonly used surfactants. For polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers (C$_m$E$_n$) surfactants, we predict a wide span of CMC from $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-2}$M as the composition parameters $m$ and $n$ are adjusted. For the ionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant, we show the decrease of CMC as salt concentration increases, and capture both the specific cation effect and the specific anion effect. Furthermore, for sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES) surfactants, we find a non-monotonic dependence of both the CMC and micelle size on the number of oxyethylene groups. Our theoretical predictions of CMC are in quantitative agreement with experimental data reported in literature for all the three types of surfactants.</description>

      <title>Theory for dissipative time crystals in coupled parametric oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals are novel phases of matter that break the discrete time translational symmetry of a periodically driven system. In this work, we propose a classical system of weakly-nonlinear parametrically-driven coupled oscillators as a testbed to understand these phases. Such a system of parametric oscillators can be used to model period-doubling instabilities of Josephson junction arrays as well as semiconductor lasers. To show that this instability leads to a discrete time crystal we first show that a certain limit of the system is close to Langevin dynamics in a symmetry breaking potential. We numerically show that this phase exists even in the presence of Ising symmetry breaking using a Glauber dynamics approximation. We then use a field theoretic argument to show that these results are robust to other approximations including the semiclassical limit when applied to dissipative quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of switching processes: general results and applications to intermittent active motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systems switching between different dynamical phases is an ubiquitous phenomenon. The general understanding of such a process is limited. To this end, we present a general expression that captures fluctuations of a system exhibiting a switching mechanism. Specifically, we obtain an exact expression of the Laplace-transformed characteristic function of the particle's position. Then, the characteristic function is used to compute the effective diffusion coefficient of a system performing intermittent dynamics. Further, we employ two examples: 1) Generalized run-and-tumble active particle, and 2) an active particle switching its dynamics between generalized active run-and-tumble motion and passive Brownian motion. In each case, explicit computations of the spatial cumulants are presented. Our findings reveal that the particle's position probability density function exhibit rich behaviours due to intermittent activity. Numerical simulations confirm our findings.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Economic Markets through Monte Carlo Simulations and Magnetism-Inspired Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to modelling economic agents as analogous to spin states in physics, particularly the Ising model. By associating economic activity with spin orientations (up for inactivity, down for activity), the study delves into optimizing market dynamics using concepts from statistical mechanics. Utilizing Monte Carlo simulations, the aim is to maximize surplus by allowing the market to evolve freely toward equilibrium. The introduction of temperature represents the frequency of economic activities, which is crucial for optimizing consumer and producer surplus. The government's role as a temperature regulator (raising temperature to stimulate economic activity) is explored. Results from simulations and policy interventions, such as introducing a "magnetic field," are discussed, showcasing complexities in optimizing economic systems while avoiding undue control that may destabilize markets. The study provides insights into bridging concepts from physics and economics, paving the way for a deeper understanding of economic dynamics and policy interventions.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality of Deep Thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the role of global system topology in governing deep thermalization, the relaxation of a local subsystem towards a maximally-entropic, uniform distribution of post-measurement states, upon observing the complementary subsystem in a local basis. Concretely, we focus on a class of (1+1)d systems exhibiting 'maximally-chaotic' dynamics, and consider how the rate of the formation of such a universal wavefunction distribution depends on boundary conditions of the system. We find that deep thermalization is achieved exponentially quickly in the presence of either periodic or open boundary conditions; however, the rate at which this occurs is twice as fast for the former than for the latter. These results are attained analytically using the calculus of integration over unitary groups, and supported by extensive numerical simulations. Our findings highlight the nonlocal nature of deep thermalization, and clearly illustrates that the physics underlying this phenomenon goes beyond that of standard quantum thermalization, which only depends on the net build-up of entanglement between a subsystem and its complement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observational entropy -- a quantity that unifies Boltzmann's entropy, Gibbs' entropy, von Neumann's macroscopic entropy, and the diagonal entropy -- has recently been argued to play a key role in a modern formulation of statistical mechanics. Here, relying on algebraic techniques taken from Petz's theory of statistical sufficiency and on a L\'evy-type concentration bound, we prove rigorous theorems showing how the observational entropy of a system undergoing a unitary evolution chosen at random tends to increase with overwhelming probability and to reach its maximum very quickly. More precisely, we show that for any observation that is sufficiently coarse with respect to the size of the system, regardless of the initial state of the system (be it pure or mixed), random evolution renders its state practically indistinguishable from the uniform (i.e., maximally mixed) distribution with a probability approaching one as the size of the system grows. The same conclusion holds not only for random evolutions sampled according to the unitarily invariant Haar distribution, but also for approximate 2-designs, which are thought to provide a more physically and computationally reasonable model of random evolutions.</description>

Abstract: The subleading corner logarithmic corrections in entanglement entropy (EE) are crucial for revealing universal characteristics of the quantum critical points (QCPs), but they are challenging to detect. Motivated by recent developments in the stable computation of EE in (2+1)D quantum many-body systems, we have developed a new method for directly measuring the corner contribution in EE with less computational cost. The cornerstone of our approach is to measure the subtracted corner entanglement entropy (SCEE) defined as the difference between the EEs of subregions with the same boundary length for smooth and cornered boundaries during the sign-problem free quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Our improved method inherently eliminates not only the area law term of EE but also the subleading log-corrections arising from Goldstone modes, leaving the universal corner contribution as the leading term of SCEE with greatly improved data quality. Utilizing this advanced approach, we calculate the SCEE of the bilayer Heisenberg model on both square and honeycomb lattices across their (2+1)D O(3) QCPs with different opening angles on entanglement boundary, and obtain the accurate values of the corresponding universal corner log-coefficients. These findings will encourage further theoretical investigations to access controlled universal information for interacting CFTs at (2+1)D.</description>

      <title>Testing the Heterogeneous-Elasticity Theory for low-energy excitations in structural glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the statistical mechanics of low-energy excitations in structural glasses has been the focus of extensive research efforts in the past decades due to their key roles in determining the low-temperature mechanical and transport properties of these intrinsically nonequilibrium materials. While it is established that glasses feature low-energy nonphononic excitations that follow a nonDebye vibrational density of states, we currently lack a well-founded theory of these fundamental objects and their vibrational spectra. A recent theory -- that builds on the so-called Heterogeneous-Elasticity Theory (HET) and its extensions -- provides explicit predictions for the scaling of the low-frequency tail of the nonphononic spectrum of glasses, the localization properties of the vibrational modes that populate this tail, and its connections to glass formation history and to the form of the distribution of weak microscopic (interatomic) stresses. Here, we employ computer models of structural glasses to quantitatively test these predictions. Our findings do not support the HET's predictions regarding the nature and statistics of low-energy excitations in glasses, highlighting the need for additional theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>Origin of Robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Phases in Stacked Hermitian Systems: Non-Hermitian Level Repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators, which possess a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase, have attracted great attention for two decades. It is generally believed that when an even number of layers of the quantum spin Hall insulators are stacked, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase becomes unstable due to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ nature. While the counterexamples of the instability were observed in several literates, there is no systematic understanding. In this work, we provide a systematic understanding that the robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase in a Hermitian system with chiral symmetry against stacking. We clarify that the robustness generally originates from level repulsion in the corresponding non-Hermitian system derived from Hermitization. We demonstrate this by treating a class DIII superconductor in 1D with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology and the corresponding non-Hermitian 1D system in class AII$^\dagger$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topology.</description>

      <title>Displacement correlations in a two-dimensional colloidal liquid and their relationship with shear strain correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlations of the displacement field in a two-dimensional model colloidal liquid is studied numerically and analytically. By calculating the displacement correlations and the shear strain correlations from the numerical data of particle simulations, the displacement field is shown to have nontrivial correlations, even in liquids that are only slightly glassy with the area fraction as low as 0.5. It is suggested analytically and demonstrated numerically that the displacement correlations are more informative than the shear correlations: the former behaves logarithmically with regard to the spatial distance at shorter scales, while the corresponding information is missing from the shear correlations. The logarithmic behavior of the displacement correlations is interpreted as manifesting a long-lived aspect of the cage effect.</description>

      <title>Space-time correlations in monitored kinetically constrained discrete-time quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art quantum simulators permit local temporal control of interactions and midcircuit readout. These capabilities open the way towards the exploration of intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena. We illustrate this with a kinetically constrained many-body quantum system that has a natural implementation on Rydberg quantum simulators. The evolution proceeds in discrete time and is generated by repeatedly entangling the system with an auxiliary environment that is monitored and reset after each time-step. Despite featuring an uncorrelated infinite-temperature average stationary state, the dynamics displays coexistence of fast and slow space-time regions in stochastic realizations of the system state. The time-record of measurement outcomes on the environment serves as natural probe for such dynamical heterogeneity, which we characterize using tools from large deviation theory. Our work establishes the large deviation framework for discrete-time open quantum many-body systems as a means to characterize complex dynamics and collective phenomena in quantum processors and simulators.</description>

      <title>Optimal switching strategies in multi-drug therapies for chronic diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance is a threat to public health with millions of deaths linked to drug resistant infections every year. To mitigate resistance, common strategies that are used are combination therapies and therapy switching. However, the stochastic nature of pathogenic mutation makes the optimization of these strategies challenging. Here, we propose a two-scale stochastic model that considers the effective evolution of therapies in a multidimensional efficacy space, where each dimension represents the efficacy of a specific drug in the therapy. The diffusion of therapies within this space is subject to stochastic resets, representing therapy switches. The boundaries of the space, inferred from coarser pathogen-host dynamics, can be either reflecting or absorbing. Reflecting boundaries impede full recovery of the host, while absorbing boundaries represent the development of antimicrobial resistance, leading to therapy failure. We derive analytical expressions for the average absorption times, accounting for both continuous and discrete genomic changes using the frameworks of Langevin and Master equations, respectively. These expressions allow us to evaluate the relevance of times between drug-switches and the number of simultaneous drugs in relation to typical timescales for drug resistance development. We also explore realistic scenarios where therapy constraints are imposed to the number of administered therapies and/or their costs, finding non-trivial optimal drug-switching protocols that maximize the time before antimicrobial resistance develops while reducing therapy costs.</description>
