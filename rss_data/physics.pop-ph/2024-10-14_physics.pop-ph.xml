      <title>Launching mass from the Moon helped by lunar gravity anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normally a passive object launched from the Moon at less than the escape velocity orbits the Moon once and then crashes back to the launch site. We show that thanks to lunar gravity anomalies, for specific launch sites and directions, a passive projectile can remain in lunar orbit for up to 9 Earth days. We find that such sites exist at least on the lunar equator for prograde equatorial orbit launches. Three of the sites are located on the lunar nearside. We envision that this can be used to lift material from the Moon at low cost because it gives prolonged opportunities for an active spacecraft to catch the projectile. Passive projectiles can be made entirely from lunar material so that a stream of Earth-imported parts is not needed. To reduce the mass and cost of the launcher, the projectile mass can be scaled down with a corresponding increase in the launch frequency. The projectile launcher itself can be a coilgun, railgun, superconducting quenchgun, sling or any other device that can give a projectile an orbital speed of about 1.7 km/s.</description>

      <title>Tunable Einstein-Bohr recoiling-slit gedankenexperiment at the quantum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1927, during the fifth Solvay Conference, Einstein and Bohr described a double-slit interferometer with a "movable slit" that can detect the momentum recoil of one photon. Here, we report a faithful realization of the Einstein-Bohr interferometer using a single atom in an optical tweezer, cooled to the motional ground state in three dimensions. The single atom has an intrinsic momentum uncertainty comparable to a single photon, which serves as a movable slit obeying the minimum Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The atom's momentum wavefunction is dynamically tunable by the tweezer laser power, which enables observation of an interferometric visibility reduction at a shallower trap, demonstrating the quantum nature of this interferometer. We further identify classical noise due to atom heating and precession, illustrating a quantum-to-classical transition.</description>
