      <title>Hilbert property for low-genus families and degree-one del Pezzo surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Hilbert property is satisfied by certain del Pezzo surfaces of degree one and Picard rank 1 over fields finitely generated over $\mathbb{Q}$. We generalize results of the first author on elliptic surfaces and employ constructions used by Desjardins and the third author to prove density of rational points. Our results are the first on the Hilbert property for minimal del Pezzo surfaces of degree one without a conic fibration.</description>

      <title>The GIT stability and Hodge structures of hypersurfaces via minimal exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X\subset \mathbb P^n$ be a degree $d$ hypersurface. We prove that $X$ is GIT stable if the minimal exponent $\widetilde \alpha(X)&gt;\frac{n+1}{d}$ and GIT semistable if $\widetilde \alpha(X)=\frac{n+1}{d}$, resolving a question of Laza. Conversely, for GIT semistable cubic hypersurfaces, we prove a uniform lower bound for the minimal exponent, which implies that every such cubic has canonical singularities (and is terminal for $n\ge 6$), answering a question of Spotti-Sun. In the classical cases $(n,d)=(2,4),(2,6),(3,3),(4,3),(5,3)$, the period map from the GIT moduli is an open embedding over the stable locus with $\widetilde \alpha(X)&gt;\frac{n+1}{d}$ and extends regularly to the Baily-Borel compactification precisely along the boundary where $\widetilde \alpha(X)=\frac{n+1}{d}$. To generalize this period map behavior in the Calabi-Yau type case $\frac{n+1}{d}=m+1\in \mathbb Z$, we introduce $m$-liminal sources and $m$-liminal centers, refining the theory of sources and log canonical centers. For an $m$-Du Bois hypersurface, we prove that the core of the limit mixed Hodge structure of any one-parameter smoothing is completely determined by the $m$-liminal source. In particular, maximal unipotent degeneration is detected by the local singularity type of the special fiber.</description>

      <title>The valuation of the discriminant of a hypersurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a discrete valuation ring, with valuation $v \colon R \twoheadrightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \cup \{\infty\}$ and residue field $k$. Let $H$ be a hypersurface $\operatorname{Proj}(R[x_0,\ldots,x_n]/\langle f \rangle)$. Let $H_k$ be the special fiber, and let $(H_k)_{\mathrm{sing}}$ be its singular subscheme. Let $\Delta(f)$ be the discriminant of $f$. We use Zariski's main theorem and degeneration arguments to prove that $v(\Delta(f))=1$ if and only if $H$ is regular and $(H_k)_{\mathrm{sing}}$ consists of a nondegenerate double point over $k$. We also give lower bounds on $v(\Delta(f))$ when $H_k$ has multiple singularities or a positive-dimensional singularity.</description>

      <title>Higher characteristic classes of multisingularity loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A map between manifolds induces stratifications of both the source and the target according to the occurring multisingularities. In this paper, we study universal expressions-called higher Thom polynomials-that describe the Segre-Schwartz-MacPherson class of such multisingularity loci. We prove a Structure Theorem reducing these Thom polynomials to the data of a linear series associated with each multisingularity. The series corresponding to the empty multisingularity, referred to as the Master Series, plays a distinguished role. Motivated by connections with geometric representation theory, we further prove an Interpolation Theorem that allows Thom polynomials to be computed algorithmically within Mather's range of nice dimensions. As an application, we derive an explicit formula for the image Milnor number of quasihomogeneous germs, providing one side of the celebrated Mond conjecture, computable up to the theoretical bound.</description>

      <title>Stable toric sheaves. I : Chern classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study rank 2 torus-equivariant torsion-free sheaves on the complex projective space. For reflexive sheaves we derive a simple formula for the Chern polynomial, and in the general torsion-free case we introduce an iterative construction method based on elementary injections, allowing us to prescribe Chern classes. This yields infinite families of explicit examples on $\mathbb{P}^4$ and $\mathbb{P}^5$, and establishes existence on $\mathbb{P}^n$ for all $n\geq 3$, with Chern classes satisfying all known constraints arising from locally freeness and indecomposability. We also provide simple obstructions for smoothability.</description>

      <title>${\mathbb Z}_{k}^{m}$-actions of signature $(0;k,\stackrel{n+1}{\ldots},k)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider group actions on compact Riemann surfaces and their topological classification. We address this problem for pairs $(S, N)$ where $S$ is a compact Riemann surface endowed with a group of automorphisms $N \cong \mathbb{Z}_k^m$ such $S/N$ has signature $(0;k,\stackrel{n+1}{\ldots},k)$, where $n, k \geqslant 2$ and $1 \leqslant m \leqslant n$ are integers. We further assume the existence of extra automorphisms, namely, a group $G$ with $N \lhd G \leqslant \mathrm{Aut}(S)$ and analyze the induced permutational action of $G/N$ on the cone points of $S/N$. To describe such actions up to topological equivalence, we employ the generalized Fermat curves $(X,H)$ and their automorphism groups, showing that every triple $(S,N, G)$ as before is determined by a class of subgroups of $H$ that satisfy certain invariance property. This approach establishes a correspondence between topological equivalence classes and an appropriate quotient set. As an application, we specialize our results to the case $k$ prime and $m=2$, including algebraic models and isogeny decompositions of their Jacobian varieties. We then discuss some examples for the cases $n=3$ and $n=5$, which are interesting in their own right.</description>

      <title>Algebraic $n$-Valued Monoids on $\mathbb{C}P^1$, Discriminants and Projective Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish connections between the theory of algebraic $n$-valued monoids and groups and the theories of discriminants and projective duality. We show that the composition of projective duality followed by the M\"obius transformation $z\mapsto 1/z$ defines a shift operation $\mathbb{M}_n(\mathbb{C}P^1)\mapsto \mathbb{M}_{n-1}(\mathbb{C}P^1)$ in the family of algebraic $n$-valued coset monoids $\{\mathbb{M}_{n}(\mathbb{C}P^1)\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$. We also show that projective duality sends each Fermat curve $x^n+y^n=z^n$ $(n\ge 2)$ to the curve $p_{n-1}(z^n; x^n, y^n)=0$, where the polynomial $p_n(z;x,y)$ defines the addition law in the monoid $\mathbb{M}_n(\mathbb{C}P^1)$. We solve the problem of describing coset $n$-valued addition laws constructed from cubic curves. As a corollary, we obtain that all such addition laws are given by polynomials, whereas the addition laws of formal groups on general cubic curves are given by series.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study non-standard holomorphic structures on line bundles over the quantum projective line $\mathbb{C} P^1_q$. We show that there exist infinitely many non-gauge equivalent holomorphic structures on those line bundles. This gives a negative answer to a question raised by Khalkhali, Landi, and Van Suijlekom in 2011.</description>

      <title>The number of rational iterated preimages of the origin under unicritical polynomial maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rational iterated preimages of the origin under unicritical maps $f_{d,c}(x)=x^d+c$. Earlier works of Faber--Hutz--Stoll and Hutz--Hyde--Krause established finiteness and conditional bounds in the quadratic case. Building on this, we prove that for $d=2$ and $c \in \mathbb Q\setminus\{0,-1\}$ there are no rational fourth preimages of the origin, and for all $d \geq 3$ there are no rational second preimages outside trivial cases. The proof relies on geometric analysis of preimage curves, the elliptic Chabauty method, and Diophantine reduction. As a result, we determine the number of rational iterated preimages of $0$ under $f_{d,c}$ for all $d\geq 2$.</description>

Abstract: We construct the Bruhat-Tits stratification of the ramified unitary splitting Rapoport-Zink space, with the level being the stabilizer of a vertex lattice. To determine certain local properties of the Bruhat-Tits strata, we develop a theory of the strata splitting models. To study their global structure, we establish an explicit isomorphism between the Bruhat-Tits strata and certain (modified) Deligne-Lusztig varieties.</description>

      <title>Kontsevich's Formula for Rational Curves from Classical and Quantum Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kontsevich's formula for rational plane curves is a recursive relation for the number $N_d$ of degree $d$ rational curves in $\mathbb{P}^2$ passing through $3d-1$ general points.
  We provide two proofs of this recursion: the first more direct and combinatoric, the second more abstract.
  In order to achieve this, we introduce several moduli spaces, such as the Deligne-Mumford-Knudsen spaces and the Kontsevich spaces, and exploit their properties. In particular, the boundary structure of these spaces gives rise to certain fundamental relations crucial to both proofs.
  For the second proof, we reconsider the objects in question from the cohomological viewpoint and generalize the numbers $N_d$ to Gromov-Witten invariants. We introduce quantum cohomology and deduce Kontsevich's formula from the associativity of the quantum product.
  We also adapt these steps to the case of curves in $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$, whose bidegrees lead to slightly more complicated but analogous results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07877v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a holomorphically symplectic manifold, equipped with a Lagrangian fibration $\pi:\; M \to X$. A degenerate twistor deformation (sometimes also called ``a Tate-Shafarevich twist'') is a family of holomorphically symplectic structures on $M$ parametrized by $H^{1,1}(X)$. All members of this family are equipped with a holomorphic Lagrangian projection to $X$, and their fibers are isomorphic to the fibers of $\pi$. Assume that $M$ is a compact hyperkahler manifold of maximal holonomy, and the general fiber of the Lagrangian projection $\pi$ is primitive (that is, not divisible) in integer homology. We also assume that $\pi$ has reduced fibers in codimension 1. Then $M$ has a degenerate twistor deformation $M'$ such that the Lagrangian projection $\pi:\; M' \to X$ admits a meromorphic section.</description>

      <title>The intrinsic reductions and the intrinsic depths in non-archimedean dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short paper, we aim at giving a more conceptual and simpler proof of Rumely's moduli theoretic characterization of type II minimal locus of the resultant function $\operatorname{ordRes}_\phi$ on the Berkovich hyperbolic space for a rational function $\phi$ on $\mathbb{P}^1$ defined over an algebraically closed and complete field that is equipped with a non-trivial and non-archimedean absolute value, and also aim at giving a much simpler and more natural proof of a degenerating limit theorem, in an improved form after DeMarco--Faber, for the family of the unique maximal entropy measures on $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$ associated to a meromorphic family of complex rational functions. We introduce the intrinsic reduction of a non-archimedean rational function $\phi$ at each point in the Berkovich projective line and its directionwise intrinsic depths, which are suitable notions for the above aims and defined in terms of the tree and analytic structures of the Berkovich projective line. Then we establish two theorems in non-archimedean dynamics, both of which play key roles in the above aims.</description>

      <title>Fundamental algebraic sets and locally unit-additive rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra can be thought of as a statement about the real numbers as a space, considered as an algebraic set over the real numbers as a field. This paper introduces what it means for an algebraic set or affine variety over a field to be fundamental, in a way that encompasses the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra as a special case. The related concept of local fundamentality is introduced and its behavior developed. On the algebraic side, the notions of locally, geometrically, and generically unit-additive rings are introduced, thus complementing unit-additivity as previously defined by the author and Jay Shapiro. A number of results are extended from the previous joint paper from unit-additivity to local unit-additivity. It is shown that an affine variety is (locally) fundamental if and only if its coordinate ring is (locally) unit-additive. To do so, a theorem is proved showing that there are many equivalent definitions of local unit-additivity. Illustrative examples are sprinkled throughout.</description>

      <title>On the connectedness of the singular set of holomorphic foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a singular holomorphic foliation of dimension $k&gt;1$ on a projective $n$-manifold $X$. Assume that the determinant of the normal sheaf of $\mathcal{F}$ is ample (as is always the case when $X=\mathbb{P}^{n}$), and that the singular set $Sing(\mathcal{F})$ has dimension $\leq k-1$. We show that the union of those irreducible components of $Sing(\mathcal{F})$ of dimension exactly $k-1$ is necessarily connected. Consequently, we obtain a Bott-type topological obstruction to the integrability of singular holomorphic distributions, echoing Bott's vanishing theorem, and we answer a question of Cerveau for codimension-one foliations on $\mathbb{P}^{3}$.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical filtrations of line bundles and optimal algebraic geometry codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01859v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce \emph{hierarchical depth}, a new invariant of line bundles and divisors, defined via maximal chains of effective sub-line bundles. This notion gives rise to \emph{hierarchical filtrations}, refining the structure of the Picard group and providing new insights into the geometry of algebraic surfaces. We establish fundamental properties of hierarchical depth, derive inequalities through intersection theory and the Hodge index theorem, and characterize filtrations that are Hodge-tight.
  Using this framework, we develop a theory of \emph{hierarchical algebraic geometry codes}, constructed from evaluation spaces along these filtrations. This approach produces nested families of codes with controlled growth of parameters and identifies an optimal intermediate code maximizing a utility function balancing rate and minimum distance. Hierarchical depth thus provides a systematic method to construct AG codes with favorable asymptotic behavior, linking geometric and coding-theoretic perspectives.
  Our results establish new connections between line bundle theory, surface geometry, and coding theory, and suggest applications to generalized Goppa codes and higher-dimensional evaluation codes.</description>

      <title>Upper bound on the multiplicity of rational and Du Bois singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper resolves a question of Huneke and Watanabe by proving a sharp upper bound for the multiplicity of Du Bois singularities: at a point of a $d$-dimensional variety with Du Bois singularities and embedding dimension $e$, the multiplicity is at most $\binom{e}{d}$. Additionally, the result recovers the previously known upper bound for the multiplicity of rational singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the natural map from the syntomification of a ring $R$ to the stack of $R$-algebra stacks is fully faithful, answering a question of Drinfeld, and we describe its essential image in terms of underlying monoid stacks. We also give similar statements in the characteristic 0 filtered de Rham, $\ell = p$ \'etale, and Betti settings.</description>

      <title>A universal mirror to $(\mathbb{P}^2, \Omega)$ as a birational object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study homological mirror symmetry for $(\mathbb{P}^2, \Omega)$ viewed as an object of birational geometry, with $\Omega$ the standard meromorphic volume form. First, we construct universal objects on the two sides of mirror symmetry, focusing on the exact symplectic setting: a smooth complex scheme $U_\mathrm{univ}$ and a Weinstein manifold $M_\mathrm{univ}$, both of infinite type; and we prove homological mirror symmetry for them. Second, we consider autoequivalences. We prove that automorphisms of $U_\mathrm{univ}$ are given by a natural discrete subgroup of $\operatorname{Bir} (\mathbb{P}^2, \pm \Omega)$; and that all of these automorphisms are mirror to symplectomorphisms of $M_\mathrm{univ}$. We conclude with some applications.</description>

      <title>Positive equilibria in mass action networks: geometry and bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results on the geometry of the positive equilibrium set of a mass action network. Any mass action network gives rise to a parameterised family of polynomial equations whose positive solutions are the positive equilibria of the network. Here, we start by deriving alternative systems of equations, whose solutions are in smooth, one-to-one correspondence with positive equilibria of the network, and capture degeneracy or nondegeneracy of the corresponding equilibria. The derivation leads us to consider partitions of networks in a natural sense, and we explore the implications of choosing different partitions. The alternative systems are often simpler than the original mass action equations, sometimes giving explicit parameterisations of positive equilibria, and allowing us to rapidly identify various algebraic and geometric properties of the positive equilibrium set, including toricity and local toricity. We can use the approaches we develop to bound the number of positive nondegenerate equilibria on stoichiometric classes; to derive semialgebraic descriptions of the parameter regions for multistationarity; and to study bifurcations. We present the main construction, various consequences for particular classes of networks, and numerous examples. We also develop additional techniques specifically for quadratic networks, the most common class of networks in applications, and use these techniques to derive strengthened results for quadratic networks.</description>

      <title>On Milnor $K$-theory in the imperfect residue case and applications to period-index problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a $(0,p)$-mixed characteristic complete discrete valued field $\mathcal{K}$ we define a class of finite field extensions called \emph{pseudo-perfect} extensions such that the natural restriction map on the mod-$p$ Milnor $K$-groups is trivial for all $p\neq 2$. This implies that pseudo-perfect extensions split every element in $H^i(\mathcal{K},\mu_p^{\otimes i-1})$ yielding period-index bounds for Brauer classes as well as higher cohomology classes of $\mathcal{K}$. As a corollary, we prove a conjecture of Bhaskhar-Haase that the Brauer $p$-dimension of $\mathcal{K}$ is upper bounded by $n+1$ where $n$ is the $p$-rank of the residue field. When $\mathcal{K}$ is the fraction field of a complete regular ring, we show that any $p$-torsion element in $Br(\mathcal{K})$ that is nicely ramified is split by a pseudo-perfect extension yielding a bound on its index. We then use patching techniques of Harbater, Hartmann and Krashen to show that the Brauer $p$-dimension of semi-global fields of residual characteristic $p$ is at most $n+2$ and also give uniform $p$-bounds for higher cohomologies. These bounds are sharper than previously known in the work of Parimala-Suresh</description>

      <title>Instantons on ALE spaces for classical groups, involutions on quiver varieties, and quantum symmetric pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moduli spaces of instantons on ALE spaces for classical groups are examples of fixed point sets of involutions on quiver varieties, i.e., $\sigma$-quiver varieties. In 2018 Yiqiang Li considered their equivariant cohomology, and by stable envelope of Maulik-Okounkov, constructed representations of coideal subalgebras of Maulik-Okounkov Yangian, called twisted Yangian. We calculate $K$-matrices as matrices in examples, identified the twisted Yangians with ones studied in other literature, and clarify conditions which we should impose to make them well-defined.</description>
