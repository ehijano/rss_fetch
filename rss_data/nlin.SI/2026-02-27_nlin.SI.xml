      <title>Mesoscopic fluctuation theory of particle systems driven by Poisson noise: study of the $q$-TASEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We pursue our study of integrable weak noise theories of directed polymer and interacting particle stochastic models in the 1D KPZ universality class. Here we focus on the $q$-TASEP in either continuous or discrete time. Each particle on $\mathbb{Z}$ jumps independently by $+1$ with a rate (or probability) depending on the gap to the next particle on its right. We consider initial conditions (either step or random) which are empty of particles on $\mathbb{Z}^+$, and focus on the dynamics of the $N$ rightmost particles. In the limit $q \to 1$ and at large time (and large gaps) we identify a new intermediate "mesoscopic" (i.e. finite $N$) regime which corresponds to weak noise. In that regime Poisson noise remains important. We obtain the large deviations of the position of a given particle by two methods. The first derives asymptotics of $q$-TASEP Fredholm determinant formula. The second maps the weak noise limit to a system of semi-discrete or fully discrete, non linear differential equations. These are obtained as saddle point classical equations of a dynamical field theory, and their solutions represent the optimal configurations in the large deviation regime. We show the classical integrability of these two systems, and exhibit their explicit Lax pair. In the case of the continuous time $q$-TASEP it provides the first instance of classical integrability arising in a stochastic system, with signatures of the Poisson noise persisting in the weak noise limit. For this model, we solve the scattering problem associated to its Lax pair and fully characterize the large deviations associated to the weak noise theory. Finally, we supplement this work with an Appendix on the first cumulant method to obtain the large deviations of several lattice polymer models (Strict Weak, Log Gamma, Beta).</description>

      <title>Discrete equations from B\"{a}cklund transformations of the fifth Painlev\'{e} equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper discrete equations are derived from B\"{a}cklund transformations of the fifth Painlev\'{e} equation, including a new discrete equation which has ternary symmetry. There are two classes of rational solutions of the fifth Painlev\'{e} equation, one expressed in terms of the generalised Laguerre polynomials and the other in terms of the generalised Umemura polynomials, both of which can be expressed as Wronskians of Laguerre polynomials. Hierarchies of rational solutions of the discrete equations are derived in terms of the generalised Laguerre and generalised Umemura polynomials. It is known that there is nonuniqueness of some rational solutions of the fifth Painlev\'{e} equation. Pairs of nonunique rational solutions are used to derive distinct hierarchies of rational solutions which satisfy the same discrete equation.</description>

      <title>Explicit Hamiltonian representations of meromorphic connections and duality from different perspectives: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present an explicit study of $\hbar$-deformed meromorphic connections in $\mathfrak{gl}_3(\mathbb{C})$ with an unramified irregular pole at infinity of order $r_\infty=3$ and its spectral dual corresponding to the $\mathfrak{gl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ Painlev\'{e} IV Lax pair. Using the apparent singularities and their dual partners on the spectral curves as Darboux coordinates, we obtain the Hamiltonian evolutions, the reduction of these evolutions to a single non-trivial direction, the Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno tau-functions, the fundamental symplectic two-forms and the associated Hermitian matrix models on both sides. We then prove that the spectral duality connecting both sides extends to all these aspects, providing an explicit illustration of the generalized Harnad duality. We finally propose a conjecture relating the Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno differential as the $\hbar=0$ evaluation of the Hamiltonian differential in these Darboux coordinates that could provide insights on the geometric interpretation of the $\hbar$ formal parameter. As a byproduct we also obtain a rank $3$ Lax pair for the Painlev\'{e} IV equation.</description>
