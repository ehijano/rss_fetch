      <title>Opportunities for Imaging Light Nuclei with a Second Interaction Region at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will address several outstanding puzzles in modern nuclear physics. Key questions, such as the partonic structure of nucleons and nuclei and the origin of their mass and spin, can be explored through high-energy electron-proton and electron-nucleus collisions. To maximize its scientific reach, the EIC community has advocated for the addition of a second interaction region equipped with a detector complementary to the EIC general purpose collider detector, ePIC. The pre-conceptual design of this interaction region aims to provide a different configuration from the first interaction region, which enhances forward acceptance at very small scattering angles ($\theta \sim 0$ mrad). This machine configuration would significantly benefit exclusive, tagging, and diffractive physics programs, complementing those of the ePIC experiment. In particular, accessing coherent diffractive processes on light nuclei by tagging of the full, intact nucleus is essential for mapping their spatial parton distributions. In this work, we present a systematic study of the detection capabilities for light nuclei at a second EIC interaction region, with a detailed discussion of the accessible kinematic phase space and its implications for imaging.</description>

      <title>Experimental review on the chiral magnetic effect in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) refers to a predicted phenomena in quantum chromodynamics that manifests as a charge separation along an external magnetic field, driven by an imbalance of quark chirality. Searches for the CME has been carried out by azimuthal particle correlations in relativistic heavy ion collisions where such a chirality imbalance is anticipated and a strong magnetic field is created in the initial stage. No conclusive experimental evidence on the CME has been established so far because of large background contributions to azimuthal correlation observables. We review the status of the experimental search for the CME, covering the observables used, the techniques to mitigate backgrounds, and the strengths and limitations of various experimental approaches, and outline a future prospect of the CME search in high-energy nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Transmission Efficiency of the Recoil Mass Spectrometer EMMA at TRIUMF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mean transmission efficiency of the EMMA recoil mass spectrometer at TRIUMF has been measured with 6 different angular apertures at 17 kinetic energy/charge deviations with respect to the central, reference trajectory. Measurements performed using a 148Gd alpha source installed at the target position of the spectrometer are compared to ion-optical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. The transmission efficiency as a function of angle and kinetic energy/charge is described empirically using piecewise Gaussian functions whose parameters are fit to the data.</description>

      <title>Microscopic study of low-lying states in odd-mass nuclei for atomic electric dipole moment searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a microscopic study of the low-lying states of five odd-mass nuclei of particular interest for experimental searches of atomic electric dipole moments (EDMs): $^{129}$Xe, $^{199}$Hg, $^{225}$Ra, $^{229}$Th, and $^{229}$Pa. The analysis is performed within the recently developed multi-reference covariant density functional theory (MR-CDFT), which incorporates symmetry restoration and configuration mixing based on self-consistent mean-field solutions. The calculated energy spectra and electromagnetic observables of these nuclei are reasonably well reproduced without introducing any parameters beyond those of the underlying universal relativistic energy density functional. The results demonstrate the reliability of MR-CDFT in describing the structure of these nuclei and in providing essential input on nuclear Schiff moments relevant to ongoing EDM searches.</description>

      <title>Ultracold neutron energy spectrum and storage properties from magnetically induced spin depolarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for extracting the energy spectrum of ultracold neutrons from magnetically induced spin depolarization measurements using the n2EDM apparatus. This method is also sensitive to the storage properties of the materials used to trap ultracold neutrons, specifically, whether collisions are specular or diffuse. We highlight the sensitivity of this new technique by comparing the two different storage chambers of the n2EDM experiment. We validate the extraction by comparing to an independent measurement for how this energy spectrum is polarized through a magnetic-filter, and finally, we calculate the neutron center-of-mass offset, an important systematic effect for measurements of the neutron electric dipole moment.</description>

      <title>A Centrality-independent Framework for Revealing Genuine Higher-Order Cumulants in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel centrality definition-independent method for analyzing higher-order cumulants, specifically addressing the challenge of volume fluctuations that dominate in low-energy heavy-ion collisions. This method reconstructs particle number distributions using the Edgeworth expansion, with parameters optimized via a combination of differential evolution algorithm and Bayesian inference. Its effectiveness is validated using UrQMD model simulations and benchmarked against traditional approaches, including centrality definitions based on particle multiplicity. Our results show that the proposed framework yields cumulant patterns consistent with those obtained using number of participant nucleon ($N_{\text{part}}$) based centrality observables, while eliminating the conventional reliance on centrality determination. This consistency confirms the method's ability to extract genuine physical signals, thereby paving the way for probing the intrinsic thermodynamic properties of the produced medium through event-by-event fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Configuration mixing effects on neutrinoless $\beta\beta$-decay nuclear matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixing and coexistence of intrinsic nuclear shapes play an important role to determine the low-energy structure of heavy nuclei, and are expected to affect nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. This problem is addressed in the interacting boson model with configuration mixing that is formulated by using the nuclear energy density functional theory. It is shown that significant amounts of mixing of normal and deformed intruder configurations are present in the ground and excited $0^+$ states in the even-even nuclei that are parent or daughter nuclei of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. An illustrative application to the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays of $^{76}$Ge, $^{96}$Zr, $^{100}$Mo, $^{116}$Cd, and $^{150}$Nd shows that the inclusion of the configuration mixing reduces the NMEs for most of the $0^+_1$ $\to$ $0^+_1$ $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays.</description>

      <title>Predictions of baryon directed flow in heavy-ion collisions at high baryon density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictions of the proton directed flow ($v_1$) in semicentral Au+Au collisions in the energy range between 4.5 and 7.7 GeV are done. The calculations are performed within the model of three-fluid dynamics with crossover equation of state, which well reproduces the proton $v_1$ both below 4.5 GeV and above 7.7 GeV, as well as bulk observables in the energy range of interest. It is predicted that the proton flow evolves non-monotonously. At the energy of 7.2 GeV it exhibits antiflow (i.e. negative slope of $v_1(y)$) in the midrapidity. At 7.7 GeV, the flow returns to the normal pattern in accordance with the STAR data. The midrapidity $v_1$-slope excitation functions within the first-order phase and crossover transitions to quark-gluon phase (QGP) turn out to be qualitatively similar, but the amplitude of the wiggle in the crossover scenario is much smaller than that in the strong first-order phase transition. Therefore, the change of sign followed by minimum at 7.2 GeV in the $v_1$-slope excitation function indicates onset of (weak phase or crossover) transition to QGP. The second change of the sign around 10 GeV results from interplay between incomplete baryon stopping and transverse expansion of the system.</description>
