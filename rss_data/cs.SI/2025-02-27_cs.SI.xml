      <title>A Parallel Hierarchical Approach for Community Detection on Large-scale Dynamic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parallel hierarchical Leiden-based algorithm for dynamic community detection. The algorithm, for a given batch update of edge insertions and deletions, partitions the network into communities using only a local neighborhood of the affected nodes. It also uses the inner hierarchical graph-based structure, which is updated incrementally in the process of optimizing the modularity of the partitioning. The algorithm has been extensively tested on various networks. The results demonstrate promising improvements in performance and scalability while maintaining the modularity of the partitioning.</description>

      <title>Too Little, Too Late: Moderation of Misinformation around the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the role of Twitter as a first line of defense against misinformation by tracking the public engagement with, and the platforms response to, 500 tweets concerning the RussoUkrainian conflict which were identified as misinformation. Using a realtime sample of 543 475 of their retweets, we find that users who geolocate themselves in the U.S. both produce and consume the largest portion of misinformation, however accounts claiming to be in Ukraine are the second largest source. At the time of writing, 84% of these tweets were still available on the platform, especially those having an anti-Russia narrative. For those that did receive some sanctions, the retweeting rate has already stabilized, pointing to ineffectiveness of the measures to stem their spread. These findings point to the need for a change in the existing anti-misinformation system ecosystem. We propose several design and research guidelines for its possible improvement.</description>

      <title>Analyzing User Perceptions of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Reddit: Sentiment and Topic Modeling of ChatGPT and DeepSeek Discussions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While there is an increased discourse on large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and DeepSeek, there is no comprehensive understanding of how users of online platforms, like Reddit, perceive these models. This is an important omission because public opinion can influence AI development, trust, and future policy. This study aims at analyzing Reddit discussions about ChatGPT and DeepSeek using sentiment and topic modeling to advance the understanding of user attitudes. Some of the significant topics such as trust in AI, user expectations, potential uses of the tools, reservations about AI biases, and ethical implications of their use are explored in this study. By examining these concerns, the study provides a sense of how public sentiment might shape the direction of AI development going forward. The report also mentions whether users have faith in the technology and what they see as its future. A word frequency approach is used to identify broad topics and sentiment trends. Also, topic modeling through the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method identifies top topics in users' language, for example, potential benefits of LLMs, their technological applications, and their overall social ramifications. The study aims to inform developers and policymakers by making it easier to see how users comprehend and experience these game-changing technologies.</description>

      <title>A simple and flexible algorithm to generate real-world networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an algorithm that generates undirected graphs with three main characteristics of real-world networks: scale-freeness, short distances between nodes (small-world phenomenon), and large clustering coefficients. The main idea is to perform random walks across the network and, at each iteration, add special edges with a decreasing probability to link more distant nodes, following a specific probability distribution. A key advantage of our algorithm is its simplicity and flexibility in creating networks with different characteristics without using global information about network topology. We show how the parameters can be adjusted to generate networks with specific average distances and clustering coefficients, maintaining a long-tailed degree distribution. The implementation of our algorithm is publicly available on a GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>TikTok StitchGraph: Characterizing communication patterns on TikTok through a collection of interaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TikTok StitchGraph: a collection of 36 graphs based on TikTok stitches. With its rapid growth and widespread popularity, TikTok presents a compelling platform for study, yet given its video-first nature the network structure of the conversations that it hosts remains largely unexplored. Leveraging its recently released APIs, in combination with web scraping, we construct graphs detailing stitch relations from both a video- and user-centric perspective. Specifically, we focus on user multi-digraphs, with vertices representing users and edges representing directed stitch relations. From the user graphs, we characterize common communication patterns of the stitch using frequent subgraph mining, finding a preference for stars and star-like structures, an aversion towards cyclic structures, and directional disposition favoring in- and out-stars over mixed-direction structures. These structures are augmented with sentiment labels in the form of edge attributes. We then use these subgraphs for graph-level embeddings together with Graph2Vec, we show no clear distinction between topologies for different hashtag topic categories. Lastly, we compare our StitchGraphs to Twitter reply networks and show that a remakable similarity between the conversation networks on the two platforms.</description>

      <title>Network dynamics of community resilience and recovery: new frontier in disaster research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disasters impact communities through interconnected social, spatial, and physical networks. Analyzing network dynamics is crucial for understanding resilience and recovery. We highlight six studies demonstrating how hazards and recovery processes spread through these networks, revealing key phenomena, such as flood exposure, emergent social cohesion, and critical recovery multipliers. This network-centric approach can uncover vulnerabilities, inform interventions, and advance equitable resilience strategies in the face of escalating risks.</description>

      <title>Sampling nodes and hyperedges via random walks on large hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a fundamental framework for representing complex systems involving interactions among three or more entities. As empirical hypergraphs grow in size, characterizing their structural properties becomes increasingly challenging due to computational complexity and, in some cases, restricted access to complete data, requiring efficient sampling methods. Random walks offer a practical approach to hypergraph sampling, as they rely solely on local neighborhood information from nodes and hyperedges. In this study, we investigate methods for simultaneously sampling nodes and hyperedges via random walks on large hypergraphs. First, we compare three existing random walks in the context of hypergraph sampling and identify an advantage of the so-called higher-order random walk. Second, by extending an established technique for graphs to the case of hypergraphs, we present a non-backtracking variant of the higher-order random walk. We derive theoretical results on estimators based on the non-backtracking higher-order random walk and validate them through numerical simulations on large empirical hypergraphs. Third, we apply the non-backtracking higher-order random walk to a large hypergraph of co-authorships indexed in the OpenAlex database, where full access to the data is not readily available. Despite the relatively small sample size, our estimates largely align with previous findings on author productivity, team size, and the prevalence of open-access publications. Our findings contribute to the development of analysis methods for large hypergraphs, offering insights into sampling strategies and estimation techniques applicable to real-world complex systems.</description>

      <title>Language-Driven Opinion Dynamics in Agent-Based Simulations with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how opinions evolve is crucial for addressing issues such as polarization, radicalization, and consensus in social systems. While much research has focused on identifying factors influencing opinion change, the role of language and argumentative fallacies remains underexplored. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating how language - along with social dynamics - influences opinion evolution through LODAS, a Language-Driven Opinion Dynamics Model for Agent-Based Simulations. The model simulates debates around the "Ship of Theseus" paradox, in which agents with discrete opinions interact with each other and evolve their opinions by accepting, rejecting, or ignoring the arguments presented. We study three different scenarios: balanced, polarized, and unbalanced opinion distributions. Agreeableness and sycophancy emerge as two main characteristics of LLM agents, and consensus around the presented statement emerges almost in any setting. Moreover, such AI agents are often producers of fallacious arguments in the attempt of persuading their peers and - for their complacency - they are also highly influenced by arguments built on logical fallacies. These results highlight the potential of this framework not only for simulating social dynamics but also for exploring from another perspective biases and shortcomings of LLMs, which may impact their interactions with humans.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Students' Emerging Roles Based on Quantity and Heterogeneity of Individual Contributions in Small Group Online Collaborative Learning Using Bipartite Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding students' emerging roles in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) is critical for promoting regulated learning processes and supporting learning at both individual and group levels. However, it has been challenging to disentangle individual performance from group-based deliverables. This study introduces new learning analytic methods based on student -- subtask bipartite networks to gauge two conceptual dimensions -- quantity and heterogeneity of individual contribution to subtasks -- for understanding students' emerging roles in online collaborative learning in small groups. We analyzed these two dimensions and explored the changes of individual emerging roles within seven groups of high school students ($N = 21$) in two consecutive collaborative learning projects. We found a significant association in the changes between assigned leadership roles and changes in the identified emerging roles between the two projects, echoing the importance of externally facilitated regulation scaffolding in CSCL. We also collected qualitative data through a semi-structured interview to further validate the quantitative analysis results, which revealed that student perceptions of their emerging roles were consistent with the quantitative analysis results. This study contributes new learning analytic methods for collaboration analytics as well as a two-dimensional theoretical framework for understanding students' emerging roles in small group CSCL.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Language Evolution under Regulated Social Media Platforms: A Synergistic Approach of Large Language Models and Genetic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms frequently impose restrictive policies to moderate user content, prompting the emergence of creative evasion language strategies. This paper presents a multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate the iterative evolution of language strategies under regulatory constraints. In this framework, participant agents, as social media users, continuously evolve their language expression, while supervisory agents emulate platform-level regulation by assessing policy violations. To achieve a more faithful simulation, we employ a dual design of language strategies (constraint and expression) to differentiate conflicting goals and utilize an LLM-driven GA (Genetic Algorithm) for the selection, mutation, and crossover of language strategies. The framework is evaluated using two distinct scenarios: an abstract password game and a realistic simulated illegal pet trade scenario. Experimental results demonstrate that as the number of dialogue rounds increases, both the number of uninterrupted dialogue turns and the accuracy of information transmission improve significantly. Furthermore, a user study with 40 participants validates the real-world relevance of the generated dialogues and strategies. Moreover, ablation studies validate the importance of the GA, emphasizing its contribution to long-term adaptability and improved overall results.</description>

      <title>Estimating Nodal Spreading Influence Using Partial Temporal Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal networks, whose links are activated or deactivated over time, are used to represent complex systems such as social interactions or collaborations occurring at specific times. Such networks facilitate the spread of information and epidemics. The average number of nodes infected via a spreading process on a network starting from a single seed node over a given period is called the influence of that node. In this paper, we address the question of how to utilize the partially observed temporal network (local and of short duration) around each node, to estimate the ranking of nodes in spreading influence on the full network over a long period. This is essential for target marketing and epidemic/misinformation mitigation where only partial network information is possibly accessible. This would also enable us to understand which network properties of a node, observed locally and shortly after the start of the spreading process, determine its influence. We systematically propose a set of nodal centrality metrics based on partial temporal network information, encoding diverse properties of (time-respecting) walks. It is found that distinct centrality metrics perform the best in estimating nodal influence depending on the infection probability of the spreading process. For a broad range of the infection probability, a node tends to be influential if it can reach many distinct nodes via time-respecting walks and if these nodes can be reached early in time. We find and explain why the proposed metrics generally outperform classic centrality metrics derived from both full and partial temporal networks.</description>

      <title>Policy-as-Prompt: Rethinking Content Moderation in the Age of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Content moderation plays a critical role in shaping safe and inclusive online environments, balancing platform standards, user expectations, and regulatory frameworks. Traditionally, this process involves operationalising policies into guidelines, which are then used by downstream human moderators for enforcement, or to further annotate datasets for training machine learning moderation models. However, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) are transforming this landscape. These models can now interpret policies directly as textual inputs, eliminating the need for extensive data curation. This approach offers unprecedented flexibility, as moderation can be dynamically adjusted through natural language interactions. This paradigm shift raises important questions about how policies are operationalised and the implications for content moderation practices. In this paper, we formalise the emerging policy-as-prompt framework and identify five key challenges across four domains: Technical Implementation (1. translating policy to prompts, 2. sensitivity to prompt structure and formatting), Sociotechnical (3. the risk of technological determinism in policy formation), Organisational (4. evolving roles between policy and machine learning teams), and Governance (5. model governance and accountability). Through analysing these challenges across technical, sociotechnical, organisational, and governance dimensions, we discuss potential mitigation approaches. This research provides actionable insights for practitioners and lays the groundwork for future exploration of scalable and adaptive content moderation systems in digital ecosystems.</description>

      <title>TrajLLM: A Modular LLM-Enhanced Agent-Based Framework for Realistic Human Trajectory Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate human mobility, addressing challenges like high costs and privacy concerns in traditional models. Our hierarchical framework integrates persona generation, activity selection, and destination prediction, using real-world demographic and psychological data to create realistic movement patterns. Both physical models and language models are employed to explore and demonstrate different methodologies for human mobility simulation. By structuring data with summarization and weighted density metrics, the system ensures scalable memory management while retaining actionable insights. Preliminary results indicate that LLM-driven simulations align with observed real-world patterns, offering scalable, interpretable insights for social problems such as urban planning, traffic management, and public health. The framework's ability to dynamically generate personas and activities enables it to provide adaptable and realistic daily routines. This study demonstrates the transformative potential of LLMs in advancing mobility modeling for societal and urban applications. The source code and interactive demo for our framework are available at https://github.com/cju0/TrajLLM.</description>

      <title>Exploring Graph Tasks with Pure LLMs: A Comprehensive Benchmark and Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph-structured data has become increasingly prevalent across various domains, raising the demand for effective models to handle graph tasks like node classification and link prediction. Traditional graph learning models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant strides, but their capabilities in handling graph data remain limited in certain contexts. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising candidates for graph tasks, yet most studies focus primarily on performance benchmarks and fail to address their broader potential, including their ability to handle limited data, their transferability across tasks, and their robustness. In this work, we provide a comprehensive exploration of LLMs applied to graph tasks. We evaluate the performance of pure LLMs, including those without parameter optimization and those fine-tuned with instructions, across various scenarios. Our analysis goes beyond accuracy, assessing LLM ability to perform in few-shot/zero-shot settings, transfer across domains, understand graph structures, and demonstrate robustness in challenging scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments with 16 graph learning models alongside 6 LLMs (e.g., Llama3B, GPT-4o, Qwen-plus), comparing their performance on datasets like Cora, PubMed, ArXiv, and Products. Our findings show that LLMs, particularly those with instruction tuning, outperform traditional models in few-shot settings, exhibit strong domain transferability, and demonstrate excellent generalization and robustness. This work offers valuable insights into the capabilities of LLMs for graph learning, highlighting their advantages and potential for real-world applications, and paving the way for future research in this area. Codes and datasets are released in https://github.com/myflashbarry/LLM-benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Stationary distribution of node2vec random walks on household models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The node2vec random walk has proven to be a key tool in network embedding algorithms. These random walks are tuneable, and their transition probabilities depend on the previous visited node and on the triangles containing the current and the previously visited node. Even though these walks are widely used in practice, most mathematical properties of node2vec walks are largely unexplored, including their stationary distribution. We study the node2vec random walk on community-structured household model graphs. We prove an explicit description of the stationary distribution of node2vec walks in terms of the walk parameters. We then show that by tuning the walk parameters, the stationary distribution can interpolate between uniform, size-biased, or the simple random walk stationary distributions, demonstrating the wide range of possible walks. We further explore these effects on some specific graph settings.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimal Transport and Embedding for Network Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network alignment, which aims to find node correspondence across different networks, is the cornerstone of various downstream multi-network and Web mining tasks. Most of the embedding-based methods indirectly model cross-network node relationships by contrasting positive and negative node pairs sampled from hand-crafted strategies, which are vulnerable to graph noises and lead to potential misalignment of nodes. Another line of work based on the optimal transport (OT) theory directly models cross-network node relationships and generates noise-reduced alignments. However, OT methods heavily rely on fixed, pre-defined cost functions that prohibit end-to-end training and are hard to generalize. In this paper, we aim to unify the embedding and OT-based methods in a mutually beneficial manner and propose a joint optimal transport and embedding framework for network alignment named JOENA. For one thing (OT for embedding), through a simple yet effective transformation, the noise-reduced OT mapping serves as an adaptive sampling strategy directly modeling all cross-network node pairs for robust embedding learning.For another (embedding for OT), on top of the learned embeddings, the OT cost can be gradually trained in an end-to-end fashion, which further enhances the alignment quality. With a unified objective, the mutual benefits of both methods can be achieved by an alternating optimization schema with guaranteed convergence. Extensive experiments on real-world networks validate the effectiveness and scalability of JOENA, achieving up to 16% improvement in MRR and 20x speedup compared with the state-of-the-art alignment methods.</description>

      <title>Impact of Fake Agents on Information Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.05518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In online markets, agents often learn from other's actions in addition to their private information. Such observational learning can lead to herding or information cascades in which agents eventually ignore their private information and "follow the crowd". Models for such cascades have been well studied for Bayes-rational agents that arrive sequentially and choose pay-off optimal actions. This paper additionally considers the presence of fake agents that take a fixed action in order to influence subsequent rational agents towards their preferred action. We characterize how the fraction of such fake agents impacts the behavior of rational agents given a fixed quality of private information. Our model results in a Markov chain with a countably infinite state space, for which we give an iterative method to compute an agent's chances of herding and its welfare (expected pay-off). Our main result shows a counter-intuitive phenomenon: there exist infinitely many scenarios where an increase in the fraction of fake agents in fact reduces the chances of their preferred outcome. Moreover, this increase causes a significant improvement in the welfare of every rational agent. Hence, this increase is not only counter-productive for the fake agents but is also beneficial to the rational agents.</description>

      <title>What is a Social Media Bot? A Global Comparison of Bot and Human Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chatter on social media is 20% bots and 80% humans. Chatter by bots and humans is consistently different: bots tend to use linguistic cues that can be easily automated while humans use cues that require dialogue understanding. Bots use words that match the identities they choose to present, while humans may send messages that are not related to the identities they present. Bots and humans differ in their communication structure: sampled bots have a star interaction structure, while sampled humans have a hierarchical structure. These conclusions are based on a large-scale analysis of social media tweets across ~200mil users across 7 events. Social media bots took the world by storm when social-cybersecurity researchers realized that social media users not only consisted of humans but also of artificial agents called bots. These bots wreck havoc online by spreading disinformation and manipulating narratives. Most research on bots are based on special-purposed definitions, mostly predicated on the event studied. This article first begins by asking, "What is a bot?", and we study the underlying principles of how bots are different from humans. We develop a first-principle definition of a social media bot. With this definition as a premise, we systematically compare characteristics between bots and humans across global events, and reflect on how the software-programmed bot is an Artificial Intelligent algorithm, and its potential for evolution as technology advances. Based on our results, we provide recommendations for the use and regulation of bots. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions: Detect, to systematically identify these automated and potentially evolving bots; Differentiate, to evaluate the goodness of the bot in terms of their content postings and relationship interactions; Disrupt, to moderate the impact of malicious bots.</description>
