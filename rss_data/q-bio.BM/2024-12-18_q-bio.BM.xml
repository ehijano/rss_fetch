      <title>InterPLM: Discovering Interpretable Features in Protein Language Models via Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in protein modeling and design, yet their internal mechanisms for predicting structure and function remain poorly understood. Here we present a systematic approach to extract and analyze interpretable features from PLMs using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). By training SAEs on embeddings from the PLM ESM-2, we identify up to 2,548 human-interpretable latent features per layer that strongly correlate with up to 143 known biological concepts such as binding sites, structural motifs, and functional domains. In contrast, examining individual neurons in ESM-2 reveals up to 46 neurons per layer with clear conceptual alignment across 15 known concepts, suggesting that PLMs represent most concepts in superposition. Beyond capturing known annotations, we show that ESM-2 learns coherent concepts that do not map onto existing annotations and propose a pipeline using language models to automatically interpret novel latent features learned by the SAEs. As practical applications, we demonstrate how these latent features can fill in missing annotations in protein databases and enable targeted steering of protein sequence generation. Our results demonstrate that PLMs encode rich, interpretable representations of protein biology and we propose a systematic framework to extract and analyze these latent features. In the process, we recover both known biology and potentially new protein motifs. As community resources, we introduce InterPLM (interPLM.ai), an interactive visualization platform for exploring and analyzing learned PLM features, and release code for training and analysis at github.com/ElanaPearl/interPLM.</description>

      <title>Guiding Generative Protein Language Models with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive protein language models (pLMs) have emerged as powerful tools to efficiently design functional proteins with extraordinary diversity, as evidenced by the successful generation of diverse enzyme families, including lysozymes or carbonic anhydrases. However, a fundamental limitation of pLMs is their propensity to sample from dense regions within the training distribution, which constrains their ability to sample from rare, high-value regions of the sequence space. This limitation becomes particularly critical in applications targeting underrepresented distribution tails, such as engineering for enzymatic activity or binding affinity. To address this challenge, we implement DPO_pLM, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for protein sequence optimization with pLMs. Drawing inspiration from the success of RL in aligning language models to human preferences, we approach protein optimization as an iterative process that fine-tunes pLM weights to maximize a reward provided by an external oracle. Our strategy demonstrates that RL can efficiently optimize for a variety of custom properties without the need for additional data, achieving significant while preserving sequence diversity. We applied DPO_pLM to the design of EGFR binders, successfully identifying nanomolar binders within hours. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/AI4PDLab/DPO_pLM.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamic forces driving DNA-protein interactions at large distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper we address the general problem of selective electrodynamic interactions between DNA and protein, which is motivated by decades of theoretical study and our very recent experimental findings (M. Lechelon et al, \textit{Sci Adv} \textbf{8,} eabl5855 (2022)). Inspired by the Davydov and Holstein-Fr\"{o}hlich models describing electron motion along biomolecules, and using a model Hamiltonian written in second quantization, the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) is used to derive the dynamical equations of the system. We demonstrate the efficacy of this {second-quantized} model for a well-documented biochemical system consisting of a restriction enzyme, \textit{Eco}RI, which binds selectively to a palindromic six-base-pair target within a DNA oligonucleotide sequence to catalyze a DNA double-strand cleavage. The time-domain Fourier spectra of the electron currents numerically computed for the DNA fragment and for the \textit{Eco}RI enzyme, respectively, exhibit a cross-correlation spectrum with a sharp co-resonance peak. When the target DNA recognition sequence is randomized, this sharp co-resonance peak is replaced with a broad and noisy spectrum. Such a sequence-dependent charge transfer phenomenology is suggestive of a potentially rich variety of selective electrodynamic interactions influencing the coordinated activity of DNA substrates, enzymes, transcription factors, ligands, and other proteins under realistic biochemical conditions characterized by electron-phonon excitations.</description>

      <title>Entropy as a Design Principle in the Photosystem II Supercomplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12418</link>

Abstract: Photosystem II (PSII) can achieve near-unity quantum efficiency of light harvesting in ideal conditions and can dissipate excess light energy as heat to prevent formation of reactive oxygen species under light stress. Understanding how this pigment-protein complex accomplishes these opposing goals is a topic of great interest that has so far been explored primarily through the lens of the system energetics. Despite PSII's known flat energy landscape, a thorough consideration of the entropic effects on energy transfer in PSII is lacking. In this work, we aim to discern the free energetic design principles underlying the PSII energy transfer network. To accomplish this goal, we employ a structure-based rate matrix and compute the free energy terms in time following a specific initial excitation to discern how entropy and enthalpy drive ensemble system dynamics. We find that the interplay between the entropy and enthalpy components differs among each protein subunit, which allows each subunit to fulfill a unique role in the energy transfer network. This individuality ensures PSII can accomplish efficient energy trapping in the RC, effective NPQ in the periphery, and robust energy trapping in the other-monomer RC if the same-monomer RC is closed. We also show that entropy, in particular, is a dynamically tunable feature of the PSII free energy landscape accomplished through regulation of LHCII binding. These findings help rationalize natural photosynthesis and provide design principles for novel, more efficient solar energy harvesting technologies.</description>
