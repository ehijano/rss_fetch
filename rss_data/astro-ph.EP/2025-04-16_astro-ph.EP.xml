      <title>CAMPOS II. The onset of protostellar disk substructures and planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1.3 mm CAMPOS survey has resolved 90 protostellar disks with $\sim$15 au resolution across the Ophiuchus, Corona Australis, and Chamaeleon star-forming regions. To address the fundamental question, "When does planet formation begin?", we combined the CAMPOS sample with literature observations of Class 0-II disks (bolometric temperature, $T_{\rm bol} \le 1900$ K), all mapped at 1.3 mm with resolutions ranging from 4 to 33 au. To investigate substructure detection rates as a function of bolometric temperature, we restricted the sample to disks observed at the 1.3 mm wavelength, with inclinations below 75$^\circ$, linear resolution $\le 20$ au and resolved with at least four resolution elements ($\theta_{\rm disk}/\theta_{\rm res} \ge 4$). We also considered the effects of extinction correction and the inclusion of Herschel Space Telescope data on the bolometric temperature measurements, to constrain the lower and upper limits of bolometric temperature for each source. We find that by $T_{\rm bol} \sim 200-400\,K$, substructure detection rates increased sharply to $\sim$60%, corresponding to an approximate age of $0.2-0.4$ Myr. No substructures are detected in Class 0 disks. The ratio of disk-averaged brightness temperature to predicted dust temperature shows a trend of increasing values toward the youngest Class 0 disks, suggesting higher optical depths in these early stages. Classifying disks with substructures into those with and without large central cavities, we find both populations coexisting across evolutionary stages, suggesting they are not necessarily evolutionarily linked. Our statistical analysis confirms that substructures similar to those in Class II disks are already common by the Class I stage, and the emergence of these structures at $T_{\rm bol} \sim 200-400\,K$ could represent only an upper limit.</description>

      <title>Probing the Outskirts of M Dwarf Planetary Systems with a Cycle 1 JWST NIRCam Coronagraphy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population of giant planets on wide orbits around low-mass M dwarf stars is poorly understood, but the unprecedented sensitivity of JWST NIRCam coronagraphic imaging now provides direct access to planets significantly less massive than Jupiter beyond 10 AU around the closest, youngest M dwarfs. We present the design, observations, and results of JWST GTO Program 1184, a Cycle 1 NIRCam coronagraphic imaging survey of 9 very nearby and young low-mass stars at 3-5 micron wavelengths. In the F356W and F444W filters, we achieve survey median 5-sigma contrasts deeper than 10-5 at a separation of 1", corresponding to 0.20 MJup in F444W and 1.30 MJup in F356W at planet-star separations of 10 AU. Our results include 3-5 micron debris disk detections and the identification of many extended and point-like sources in the final post-processed images. In particular, we have identified two marginal point source candidates having fluxes and color limits consistent with model predictions for young sub-Jupiter mass exoplanets. Under the assumption that neither candidate is confirmed, we place the first direct-imaging occurrence constraints on M dwarf wide-orbit (semimajor axes 10-100 AU), sub-Jupiter mass exoplanets (0.3-1 MJup). We find frequency limits of &lt; 0.10 and &lt; 0.16 objects per star with 1 and 3-sigma confidence, respectively. This survey brings to the forefront the unprecedented capabilities of JWST NIRCam coronagraphic imaging when targeting young, low-mass stars and acts as a precursor to broader surveys to place deep statistical constraints on wide-orbit, sub-Jupiter mass planets around M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Radiative Flux from a High-Resolution Atmospheric Dynamics Simulation of a Hot-Jupiter for JWST and Ariel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present medium-wave ($\sim$0.5~$\mu$m to $\sim$13~$\mu$m) radiative flux distributions and spectra derived from high-resolution atmospheric dynamics simulations of an exoplanet \WASPP. This planet serves to illustrate several important features. Assuming different chemical compositions for its atmosphere (e.g., H$_2$/He only and $Z \in \{1, 12\}$ times solar metallicity), the outgoing radiative flux is computed using full radiative transfer that folds in the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Ariel instrument characteristics. We find that the observed variability depends strongly on the the assumed chemistry and the instrument wavelength range, hence the probed altitude of the atmosphere. With H$_2$/He only, the flux and variability originate near the 10$^5$~Pa level; with solar and higher metallicity, $\sim$10$^3$~Pa level is probed, and the variability is distinguishably reduced. Our calculations show that JWST and Ariel have the sensitivity to capture the atmospheric variability of exoplanets like \WASPP, depending on the metallicity -- both in repeated eclipse and phase-curve observations.</description>

      <title>Planetary albedo is limited by the above-cloud atmosphere: Implications for sub-Neptune climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy limits that delineate the `habitable zone' for exoplanets depend on a given exoplanet's net planetary albedo (or `Bond albedo'). We here demonstrate that the planetary albedo of an observed exoplanet is limited by the above-cloud atmosphere - the region of the atmosphere that is probed in remote observation. We derive an analytic model to explore how the maximum planetary albedo depends on the above-cloud optical depth and scattering versus absorbing properties, even in the limit of a perfectly reflective grey cloud layer. We apply this framework to sub-Neptune K2-18b, for which a high planetary albedo has recently been invoked to argue for the possibility of maintaining a liquid water ocean surface, despite K2-18b receiving an energy flux from its host star that places it inside of its estimated `habitable zone' inner edge. We use a numerical multiple-scattering line-by-line radiative transfer model to retrieve the albedo of K2-18b based on the observational constraints from the above-cloud atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that K2-18b's observed transmission spectrum already restricts its possible planetary albedo to values below the threshold required to be potentially habitable, with the data favouring a median planetary albedo of 0.17-0.18. Our results thus reveal that currently characteriseable sub-Neptunes are likely to be magma-ocean or gas-dwarf worlds. The methods that we present are generally applicable to constrain the planetary albedo of any exoplanet with measurements of its observable atmosphere, enabling the quantification of potential exoplanet habitability with current observational capabilities.</description>

      <title>Activity-Induced Near-Infrared Variability at 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1, 2017-2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 (SW1) is both the first-discovered active Centaur and the most outburst-prone comet known. The nature of SW1's many outbursts, which regularly brighten the comet by five magnitudes or more, and what processes power them has been of particular interest since SW1's discovery in the 1920s. In this paper, we present and model four epochs of low-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy of SW1 taken with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility and Lowell Discovery Telescope between 2017 and 2022. This dataset includes one large outburst, two periods of low activity ("quiescence" or "quiescent activity"), and one mid-sized outburst a few days after one of the quiescent observations. The two quiescent epochs appear similar in both spectral slope and modeled grain size distributions, but the two outbursts are significantly different. We propose that the two can be reconciled if smaller dust grains are accelerated more than larger ones, such that observations closer to the onset of an outburst are more sensitive to the finer-grained dust on the outside of the expanding cloud of material. These outbursts can thus appear very rapid but there is still a period in which the dust and gas are well-coupled. We find no strong evidence of water ice absorption in any of our spectra, suggesting that the areal abundance of ice-dominated grains is less than one percent. We conclude with a discussion of future modeling and monitoring efforts which might be able to further advance our understanding of this object's complicated activity patterns.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the origin of giant exoplanets -- Observational implications of convective mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between the atmospheric composition of giant planets and their origin remains elusive. In this study, we explore how convective mixing can link the planetary primordial state to its atmospheric composition. We simulate the long-term evolution of gas giants with masses between 0.3 and 3 Jupiter masses, considering various composition profiles and primordial entropies (assuming no entropy-mass dependence). Our results show that when convective mixing is considered, the atmospheric metallicity increases with time and that this time evolution encodes information about the planetary primordial structure. Additionally, the degree of compositional mixing affects the planetary radius, altering its evolution in a measurable way. By applying mock observations, we demonstrate that combining radius and atmospheric composition can help to constrain the planetary formation history. Young systems emerge as prime targets for such characterization, with lower-mass gas giants (approaching Saturn's mass) being particularly susceptible to mixing-induced changes. Our findings highlight convective mixing as a key mechanism for probing the primordial state of giant planets, offering new constraints on formation models and demonstrating that the conditions inside giant planets shortly after their formation are not necessarily erased over billions of years and can leave a lasting imprint on their evolution.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Moon's Earth-like isotopic composition from giant impact on a differential rotating proto-Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the giant impact theory, the Moon formed by accreting the circum-terrestrial debris disk produced by Theia colliding with the proto-Earth. The giant impact theory can explain most of the properties of the Earth-Moon system, however, simulations of giant impact between a planetary embryo and the growing proto-Earth indicate that the materials in the circum-terrestrial debris disk produced by the impact originate mainly from the impactor, contradicting with the fact that different Solar System bodies have distinct compositions. Thus, the giant impact theory has difficulty explaining the Moon's Earth-like isotopic compositions. More materials from the proto-Earth could be delivered to the circum-terrestrial debris disk when a slightly sub-Mars-sized body collides with a fast rotating planet of rigid rotation but the resulting angular momentum is too large compared with that of the current Earth-Moon system. Since planetesimals accreted by the proto-Earth hit the surface of the proto-Earth, enhancing the rotation rate of the surface of the proto-Earth. The surface's fast rotation rate relative to the slow rotation rate of the inner region of the proto-Earth leads to transfer of angular momentum from surface to inner, resulting in the differential rotation. Here, we show that the giant impact of a sub-Mars-sized body on a differential rotating proto-Earth with a fast rotating outer region and a relative slow rotating inner region could result in a circum-terrestrial debris disk with materials predominately from the proto-Earth without violating the angular momentum constraint. The theory proposed here may provide a viable way of explaining the similarity in the isotopic compositions of the Earth and Moon.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a polar circumbinary exoplanet orbiting a pair of eclipsing brown dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One notable example of exoplanet diversity is the population of circumbinary planets, which orbit around both stars of a binary star system. There are so far only 16 known circumbinary exoplanets, all of which lie in the same orbital plane as the host binary. Suggestions exist that circumbinary planets could also exist on orbits highly inclined to the binary, close to 90$^{\circ}$, polar orbits. No such planets have been found yet but polar circumbinary gas and debris discs have been observed and if these were to form planets then those would be left on a polar orbit. We report strong evidence for a polar circumbinary exoplanet, which orbits a close pair of brown dwarfs which are on an eccentric orbit. We use radial-velocities to measure a retrograde apsidal precession for the binary, and show that this can only be attributed to the presence of a polar planet.</description>

      <title>New Constraints on DMS and DMDS in the Atmosphere of K2-18 b from JWST MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sub-Neptune frontier has opened a new window into the rich diversity of planetary environments beyond the solar system. The possibility of hycean worlds, with planet-wide oceans and H$_2$-rich atmospheres, significantly expands and accelerates the search for habitable environments elsewhere. Recent JWST transmission spectroscopy of the candidate hycean world K2-18 b in the near-infrared led to the first detections of carbon-bearing molecules CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ in its atmosphere, with a composition consistent with predictions for hycean conditions. The observations also provided a tentative hint of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a possible biosignature gas, but the inference was of low statistical significance. We report a mid-infrared transmission spectrum of K2-18 b obtained using the JWST MIRI LRS instrument in the ~6-12 $\mu$m range. The spectrum shows distinct features and is inconsistent with a featureless spectrum at 3.4-$\sigma$ significance compared to our canonical model. We find that the spectrum cannot be explained by most molecules predicted for K2-18 b with the exception of DMS and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), also a potential biosignature gas. We report new independent evidence for DMS and/or DMDS in the atmosphere at 3-$\sigma$ significance, with high abundance ($\gtrsim$10 ppmv) of at least one of the two molecules. More observations are needed to increase the robustness of the findings and resolve the degeneracy between DMS and DMDS. The results also highlight the need for additional experimental and theoretical work to determine accurate cross sections of important biosignature gases and identify potential abiotic sources. We discuss the implications of the present findings for the possibility of biological activity on K2-18 b.</description>

      <title>The Dynamic Inner Disk of a Planet Forming Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets are a natural byproduct of the stellar formation process, resulting from local aggregations of material within the disks surrounding young stars. Whereas signatures of gas-giant planets at large orbital separations have been observed and successfully modeled within protoplanetary disks, the formation pathways of planets within their host star's future habitable zones remain poorly understood. Analyzing multiple nights of observations conducted over a short, two-month span with the MIRC-X and PIONIER instruments at the CHARA Array and VLTI, respectively, we uncover a highly active environment at the inner-edge of the planet formation region in the disk of HD 163296. In particular, we localize and track the motion of a disk feature near the dust-sublimation radius with a pattern speed of less than half the local Keplerian velocity, providing a potential glimpse at the planet formation process in action within the inner astronomical unit. We emphasize that this result is at the edge of what is currently possible with available optical interferometric techniques and behooves confirmation with a temporally dense followup observing campaign.</description>

      <title>The Resonant Remains of Broken Chains from Major and Minor Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TESS and Kepler have revealed that practically all close-in sub-Neptunes form in mean-motion resonant chains, most of which unravel on timescales of 100 Myr. Using N-body integrations, we study how planetary collisions from destabilized resonant chains produce the orbital period distribution observed among mature systems, focusing on the resonant fine structures remaining post-instability. In their natal chains, planets near first-order resonances have period ratios just wide of perfect commensurability, driven there by disk migration and eccentricity damping. Sufficiently large resonant libration amplitudes are needed to trigger instability. Ensuing collisions between planets ("major mergers") erode but do not eliminate resonant pairs; surviving pairs show up as narrow "peaks" just wide of commensurability in the histogram of neighboring-planet period ratios. Merger products exhibit a broad range of period ratios, filling the space between relatively closely-separated resonances such as the 5:4, 4:3, and 3:2, but failing to bridge the wider gap between the 3:2 and 2:1 -- a "trough" thus manifests just short of the 2:1 resonance, as observed. Major mergers generate debris which undergoes "minor mergers" with planets, in many cases further widening resonant pairs. With all this dynamical activity, free eccentricities of resonant pairs, and by extension the phases of their transit timing variations, are readily excited. Non-resonant planets, being merger products, are predicted to have higher masses than resonant planets, as observed. At the same time, a small fraction of mergers produce a high-mass tail in the resonant population, also observed.</description>

      <title>Searching for Additional Planets in TESS Multi-Planet Systems: Testing Empirical Models Based on Kepler Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-planet system architectures are frequently used to constrain possible formation and evolutionary pathways of observed exoplanets. Therefore, understanding the predictive and descriptive power of empirical models of these systems is critical to understanding their formation histories. Additionally, if empirical models can reproduce architectures over a range of scales, transit and radial velocity observations can be more easily and effectively used to inform future microlensing, astrometric, and direct imaging surveys. We analyze 52 TESS multi-planet systems previously studied using Dynamite (Dietrich &amp; Apai 2020), who used TESS data alongside empirical models based on Kepler planets to predict additional planets in each system. We analyze additional TESS data to search for these predicted planets. We thereby evaluate the degree to which these models can be used to predict planets in TESS multi-planet systems. Specifically, we study whether a period ratio method or clustered period model is more predictive. We find that the period ratio model predictions are most consistent with the planets discovered since 2020, accounting for detection sensitivity. However, neither model is highly predictive, highlighting the need for additional data and nuanced models to describe the full population. Improved eccentricity and dynamical stability prescriptions incorporated into Dynamite provide a modest improvement in the prediction accuracy. We also find that the current sample of 183 TESS multi-planet systems are are highly dynamically packed, and appear truncated relative to detection biases. These attributes are consistent with the Kepler sample, and suggest a highly efficient formation process.</description>

Abstract: The search for radio signals from exoplanets or star-planet interactions is a major challenge, as it is likely the best way to detect and measure a planetary magnetic field and thus prob exoplanets' interior structure. The aim of this article is to demonstrate the relevance of using statistical tools to detect periodic radio signals in unevenly spaced observations, and identify the implications of eas measured period. Identification of periodic radio signal is achieved here by a Lomb-Scargle (LS) analysis. We first apply the technique on simulated astrophysical observations with controlled simulated noise. This allows to characterize the origin of spurious detection peaks in the resulting periodograms, as well as identifying peaks due to real periods in the studied system, as well as resonance or beat periods. We then validate this method on a real signal, using ~1400 hours of data from observations of Jupiter's radio emissions by the NenuFAR radio telescope over more than six years to detect jovian radio emissions periodicities (auroral and induced by the Galilean moons). We demonstrate with the simulation that the LS periodogram allows to correctly identify periodic radio signal, even in a diluted signal. On real measurements, it correctly detects the rotation period of the strong signal produced by Jupiter and the synodic period of the emission triggered by the interaction between Jupiter and its Galilean moon Io, but also possibly weaker signal such as the one produced by the interaction between Jupiter and Europa or between Jupiter and Ganymede. It is important to note that secondary peaks in the LS periodogram will be observed at the synodic and resonance periods between all the detected signal periodicities (i.e. real signals, but also periodicities in the observation). These secondary peaks can then be used to strengthen the detections of weak signals.</description>

Abstract: The nature of sub-Neptunes is one of the hottest topics in exoplanetary science. Temperate sub-Neptunes are of special interest because some could be habitable. Here, we consider whether these planets might instead be rocky worlds with thick, hot atmospheres. Can recent JWST observations of TOI-270 d be understood in terms of such a model? We perform thermochemical equilibrium calculations to infer conditions of quenching of C-H-O-N species. Our results indicate apparent CO$_2$-CH$_4$ equilibrium between ~900 and ~1100 K. The CO abundance should be quenched higher in the atmosphere where the equilibrium CO/CO$_2$ ratio is lower, potentially explaining a lack of CO. N$_2$ is predicted to dominate the nitrogen budget. We confirm that the atmosphere of TOI-270 d is strongly enriched in both C and O$_g$$_a$$_s$ relative to protosolar H, whereas N is likely to be less enriched or even depleted. We attempt to reproduce these enrichments by modeling the atmosphere as nebular gas that extracted heavy elements from accreted solids. This type of model can explain the C/H and O$_g$$_a$$_s$/H ratios, but despite supersolar C/N ratios provided by solids, the NH$_3$ abundance will probably be too high unless there is a nitrogen sink in addition to N$_2$. A magma ocean may be implied, and indeed the oxygen fugacity of the deep atmosphere seems sufficiently low to support the sequestration of reduced N in silicate melt. The evaluation presented here demonstrates that exoplanetary geochemistry now approaches a level of sophistication comparable to that achieved within our own solar system.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Dynamics Identification and Linearization of Orbital Problems using Koopman Theory</title>

Abstract: The study of the Two-Body and Circular Restricted Three-Body Problems in the field of aerospace engineering and sciences is deeply important because they help describe the motion of both celestial and artificial satellites. With the growing demand for satellites and satellite formation flying, fast and efficient control of these systems is becoming ever more important. Global linearization of these systems allows engineers to employ methods of control in order to achieve these desired results. We propose a data-driven framework for simultaneous system identification and global linearization of the Circular, Elliptical and Perturbed Two-Body Problem as well as the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem around the L1 Lagrange point via deep learning-based Koopman Theory, i.e., a framework that can identify the underlying dynamics and globally linearize it into a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The linear Koopman operator is discovered through purely data-driven training of a Deep Neural Network with a custom architecture. This paper displays the ability of the Koopman operator to generalize to various other Two-Body systems without the need for retraining. We also demonstrate the capability of the same architecture to be utilized to accurately learn a Koopman operator that approximates the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem.</description>
