      <title>The \'etale topos reconstructs varieties over sub-p-adic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a sub-$p$-adic field. We show that the functor sending a finite type $K$-scheme to its \'etale topos is fully faithful after localizing at the class of universal homeomorphisms. This generalizes a result of Voevodsky, who proved the analogous theorem for fields finitely generated over $\mathbb{Q}$. Our proof relies on Mochizuki's Hom-theorem in anabelian geometry, and a study of point-theoretic morphisms of fundamental groups of curves.</description>

      <title>Tschirnhausen bundles of covers of the projective line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A degree $d$ genus $g$ cover of the complex projective line by a smooth curve $C$ yields a vector bundle on the projective line by pushforward of the structure sheaf. Which bundles are possible? Equivalently, which $\mathbb{P}^{d-2}$-bundles over $\mathbb{P}^1$ contain such covers? (In the language of many previous papers: what are the scrollar invariants of the cover?)
  We give a complete answer in degree $4$, which exhibits the expected pathologies. We describe a polytope (one per degree) which we propose gives the complete answer for primitive covers, i.e. covers that don't factor through a subcover. We show that all such bundles (for primitive covers) lie in this polytope, and that a ``positive proportion'' of the polytope arises from smooth covers. Moreover, we show the necessity of the primitivity assumption. Finally, we show that the map from the Hurwitz space of smooth covers to the space of bundles is not flat (for $d&gt;3$ and $g \gg_d 0$).</description>

      <title>Logarithmic tautological rings of the moduli spaces of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the logarithmic tautological rings of the moduli spaces of Deligne-Mumford stable curves (together with a set of additive generators lifting the decorated strata classes of the standard tautological rings). While these algebras are infinite dimensional, a connection to polyhedral combinatorics via a new theory of homological piecewise polynomials allows an effective study. A complete calculation is given in genus 0 via the algebra of piecewise polynomials on the cone stack of the associated Artin fan (lifting Keel's presentation of the Chow ring of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}$). Counterexamples to the simplest generalizations in genus 1 are presented. We show, however, that the structure of the log tautological rings is determined by the complete knowledge of all relations in the standard tautological rings of the moduli spaces of curves. In particular, Pixton's conjecture concerning relations in the standard tautological rings lifts to a complete conjecture for relations in the log tautological rings of the moduli spaces of curves. Several open questions are discussed.
  We develop the entire theory of logarithmic tautological classes in the context of arbitrary smooth normal crossings pairs $(X,D)$ with explicit formulas for intersection products. As a special case, we give an explicit set of additive generators of the full logarithmic Chow ring of $(X,D)$ in terms of Chow classes on the strata of $X$ and piecewise polynomials on the cone stack.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a crepant transformation correspondence in genus zero Gromov-Witten theory for toric stack bundles related by crepant wall-crossings of the toric fibers. Specifically, we construct a symplectic transformation that identifies $I$-functions toric stack bundles suitably analytically continued using Mellin-Barnes integral approach. We compare our symplectic transformation with a Fourier-Mukai isomorphism between the $K$-groups.</description>

      <title>Nowhere vanishing 1-forms on varieties admitting a good minimal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove several conjectures relating the existence of nonvanishing 1- forms to smooth morphisms over abelian varieties, assuming the existence of good minimal models. The proof involves a decomposition result for a family of Calabi-Yau varieties equipped with a surjective map to an abelian scheme. In the uniruled case, supposing the MRC base admits a good minimal model, we also achieve a structure theorem for those varieties admitting nowhere vanishing 1-forms.</description>

      <title>Rees Algebras and the reduced fiber cone of divisorial filtrations on two dimensional normal local rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal I=\{I_n\}$ be a divisorial filtration on a two dimensional normal excellent local ring $(R,m_R)$. Let $R[\mathcal I]=\oplus_{n\ge 0}I_n$ be the Rees algebra of $\mathcal I$ and $\tau:\mbox{Proj}R[\mathcal I])\rightarrow \mbox{Spec}(R)$ be the natural morphism. The reduced fiber cone of $\mathcal I$ is the $R$-algebra $R[\mathcal I]/\sqrt{m_RR[\mathcal I]}$, and the reduced exceptional fiber of $\tau$ is $\mbox{Proj}(R[\mathcal I]/\sqrt{m_RR[\mathcal I]})$. We give an explicit description of the scheme structure of $\mbox{Proj}(R[\mathcal I])$. As a corollary, we obtain a new proof of a theorem of F. Russo, showing that $\mbox{Proj}(R[\mathcal I])$ is always Noetherian and that $R[\mathcal I]$ is Noetherian if and only if $\mbox{Proj}(R[\mathcal I])$ is a proper $R$-scheme. We give an explicit description of the scheme structure of the reduced exceptional fiber $\mbox{Proj}(R[\mathcal I]/\sqrt{m_RR[\mathcal I]})$ of $\tau$, in terms of the possible values 0, 1 or 2 of the analytic spread $\ell(\mathcal I)=\dim R[\mathcal I]/m_RR[\mathcal I]$. In the case that $\ell(\mathcal I)=0$, $\tau^{-1}(m_R)$ is the emptyset; this case can only occur if $R[\mathcal I]$ is not Noetherian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates under which conditions the symbolic powers of the extension of an ideal is the same as the extension of the symbolic powers. Our result generalizes the known scenarios. As an application, we prove formulas for the resurgence of sum of two homogeneous ideals in finitely generated k-algebra domains, where k is algebraically closed. Initially, these were known for ideals in polynomial rings.</description>

      <title>On lens spaces bounding smooth 4-manifolds with $\boldsymbol{b_2=1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study which lens spaces can bound smooth 4-manifolds with second Betti number one under various topological conditions. Specifically, we show that there are infinite families of lens spaces that bound compact, simply-connected, smooth 4-manifolds with second Betti number one, yet cannot bound a 4-manifold consisting of a single 0-handle and 2-handle. Additionally, we establish the existence of infinite families of lens spaces that bound compact, smooth 4-manifolds with first Betti number zero and second Betti number one, but cannot bound simply-connected 4-manifolds with second Betti number one. The construction of such 4-manifolds with lens space boundaries is motivated by the study of rational homology projective planes with cyclic quotient singularities.</description>

      <title>On the Tambara Affine Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tambara functors are the analogue of commutative rings in equivariant algebra. Nakaoka defined ideals in Tambara functors, leading to the definition of the Nakaoka spectrum of prime ideals in a Tambara functor. In this work, we continue the study of the Nakoaka spectra of Tambara functors. We describe, in terms of the Zariski spectra of ordinary commutative rings, the Nakaoka spectra of many Tambara functors. In particular: we identify the Nakaoka spectrum of the fixed point Tambara functor of any $G$-ring with the GIT quotient of its classical Zariski spectrum; we describe the Nakaoka spectrum of the complex representation ring Tambara functor over a cyclic group of prime order $p$; we describe the affine line (the Nakaoka spectra of free Tambara functors on one generator) over a cyclic group of prime order $p$ in terms of the Zariski spectra of $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, $\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$, and the ring of cyclic polynomials $\mathbb{Z}[x_0,\ldots,x_{p-1}]^{C_p}$. To obtain these results, we introduce a "ghost construction" which produces an integral extension of any $C_p$-Tambara functor, the Nakaoka spectrum of which is describable. To relate the Nakaoka spectrum of a Tambara functor to that of its ghost, we prove several new results in equivariant commutative algebra, including a weak form of the Hilbert basis theorem, going up, lying over, and levelwise radicality of prime ideals in Tambara functors. These results also allow us to compute the Krull dimensions of many Tambara functors.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we'll introduce a $q$-variant of Witt vectors and de Rham-Witt complexes. This variant is closely related to the Habiro ring of a number field constructed by Garoufalidis, Scholze, Wheeler, and Zagier, to $q$-Hodge cohomology, and to $\operatorname{THH}(-/\mathrm{ku})$. While most of these connections will only be explored in forthcoming work, the goal of this article is to provide the necessary technical foundation.</description>

      <title>Real birational implicitization for statistical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an implicit description of the image of a semialgebraic set under a birational map, provided that the denominators of the map are positive on the set. For statistical models which are globally rationally identifiable, this yields model-defining constraints which facilitate model membership testing, representation learning, and model equivalence tests. Many examples illustrate the applicability of our results. The implicit equations recover well-known Markov properties of classical graphical models, as well as other well-studied equations such as the Verma constraint. They also provide Markov properties for generalizations of these frameworks, such as colored or interventional graphical models, staged trees, and the recently introduced Lyapunov models. Under a further mild assumption, we show that our implicit equations generate the vanishing ideal of the model up to a saturation, generalizing previous results of Geiger, Meek and Sturmfels, Duarte and G\"orgen, Sullivant, and others.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a consequence of Efimov's proof of rigidity of the $\infty$-category of localising motives, Scholze and Efimov have constructed refinements of localising invariants such as $\operatorname{TC}^-$. In this article we compute the homotopy groups of the refined invariants $\operatorname{TC}^{-,\mathrm{ref}}(\mathrm{ku}\otimes\mathbb Q/\mathrm{ku})$ and $\operatorname{TC}^{-,\mathrm{ref}}(\mathrm{KU}\otimes\mathbb Q/\mathrm{KU})$. The computation involves a surprising connection to $q$-de Rham cohomology. In particular, it suggests a construction of a $q$-Hodge filtration on $q$-de Rham complexes in certain situations, which can be used to construct a functorial derived $q$-Hodge complex for many rings. This is in contrast to a no-go result by the second author, who showed that such a $q$-Hodge complex (and thus also a $q$-Hodge filtration) cannot exist in full generality.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic resolution via multi-weighted blow-ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.06361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first introduce and study the notion of multi-weighted blow-ups, which is later used to systematically construct an explicit yet efficient algorithm for functorial logarithmic resolution in characteristic zero, in the sense of Hironaka. Specifically, for a singular, reduced closed subscheme $X$ of a smooth scheme $Y$ over a field of characteristic zero, we resolve the singularities of $X$ by taking proper transforms $X_i \subset Y_i$ along a sequence of multi-weighted blow-ups $Y_N \to Y_{N-1} \to \dotsb \to Y_0 = Y$ which satisfies the following properties: (i) the $Y_i$ are smooth Artin stacks with simple normal crossing exceptional loci; (ii) at each step we always blow up the worst singular locus of $X_i$, and witness on $X_{i+1}$ an immediate improvement in singularities; (iii) and finally, the singular locus of $X$ is transformed into a simple normal crossing divisor on $X_N$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much recent literature concerns finiteness properties of infinite-dimensional algebraic varieties equipped with an action of the infinite symmetric group, or of the infinite general linear group. In this paper, we study a common generalisation in which the product of both groups acts on infinite-dimensional spaces, and we show that these spaces are topologically Noetherian with respect to this action.</description>

      <title>Half-spherical twists on derived categories of coherent sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a flat morphism $\pi \colon X \to T$ between smooth quasi-projective varieties and its fiber $X_0$, we prove that spherical objects on $D^b(X)$ pushed-forward from $D^b(X_0)$ induce autoequivalences of $D^b(X_0)$ itself. Our construction provides new derived symmetries for some singular varieties, which include singular fibers of elliptic surfaces (commonly referred to as Kodaira fibers) and type $III$ degenerations of K3 surfaces. In the case of Kodaira fibers of type $I_n$, we also show the induced autoequivalences of $D^b(X_0)$ correspond to the half twists on the $n$-punctured $2$-torus via homological mirror symmetry. As an application, we describe the autoequivalence groups of elliptic surfaces in terms of mapping class groups of punctured tori.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the geometry of smooth hyperelliptic curves that possess additional involutions, especially from the point of view of the Prym theory. Our main result is the injectivity of the Prym map for hyperelliptic $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-coverings over hyperelliptic curves of positive genus.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of non-generic character stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01306v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study (compactly supported) cohomology of character stacks of punctured Riemann surfaces with prescribed semisimple local monodromies at punctures. In the case of generic local monodromies, the cohomology of these character stacks has already been studied by Hausel, Letellier and Rodriguez-Villegas and by Mellit. In this paper, we extend the results of Hausel, Letellier and Rodriguez-Villegas to the non-generic case. In particular, we compute the E-series and we give a conjectural formula for the mixed Poincar\'e series. Moreover, we verify our conjecture in the case of the projective line with 4 punctures and a certain choice of a non-generic quadruple.</description>

      <title>Gotzmann's persistence theorem for smooth projective toric varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gotzmann's persistence theorem enables us to confirm the Hilbert polynomial of a subscheme of projective space by checking the Hilbert function in just two points, regardless of the dimension of the ambient space. We generalise this result to products of projective spaces, and then extend our result to any smooth projective toric variety. The number of points to check depends solely on the Picard rank of the ambient space, with no dependence on the dimension.</description>

      <title>The Bieri-Neumann-Strebel sets of quasi-projective groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth complex quasi-projective variety and $\Gamma=\pi_1(X)$. Let $\chi \colon \Gamma \to \mathbb{R}$ be an additive character. We prove that the ray $[\chi]$ does not belong to the BNS set $\Sigma(\Gamma)$ if and only if it comes as a pullback along an algebraic fibration $f \colon X \to \mathcal{C}$ over a quasi-projective hyperbolic orbicurve $\mathcal{C}$. We also prove that if $\pi_1(X)$ admits a solvable quotient which is not virtually nilpotent, there exists a finite \'etale cover $X_1 \to X$ and a fibration $f \colon X_1 \to \mathcal{C}$ over a quasi-projective hyperbolic orbicurve $\mathcal{C}$. Both of these results were proved by Delzant in the case when $X$ is a compact K\"ahler manifold. We deduce that $\Gamma$ is virtually solvable if and only if it is virtually nilpotent, generalising the theorems of Delzant and Arapura-Nori. As a byproduct, we prove a version of Simpson's Lefschetz Theorem for the integral leaves of logarithmic $1$-forms that do not extend to any partial compactification. We give two applications of our results. First, we strengthen the recent theorem of Cadorel-Deng-Yamanoi on virtual nilpotency of fundamental groups of quasi-projective $h$-special and weakly special manifolds. Second, we prove the sharpness of Suciu's tropical bound for the fundamental groups of smooth quasi-projective varieties and answer a question of Suciu on the topology of hyperplane arrangements.</description>

      <title>A Non-Archimedean Second Main Theorem for Hypersurfaces in Subgeneral Position</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply an idea of Levin to obtain a non-truncated second main theorem for non-Archimedean analytic maps approximating algebraic hypersurfaces in subgeneral position. In some cases, for example when all the hypersurfaces are non-linear and all the intersections are transverse, this improves an inequality of Quang, whose inequality is sharp for the case of hyperplanes in subgeneral position.</description>

      <title>Subspace configurations and low degree points on curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to understanding curves $X$ over a number field $k$ that possess infinitely many solutions in extensions of $k$ of degree at most $d$; such solutions are the titular low degree points. For $d=2,3$ it is known (by the work of Harris-Silverman and Abramovich-Harris) that such curves, after a base change to $\overline{k},$ admit a map of degree at most $d$ onto $\mathbb{P}^1$ or an elliptic curve. For $d \geqslant 4$ the analogous statement was shown to be false by Debarre and Fahlaoui. We prove that once the genus of $X$ is high enough, the low degree points still have geometric origin: they can be obtained as pullbacks of low degree points from a lower genus curve. We introduce a discrete-geometric invariant attached to such curves: a family of subspace configurations, with many interesting properties. This structure gives a natural alternative construction of curves with many low degree points, that were first discovered by Debarre and Fahlaoui. As an application of our methods, we obtain a classification of such curves over $k$ for $d=2,3$, and a classification over $\overline{k}$ for $d=4,5$.</description>

      <title>K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on families of Fano varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a one-parameter family of $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano varieties such that the central fibre admits a unique K\"ahler-Einstein metric, we provide an analytic method to show that the neighboring fibre admits a unique K\"ahler-Einstein metric. Our results go beyond by establishing uniform a priori estimates on the K\"ahler-Einstein potentials along fully degenerate families of $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano varieties. In addition, we show the continuous variation of these K\"ahler-Einstein currents, and establish uniform Moser-Trudinger inequalities and uniform coercivity of the Ding functionals. Central to our article is introducing and studying a notion of convergence for quasi-plurisubharmonic functions within families of normal K\"ahler varieties. We show that the Monge-Amp\`ere energy is upper semi-continuous with respect to this topology, and we establish a Demailly-Koll\'ar result for functions with full Monge-Amp\`ere mass.</description>

Abstract: For a non-archimedean local field $F$ and a connected reductive group $G$ over $F$ equipped with a parabolic subgroup $P$, we show that the dualizing complex on $\mathrm{Bun}_P$, the moduli stack of $P$-bundles on the Fargues--Fontaine curve, can be described explicitly in terms of the modulus character of $P$. As applications, we identify various characters appearing in the theory of local and global Shimura varieties, show the Harris--Viehmann conjecture in the Hodge--Newton reducible case, and carry out some computations of the geometric Eisenstein functors for general parabolics.</description>
