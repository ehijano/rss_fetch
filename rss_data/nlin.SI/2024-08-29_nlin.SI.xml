      <title>Asymptotic integrability and Hamilton theory of soliton's motion along large-scale background waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of soliton-mean field interaction for the class of asymptotically integrable equations, where the notion of the complete integrability means that the Hamilton equations for the high-frequency wave packet propagation along a large-scale background wave have an integral of motion. Using the Stokes remark, we transform this integral to the integral for the soliton's equations of motion and then derive the Hamilton equations for the soliton's dynamics in a universal form expressed in terms of the Riemann invariants for the hydrodynamic background wave. The physical properties are specified by the concrete expressions for the Riemann invariants. The theory is illustrated by its application to the soliton's dynamics which is described by the Kaup-Boussinesq system.</description>

      <title>Volume Changing Symmetries by Matrix Product Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider spin chain models with exotic symmetries that change the length of the spin chain. It is known that the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain at the supersymmetric point $\Delta=-1/2$ possesses such a symmetry: it is given by the supersymmetry generators, which change the length of the chain by one unit. We show that volume changing symmetries exist also in other spin chain models, and that they can be constructed using a special tensor network, which is a simple generalization of a Matrix Product Operator. As examples we consider the folded XXZ model and its perturbations, and also a new hopping model that is defined on constrained Hilbert spaces. We show that the volume changing symmetries are not related to integrability: the symmetries can survive even non-integrable perturbations. We also show that the known supersymmetry generator of the XXZ chain with $\Delta=-1/2$ can also be expressed as a generalized Matrix Product Operator.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry Amplification by a Nonadiabatic Passage through a Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and solve a minimal model of dynamic passage through a quantum second order phase transition in the presence of weak symmetry breaking interactions and no dissipation. The evolution eventually leads to a highly asymmetric state, no matter how weak the symmetry breaking term is. This suggests a potential mechanism for strong asymmetry in the production of particles with almost identical characteristics. The model's integrability also allows us to obtain exact Kibble-Zurek exponents for the scaling of the number of nonadiabatic excitations.</description>

      <title>Weyl group symmetry of q-characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an action of the Weyl group W of a simple Lie algebra g on a completion of the ring Y, which is the codomain of the q-character homomorphism of the corresponding quantum affine algebra U_q(g^). We prove that the subring of W-invariants of Y is precisely the ring of q-characters, which is isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring of the category of finite-dimensional representations of U_q(g^). This resolves an old puzzle in the theory of q-characters. We also identify the screening operators, which were previously used to describe the ring of q-characters, as the subleading terms of simple reflections from W in a certain limit. Our results have already found applications to the study of the category O of representations of the Borel subalgebra of U_q(g^) in arXiv:2312.13256 and to the categorification of cluster algebras in arXiv:2401.04616.</description>
