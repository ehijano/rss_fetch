      <title>The existence of stealth corrections in scientific literature -- a threat to scientific integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Thorough maintenance of the scientific record is needed to ensure the trustworthiness of its content. This can be undermined by a stealth correction, which is at least one post-publication change made to a scientific article, without providing a correction note or any other indicator that the publication was temporarily or permanently altered. In this paper we provide several examples of stealth corrections in order to demonstrate that these exist within the scientific literature. As far as we are aware, no documentation of such stealth corrections was previously reported in the scientific literature.
  Methods: We identified stealth corrections ourselves, or found already reported ones on the public database pubpeer.com or through social media accounts of known science sleuths.
  Results: In total we report 131 articles that were affected by stealth corrections and were published between 2005 and 2024. These stealth corrections were found among multiple publishers and scientific fields.
  Conclusion: and recommendations Stealth corrections exist in the scientific literature. This needs to end immediately as it threatens scientific integrity. We recommend the following: 1) Tracking all changes to the published record by all publishers in an open, uniform and transparent manner, preferably by online submission systems that log every change publicly, making stealth corrections impossible; 2) Clear definitions and guidelines on all types of corrections; 3) Support sustained vigilance of the scientific community to publicly register stealth corrections.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Innovation Dataset on Scientific Research Outcomes and Patents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various stakeholders, such as researchers, government agencies, businesses, and laboratories require reliable scientific research outcomes and patent data to support their work. These data are crucial for advancing scientific research, conducting business evaluations, and policy analysis. However, collecting such data is often a time-consuming and laborious task. Consequently, many users turn to using openly accessible data for their research. However, these open data releases may suffer from lack of relationship between different data sources or limited temporal coverage. In this context, we present a new Intelligent Innovation Dataset (IIDS dataset), which comprises six inter-related datasets spanning nearly 120 years, encompassing paper information, paper citation relationships, patent details, patent legal statuses, funding information and funding relationship. The extensive contextual and extensive temporal coverage of the IIDS dataset will provide researchers with comprehensive data support, enabling them to delve into in-depth scientific research and conduct thorough data analysis.</description>

      <title>[Citation needed] Data usage and citation practices in medical imaging conferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical imaging papers often focus on methodology, but the quality of the algorithms and the validity of the conclusions are highly dependent on the datasets used. As creating datasets requires a lot of effort, researchers often use publicly available datasets, there is however no adopted standard for citing the datasets used in scientific papers, leading to difficulty in tracking dataset usage. In this work, we present two open-source tools we created that could help with the detection of dataset usage, a pipeline \url{https://github.com/TheoSourget/Public_Medical_Datasets_References} using OpenAlex and full-text analysis, and a PDF annotation software \url{https://github.com/TheoSourget/pdf_annotator} used in our study to manually label the presence of datasets. We applied both tools on a study of the usage of 20 publicly available medical datasets in papers from MICCAI and MIDL. We compute the proportion and the evolution between 2013 and 2023 of 3 types of presence in a paper: cited, mentioned in the full text, cited and mentioned. Our findings demonstrate the concentration of the usage of a limited set of datasets. We also highlight different citing practices, making the automation of tracking difficult.</description>
