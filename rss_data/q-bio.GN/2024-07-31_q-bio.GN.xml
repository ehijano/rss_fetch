      <title>Are gene-by-environment interactions leveraged in multi-modality neural networks for breast cancer prediction?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) can significantly enhance breast cancer risk prediction when combined with clinical risk factor data. While many studies have explored the value-add of PRSs, little is known about the potential impact of gene-by-gene or gene-by-environment interactions towards enhancing the risk discrimination capabilities of multi-modal models combining PRSs with clinical data. In this study, we integrated data on 318 individual genotype variants along with clinical data in a neural network to explore whether gene-by-gene (i.e., between individual variants) and/or gene-by-environment (between clinical risk factors and variants) interactions could be leveraged jointly during training to improve breast cancer risk prediction performance. We benchmarked our approach against a baseline model combining traditional univariate PRSs with clinical data in a logistic regression model and ran an interpretability analysis to identify feature interactions.
  While our model did not demonstrate improved performance over the baseline, we discovered 248 (&lt;1%) statistically significant gene-by-gene and gene-by-environment interactions out of the ~53.6k possible feature pairs, the most contributory of which included rs6001930 (MKL1) and rs889312 (MAP3K1), with age and menopause being the most heavily interacting non-genetic risk factors. We also modeled the significant interactions as a network of highly connected features, suggesting that potential higher-order interactions are captured by the model. Although gene-by-environment (or gene-by-gene) interactions did not enhance breast cancer risk prediction performance in neural networks, our study provides evidence that these interactions can be leveraged by these models to inform their predictions. This study represents the first application of neural networks to screen for interactions impacting breast cancer risk using real-world data.</description>

      <title>A survey of machine learning techniques in medical applications</title>

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving a wide range of problems, including medical decision-making. The exponential growth of medical data over the past two decades has surpassed the capacity for manual analysis, prompting increased interest in automated data analysis and processing. ML algorithms, capable of learning from data with minimal human intervention, are particularly well-suited for medical data analysis and interpretation. One significant advantage of ML is the reduced cost of collecting labeled training data necessary for supervised learning. While numerous studies have explored the applications of ML in medicine, this survey specifically focuses on the use of ML across various medical research fields. We provide a comprehensive technical overview of existing studies on ML applications in medicine, highlighting the strengths and limitations of these approaches. Additionally, we discuss potential research directions for future exploration. These include the development of more sophisticated reward functions, as the accuracy of the reward function is crucial for ML performance, the integration of ML with other techniques, and the application of ML to new and emerging areas in genomics research. Finally, we summarize our findings and present the current state of the field and the future outlook for ML in medical application.</description>
