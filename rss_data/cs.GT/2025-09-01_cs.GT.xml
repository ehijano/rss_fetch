      <title>Auctions Meet Bandits: An Empirical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sponsored search positions are typically allocated through real-time auctions, where the outcomes depend on advertisers' quality-adjusted bids - the product of their bids and quality scores. Although quality scoring helps promote ads with higher conversion outcomes, setting these scores for new advertisers in any given market is challenging, leading to the cold-start problem. To address this, platforms incorporate multi-armed bandit algorithms in auctions to balance exploration and exploitation. However, little is known about the optimal exploration strategies in such auction environments. We utilize data from a leading Asian mobile app store that places sponsored ads for keywords. The platform employs a Thompson Sampling algorithm within a second-price auction to learn quality scores and allocate a single sponsored position for each keyword. We empirically quantify the gains from optimizing exploration under this combined auction-bandit model and show that this problem differs substantially from the canonical bandit problem. Drawing on these empirical insights, we propose a customized exploration strategy in which the platform adjusts the exploration levels for each keyword according to its characteristics. We derive the Pareto frontier for revenue and efficiency and provide actionable policies, demonstrating substantial gains for the platform on both metrics when using a tailored exploration approach.</description>

      <title>A Soft Inducement Framework for Incentive-Aided Steering of No-Regret Players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a steering problem in a mediator-augmented two-player normal-form game, where the mediator aims to guide players toward a specific action profile through information and incentive design. We first characterize the games for which successful steering is possible. Moreover, we establish that steering players to any desired action profile is not always achievable with information design alone, nor when accompanied with sublinear payment schemes. Consequently, we derive a lower bound on the constant payments required per round to achieve this goal. To address these limitations incurred with information design, we introduce an augmented approach that involves a one-shot information design phase before the start of the repeated game, transforming the prior interaction into a Stackelberg game. Finally, we theoretically demonstrate that this approach improves the convergence rate of players' action profiles to the target point by a constant factor with high probability, and support it with empirical results.</description>

      <title>Sequential Fair Allocation With Replenishments: A Little Envy Goes An Exponentially Long Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the trade-off between envy and inefficiency in repeated resource allocation settings with stochastic replenishments, motivated by real-world systems such as food banks and medical supply chains. Specifically, we consider a model in which a decision-maker faced with stochastic demand and resource donations must trade off between an equitable and efficient allocation of resources over an infinite horizon. The decision-maker has access to storage with fixed capacity $M$, and incurs efficiency losses when storage is empty (stockouts) or full (overflows). We provide a nearly tight (up to constant factors) characterization of achievable envy-inefficiency pairs. Namely, we introduce a class of Bang-Bang control policies whose inefficiency exhibits a sharp phase transition, dropping from $\Theta(1/M)$ when $\Delta = 0$ to $e^{-\Omega(\Delta M)}$ when $\Delta &gt; 0$, where $\Delta$ is used to denote the target envy of the policy. We complement this with matching lower bounds, demonstrating that the trade-off is driven by supply, as opposed to demand uncertainty. Our results demonstrate that envy-inefficiency trade-offs not only persist in settings with dynamic replenishment, but are shaped by the decision-maker's available capacity, and are therefore qualitatively different compared to previously studied settings with fixed supply.</description>

      <title>Envy-Free Cake-Cutting for Four Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the envy-free cake-cutting problem we are given a resource, usually called a cake and represented as the $[0,1]$ interval, and a set of $n$ agents with heterogeneous preferences over pieces of the cake. The goal is to divide the cake among the $n$ agents such that no agent is envious of any other agent. Even under a very general preferences model, this fundamental fair division problem is known to always admit an exact solution where each agent obtains a connected piece of the cake; we study the complexity of finding an approximate solution, i.e., a connected $\varepsilon$-envy-free allocation.
  For monotone valuations of cake pieces, Deng, Qi, and Saberi (2012) gave an efficient ($\textsf{poly}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ queries) algorithm for three agents and posed the open problem of four (or more) monotone agents. Even for the special case of additive valuations, Br\^anzei and Nisan (2022) conjectured an $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$ lower bound on the number of queries for four agents. We provide the first efficient algorithm for finding a connected $\varepsilon$-envy-free allocation with four monotone agents.
  We also prove that as soon as valuations are allowed to be non-monotone, the problem becomes hard: it becomes PPAD-hard, requires $\textsf{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ queries in the black-box model, and even $\textsf{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ communication complexity. This constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the first intractability result for any version of the cake-cutting problem in the communication complexity model.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Optimisation of Ride-Pooling Personalised Fares in a Stochastic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ride-pooling systems, to succeed, must provide an attractive service, namely compensate perceived costs with an appealing price. However, because of a strong heterogeneity in a value-of-time, each traveller has his own acceptable price, unknown to the operator. Here, we show that individual acceptance levels can be learned by the operator (over $90\%$ accuracy for pooled travellers in $10$ days) to optimise personalised fares. We propose an adaptive pricing policy, where every day the operator constructs an offer that progressively meets travellers' expectations and attracts a growing demand. Our results suggest that operators, by learning behavioural traits of individual travellers, may improve performance not only for travellers (increased utility) but also for themselves (increased profit). Moreover, such knowledge allows the operator to remove inefficient pooled rides and focus on attractive and profitable combinations.</description>
