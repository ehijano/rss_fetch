      <title>A Virgo Environmental Survey Tracing Ionised Gas Emission (VESTIGE) XVIII. Reconstructing the star formation history of early-type galaxies through the combination of their UV and H$\alpha$ emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconstruct the SFHs of 7 massive ($M_{\star}\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$) early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the Virgo cluster by analysing their spatially resolved stellar population (SP), including their UV and H$\alpha$ emission. As part of the VESTIGE survey, we used H$\alpha$ images to select ETGs that show no signs of ongoing star formation. We combined VESTIGE with images from Astrosat/UVIT, GALEX and CFHT from the NGVS to analyse radial spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the FUV to the NIR. The UV emission in these galaxies is likely due to old, low mass stars in post main sequence (PMS) phases, the UV upturn. We fit the radial SEDs with novel SP models that include an old, hot stellar component of PMS stars with various temperatures and energetics. This way, we explore the main stellar parameters responsible for UV upturn stars irregardless of their evolutionary path. Standard models are not able to reproduce the galaxies' central FUV emission (SMA/$R_{eff}\lesssim1$), while the new models well characterise it through PMS stars with temperatures T$\gtrsim$25000 K. All galaxies are old (mass-weighted ages $\gtrsim10$ Gyr) and the most massive M49 and M87 are supersolar within SMA/$R_{\rm eff}\lesssim0.2$. Overall, we found flat age gradients ($\nabla$Log(Age)$\sim -0.04 - 0$ dex) and shallow metallicity gradients ($\nabla$Log(Z)$&lt;-0.2$ dex), except for M87 ($\nabla$Log($Z_{\rm M87}$)$\simeq-0.45$ dex). Our results show that these ETGs formed with timescales $\tau\lesssim1500$ Myr, having assembled between $\sim40-90\%$ of their stellar mass at $z\sim5$. This is consistent with recent JWST observations of quiescent massive galaxies at high$-z$, which are likely the ancestors of the largest ETGs in the nearby Universe. The derived flat/shallow gradients indicate that major mergers might have contributed to the formation and evolution of these galaxies.</description>

      <title>SOFIA/HAWC+ Far-Infrared Polarimetric Large Area CMZ Exploration Survey. V. The Magnetic Field Strength and Morphology in the Sagittarius C Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the magnetic field strength and morphology in the Sagittarius C complex (Sgr C; G359.43-0.09) in the Milky Way Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) using the 214 $\mu$m polarimetry data acquired with the High-Angular-Resolution Wideband Camera+ (HAWC+) instrument aboard the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). We use several hundred magnetic field pseudovectors in the Sgr C region to trace the projected magnetic field orientation within cold molecular gas clouds, and as is the trend throughout the CMZ, they show a higher polarization fraction toward the periphery of the clouds. We conduct a modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) analysis of individual clouds and find that the sky-plane magnetic field strength varies from highly turbulent regions having inferred strengths of $\sim30~\mu{\rm G}$ to regions of relatively uniform field orientation having strengths of $\sim 1~{\rm mG}$. The magnetic field orientations suggest that outflows from active star-forming regions, such as the extended green object (EGO) G359.43-0.10 and the protostellar source FIR-4 (G359.43+0.02), cause high turbulence in their vicinity. The magnetic field direction is found to be tangential to the surface of the Sgr C HII region, as well as two [CII] emission cavities around this region. Several other features in the vicinity of Sgr C, especially numerous non-thermal filaments (NTFs) and a diffuse source of X-ray emission towards the southwest of the \hii{} region, are discussed with regard to the observed magnetic field pseudovectors.</description>

      <title>Are Gas-rich Ultra-diffuse Galaxies and Field Dwarfs Distinct?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the differences in gas-rich field Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs) and classical dwarf galaxies using an extensive atomic gas (HI) follow-up survey of optically-selected UDG candidates from the Systematically Measuring Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (SMUDGes) catalogue. We also compare the SMUDGes-HI observations with two state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astrophysical Objects (NIHAO), where UDGs form through a series of bursty star formation episodes and Romulus25, in which UDGs occupy dark matter halos with high spins as a result of major mergers. Although the suggested formation scenarios for UDGs within these simulations are different, the present-day HI masses $M_{HI}$, stellar masses $M_*$, and star formation rates $SFR$ of simulated galaxies are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with each other and with the observed SMUDGes-HI sample. We find that when controlling for $M_*$, there is a positive correlation between the gas richness $M_{HI}$/$M_*$ and the effective optical radius $R_{eff}$ , and that this trend is not different between the UDG and dwarf populations, within the measured scatter. Taken together, our results suggest that gas-rich, star-forming UDGs and dwarfs are not distinct galaxy populations, either observationally or in simulations.</description>

      <title>GalactiKit: reconstructing mergers from $z=0$ debris using simulation-based inference in Auriga</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GalactiKit, a data-driven methodology for estimating the lookback infall time, stellar mass, halo mass and mass ratio of the disrupted progenitors of Milky Way-like galaxies at the time of infall. GalactiKit uses simulation-based inference to extract the information on galaxy formation processes encoded in the Auriga cosmological MHD simulations of Milky Way-mass halos to create a model that relates the properties of mergers to those of the corresponding merger debris at $z=0$. We investigate how well GalactiKit can reconstruct the merger properties given the dynamical, chemical, and the combined chemo-dynamical information of debris. For this purpose, three models were implemented considering the following properties of merger debris: (a) total energy and angular momentum, (b) iron-to-hydrogen and alpha-to-iron abundance ratios, and (c) a combination of all of these. We find that the kinematics of the debris can be used to trace the lookback time at which the progenitor was first accreted into the main halo. However, chemical information is necessary for inferring the stellar and halo masses of the progenitors. In both models (b) and (c), the stellar masses are predicted more accurately than the halo masses, which could be related to the scatter in the stellar mass-halo mass relation. Model (c) provides the most accurate predictions for the merger parameters, which suggests that combining chemical and dynamical data of debris can significantly improve the reconstruction of the Milky Way's assembly history.</description>

      <title>Morphology and kinematics of the gas in M51: How interaction with NGC5195 has moulded the structure of its arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Whirlpool Galaxy is a well studied grand design galaxy with two major spiral arms, and a large satellite NGC 5195. The arms both show long uniform sections with perturbations ('kinks' or sharp turns) in specific regions. Comparing the two arms shows a small radial offset between the main kinked regions. We analysed the morphology and also the velocity field in the disk of M51 using kinematic maps based on H$\alpha$ and CO line emission. These sample complementary radial ranges, with the CO map covering the central zone and the H$\alpha$ map extending to cover the outer zone. We looked for indicators of density wave resonance, zones where radial flows of gas in the disk plane reverse their sign. These were present in both velocity maps; their two-dimensional localization placed them along or closely parallel to the spiral arms, at a set of well defined galactocentric radii, and notably more concentrated along the southern, stronger arm. The results can be well interpreted quantitatively, using a numerical model of the interaction of M51 and NGC5195 in which the satellite has made two relatively recent passes through the disk plane of M51. During the first pass the pair of dominant spiral arms was stimulated, and during the second pass the strong kinks in both arms were formed at about the same time. The second interaction is particularly well characterised, because the timescale corresponding to the production of the kinks and the recovery of the original pitch angle is identical for the two arms.</description>

      <title>An Increase in the Prevalence of Ionized Outflows in Galaxies with Coronal Line Emission: Feedback in Action?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal lines (CLs), which arise from collisionally excited forbidden transitions from highly ionized species, are a powerful diagnostic tool in uncovering active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and constraining their properties. However, recent optical surveys are finding that coronal lines are rarely detected in the majority of local AGNs, possibly as a result of the depletion of elements from the interstellar gas onto dust grains. Prominent CL emission may therefore only arise when dust is being destroyed in the highly ionized gas in AGNs. To explore the possibility that dust destruction may be caused by ionized gas outflows in galaxies with prominent CLs, we present the first large-scale systematic study of ionized outflows, as traced by the [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission, in galaxies displaying CL emission relative to a robust control sample of non-CL-emitting galaxies. We find: 1) galaxies that display CL emission have a significantly elevated outflow incidence rate compared to their matched controls, 2) the outflow luminosity is significantly higher in the CL-emitters, 3) the CL-emitters have systematically lower intrinsic extinction toward the ionized gas compared with the controls, 4) there are significant correlations between the CL luminosity and outflow velocity for the iron CLs, with similar relationships found between the CL FWHM and outflow luminosity. These observations are consistent with dust destruction in an outflowing wind from a dusty torus causing efficient CL emission.</description>

      <title>The Life and Times of Star-Forming Cores: an Analysis of Dense Gas in the STARFORGE Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense gas in molecular clouds is an important signature of ongoing and future star formation. We identify and track dense cores in the STARFORGE simulations, following the core evolution from birth through dispersal by stellar feedback for typical Milky Way cloud conditions. Only $\sim$8% of cores host protostars, and most disperse before forming stars. The median starless and protostellar core lifetimes are $\sim 0.5-0.6$ Myr and $\sim0.8-1.1$ Myr, respectively, where the protostellar phase lasts $\sim 0.1^{+0.1}_{-0.05}$ Myr. While core evolution is stochastic, we find that virial ratios and linewidths decline in prestellar cores, coincident with turbulent decay. Collapse occurs over $\sim 0.1$ Myr, once the central density exceeds $\gtrsim 10^6$cm$^{-3}$. Starless cores, only, follow linewidth-size and mass-size relations, $\sigma \propto R^{0.3}$ and $M \propto R^1$. The core median mass, radius, and velocity dispersion scale weakly with the cloud magnetic field strength. We cluster the core properties and find that protostellar cores have $&gt;80$% likelihood of belonging to three particular groups that are characterized by high central densities, compact radii, and lower virial parameters. Overall, core evolution appears to be universally set by the interplay of gravity and magnetized turbulence, while stellar feedback dictates protostellar core properties and sets the protostellar phase lifetime.</description>

      <title>Multi-Wavelength characterization of VVVX open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Large-scale surveys across wavelengths, aided by machine learning, have improved the detection of old open clusters in high-extinction Milky Way regions. Aims. We aim to confirm or reject automatically detected open clusters in poorly studied, contaminated regions, refining samples for Galactic disk formation studies. Methods. Using VVVX, 2MASS, and Gaia DR3, we analyzed nine cluster candidates: BH118, BH144, Schuster-MWSC 1756, Saurer 3, FSR 1521, Saurer 2, Haffner 10-FSR 1231, Juchert 12, and Pismis 3. We examined density maps, proper motion diagrams, and photometry to derive physical parameters. Results. We identified star clusters via overdensities in 2MASS, WISE, and DECaPS, confirmed with VVVX and Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation. Using Gaia proper motions, we refined memberships, building a high-likelihood cluster catalog. We derived extinction ($A_{Ks} = 0.07$-$0.50$), color excess ($E(J-Ks) = 0.16$-$0.60$), distances ($D = 2.06$-$8.64$ kpc), and Galactocentric distances ($R_G = 7.69$-$14.81$ kpc). Ages range from 20 Myr to 5 Gyr, metallicity from [Fe/H] = -0.5 to 0.5. Structural parameters include core radii ($r_c = 0.71'$-$5.21'$) and tidal radii ($r_t = 3.4'$-$12.0'$). Conclusions. We confirm the open cluster nature of nine targets, updating their physical parameters.</description>

      <title>On type 1 active galactic nuclei with double-peaked [O~{\sc iii}]. I. data sample and basic results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double-peaked narrow emission lines (DPNELs) might be evidence for the existence of kpc-scale dual AGNs. There are so far large samples of objects with DPNELs in narrow emission line galaxies. Here, a systematic search is made to build a sample of type 1 AGNs with double-peaked [O~{\sc~iii}] from Data Release 16 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Through visually inspecting and fitting [O~{\sc~iii}], fitting broad H$\alpha$ emission lines, performing F-test for [O~{\sc~iii}] profiles, and checking broad H$\beta$ and [O~{\sc~iii}] emission lines, we select 62 type 1 AGNs with reliable double-peaked [O~{\sc~iii}] from 11557 QSOs with z &lt; 0.3. After visually checking the 62 SDSS multi-color images, we find only seven objects with signs of merging. Four possible models for the double-peaked [O~{\sc~iii}] observed in our sample are discussed: the superposition model, AGN outflow model, dual AGN model, and rotating disk model. However, the current results can not provide any one explanation conclusively, and additional observational data are needed to provide the details of narrow line regions. But at least 22 objects with different velocity offsets between double-peaked [O~{\sc~iii}] and narrow H$\alpha$ emission lines could be excluded as dual AGN candidates. The relative velocity offsets of the [O~{\sc~iii}] blue-shifted/red-shifted components are negative to their line flux ratios, which is consistent with dual AGN model. This work provides a new sample of 62 type 1 AGNs with double-peaked [O~{\sc~iii}] for further study.</description>

      <title>Clump formation in ram-pressure stripped galaxies: evidence from mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass function (MF) of young ($\mathrm{age\lesssim 200}$ Myr) stellar clumps is an indicator of the mechanism driving the collapse of the interstellar medium (ISM) into giant molecular clouds. Typically, the clump MF in main-sequence galaxies is described by a power law ($dN/dM_*\propto M_*^{-\alpha}$) with slope $\alpha=2$, hinting a turbulence-driven collapse. To understand whether the local environment affects star formation, we have modelled the clump MF of six cluster galaxies from the GASP survey, undergoing strong ram-pressure stripping. This process, exerted by the hot and high-pressure intra-cluster medium (ICM), has produced long tails of stripped ISM where clumps form far away from the galactic disk and surrounded by the ICM itself. Clumps were selected from HST-UVIS/WFC3 images, covering from near-UV to red-optical bands and including H$\alpha$-line maps. The catalogue comprises 398 H$\alpha$ (188 in tails, 210 in disk outskirts, the so-called extraplanar region) and 1270 UV clumps (593 tail, 677 extraplanar). Using mock images, we quantified the mass completeness and bias of our sample. Accounting for these two effects, we adopted a Bayesian approach to fit the clump mass catalogue to a chosen function. The resulting MFs are steeper than expected. In the tails, the H$\alpha$ clumps have slope $\alpha=2.31\pm0.12$, while the UV slope is larger ($2.60\pm0.09$), in agreement with ageing effects. Similar results are found in the extraplanar region, with H$\alpha$ slope $\alpha=2.45^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$ and UV slope $\alpha=2.63^{+0.20}_{-0.18}$, even if they are consistent within uncertainties. We suggest that the steepening results from the higher-than-usual turbulent environment, arising from the interaction between ISM and ICM. As shown by recent works, this process can favour the fragmentation of the largest ISM clouds, inhibiting the formation of very massive clumps.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Size and Merger Fraction of Submillimeter Galaxies across $1 &lt; z \lesssim 6$ as Observed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise tracking of the growth in galaxy size and the evolution of merger fractions with redshift is vital for understanding the formation history of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs). This study investigates these evolutions over a broad redshift range ($1 &lt; z \lesssim 6$), using a sample of 222 SMGs with a median redshift of $z = 2.61^{+0.89}_{-0.82}$ identified by ALMA and JCMT, enhanced by the advanced imaging capabilities of the JWST/NIRCam and MIRI. We find significant evolution in effective radii ($R_e$) in rest-frame V-band ($R_e \propto (1 + z)^{-0.87 \pm 0.08}$) and near-infrared (NIR) band ($R_e \propto (1 + z)^{-0.88 \pm 0.11}$), with the NIR size evolution resembling that of massive star-forming galaxies at lower redshift. Visual inspections reveal a major merger fraction of $24.3 \pm 3.7\%$ and an interaction fraction of up to $48.4 \pm 11.1\%$. The major merger fraction exhibits an increase from 14.7$\pm9.1$\% at $z = 1$ to 26.6$\pm 8.4$\% at $z = 3$, after which it remains approximately constant across the redshift range $3 &lt; z &lt; 6$. In contrast, the interaction fraction remains relatively stable across the range $2 &lt; z &lt; 5$. Our results indicate that late-stage major mergers are not the primary formation mechanism for SMGs at $z&lt;3$, while interactions appear to play a significant role across the broader redshift range of $1&lt;z&lt;6$. Additionally, HST-based major merger identifications may overestimate the true fraction by a factor of 1.7 at $z \sim 2$. These findings highlight the varying roles of mergers and interactions in driving the formation of massive, dusty star-forming galaxies across different redshifts.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Galaxy morphology and photometry from bulge-disc decomposition of Early Release Observations</title>

Abstract: The background galaxies in Euclid Early Release Observations images of the Perseus cluster make up a remarkable sample in its combination of 0.57 deg$^2$ area, 25.3 and 23.2 AB mag depth, as well as 0.1" and 0.3" angular resolutions, in optical and near-IR bands, respectively. Towards characterising the history of the Hubble sequence, we perform a preliminary morphological analysis of 2445 and 12,786 galaxies with $I_E &lt; 21$ and $I_E &lt; 23$, respectively. We use single-S\'ersic profiles and the sums of a S\'ersic bulge and an exponential disc to model these galaxies with SourceXtractor++ and analyse their parameters in order to assess their consistencies and biases. The fitted galaxies to $I_E &lt; 21$ span the various Hubble types with ubiquitous bulge and disc components, and a bulge-to-total light ratio B/T taking all values from 0 to 1. The median effective radius of the single-S\'ersic profile is a biased estimate of galaxy size, intermediate between the bulge and disc effective radii, depending on B/T. The axis ratio of the single-S\'ersic profile overestimates that of the disc, increasingly so with B/T. The model impacts the photometry with -0.08 to 0.01 mag median systematic $I_E$ offsets between single-S\'ersic and bulge+disc total magnitudes, and a 0.05 to 0.15 mag dispersion, from low to high B/T. We measure a median 0.4 mag bulge-disc colour difference in $I_E - J_E$ that originates from the disc-dominated galaxies, whereas bulge-dominated galaxies have similar median colours of their components. Remarkably, we also measure redder-inside disc colour gradients, based on 5 to 10% systematic variations of disc effective radii between the optical and near-IR bands. This analysis demonstrates the usefulness and limits of single-S\'ersic profile modelling, and the power of bulge-disc decomposition for reliably characterising the morphology of lenticulars and spirals in Euclid images.</description>

      <title>Fundamental relation in isolated galaxies, pairs, and triplets in the local universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish fundamental relations, for the first time, in isolated systems in the local universe (with 0.005$\leq$z$\leq$0.080), which can give insight into the underlying physics of star-formation. We use a sample of isolated galaxies to explore whether star formation is regulated by smooth secular processes. In addition, galaxies in physically bound isolated pairs and isolated triplets may also interact with each other, where interaction itself may enhance/regulate star-formation and the distribution of gas and metals within galaxies. We made use of published emission line fluxes information from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to identify SF galaxies in the SDSS-based catalogue of isolated galaxies (SIG), isolated pairs (SIP), and isolated triplets (SIT). We also use this data to derive their aperture-corrected SFR (considering two different methods) and oxygen abundance, 12 + log(O/H), using bright lines calibrations. Stellar masses for SIG, SIP, and SIT galaxies were estimated by fitting their spectral energy distribution on the five SDSS bands. We compared our results with a sample of SF galaxies in the SDSS. We found that, on average, at a fixed stellar mass, the SIG SF galaxies have lower SFR values than Main Sequence (MS) SF galaxies in the SDSS and central galaxies in the SIP and SIT. On average, SIG galaxies have higher 12 + log(O/H) values than galaxies in the SIP, SIT, and comparison sample. When distinguishing between central and satellite galaxies in the SIP and SIT, centrals and SIG galaxies present similar values ($\sim$8.55) while satellites have values close to M33 ($\sim$8.4). Based on our results, we propose a ground level `nurture' free SFR-M$_\star$ and gas metallicity-SFR-M$_\star$ relations for SF galaxies in the local universe.</description>

      <title>The SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey extended source catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalogue of extended radio sources from the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS). Compiled from 56 survey tiles and covering approximately 500 deg$^2$ across the first, third, and fourth Galactic quadrants, the catalogue includes 16534 extended and diffuse sources with areas larger than 5 synthesised beams. Of them, 3891 (24\% of the total) are confidently associated with known Galactic radio-emitting objects in the literature, such as HII regions, supernova remnants, planetary nebulae, luminous blue variables, and Wolf-Rayet stars. A significant fraction of the remaining sources, 5462 (33\%), are candidate extragalactic sources, while 7181 (43\%) remain unclassified. Isolated radio filaments are excluded from the catalogue. The diversity of extended sources underscores MeerKAT's contribution to the completeness of censuses of Galactic radio emitters, and its potential for new scientific discoveries. For the catalogued sources, we derived basic positional and morphological parameters, as well as flux density estimates, using standard aperture photometry. This paper describes the methods followed to generate the catalogue from the original SMGPS tiles, detailing the source extraction, characterisation, and crossmatching procedures. Additionally, we analyse the statistical properties of the catalogued populations</description>

      <title>Reducing false positives in strong lens detection through effective augmentation and ensemble learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research studies the impact of high-quality training datasets on the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in detecting strong gravitational lenses. We stress the importance of data diversity and representativeness, demonstrating how variations in sample populations influence CNN performance. In addition to the quality of training data, our results highlight the effectiveness of various techniques, such as data augmentation and ensemble learning, in reducing false positives while maintaining model completeness at an acceptable level. This enhances the robustness of gravitational lens detection models and advancing capabilities in this field. Our experiments, employing variations of DenseNet and EfficientNet, achieved a best false positive rate (FP rate) of $10^{-4}$, while successfully identifying over 88 per cent of genuine gravitational lenses in the test dataset. This represents an 11-fold reduction in the FP rate compared to the original training dataset. Notably, this substantial enhancement in the FP rate is accompanied by only a 2.3 per cent decrease in the number of true positive samples. Validated on the KiDS dataset, our findings offer insights applicable to ongoing missions, like Euclid.</description>

      <title>A new mass estimate method with hydrodynamical atmospheres for very massive WNh stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very massive stars with masses over 100 Msun are key objects in the Universe for our understanding of chemical and energetic feedback in the Universe, but their evolution and fate are almost entirely determined by their wind mass loss. We aim to determine the mass of the most massive star known in the Local Group R136a1. For this we compute the first hydrodynamically consistent non-local thermodynamical equilibrium atmosphere models for both R136a1 (WN5h) as well as the binary system R144 (WN5/6h+WN6/7h) in the Tarantula nebula. Using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet code, we simultaneously empirically derive and theoretically predict mass-loss rates and wind velocities. By fitting synthetic spectra derived from these models to multi-wavelength observations, we constrain the stellar and wind properties of R144 and R136a1. We first determine the clumping stratification required by our hydro-models to fit the spectra of R144 by using the available dynamical mass estimates for the two components. We then utilise this clumping stratification in hydrodynamic models of R136a1 and estimate a mass of $M_\mathrm{Hydro}$ of 233 Msun. Remarkably, the estimated mass is close to and entirely consistent with chemical homogeneous mass relations. This present-day mass of 233 Msun provides a lower limit to the initial stellar mass, that could be far higher due to previous wind mass loss.</description>

      <title>3D Adiabatic Simulations of Binary Black Hole Formation in AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate close encounters between initially unbound black holes (BHs) in the gaseous discs of active galactic nuclei (AGN), performing the first 3D non-isothermal hydrodynamical simulations of gas-assisted binary BH formation. We discuss a suite of 135 simulations, considering 9 AGN disc environments and 15 BH impact parameters. We find that the gas distribution within the Hill sphere about an isolated embedded BH is akin to a spherically symmetric star with a low-mass convective envelope and a BH core, with large convective currents driving strong outflows away from the midplane. We find that Coriolis force acting on the outflow results in winds, analogous to cyclones, that counter-rotate with respect to the midplane flow within the Hill sphere. We confirm the existence of strong thermal blasts due to minidisc collisions during BH close encounters, as predicted in our previous 2D studies. We document binary formation across a wide range of environments, finding formation likelihood is increased when the gas mass in the Hill sphere is large, allowing for easier binary formation in the outer AGN disc. We provide a comprehensive overview of the SMBH's role in binary formation, investigating how binary formation in intermediate density environments is biased towards certain binary orientations. We offer two models for predicting dissipation by gas during close encounters, as a function of the ambient Hill mass alone, or with the periapsis depth. We use these models to motivate a prescription for binary formation likelihood that can be readily applied to Monte-Carlo simulations of AGN evolution.</description>

      <title>A Universal Analytic Model for Gravitational Lensing by Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model for analytically calculating gravitational lensing by self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. Leveraging the universal behavior of SIDM halos during gravothermal evolution, we calibrate the lensing potential using a fluid simulation, normalizing the evolution time to align with established scenarios. From this potential, we derive explicit equations for the deflection angle and surface density profile, quantifying their deviations from numerical results. Our model builds on the parametric approach of arXiv:2305.16176, providing refinements in the deep core-collapse regime and enabling more comprehensive lensing studies. We explore characteristic lensing features, including critical curves and caustics, for SIDM halos in isolation and within a main halo, tracking their evolution through the gravothermal phase. We also examine signatures in the self-similar regime of core collapsed halos and highlight the role of baryonic effects in realistic halos. The efficiency of our model enables large-scale lensing studies, and we make our implementation publicly available on GitHub to support further research.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for AGN Accretion and Jet Feedback in Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, especially due to relativistic jets, is crucial for understanding the cool-core problem in galaxy clusters. We present a new subgrid method to model accretion onto and feedback from AGN in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters. Instead of applying the traditional Bondi formalism, we use a sink particle algorithm in which the accretion flux is measured directly through a control surface. A weighting kernel is used to reset the gas properties within the accretion radius at the end of each timestep. We implement feedback in the form of bipolar jets whose properties are tied to the accretion rate. The method is tested with a spherically symmetric Bondi gas flow problem and a Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton wind problem, with and without jet feedback. We discuss the reliability of this model by comparing our jet simulations with those in the literature, and we examine the dependence of test results on parameters such as the resolution and size of the jet injection region. We find that the sink particle model can account for the $\alpha$ factor in accretion measurement, and the accretion radius must be resolved with at least two zones to produce realistic black hole accretion. We also show how under-resolving the AGN feedback region in simulations can impact the feedback energy deposited and the jet dynamics. The code described here is the framework for a feedback model, described in a companion paper, that will use accretion disk modeling to more self-consistently determine the feedback efficiency.</description>

      <title>ODS: A self-reporting system for radio telescopes to coexist with adaptive satellite constellations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations bring broadband internet and cellular service to the most remote locations on the planet. Unfortunately, many of these locations also host some of the world's best optical and radio astronomy (RA) observatories. With the number of LEO satellites expected to increase by an order of magnitude in the upcoming decade, satellite downlink radio frequency interference (RFI) is a growing concern in protected radio-quiet areas like the United States National Radio Quiet Zone. When these satellites transmit in the spectrum near protected RA bands, undesired out-of-band emission can leak into these protected bands and impact scientific observations. In this paper, we present a self-reporting system - Operational Data Sharing (ODS) - which enables mutual awareness by publishing radio telescopes' operational information to a protected database that is available to satellite operators through a representational state transfer application programming interface (REST API). Satellite operators can use the ODS data to adapt their downlink tasking algorithms in real time to avoid overwhelming sensitive RA facilities, particularly, through the novel Telescope Boresight Avoidance (TBA) technique. Preliminary results from recent experiments between the NRAO and the SpaceX Starlink teams demonstrate the effectiveness of the ODS and TBA in reducing downlink RFI in the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array's observations in the 1990-1995 MHz and 10.7-12.7 GHz bands. This automated ODS system is beginning to be implemented by other RA facilities and could be utilized by other satellite operators in the near future.</description>

      <title>Gas infall via accretion disk feeding Cepheus A HW2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The star-forming region Cepheus A hosts a very young star, called HW2, that is the second closest to us growing a dozen times more massive than our Sun. The circumstellar environment surrounding HW2 has long been the subject of much debate about the presence or not of an accretion disk, whose existence is at the basis of our current paradigm of star formation. Here, we answer this long standing question by resolving the gaseous disk component, and its kinematics, through sensitive observations at cm wavelengths of hot ammonia (NH$_3$) with the Jansky Very Large Array. We map the accretion disk surrounding HW2 at radii between 200 and 700 au, showing how fast circumstellar gas collapses and slowly orbits to pile up near the young star at very high rates of $2\times10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. These results, corroborated by state-of-the-art simulations, show that an accretion disk is still efficient in focusing huge mass infall rates near the young star, even when this star has already reached a large mass of 16 M$_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters in a IllustrisTNG simulation based on mock observations of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are the largest self-gravitational systems in the Universe. They are valuable probes of the structure growth of the Universe when we estimate their peculiar velocities with the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effects. We investigate whether there is a systematic offset between the peculiar velocities ($v_{\rm z,kSZ}$) estimated with the kSZ effect and the true velocities of halos. We first created mocks of the 2D maps of SZ effects in seven frequency bands for galaxy clusters spanning a broad range of masses in TNG 300-3. We then derived the line-of-sight (LOS) peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters by applying an analytical formula to fit the spectra of the SZ effect. We find that the analytical formula-fitting method tends to overestimate the peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters, regardless of whether they approach us or recede from us. However, when galaxy clusters larger than 500 km/s were excluded, the slopes of the relations between $v_{\rm z,kSZ}$ and the real LOS velocities of galaxy clusters ($v_{\rm z,halo}$) were consistent with unity within the errors. Additionally, we further accounted for observational noise for different-aperture telescopes under different precipitable water vapor. The slopes for most cases are consistent with unity within the errors, and the errors of the slopes slightly increase with higher observation noise. The $|v_{\rm z,kSZ}-v_{\rm z,halo}|$ exhibits no obvious trend with increasing concentration and $M_{\rm 200}$. It is noteworthy that the $|v_{\rm z,kSZ}-v_{\rm z,halo}|$ is relatively high for galaxy clusters with strong active galactic nucleus feedback and high star formation rates. This indicates that these physical processes affect the cluster dynamic state and may reflect on the peculiar velocity estimated from the kSZ effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has become a key tool in astronomy, driving advancements in the analysis and interpretation of complex datasets from observations. This article reviews the application of ML techniques in the identification and classification of stellar objects, alongside the inference of their key astrophysical properties. We highlight the role of both supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms, particularly deep learning models, in classifying stars and enhancing our understanding of essential stellar parameters, such as mass, age, and chemical composition. We discuss ML applications in the study of various stellar objects, including binaries, supernovae, dwarfs, young stellar objects, variables, metal-poor, and chemically peculiar stars. Additionally, we examine the role of ML in investigating star-related interstellar medium objects, such as protoplanetary disks, planetary nebulae, cold neutral medium, feedback bubbles, and molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger detection of black hole binaries in dark matter spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inspiral of a high mass-ratio black hole binary located in the nucleus of a galaxy, where the primary central black hole is surrounded by a dense dark matter spike formed through accretion during the black hole growth phase. Within this spike, dark matter undergoes strong self-annihilation, producing a compact source of $\gamma$-ray radiation that is highly sensitive to spike density, while the binary emits gravitational waves at frequencies detectable by LISA. As the inspiralling binary interacts with the surrounding dark matter particles, it alters the density of the spike, thereby influencing the $\gamma$-ray flux from dark matter annihilation. We demonstrate that the spike self-annihilation luminosity decreases by $10\%$ to $90\%$ of its initial value, depending on the initial density profile and binary mass ratio, as the binary sweeps through the LISA band. This presents a new opportunity to indirectly probe dark matter through multi-messenger observations of galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the origin of fast radio bursts by modeling the stellar mass and star formation distributions of their host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diverse formation channels have been proposed to explain the emergence of fast radio bursts (FRBs), yet their origin remains elusive. With improved localization precision, roughly 90 FRBs are now associated with host galaxies. SED fitting to the host galaxy photometry reveals their stellar masses ($M_\star$) and star formation rates (SFRs), enabling discrimination between various formation channels. We conduct an extensive comparison of the stellar mass, SFR and z distributions of 51 FRB hosts and mock-generated galaxy samples to test whether FRBs trace SFR or $M_\star$. We incorporate a mass-to-light ratio prescription to address optical selection biases. In line with Sharma et al. (2024), we provide evidence in favor of FRB progenitors tracking SF rather than stellar mass. We show that the shape of the assumed $(M_\star/L_r)_{obs}$ distribution affects the predictions, bringing the low mass end of the stellar mass distribution closer to the data when accounting for the $\mathrm{SFR} - (M_\star/L_r)_{obs}$ correlation. The K-correction effect in the $r-$band is minimal for galaxies at $z \lesssim 0.7$. Even if FRBs trace SF, up to $\sim30\%$ of a flux-limited FRB host sample can reside below the star-forming main sequence. Finally, we examine a hybrid model in which a fraction of FRBs tracks stellar mass rather than SF. This fraction can be as large as $\sim(40-50)\%$, suggesting that multiple formation channels are still consistent with observations. The toolkit developed in this work is publicly available (GALFRB code), offering a straightforward way to generate mock galaxy samples suitable for direct comparisons with future FRB host galaxy data.</description>

      <title>UNCOVERing the contribution of black holes to reionization in the JWST era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With its sensitivity in the rest-frame optical, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered active galactic nuclei (AGN), comprising both intrinsically faint and heavily reddened sources, well into the first billion years of the Universe, at $z \sim 4-11$. In this work, we revisit the AGN contribution to reionization given the high number densities associated with these objects. We use the DELPHI semi-analytic model, base-lined against the latest high-redshift datasets from the JWST and the Atacama Large millimetre Array (ALMA) to model early star forming galaxies and AGN. We calculate the escape fractions of ionizing radiation from both star formation and AGN and include the impact of reionization feeback in suppressing the baryonic content of low-mass galaxies in ionized regions. This model is validated against the key observables for star forming galaxy, AGN and reionization. In our {\it fiducial} model, reionization reaches its mid-point at $z \sim 6.9$ and ends by $z \sim 5.9$. Low stellar mass ($M_*\leq 10^9M_\odot$) star forming galaxies are found to be the key drivers of the reionization process, providing about $77\%$ of the total photon budget. Despite their high numbers, high accretion rates and higher escape fractions compared to star forming galaxies at $z \sim 5$, AGN only provide about $23\%$ of the total reionization budget which is dominated by black holes in high stellar mass systems (with $M_* \geq 10^9M_\odot$). This is because AGN number densities become relevant only at $z \leq 7$ - as a result, AGN contribute as much as galaxies as late as $z \sim 6.2$, when reionization is already in its end stages. Finally, we find that even contrasting models of the AGN ionizing photon escape fraction (increasing or decreasing with stellar mass) do not qualitatively change our results.</description>

      <title>Stellar streams from black hole-rich star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nearly a hundred progenitor-less, thin stellar streams have been discovered in the Milky Way, thanks to Gaia and related surveys. Most streams are believed to have formed from star clusters and it was recently proposed that extended star clusters -- rich in stellar-mass black holes (BHs) -- are efficient in creating streams. To understand the nature of stream progenitors better, we quantify the differences between streams originating from star clusters with and without BHs using direct $N$-body models and a new model for the density profiles of streams based on time-dependent escape rates from clusters. The QSG (Quantifying Stream Growth) model facilitates the rapid exploration of parameter space and provides an analytic framework to understand the impact of different star cluster properties and escape conditions on the structure of streams. Using these models it is found that, compared to streams from BH-free clusters on the same orbit, streams of BH-rich clusters: (1) are approximately five times more massive; (2) have a peak density three times closer to the cluster 1 Gyr post-dissolution (for orbits of Galactocentric radius &gt; 10 kpc), and (3) have narrower peaks and more extended wings in their density profile. We discuss other observable stream properties that are affected by the presence of BHs in their progenitor cluster, namely the width of the stream, its radial offset from the orbit, and the properties of the gap at the progenitor's location. Our results provide a step towards using stellar streams to constrain the BH content of dissolved (globular) star clusters.</description>

      <title>MIDIS: MIRI uncovers Virgil, the first Little Red Dot with clear detection of its host galaxy at z ~ 6.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Virgil, a MIRI extremely red object (MERO) detected with the F1000W filter as part of the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) observations of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). Virgil is a Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) at $z_{spec} = 6.6312\pm 0.0019$ (from VLT/MUSE) with a rest-frame UV-to-optical spectral energy distribution (SED) typical of LAEs at similar redshifts. However, MIRI observations reveal an unexpected extremely red color at rest-frame near-infrared wavelengths, $\rm F444W - F1000W = 2.33 \pm 0.06$. Such steep rise in the near-infrared, completely missed without MIRI imaging, is poorly reproduced by models including only stellar populations and hints towards the presence of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). According to the shape of its overall SED, Virgil belongs to the recently discovered population of Little Red Dots (LRDs) but displays an extended rest-frame UV-optical wavelengths morphology following a 2D-S\'ersic profile with average index $n = 0.93^{+0.85}_{-0.31}$ and $r_e = 0.49^{+0.05}_{-0.11}$ pkpc. Only at MIRI wavelengths Virgil is unresolved due to the coarser PSF. We also estimate a bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm bol, AGN} = (8.9-11)\times 10^{44}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$ and a supermassive black hole mass $M_{\rm BH} = (7-9)\times 10^6\rm ~ M_\odot$ (if $\lambda_{\rm Edd} = 1$) in agreement with recently reported values for LRDs. This discovery demonstrates the crucial importance of deep MIRI surveys to find AGN amongst high-$z$ galaxies that otherwise would be completely missed and raises the question of how common Virgil-like objects could be in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Jetted subgalactic-size radio sources in merging galaxies -- A jet redirection scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: The long-standing question concerning jetted subgalactic-size (JSS) radio sources is whether they will evolve into large radio galaxies, die before escaping the host galaxy, or remain indefinitely confined to their compact size. Aims: Our main goal is to propose a scenario that explains the relative number of JSS radio sources and their general properties. Methods: We studied the parsec-scale radio morphology of a complete sample of 21 objects using Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at various frequencies and analyzed the morphological characteristics of their optical hosts. Results: Many of these radio sources exhibit radio morphologies consistent with transverse motions of their bright edges and are found in dynamically disturbed galaxies. VLBA images suggest the possible presence of large-angle, short-period precessing jets, and an orbital motion of the radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN) in a dual or binary system. The majority of JSS radio sources appear to be in systems in different stages of their merging evolution. Conclusions: We propose a scenario where rapid jet redirection, through precession or orbital motion, prevents the jet from penetrating the interstellar medium (ISM) sufficiently to escape the host galaxy. Most JSS radio sources remain compact due to their occurrence in merging galaxies.</description>

      <title>Investigating C-D out-of-plane vibrational modes in PAHs as a tool to study interstellar deuterium-containing PAHs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous as well as recent observations by ISO, Spitzer, AKARI, SOFIA, JWST etc. have revealed various characteristics of mid-infrared emission bands between 3-20 micron. Subsequently, several forms of organics including Polycylic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)/PAH-like molecules are proposed as carriers for these bands. Deuterated PAH (PAD) is one such substituted PAH, which is proposed as a potential candidate carrier for weak emission bands at 4.4 and 4.65 micron, detected towards few astronomical targets and are characteristics of aromatic and aliphatic C-D stretching modes in a PAD molecule, respectively. However, the 4.4 micron band is not widely detected. In order to validate PADs as carriers for mid-infrared emission bands, an additional alternative tool is crucial. If PAHs are deuterated, they should also possess an inherent signature from the C-D out-of-plane (C-Doop) vibrations, which are at the longer wavelength side. In this report, features due to C-Doop modes in PAHs bearing a single to multiple deuterium atoms are reported by performing quantum-chemical calculations. This paper reports that some of the C-Doop vibrations appear at the 14-19 micron range. Also, the strength of C-Doop modes is not proportional to the D/H ratio in PAHs. In addition, a moderate change in the spectra of deuterated PAHs is observed from that of the undeuterated counterparts, as deuteration would alternate the adjacency class of the C-H bonds and the symmetry of the molecule. We discuss the efficiency and usefulness of these bands to constrain the form of PAHs emitting mid-infrared emission bands.</description>

      <title>A Quasar-Anchored Protocluster at z=6.6 in the ASPIRE Survey: I. Properties of [OIII] Emitters in a 10 Mpc Overdensity Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ASPIRE (A SPectroscopic survey of bIased halos in the Reionization Era) is a quasar legacy survey primarily using \textit{JWST} to target a sample of 25 $z&gt;6$ quasars with NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and imaging. The first study in this series found evidence of a strong overdensity of galaxies around J0305$-$3150, a luminous quasar at $z=6.61$, within a single NIRCam pointing obtained in JWST Cycle 1. Here, we present the first results of a JWST Cycle 2 mosaic that covers 35 arcmin$^2$ with NIRCam imaging/WFSS of the same field to investigate the spatial extent of the putative protocluster. The F356W grism data targets [OIII]+H$\beta$ at $5.3&lt;z&lt;7$ and reveals a population of 124 line emitters down to a flux limit of 1.2$\times$10$^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. Fifty-three of these galaxies lie at $6.5&lt;z&lt;6.8$ spanning 10 cMpc on the sky, corresponding to an overdensity within a 2500 cMpc$^3$ volume of 12.5 $\pm$ 2.6, anchored by the quasar. Comparing to the [OIII] luminosity function from the Emission line galaxies and Intergalactic Gas in the Epoch of Reionization (EIGER) project, we find a dearth of faint [OIII] emitters at log(L/erg\,s$^{-1}$) $&lt;$ 42.3, which we suggest is consistent with either bursty star formation causing galaxies to scatter around the grism detection limit or modest suppression from quasar feedback. While we find a strong filamentary overdensity of [OIII] emitters consistent with a protocluster, we suggest that we could be insensitive to a population of older, more massive Lyman-break galaxies with weak nebular emission on scales $&gt;10$ cMpc.</description>

Abstract: We present paper II comprising a 35 arcmin$^2$ \textit{JWST}/NIRCam imaging and wide-field slitless spectroscopy mosaic centered on J0305$-$3150, a luminous quasar at $z=6.61$. The F356W grism data reveals 124 [OIII]+H$\beta$ emitters at $5.3&lt;z&lt;7$, 53 of which constitute a protocluster spanning (10 cMpc)$^2$ across $6.5&lt;z&lt;6.8$. We find no evidence of any broad-line AGN in individual galaxies or stacking, reporting a median H$\beta$ FWHM of 585 $\pm$ 152 km s$^{-1}$; however, the mass-excitation diagram and ``little red dot" color and compactness criteria suggest that there are a few AGN candidates on the outskirts of the protocluster. We fit the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the [OIII] emitters with \texttt{Prospector} and \texttt{Bagpipes}, and find that none of the SED-derived properties (stellar mass, age, or star formation rate) correlates with proximity to the quasar. While there is no correlation between galaxy age and local galaxy density, we find modest correlations between local galaxy density with increasing stellar mass, decreasing 10-to-100 Myr star formation rate ratios and decreasing nebular line equivalent widths. We further find that the protocluster galaxies are consistent with being more massive, older, and hosting higher star formation rates than the field sample at the 3$\sigma$ level, distributed in a filamentary structure which supports inside-out formation of the protocluster. There is modest evidence that galaxy evolution proceeds differently as a function of the density of local environment within protoclusters during the epoch of reionization, and the central quasar has little effect on the galaxy properties of the surrounding structure.</description>

      <title>A recoiling supermassive black hole in a powerful quasar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBH) are thought to grow through accretion of matter and mergers. Models of SMBH mergers have long suffered the final parsec problem, where SMBH binaries may stall before energy loss from gravitational waves (GW) becomes significant, leaving the pair unmerged. Direct evidence of coalesced SMBH remains elusive. Theory predicts that GW recoiling black holes can occur following a black hole merger. Here we present new and conclusive spectroscopic evidence that both the accretion disk and the broad line region in the spatially offset quasar 3C 186 are blue-shifted by the same velocity relative to the host galaxy, with a line of sight velocity of (-1310 +- 21) km/s. This is best explained by the GW recoil super-kick scenario. This confirmation of the ejection process implies that the final parsec problem is resolved in nature, providing evidence that even the most massive black holes can merge.</description>

      <title>The Host Galaxy of the Hyperactive Repeating FRB 20240114A: Behind a Galaxy Cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the optical spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy of the hyperactive repeating fast radio burst, FRB 20240114A. The host galaxy is a dwarf galaxy at a redshift of $z=0.1306\pm0.0002$. With a rest-frame coverage of 4300-7900 \AA, we have detected H$\rm{\alpha}$, H$\rm{\beta}$, [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007, [N II]$\lambda\lambda$6548,6583, and [S II]$\lambda$6716 emission lines. The emission line ratios suggest that the ionization in the host galaxy is dominated by star formation. The star formation rate (SFR) derived from the H$\rm{\alpha}$ emission line is $(0.06 \pm 0.01) \ \rm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$, and the SED fitting suggests the lower limit of the SFR(UV) is $0.09 \ \rm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$. The stellar mass is $(\rm 4.0 \pm 1.8) \times 10^8 \ M_{\odot}$, making the specific star formation rate $\rm log \ sSFR(H\rm \alpha) = -9.8 \pm 0.2 \ yr^{-1}$. The line ratios indicate an upper limit of a metallicity of $\rm 12+log_{10} ([O/H]) \sim 8.5$. As the nearest dwarf host galaxy with a repeating FRB, the activity of FRB 20240114A and the properties of this host galaxy closely resemble those of FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B. The H$\rm{\alpha}$-traced dispersion measure (DM) provided by the ionized gas of the host galaxy has a moderate contribution of $\sim 200 \rm \ pc \ cm^{-3}$, assuming a warm ionized gas. We found that the distributions of the stellar mass versus SFR are significantly different between repeating and one-off FRBs, as determined by the MANOVA test with $p=0.0116$.</description>

      <title>Lopsided and Bulging Distribution of Satellites around Paired Halos. I. Observational Measurements and Comparison with Halo-based Models</title>

Abstract: We investigate the angular distribution of satellite galaxies in and around pairs of galaxy groups in SDSS and compare the results with the satellite distribution in pairs of dark matter halos by constructing mock catalogs that account for the same selection effects as the observational sample. We find that the angular distribution of satellites in both SDSS and the mock catalog exhibits a pronounced tendency towards lopsidedness, with satellites preferentially located between the two central galaxies. Additionally, there is a significant bulging distribution characterized by a higher concentration of satellites along the line connecting the two centrals compared to those found perpendicular to it. The lopsided and bulging distributions strengthen as pair separation and halo mass increase. The mock catalog successfully reproduces the observational results across all cases considered. We find that the lopsided and bulging distribution of satellites can largely be explained by overlapping two randomly selected halos matched in mass to the actual halo pairs, along with their surrounding satellite distribution, provided that the alignment between the orientations of the halos and the line connecting the halo pairs is taken into account. This suggests that the angular distribution of satellites is a natural consequence of the formation and evolution of large-scale structure in a $\Lambda$CDM universe, eliminating the need to introduce other physical origins.</description>

      <title>Photon Ring Dimming as a Signature of Photon-Axion Conversion in Janis-Newman-Winicour Naked Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possible existence of axions in the universe introduces the intriguing possibility of photon-axion conversion in strong magnetic fields, particularly near compact objects like supermassive black holes or even naked singularity. In this study, we investigate the conversion of photons into axions in the vicinity of a Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) spacetime, a well-known naked singularity solution. Our analysis reveals that photons can efficiently convert into axions with masses less than $100 \rm \ neV$. We calculate the conversion probability and find that it is significantly influenced by the characteristic parameter of the JNW spacetime. The potential observational signatures of this conversion, would be the dimming of photon ring in the X-ray and gamma-ray spectrum. Our findings suggest that compact objects like M87* could be prime candidates for detecting photon-axion conversion effects, provided future advances in high-resolution observations.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of black holes embedded in halos of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the (axial) quasinormal modes of black holes embedded in generic matter profiles. Our results reveal that the axial QNMs experience a redshift when the black hole is surrounded by various matter environments, proportional to the compactness of the matter halo. Our calculations demonstrate that for static black holes embedded in galactic matter distributions, there exists a universal relation between the matter environment and the redshifted vacuum quasinormal modes. In particular, for dilute environments the leading order effect is a redshift $1+U$ of frequencies and damping times, with $U \sim -{\cal C}$ the Newtonian potential of the environment at its center, which scales with its compactness ${\cal C}$.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project XIV. New clues on the location of the TAMS in the massive star domain</title>

Abstract: Massive stars play a very important role in many astrophysical fields. Yet, some fundamental aspects of their evolution remain poorly constrained. In this regard, there is an open debate on the width of the main-sequence (MS) phase. We aim to create an updated Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram that includes a volume-limited and statistically significant sample of massive stars. Our goal is to use this sample to investigate the extension of the MS, including information about projected rotational velocities ($v\sin i$) and the spectroscopic binary status. We combine spectroscopic parameters derived with FASTWIND stellar atmosphere code and Gaia distances to obtain stellar parameters for 876 Galactic luminous O- and B-type stars gathered within the IACOB project. We use the ${\tt iacob-broad}$ tool to derive $v\sin i$ estimates and multi-epoch spectra to identify single/double-line spectroscopic binaries (SB1/SB2). We present an HR diagram for 670 stars located within 2500pc balancing completeness and number. We evaluate the extension of the MS in terms of the drop in the relative number of stars as a function of effective temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$). We find a consistent boundary at $\approx$22.5kK within the full range of luminosities that we use to delineate the terminal-age main sequence (TAMS). We obtain a smooth decrease of the highest $v\sin i$ with $T_{\rm eff}$ along the MS, likely limited by the critical velocity. We consider this effect combined with a lower expected fraction of stars beyond the MS as the best explanation for the lack of fast-rotating objects in the post-MS region. Our results favor low to mild initial rotation for the full sample and a binary past for the tail of fast-rotating stars. The prominence of SB1/SB2 systems in the MS, and the 25% decrease in the relative fraction of SB1 systems when crossing the TAMS can further delineate its location.</description>

      <title>Lopsided and Bulging Distribution of Satellites around Paired Halos. II. 3D Analysis and Dependence on Projection and Selection Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of subhalos in the vicinity of dark matter halo pairs in the Illustris-TNG simulation. The satellites around halo pairs with separations $d_{\text{sep}} &gt; 0.5~h^{-1} \text{Mpc}$ exhibit a non-uniform distribution, which is a combined result of two distinct features: the "bulging" distribution, characterized by an overabundance along the pairwise direction, and the ''lopsided'' distribution, which shows an overabundance in the region between the paired halos. The bulging signal is stronger for halo pairs that are more widely separated and involve less massive halos, while the lopsidedness strengthens as the halo mass increases. Both signals depend weakly on halo mass ratio, and are primarily contributed by subhalos that are relatively distant from host halos. These measurements can be broadly reproduced by the overlap effect, provided the spatial alignment of halos is properly taken into account. Our results imply that the lopsidedness and bulging distribution may arise from two distinct origins: the former is caused simply by the overlap of two closely placed halos, while the latter is driven by the alignment of halos with large-scale filamentary structures. We examine the impact of projection and selection effects by conducting the same analysis of satellite distribution in two dimensions and in a mock catalog that replicates the selection effects of the SDSS galaxy sample. We find that the 3D-to-2D projection significantly suppresses the bulging distribution, with particularly strong effects at large pair separations, low halo masses, and large halo mass ratios.</description>
