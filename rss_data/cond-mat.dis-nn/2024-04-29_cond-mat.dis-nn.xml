      <title>Fast relaxation in metallic glasses studied by measurements of the internal friction at high frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed high-frequency (0.4 to 1.7 MHz) measurements of the internal friction (IF) on 14 bulk metallic glasses (MGs). It is found that 12 of these MGs display relaxation IF peaks at temperatures T= 400-500 K, which are weakly affected by heat treatment within the amorphous state. The corresponding relaxation time is about 0.3 microseconds. This fast relaxation is reported for the first time in the literature. The apparent activation enthalpy for 4 MGs is determined.</description>

      <title>Emergent Non-Abelian Thouless Pumping Induced by the Quasiperiodic Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Abelian Thouless pumping in a disorder tunable Lieb chain with degenerate flat bands. The results reveal that quasiperiodic disorder will cause a topological phase transition from the trivial (without non-Abelian Thouless pumping) to the non-trivial (with non-Abelian Thouless pumping) phase. The mechanism behind is that the monopole originally outside the topological region can be driven into the topological region due to the introduction of quasiperiodic disorder. Moreover, since the corresponding monopole will turn into a nodal line to spread beyond the boundaries of the topological region, the system with large disorder strength will result in the disappearance of non-Abelian Thouless pumping. Furthermore, we numerically simulate the Thouless pumping of non-Abelian systems, and the evolution results of center of mass' displacement are consistent with the Chern number. Finally, we discuss the localization properties of the system and find that, similar to [PRL 130, 206401(2023)], the inverse Anderson transition does not occur in the system with the increase of quasiperiodic strength, while the system still maintains the coexistence of localized and extended states.</description>

      <title>Network-theory based modeling of avalanche dynamics in percolative tunnelling networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-like self-assembled networks can infer and analyze information out of unorganized noisy signals with minimal power consumption. These networks are characterized by spatiotemporal avalanches and their crackling behavior, and their physical models are expected to predict and understand their computational capabilities. Here, we use a network theory-based approach to provide a physical model for percolative tunnelling networks, found in Ag-hBN system, consisting of nodes (atomic clusters) of Ag intercalated in the hBN van der Waals layers. By modeling a single edge plasticity through constitutive electrochemical filament formation, and annihilation through Joule heating, we identify independent parameters that determine the network connectivity. We construct a phase diagram and show that a small region of the parameter space contains signals which are long-range temporally correlated, and only a subset of them contains crackling avalanche dynamics. Physical systems spontaneously selforganize to this region for possibly maximizing the efficiency of information transfer.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic &amp; algorithmic efficiency in heterogeneous networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Why complex structures emerge in a real world environment is a fascinating question which has not found any fully satisfactory answer at the point of today. At the border between statistical physics, machine learning and network theory, we provide some computational empirical evidence indicating that the emergence of complex structures in a real world environment is the macroscopic thermodynamic result of the optimal trade-off between the ability to encode information about the environment in the very features of the network and the ability to transmit information across it. While the former is quantified by the von Neumann network entropy and the latter by the Helmholtz free energy, the two are gathered into a single quantity tantamount to the thermodynamic efficiency. We take as a case study an algorithm originally proposed for creating and searching trees of patterns under the assumption that, akin to living system, the algorithm seeks the best internal representation of the outer world, namely a real world dataset of patterns. Remarkably, optimal thermodynamic efficiency overlaps with the optimal algorithmic efficiency, defined in terms of accuracy and computational cost, whether the former is measured at the resolution scale in where the network transits from exhibiting a specific heat with a single peak to a scale-invariant region. Moreover the critical hypothesis is investigated and empirical evidence suggests that the system benefits from the critical-state when it confronts with higher-complexity environments, while it does not when the environment is simpler.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A neural network is used to train, predict, and evaluate a model to calculate the energies of 3-dimensional systems composed of Ti and O atoms. Python classes are implemented to quantify atomic interactions through symmetry functions and to specify prediction algorithms. The hyperparameters of the model are optimised by minimising validation RMSE, which then produced a model that is accurate to within 100 eV. The model could be improved by proper testing of symmetry function calculations and addressing properties of features and targets.</description>

      <title>Floquet Amorphous Topological Orders in a Rydberg Glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Floquet amorphous topological orders in experimentally accessible one-dimensional array of randomly pointed Rydberg atoms with periodic driving. The filling factor in the chain is tunable by applying a microwave field. We give a complete characterization of the topological properties from both the single-particle and many-body aspect. The periodic driving results in richer topological phases. At the single-particle level, we calculate the real space winding numbers and polarization, confirming robust amorphous topological phases with 0-type and $\pi$-type edge modes. We show a structural disorder induced topological phase transition acompanied with localization transition in the nonequilibrium system. Furthermore, in the many-body case we find the existence of amorphous topological orders of the hardcore bosons half-filled the chain, in contrast described by the topological entanglement entropy and the string order. Possible detection methods are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Avalanche Dynamics and the Effect of Straining in Dislocation Systems with Quenched Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The plastic deformation of crystalline and other heterogeneous materials often manifests in stochastic intermittent events indicating the criticality of plastic behavior. Previous studies demonstrated that the presence of short-ranged quenched disorder modifies this behavior disrupting long-range static and dynamic correlations consequently localizing dislocation avalanches. However, these observations were mostly confined to relaxed materials devoid of deformation history. In this work our focus is on how straining affects static and dynamic correlations, avalanche dynamics and local yield stresses. We demonstrate that the interplay between severe straining and confining quenched disorder induces critical behavior characterized by dislocation avalanches distinct from those at lower stresses. Namely, near the flow stress many avalanches, even if triggered locally, evolve into events affecting a larger region by exciting small clusters of dislocations all around the sample. This type of avalanches differ from the ones at low strains where plastic events typically consist of one compact cluster of dislocations which is either local or it is already quite extended at the onset of the avalanche. Furthermore, we examine the impact of avalanches on local yield stresses. It is shown in detail in this work that while some statistical features of the local yield thresholds are robust to straining, others are significantly affected by the deformation history.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the capacity of the Ising perceptron is with high probability upper bounded by the constant $\alpha_\star \approx 0.833$ conjectured by Krauth and M\'ezard, under the condition that an explicit two-variable function $\mathscr{S}_\star(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ is maximized at $(1,0)$. The earlier work of Ding and Sun proves the matching lower bound subject to a similar numerical condition, and together these results give a conditional proof of the conjecture of Krauth and M\'ezard.</description>

Abstract: We study electron localization in disordered quantum systems, focusing on both individual eigenstates and thermal states. We employ complex polarization as a numerical indicator to characterize the system's localization length. Furthermore, we assess the efficacy of mean-field approximation in providing a quantitative analysis of such systems. Through this study, we seek to provide insight into the following aspects: the behavior of electron localization as a function of interaction, disorder, and temperature, whether thermal states and highly excited states exhibit similar properties in many-body localized systems, and the reliability of the mean-field approximation in weak-interaction scenarios.</description>

      <title>Ring Structure in the Complex Plane: A Fingerprint of non-Hermitian Mobility Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By Avila's global theory, we analytically reveal that the non-Hermitian mobility edge will take on a ring structure in the complex plane, which we name as "mobility ring". The universality of mobility ring has been checked and supported by the Hermitian limit, $PT$-symmetry protection and without $PT$-symmetry cases. Further, we study the evolution of mobility ring versus quasiperiodic strength, and find that in the non-Hermitian system, there will appear multiple mobility ring structures. With cross-reference to the multiple mobility edges in Hermitian case, we give the expression of the maximum number of mobility rings. Finally, by comparing the results of Avila's global theorem and self-duality method, we show that self-duality relation has its own limitations in calculating the critical point in non-Hermitian systems. As we know, the general non-Hermitian system has a complex spectrum, which determines that the non-Hermitian mobility edge can but exhibit a ring structure in the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Explaining Neural Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.06701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The population loss of trained deep neural networks often follows precise power-law scaling relations with either the size of the training dataset or the number of parameters in the network. We propose a theory that explains the origins of and connects these scaling laws. We identify variance-limited and resolution-limited scaling behavior for both dataset and model size, for a total of four scaling regimes. The variance-limited scaling follows simply from the existence of a well-behaved infinite data or infinite width limit, while the resolution-limited regime can be explained by positing that models are effectively resolving a smooth data manifold. In the large width limit, this can be equivalently obtained from the spectrum of certain kernels, and we present evidence that large width and large dataset resolution-limited scaling exponents are related by a duality. We exhibit all four scaling regimes in the controlled setting of large random feature and pretrained models and test the predictions empirically on a range of standard architectures and datasets. We also observe several empirical relationships between datasets and scaling exponents under modifications of task and architecture aspect ratio. Our work provides a taxonomy for classifying different scaling regimes, underscores that there can be different mechanisms driving improvements in loss, and lends insight into the microscopic origins of and relationships between scaling exponents.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian Algorithms for Maximum Independent Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two quantum Hamiltonian algorithms have been proposed to solve the maximum independent set problem: the PK algorithm, introduced in [Phys. Rev. A 101 (2020) 012318; Chin. Phys. Lett. 38, (2021) 030304], and the the HV algorithm, presented in [Science 376 (2022) 1209]. Here we demonstrate that the two algorithms are mathematically equivalent. Specifically, the Hamiltonian in the PK algorithm can be viewed as the HV Hamiltonian in the interaction picture. We remark on potential practical advantages of the PK algorithm.Although they are mathematically equivalent, their most straightforward physical implementations are different, and our numerical simulations suggest that the PK algorithm might can bring significant advantages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Penrose method of instability analysis, we consider the synchronization transition in the Kuramoto model with inertia and noise with all-to-all couplings. Analyzing the Penrose curves, we identify the appearance of cluster and chimera states in the presence of noise. We observe that noise can destroy chimera and biclusters states. The critical coupling describing bifurcation from incoherent to coherent state is found analytically. To confirm our propositions based on the Penrose method, we perform numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Enumerating low-frequency nonphononic vibrations in computer glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In addition to Goldstone phonons that generically emerge in the low-frequency vibrational spectrum of any solid, crystalline or glassy, structural glasses also feature other low-frequency vibrational modes. The nature and statistical properties of these modes -- often termed `excess modes' -- have been the subject of decades-long investigation. Studying them, even using well-controlled computer glasses, has proven challenging due to strong spatial hybridization effects between phononic and nonphononic excitations, which hinder quantitative analyses of the nonphononic contribution ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ to the total spectrum ${\cal D}(\omega)$, per frequency $\omega$. Here, using recent advances indicating that ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)\!=\!{\cal D}(\omega)-{\cal D}_{\rm D}(\omega)$, where ${\cal D}_{\rm D}(\omega)$ is Debye's spectrum of phonons, we present a simple and straightforward scheme to enumerate nonphononic modes in computer glasses. Our analysis establishes that nonphononic modes in computer glasses indeed make an additive contribution to the total spectrum, including in the presence of strong hybridizations. Moreover, it cleanly reveals the universal ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)\!\sim\!\omega^4$ tail of the nonphononic spectrum, and opens the way for related analyses of experimental spectra of glasses.</description>
