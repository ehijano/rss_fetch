      <title>Deep Learning solutions to singular problems: from special functions to spherical accretion</title>

Abstract: Singular regular points often arise in differential equations describing physical phenomena such as fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and gravitation. Traditional numerical techniques often fail or become unstable near these points, requiring the use of semi-analytical tools, such as series expansions and perturbative methods, in combination with numerical algorithms; or to invoke more sophisticated methods. In this work, we take an alternative route and leverage the power of machine learning to exploit Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a modern approach to solving differential equations with singular points. PINNs utilize deep learning architectures to approximate solutions by embedding the differential equations into the loss function of the neural network. We discuss the advantages of PINNs in handling singularities, particularly their ability to bypass traditional grid-based methods and provide smooth approximations across irregular regions. Techniques for enhancing the accuracy of PINNs near singular points, such as adaptive loss weighting, are used in order to achieve high efficiency in the training of the network. We exemplify our results by studying four differential equations of interest in mathematics and gravitation -- the Legendre equation, the hypergeometric equation, the solution for black hole space-times in theories of Lorentz violating gravity, and the spherical accretion of a perfect fluid in a Schwarzschild geometry.</description>

      <title>Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems: A compositional electro-magneto hydrodynamics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics plays a crucial role in various multiphysics applications, including energy systems, electronics cooling, and biomedical engineering. Developing computational models for complex coupled systems can be challenging and time-consuming. In particular, ensuring the consistent integration of models from diverse physical domains requires meticulous attention. Even if the coupling of specialized simulation tools based on different formalisms were practically feasible, the growing demand to combine first-principles-based modeling with scientific machine learning necessitates an integrated high-level approach to model specification. Considering the example of electro-magneto hydrodynamics (on a fixed spatial domain and with linear polarization and magnetization), this article demonstrates how relatively complex models can be hierarchically composed from simpler parts by means of a formal language for multiphysics modeling. The Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems (EPHS) modeling language features a simple graphical syntax for expressing the energy-based interconnection of subsystems. This reduces cognitive load and facilitates communication, especially in multidisciplinary environments. As the example demonstrates, existing models can be easily integrated as subsystems of new models. Specifically, the ideal fluid model is used as a subsystem of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier fluid model, which in turn is used as a subsystem of the electro-magneto hydrodynamics model. The compositional approach makes it nearly trivial to encapsulate, reuse, and swap out (parts of) models. Moreover, structural properties of EPHS models guarantee fundamental properties of thermodynamic systems, such as conservation of energy, non-negative entropy production, and Onsager reciprocal relations.</description>

      <title>Investigation of shock-shock interaction in hypersonic rarefied flow using direct simulation Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rarefied flows encountered by the hypersonic vehicles in their high-altitude flights call for investigations coupling the shock-shock interaction and the rarefied-gas effect. An in-house direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) solver is employed to simulate a series of hypersonic air flows over a wedge-cylinder configuration at the freestream Mach number of 10. The DSMC simulations cover 15 different Knudsen numbers, spanning from 0.006688 to 0.6688. At the lowest Knudsen number, the numerical results are validated by the corresponding wind-tunnel experiment, and demonstrate the features of an Edney type IV shock-shock interaction, including the type IV wave pattern, the supersonic jet impingement, the augmentations of surface shear stress, pressure and heat flux, as well as the shifts in the angular positions of the peak shear stress, pressure and heat flux over the cylinder surface. In ascending order of Knudsen number, the overviews and details of the flow fields with and without shock-shock interaction, as well as the distributions of the shear stress, pressure and heat flux over the cylinder surface are displayed and analyzed. The increase of flow rarefaction continuously alters the flow pattern of the shock-shock interaction, in which the wave system gradually losses the abilities to deflect the streamlines or to concentrate the energy in the flow. As the flow becomes more rarefied, the shock-shock interaction will result in smaller augmentation factors and less angular shifts of the peak aerodynamic/aerothermal loads. At the highest Knudsen number in this study, the augmentation factors for skin friction and heat flux are found to be less than unity. The existence/vanishment of the supersonic jet and its position relative to the cylinder account for the distribution characteristics of aerodynamic/aerothermal loads over the cylinder surface.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving parametric finite element method for solid-state dewetting on curved substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional sharp-interface model for solid-state dewetting of thin films with anisotropic surface energies on curved substrates, where the film/vapor interface and substrate surface are represented by an evolving and a static curve, respectively. The model is governed by the anisotropic surface diffusion for the evolving curve, with appropriate boundary conditions at the contact points where the two curves meet. The continuum model obeys an energy decay law and preserves the enclosed area between the two curves. We introduce an arclength parameterization for the substrate curve, which plays a crucial role in a structure-preserving approximation as it straightens the curved substrate and tracks length changes between contact points. Based on this insight, we introduce a symmetrized weak formulation which leads to an unconditional energy stable parametric approximation in terms of the discrete energy. We also provide an error estimate of the enclosed area, which depends on the substrate profile and can be zero in the case of a flat substrate. Furthermore, we introduce a correction to the discrete normals to enable an exact area preservation for general curved substrates. The resulting nonlinear system is efficiently solved using a hybrid iterative algorithm which combines both Picard and Newton's methods. Numerical results are presented to show the robustness and good properties of the introduced method for simulating solid-state dewetting on various curved substrates.</description>

      <title>High-directivity multi-level beam switching with single-gate tunable metasurfaces based on graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for ultra-fast telecommunications, autonomous driving, and futuristic technologies highlights the crucial role of active beam steering at the nanoscale. This is essential for applications like LiDAR, beam-forming, and holographic displays, especially as devices reduce in form-factor. Although device with active beam switching capability is a potential candidate for realizing those applications, there have been only a few works to realize beam switching in reconfigurable metasurfaces with active tuning materials. In this paper, we theoretically present a multi-level beam-switching dielectric metasurface with a graphene layer for active tuning, addressing challenges associated with achieving high directivity and diffraction efficiency, and doing so while using a single-gate setup. For two-level switching, the directivities reached above 95%, and the diffraction efficiencies were near 50% at the operation wavelength ${\lambda}_0$ = 8 ${\mu}$m. Through quasi-normal mode expansion, we illustrate the physics of the beam switching metasurface inverse-designed by the adjoint method, highlighting the role of resonant modes and their response to charge carrier tuning. Under the same design scheme, we design and report characteristics of a three-level and four-level beam switching device, suggesting a possibility of generalizing to multi-level beam switching.</description>

      <title>First-passage times to a fractal boundary: local persistence exponent and its log-periodic oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the statistics of the first-passage time (FPT) to a fractal self-similar boundary of the Koch snowflake. When the starting position is fixed near the absorbing boundary, the FPT distribution exhibits an apparent power-law decay over a broad range of timescales, culminated by an exponential cut-off. By extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we compute the local persistence exponent of the survival probability and reveal its log-periodic oscillations in time due to self-similarity of the boundary. The effect of the starting point onto this behavior is analyzed in depth. Theoretical bounds on the survival probability are derived from the analysis of diffusion in a circular sector. Physical rationales for the refined structure of the survival probability are presented.</description>

      <title>Learning Stochastic Dynamics from Snapshots through Regularized Unbalanced Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing dynamics using samples from sparsely time-resolved snapshots is an important problem in both natural sciences and machine learning. Here, we introduce a new deep learning approach for solving regularized unbalanced optimal transport (RUOT) and inferring continuous unbalanced stochastic dynamics from observed snapshots. Based on the RUOT form, our method models these dynamics without requiring prior knowledge of growth and death processes or additional information, allowing them to be learnt directly from data. Theoretically, we explore the connections between the RUOT and Schr\"odinger bridge problem and discuss the key challenges and potential solutions. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with a synthetic gene regulatory network. Compared with other methods, our approach accurately identifies growth and transition patterns, eliminates false transitions, and constructs the Waddington developmental landscape.</description>

      <title>A gradient flow model for ground state calculations in Wigner formalism based on density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a gradient flow model is proposed for conducting ground state calculations in Wigner formalism of many-body system in the framework of density functional theory. More specifically, an energy functional for the ground state in Wigner formalism is proposed to provide a new perspective for ground state calculations of the Wigner function. Employing density functional theory, a gradient flow model is designed based on the energy functional to obtain the ground state Wigner function representing the whole many-body system. Subsequently, an efficient algorithm is developed using the operator splitting method and the Fourier spectral collocation method, whose numerical complexity of single iteration is $O(n_{\rm DoF}\log n_{\rm DoF})$. Numerical experiments demonstrate the anticipated accuracy, encompassing the one-dimensional system with up to $2^{21}$ particles and the three-dimensional system with defect, showcasing the potential of our approach to large-scale simulations and computations of systems with defect.</description>

      <title>Statistics of drops generated from ensembles of randomly corrugated ligaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.16192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.16192v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The size of drops generated by the capillary-driven disintegration of liquid ligaments plays a fundamental role in several important natural phenomena, ranging from heat and mass transfer at the ocean-atmosphere interface to pathogen transmission. The inherent non-linearity of the equations governing the ligament destabilization leads to significant differences in the resulting drop sizes, owing to small fluctuations in the myriad initial conditions. Previous experiments and simulations reveal a variety of drop size distributions, corresponding to competing underlying physical interpretations. Here, we perform numerical simulations of individual ligaments, the deterministic breakup of which is triggered by random initial surface corrugations. The simulations are grouped in a large ensemble, each corresponding to a random initial configuration. The resulting probability distributions reveal three stable drop sizes, generated via a sequence of two distinct stages of breakup. Four different distributions are tested, volume-based Poisson, Gaussian, Gamma and Log-Normal. Depending on the time, range of droplet sizes and criteria for success, each distribution has successes and failures. However the Log-Normal distribution roughly describes the data when fitting both the primary peak and the tail of the distribution while the number of droplets generated is the highest, while the Gamma and Log-Normal distributions perform equally well when fitting the tail. The study demonstrates a precisely controllable and reproducible framework, which can be employed to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the polydispersity of drop sizes found in complex fluid fragmentation scenarios.</description>

      <title>From Density Response to Energy Functionals and Back: An ab initio perspective on Matter Under Extreme Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy functionals serve as the basis for different models and methods in quantum and classical many-particle physics. Arguably, one of the most successful and widely used approaches in material science at both ambient and extreme conditions is density functional theory (DFT). Various flavors of DFT methods are being actively used to study material properties at extreme conditions, such as in warm dense matter, dense plasmas, and nuclear physics applications. In this review, we focus on the warm dense matter regime, which occurs in the core of giant planets and stellar atmospheres, and as a transient state in inertial confinement fusion experiments. We discuss the connection between linear density response functions and free energy functionals as well as the utility of the linear response formalism for the construction of advanced functionals. As a new result, we derive the stiffness theorem linking the change in the intrinsic free energy to the density response properties of electrons. We review and summarize recent works that assess various exchange-correlation (XC) functionals for an inhomogeneous electron gas that is perturbed by a harmonic external field and for warm dense hydrogen using exact path integral quantum Monte Carlo data as an unassailable benchmark. This constitutes a valuable guide for selecting an appropriate XC functional for DFT calculations in the context of investigating the inhomogeneous electronic structure of warm dense matter. We stress that correctly simulating the strongly perturbed electron gas necessitates the correct UEG limit of the XC and non-interacting free-energy functionals.</description>

      <title>Dissipative split-charge formalism: Ohm's law, Nyquist noise, and non-contact friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The split-charge equilibration method is extended to describe dissipative charge transfer similarly as the Drude model, whereby the generic frequency-dependent dielectric permitivitties or conductivities of dielectrics and metals can be mimicked. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, a resistor-capacitor circuit is simulated using an all-atom representation for resistor and capacitor. The simulated dynamics reproduce the expected charging process and Nyquist noise, the latter resulting from the thermal voltages acting on individual split charges. The method bears promise to model friction caused by the motion of charged particles past metallic or highly polarizable media.</description>
