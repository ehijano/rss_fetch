      <title>Real-time, chirped-pulse heterodyne detection at room-temperature with 100GHz 3dB-bandwidth mid-infrared quantum-well photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to intrinsically short electronic relaxation on the ps time scale, III-V semiconductor unipolar devices are ideal candidates for ultrahigh-speed operation at mid-infrared frequencies. In this work, antenna-coupled, GaAs-based multi quantum-well photodetectors operating in the 10-11um range are demonstrated, with a responsivity of 0.3A/W and a 3dB-cutoff bandwidth of 100GHz at room-temperature. The frequency response is measured up to 220GHz: beyond 100GHz we find a roll-off dominated by the 2.5 ps-long recombination time of the photo-excited electrons. The potential of the detectors is illustrated by setting up an experiment where the time dependent emission frequency of a quantum cascade laser operated in pulsed mode is measured electronically and in real-time, over a frequency range &gt;60GHz. By exploiting broadband electronics, and thanks to its high signal-to-noise ratio, this technique allows the acquisition, in a single-shot, of frequency-calibrated, mid-infrared molecular spectra spanning up to 100GHz and beyond, which is particularly attractive for fast, active remote sensing applications in fields such as environmental or combustion monitoring.</description>

      <title>Design,fabrication and characterization of 8x9 n-type silicon pad array for sampling calorimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports the development and testing of n-type silicon pad array detectors targeted for the Forward Calorimeter (FoCal) detector, which is an upgrade of the ALICE detector at CERN, scheduled for data taking in Run~4~(2029-2034). The FoCal detector includes hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters, with the latter made of tungsten absorber layers and granular silicon pad arrays read out using the High Granularity Calorimeter Readout Chip~(HGCROC). This paper covers the Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) simulations, the fabrication process, current versus voltage (IV) and capacitance versus voltage (CV) measurements, test results with a blue LED and $^{90}$Sr beta source, and neutron radiation hardness tests. IV measurements for the detector showed that 90\% of the pads had leakage current below 10~nA at full depletion voltage. Simulations predicted a breakdown voltage of 1000~V and practical tests confirmed stable operation up to 500~V without breakdown. CV measurements in the data and the simulations gave a full depletion voltage of around 50~V at a capacitance of 35~pF. LED tests verified that all detector pads responded correctly. Additionally, the 1$\times$1 cm$^2$ pads were also tested with the neutron radiations at a fluence of $5\times10^{13}$ 1~MeV~n$_{eq}$/cm$^2$.</description>

      <title>Towards a sub-kelvin cryogenic Fabry-Perot silicon cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the development of a sub-kelvin, single-crystal silicon Fabry-Perot cavity. Operating such a cavity below 1~K should reduce the thermal noise limit of the cavity, and by this way address the current limitations of ultrastable lasers. To further decrease mechanical losses, mirrors with silicon substrates and crystalline coatings are optically contacted to the spacer, resulting in a room-temperature finesse of 220,000. To operate our cavity at sub-kelvin temperatures, we use a dilution refrigerator able to reach temperatures down to 10 mK. We have designed a mechanical mount to house our cavity in such a cryostat, with optimized heat transfer that will decrease the cooldown time for temperatures below 1~K. The estimated thermal noise is projected to be $\sim 7{\times}10^{-19}$ at 100~mK. However, silicon cavities with crystalline mirror coatings at cryogenic temperatures have shown birefringence correlated frequency fluctuations as well as unknown additional noise mechanisms \cite{yu2023, kedar2023}. We have measured a room-temperature TEM$_{00}$ birefringent mode splitting of about 250 kHz. Understanding and measuring these noise mechanisms will be a key to attaining fractional frequency stabilities beyond state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning of Structural Morphology Imaged by Scanning X-ray Diffraction Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning X-ray nanodiffraction microscopy is a powerful technique for spatially resolving nanoscale structural morphologies by diffraction contrast. One of the critical challenges in experimental nanodiffraction data analysis is posed by the convergence angle of nanoscale focusing optics which creates simultaneous dependency of the far-field scattering data on three independent components of the local strain tensor - corresponding to dilation and two potential rigid body rotations of the unit cell. All three components are in principle resolvable through a spatially mapped sample tilt series however traditional data analysis is computationally expensive and prone to artifacts. In this study, we implement NanobeamNN, a convolutional neural network specifically tailored to the analysis of scanning probe X-ray microscopy data. NanobeamNN learns lattice strain and rotation angles from simulated diffraction of a focused X-ray nanobeam by an epitaxial thin film and can directly make reasonable predictions on experimental data without the need for additional fine-tuning. We demonstrate that this approach represents a significant advancement in computational speed over conventional methods, as well as a potential improvement in accuracy over the current standard.</description>

      <title>Wideband tunable cavity development for axion dark matter searches using a piezoelectric motor in combination with gears</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most search experiments sensitive to quantum chromodynamics axion dark matter benefit from microwave cavities, as electromagnetic resonators, that enhance the detected axion signal power and thus the experimental sensitivity drastically. As the possible axion mass spans multiple orders of magnitude, microwave cavities must be tunable and it is desirable for the cavity to have a tunable frequency range that is as wide as possible. Since the tunable frequency range generally increases as the dimension of the conductor tuning rod increases for a given cylindrical conductor cavity system, we developed a cavity system with a large dimensional tuning rod in order to increase this. We, for the first time, employed not only a piezoelectric motor, but also gears to drive a large and accordingly heavy tuning rod, where such a combination to increase driving power can be adopted for extreme environments as is the case for axion dark matter experiments: cryogenic, high-magnetic-field, and high vacuum. Thanks to such higher power derived from the piezoelectric motor and gear combination, we realized a wideband tunable cavity whose frequency range is about 42\% of the central resonant frequency of the cavity, without sacrificing the experimental sensitivity too much.</description>

      <title>Single MoS2-flake as a high TCR non-cryogenic bolometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of a bolometer can be tuned by modifying the thermal conductance of an absorbing materials since they sense radiations via the temperature change in the absorber. However, the thermal conductance of the absorber can be reduced by engineering the appropriate thermal isolation, which can be an ultimate solution towards making a highly sensitive thermal detector. Here, we have developed an atomically thin 2D bolometer detector made up of a mechanically transferred suspended multilayer-MoS2 flake, eliminating the use of challenging thin-film fabrication process. The strength of our detector lies on the two factors: its large surface-to-volume window to absorb the radiations; the suspended configuration which prevents the heat dissipation through the substrate and therefore reduces the thermal conductance. The bolometric response of the detector is tested in both modes, via the photoresponse and the thermal response. The prototype is found to exhibit a very high TCR ~ -9.5%/K with the least achievable thermal noise-equivalent power (NEP) ~ 0.61 pWHz-1/2, in ambient conditions at 328 K.</description>

      <title>Josephson Parametric Amplifier based Quantum Noise Limited Amplifier Development for Axion Search Experiments in CAPP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the development of flux-driven Josephson Parametric Amplifiers (JPAs) as Quantum Noise Limited Amplifier for axion search experiments conducted at the Center for Axion and Precision Physics Research (CAPP) of the Institute for Basic Science. It focuses on the characterization, and optimization of JPAs, which are crucial for achieving the highest sensitivity in axion particle detection. We discuss various characterization techniques, methods for improving bandwidth, and the attainment of ultra-low noise temperatures. JPAs have emerged as indispensable tools in CAPPs axion search endeavors, playing a significant role in advancing our understanding of fundamental physics and unraveling the mysteries of the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a modular silicon photomultiplier camera to detect Earth-skimming PeV to EeV tau neutrinos with the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique. We built two cameras, a 256-pixel camera with S14161-6050HS SiPMs for the Trinity Demonstrator located on Frisco Peak, Utah, and a 512-pixel camera with S14521-6050AN SiPMs for the EUSO-SPB2 Cherenkov Telescope. The front-end electronics are based on the eMUSIC ASIC, and the camera signals are sampled and digitized with the 100MS/s and 12-bit AGET system. Both cameras are liquid-cooled. We detail the camera concept and the results from characterizing the SiPMs, bench testing, and calibrating the two cameras.</description>

      <title>On the application of components manufactured with stereolithographic 3D printing in high vacuum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a method for using stereolithographic (SLA) additive manufacturing to rapidly and cheaply prototype components for use in high-vacuum environments. We demonstrate the primary vacuum contaminant from freshly printed SLA plastics is water with no evidence of polymers out-gassing from the material and thus the vacuum performance can be controlled with simple treatments which do not involve surface sealing. An unbaked vacuum system containing SLA printed parts achieved 1.9e-8 mbar base pressure whilst retaining structural integrity and manufacturing accuracy. Preliminary results indicate that our method can be extended to achieve ultrahigh-vacuum compatibility by baking at higher temperatures. We further report on the effect of atmospheric exposure to components and present evidence to suggest that re-wetting occurs exclusively in the component skin layer, by showing that the bulk mass changes of the material is irreversible on the timescale investigated (&lt; 2 weeks).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The PROSPECT-I detector has several features that enable measurement of the direction of a compact neutrino source. In this paper, a detailed report on the directional measurements made on electron antineutrinos emitted from the High Flux Isotope Reactor is presented. With an estimated true neutrino (reactor to detector) direction of $\phi = 40.8\unicode{xB0} \pm 0.7\unicode{xB0}$ and $\theta = 98.6\unicode{xB0} \pm 0.4\unicode{xB0}$, the PROSPECT-I detector is able to reconstruct an average neutrino direction of $\phi = 39.4\unicode{xB0} \pm 2.9\unicode{xB0}$ and $\theta = 97.6\unicode{xB0} \pm 1.6\unicode{xB0}$. This measurement is made with approximately 48000 Inverse Beta Decay signal events and is the most precise directional reconstruction of reactor antineutrinos to date.</description>

      <title>Additive manufacturing of a 3D-segmented plastic scintillator detector for tracking and calorimetry of elementary particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plastic-scintillator detectors are devices used for the detection of elementary particles. They provide good particle identification with excellent time resolution, whilst being inexpensive due to the affordability of plastic materials. Particle tracking is achieved by segmenting the scintillator into smaller optically-isolated 3D granular sub-structures which require the integration of multiple types of plastic materials as well as several thousands of tiny holes through a compact volume of several cubic meters. Future particle detectors necessitate larger volumes, possibly with even finer segmentation. However, manufacturing such geometries with current production strategies is challenging, as they involve time-consuming and costly fabrication processes, followed by the assembly of millions of individual parts. The difficulty in scaling up such a workflow can be addressed by additive manufacturing, enabling the construction of complex, monolithic geometries in a single operation. This article presents the fabrication of the first additive manufactured plastic scintillator detector, capable of 3D tracking elementary particles and measuring their stopping power. Its performance is comparable to the state of the art of plastic scintillator detectors. This work paves the way towards a new feasible, time and cost-effective process for the production of future plastic-based scintillator detectors, regardless their size and difficulty in geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The last decade has shown the great potential that X-ray Free Electron Lasers have to study High Energy Density matter. Experiments at FELs have made significant breakthroughs in Shock Physics and Dynamic Diffraction, Dense Plasma Physics and Warm Dense Matter Science, using techniques such as isochoric heating, inelastic scattering, small angle scattering and diffraction. In addition, and complementary to these techniques, the coherent properties of the beam can be used to image HED samples with high precision. We present new imaging diagnostics and techniques developed at the MEC instrument at LCLS over the last few years. We briefly show result of a previously used Phase Contrast Imaging setup, where the X-ray beam propagates from the target to a camera some distance away revealing its phase, as well as from a new direct imaging approach where the target is re-imaged on the camera with 300nm resolution. Last, we show a new Talbot Phase Imaging method that allows for both measuring the phase and intensity changes of the x-rays introduced by a target with sub-micron resolution.</description>

      <title>Detection of gravitational waves in circular particle accelerators II. Response analysis and parameter estimation using synthetic data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate the response of a Storage Ring Gravitational-Wave Observatory (SRGO) to astrophysical millihertz (mHz) gravitational waves (GWs), numerically obtaining its sensitivity curve and optimal choices for some controllable experiment parameters. We also generate synthetic noisy GW data and use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to perform parameter estimation of the source properties and their degeneracies. We show that a single SRGO could potentially localize the GW source in the sky using Earth's rotation. We also study the source sky localization area, mass and distance estimation errors as functions of noise, data sampling rate, and observing time. Finally, we discuss, along with its implications, the capacity of an SRGO to detect and constrain the parameters of millihertz GW events.</description>

      <title>The Neural Network First-Level Hardware Track Trigger of the Belle II Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the principles and performance of the first-level ("L1") hardware track trigger of Belle II, based on neural networks. The networks use as input the results from the standard Belle II trigger, which provides "2D" track candidates in the plane transverse to the electron-positron beams. The networks then provide estimates for the origin of the 2D track candidates in direction of the colliding beams ("$z$-vertex"), as well as their polar emission angles $\theta$. Given the $z$-vertices of the "neural" tracks allows identifying events coming from the collision region ($z \approx 0$), and suppressing the overwhelming background from outside by a suitable cut $d$. Requiring $|z| &lt; d$ for at least one neural track in an event with two or more 2D candidates will set an L1 trigger. The networks also enable a minimum bias trigger, requiring a single 2D track candidate validated by a neural track with a momentum larger than 0.7 GeV in addition to the $|z|$ condition. The momentum of the neural track is derived with the help of the polar angle $\theta$.</description>
