      <title>Giant microwave absorption in the vortex lattice in $s$-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study microwave absorption in superconductors in the presence of a vortex lattice. We show that in addition to the conventional absorption mechanism associated with the vortex core motion, there is another mechanism of microwave absorption, which is caused by the time-dependence of the quasiparticle density of states outside the vortex cores. This mechanism exists even in the absence of vortex motion and provides the dominant contribution to microwave absorption in a broad interval of physical parameters. At low frequencies, the dissipative part of the microwave conductivity $\sigma(\omega)$ is proportional to the inelastic relaxation time, $\tau_{\mathrm{in}}$, which is typically much larger than the elastic relaxation time, $\tau_{\mathrm{el}}$. At high frequencies $\sigma(\omega)$ is proportional to the quasiparticle diffusion time across the inter-vortex distance, $\tau_{\mathrm D}$, which is still larger than $\tau_{\mathrm{el}}$.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent Diode Effect in Helical Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the generalities of the supercurrent diode effect. As an illustrative example, we examine a model of a two-dimensional superconductor with Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling under an in-plane magnetic field and in the clean limit, which realizes a helical phase. First, we utilize Ginzburg-Landau phenomenology to derive a general formula for the diode efficiency. This is achieved by incorporating higher gradient terms in the Lifshitz invariants, which are responsible for the nonreciprocal superflow. Subsequently, we validate these results through microscopic diagrammatic computation and further estimate correction terms arising from interband pairing correlations. We provide a detailed comparison to prior investigations of this problem conducted within the framework of the quasiclassical approximation based on the Eilenberger equation.</description>

      <title>Broken time reversal symmetry vestigial state for a two-component superconductor in two spatial dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the vestigial phase with broken time-reversal symmetry above the superconducting transition temperature of a two-component superconductor in two spatial dimensions. We show that, in contrast to 3D, a vestigial phase is in general allowed within Ginzburg-Landau theory. The vestigial phase occupies an increasing temperature region if the parameters in the Ginzburg-Landau theory gives a larger energy difference between the broken time reversal symmetry phase and the other ordered phase.</description>

      <title>Percolative supercurrent in superconductor--ferromagnetic-insulator bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report tunneling spectroscopy and transport measurements in superconducting Al and ferromagnetic-insulator EuS bilayers. The samples display remanent spin-splitting, roughly half the superconducting gap, and supercurrent transport above the average paramagnetic limit. We interpret this behavior as arising from the interplay between two characteristic length scales: the superconducting coherence length, $\xi$, and the magnetic domain size, $d$. By comparing experimental results to a theoretical model, we find $\xi/d \approx 10$. In this regime, spin-averaging across the micromagnetic configuration can locally suppress superconductivity, resulting in percolative supercurrent flow.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity with high upper critical field in an equiatomic high entropy alloy Sc-V-Ti-Hf-Nb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy alloy (HEA) superconductors have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional low-temperature mechanical and superconducting properties. We report the synthesis and thorough characterization of an equiatomic HEA superconductor with the composition Sc$_{0.20}$V$_{0.20}$Ti$_{0.20}$Hf$_{0.20}$Nb$_{0.20}$, crystallizing in a body-centered cubic crystal structure (Im3$\bar{m}$). Our investigation, using magnetization, transport, and heat capacity measurements, reveals the presence of weakly coupled, fully gapped superconductivity with a transition temperature of 4.17(3) K and the upper critical field exceeding the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The metallic nature, combined with a high upper critical field, positions it as a promising candidate for applications in superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Relations between normal state nonreciprocal transport and the superconducting diode effect in the trivial and topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal transport effects can occur in the normal state of conductors and in superconductors when both inversion and time-reversal symmetry are broken. Here, we consider systems where magnetochiral anisotropy (MCA) of the energy spectrum due to an externally applied magnetic field results in a rectification effect in the normal state and a superconducting (SC) diode effect when the system is proximitised by a superconductor. Focussing on nanowire systems, we obtain analytic expressions for both normal state rectification and SC diode effects that reveal the commonalities - as well as differences - between these two phenomena. Furthermore, we consider the nanowire brought into an (almost) helical state in the normal phase or a topological superconducting phase when proximitised. In both cases this reveals that the topology of the system considerably modifies its nonreciprocal transport properties. Our results provide new insights into how to determine the origin of nonreciprocal effects and further evince the strong connection of nonreciprocal transport with the topological properties of a system.</description>

      <title>Engineering underdoped CuO$_2$ nanoribbons in nm-thick $a$-axis YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.04541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In underdoped cuprate high $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ superconductors, various local orders and symmetry breaking states, in addition to superconductivity, reside in the CuO$_2$ planes. The confinement of the CuO$_2$ planes can therefore play a fundamental role in modifying the hierarchy between the various orders and their intertwining with superconductivity. Here we present the growth of $a$-axis oriented YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films, spanning the whole underdoped side of the phase diagram. In these samples, the CuO$_2$ planes are confined by the film thickness, effectively forming unit-cell-thick nanoribbons. The unidirectional confinement at the nanoscale enhances the in-plane anisotropy of the films. By X-ray diffraction and resistance vs temperature measurements, we have discovered the suppression of the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition at low dopings, and a very high anisotropy of the normal state resistance in the $b$-$c$ plane, the latter being connected to a weak coupling between adjacent CuO$_2$ nanoribbons. These findings show that the samples we have grown represent a novel system, different from the bulk, where future experiments can possibly shed light on the rich and mysterious physics occurring within the CuO$_2$ planes.</description>

      <title>Crossed Andreev reflection in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a scattering phenomenon occurring in a superconductor (SC) connected to two metallic leads, where an incident electron on one side of the SC emerges on the opposite side as a hole. Despite its significance, CAR detection is often impeded by the prevalent electron tunneling (ET), wherein the incident electron exits on the opposing side as an electron. One approach to augment CAR over ET involves employing two antiparallel ferromagnets across the SC. However, this method is constrained by the low polarization in ferromagnets and necessitates the application of a magnetic field. Altermagnets (AMs) present a promising avenue for detecting and enhancing CAR due to their distinct Fermi surfaces for the two spins. Here, we propose a configuration utilizing two AMs rotated by $90^{\circ}$ with respect to each other on either side of an SC to enhance CAR. We calculate local and nonlocal conductivities across the AM-SC-AM junction using the Landauer-B\"uttiker scattering approach. Our findings reveal that in the strong phase of AMs, CAR overwhelmingly dominates nonlocal transport. In the weak phase, CAR can exhibit significant enhancement for larger values of the altermagnetic parameter compared to the scenario where AMs are in the normal metallic phase. As a function of the length of the SC, the conductivities exhibit oscillations reminiscent of Fabry-P\'erot interference.</description>
