      <title>Model-free Rayleigh weight from x-ray Thomson scattering measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) has emerged as a powerful tool for the diagnostics of matter under extreme conditions. In principle, it gives one access to important system parameters such as the temperature, density, and ionization state, but the interpretation of the measured XRTS intensity usually relies on theoretical models and approximations. In this work, we show that it is possible to extract the Rayleigh weight -- a key property that describes the electronic localization around the ions -- directly from the experimental data without the need for any model calculations or simulations. As a practical application, we consider an experimental measurement of strongly compressed Be at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) [D\"oppner \emph{et al.}, \textit{Nature} \textbf{618}, 270-275 (2023)]. In addition to being interesting in their own right, our results will open up new avenues for diagnostics from \emph{ab initio} simulations, help to further constrain existing chemical models, and constitute a rigorous benchmark for theory and simulations.</description>

      <title>FreeMHD: validation and verification of the open-source, multi-domain, multi-phase solver for electrically conductive flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme heat fluxes in the divertor region of tokamaks may require an alternative to solid plasma-facing components, for the extraction of heat and the protection of the surrounding walls. Flowing liquid metals are proposed as an alternative, but raise additional challenges that require investigation and numerical simulations. Free surface designs are desirable for plasma-facing components (PFCs), but steady flow profiles and surface stability must be ensured to limit undesirable interactions with the plasma. Previous studies have mainly used steady-state, 2D, or simplified models for internal flows and have not been able to adequately model free-surface liquid metal (LM) experiments. Therefore, FreeMHD has been recently developed as an open-source magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) solver for free-surface electrically conductive flows subject to a strong external magnetic field. The FreeMHD solver computes incompressible free-surface flows with multi-region coupling for the investigation of MHD phenomena involving fluid and solid domains. The model utilizes the finite-volume OpenFOAM framework under the low magnetic Reynolds number approximation. FreeMHD is validated using analytical solutions for the velocity profiles of closed channel flows with various Hartmann numbers and wall conductance ratios. Next, experimental measurements are then used to verify FreeMHD, through a series of cases involving dam breaking, 3D magnetic fields, and free-surface LM flows. These results demonstrate that FreeMHD is a reliable tool for the design of LM systems under free surface conditions at the reactor scale. Furthermore, it is flexible, computationally inexpensive, and can be used to solve fully 3D transient MHD flows.</description>

      <title>Entangled two-photon absorption for the continuous generation of excited state populations in plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entangled two-photon absorption (ETPA) may be a viable technique to continuously drive an excited state population in plasma for high-bandwidth spectroscopy measurements of localized plasma turbulence or impurity density. Classical two-photon absorption commonly requires a high-intensity, pulsed laser, but entangled photons with short entanglement time and high time correlation may allow for ETPA using a lower intensity, continuous-wave laser. Notably, ETPA with non-collinear entangled photon generation allows for cross-beam spatial localization of the absorption or fluorescence signal using a single laser source. Entangled photon generation, the ETPA cross-section, candidate transitions for an Ar-II species, and plans for a proof-of-principle measurement in a helicon plasma are discussed.</description>

      <title>Real-time observation of frustrated ultrafast recovery from ionisation in nanostructured SiO2 using laser driven accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionising radiation interactions in matter can trigger a cascade of processes that underpin long-lived damage in the medium. To date, however, a lack of suitable methodologies has precluded our ability to understand the role that material nanostructure plays in this cascade. Here, we use transient photoabsorption to track the lifetime of free electrons (t_c) in bulk and nanostructured SiO2 (aerogel) irradiated by picosecond-scale (10^-12 s) bursts of X-rays and protons from a laser-driven accelerator. Optical streaking reveals a sharp increase in t_c from &lt; 1 ps to &gt; 50 ps over a narrow average density (p_av) range spanning the expected phonon-fracton crossover in aerogels. Numerical modelling suggests that this discontinuity can be understood by a quenching of rapid, phonon-assisted recovery in irradiated nanostructured SiO_2. This is shown to lead to an extended period of enhanced energy density in the excited electron population. Overall, these results open a direct route to tracking how low-level processes in complex systems can underpin macroscopically observed phenomena and, importantly, the conditions that permit them to emerge.</description>

      <title>Towards the Use of Anderson Acceleration in Coupled Transport-Gyrokinetic Turbulence Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the behavior of a magnetically confined fusion plasma over long time periods requires methods that can bridge the difference between transport and turbulent time scales. The nonlinear transport solver, Tango, enables simulations of very long times, in particular to steady state, by advancing each process independently with different time step sizes and couples them through a relaxed iteration scheme. We examine the use of Anderson Acceleration (AA) to reduce the total number of coupling iterations required by interfacing Tango with the AA implementation, including several extensions to AA, provided by the KINSOL nonlinear solver package in SUNDIALS. The ability to easily enable and adjust algorithmic options through KINSOL allows for rapid experimentation to evaluate different approaches with minimal effort. Additionally, we leverage the GPTune library to automate the optimization of algorithmic parameters within KINSOL. We show that AA can enable faster convergence in stiff and very stiff tests cases without noise present and in all cases, including with noisy fluxes, increases robustness and reduces sensitivity to the choice of relaxation strength.</description>

      <title>A conservative, implicit solver for 0D-2V multi-species nonlinear Fokker-Planck collision equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present an optimal implicit algorithm specifically designed to accurately solve the multi-species nonlinear 0D-2V axisymmetric Fokker-Planck-Rosenbluth (FPR) collision equation while preserving mass, momentum, and energy. Our approach relies on the utilization of nonlinear Shkarofsky's formula of FPR (FPRS) collision operator in terms of Legendre polynomial expansions. The key innovation lies in the introduction of a new function named King (Eq.(54)) with the adoption of the Legendre polynomial expansion for the angular direction and King function expansion for the velocity axis direction. The Legendre polynomial expansion will converge exponentially and the King method, a moment convergence algorithm, could ensure the conservation with high precision in discrete form. Additionally, a post-step projection to manifolds is employed to exactly enforce symmetries of the collision operators. Through solving several typical problems across various nonequilibrium configurations, we demonstrate the superior performance and high accuracy of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Approaching the Lower Temporal Limit of Laser-Produced Plasma Sources for Table-Top Soft X-ray NEXAFS Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing popularity of time-resolved X-ray absorption measurements for understanding dynamics in molecular and material systems has led to many advances in table-top sources for pulsed X-rays. We report on a table top laser-produced plasma (LPP) source that can perform soft X-ray (SXR), near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) measurements using a laser source with 23 ps pulse duration. The spectrometer's key specifications, such as brilliance, resolution, and stability, are characterized against the more commonly used longer-pulse-duration LPP sources. The 23 ps laser produced approximately an order of magnitude weaker SXR flux than the 8 ns laser for a higher power density due to the smaller total energy absorbed by the plasma. The increased repetition rate and an implemented self-referencing scheme still allowed for high-resolution, synchrotron-like NEXAFS measurements of Si3N4 and TiO2 thin films with 2.5 minute acquisition times. It was observed that degradation of the gas jet nozzle led to long-term instability of the source, which can be remediated using alternative nozzle designs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of achieving higher temporal resolution in future time-resolved X-ray absorption measurements using table-top laser-produced plasma sources</description>
