      <title>Supply vs. Demand in Community-Based Fact-Checking on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fact-checking ecosystems on social media depend on the interplay between what users want checked and what contributors are willing to supply. Prior research has largely examined these forces in isolation, yet it remains unclear to what extent supply meets demand. We address this gap with an empirical analysis of a unique dataset of 1.1 million fact-checks and fact-checking requests from X's Community Notes platform between June 2024 and May 2025. We find that requests disproportionately target highly visible posts - those with more views and engagement and authored by influential accounts - whereas fact-checks are distributed more broadly across languages, sentiments, and topics. Using a quasi-experimental survival analysis, we further estimate the effect of displaying requests on subsequent note creation. Results show that requests significantly accelerate contributions from Top Writers. Altogether, our findings highlight a gap between the content that attracts requests for fact-checking and the content that ultimately receives fact-checks, while showing that user requests can steer contributors toward greater alignment. These insights carry important implications for platform governance and future research on online misinformation.</description>

      <title>Autodiscover: A reinforcement learning recommendation system for the cold-start imbalance challenge in active learning, powered by graph-aware thompson sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are fundamental to evidence-based research, but manual screening is an increasing bottleneck as scientific output grows. Screening features low prevalence of relevant studies and scarce, costly expert decisions. Traditional active learning (AL) systems help, yet typically rely on fixed query strategies for selecting the next unlabeled documents. These static strategies do not adapt over time and ignore the relational structure of scientific literature networks. This thesis introduces AutoDiscover, a framework that reframes AL as an online decision-making problem driven by an adaptive agent. Literature is modeled as a heterogeneous graph capturing relationships among documents, authors, and metadata. A Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) learns node representations, which a Discounted Thompson Sampling (DTS) agent uses to dynamically manage a portfolio of query strategies. With real-time human-in-the-loop labels, the agent balances exploration and exploitation under non-stationary review dynamics, where strategy utility changes over time. On the 26-dataset SYNERGY benchmark, AutoDiscover achieves higher screening efficiency than static AL baselines. Crucially, the agent mitigates cold start by bootstrapping discovery from minimal initial labels where static approaches fail. We also introduce TS-Insight, an open-source visual analytics dashboard to interpret, verify, and diagnose the agent's decisions. Together, these contributions accelerate SLR screening under scarce expert labels and low prevalence of relevant studies.</description>

      <title>Blockchain Technology for Public Services: A Polycentric Governance Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: National governments are increasingly adopting blockchain to enhance transparency, trust, and efficiency in public service delivery. However, evidence on how these technologies are governed across national contexts remains fragmented and overly focused on technical features. Using Polycentric Governance Theory, this study conducts a systematic review of peer-reviewed research published between 2021 and 2025 to examine blockchain-enabled public services and the institutional, organizational, and information-management factors shaping their adoption. Following PRISMA guidelines, we synthesize findings from major digital government and information systems databases to identify key application domains, including digital identity, electronic voting, procurement, and social services, and analyze the governance arrangements underpinning these initiatives. Our analysis reveals that blockchain adoption is embedded within polycentric environments characterized by distributed authority, inter-organizational coordination, and layered accountability. Rather than adopting full decentralization, governments typically utilize hybrid and permissioned designs that allow for selective decentralization alongside centralized oversight, a pattern we conceptualize as "controlled polycentricity." By reframing blockchain as a governance infrastructure that encodes rules for coordination and information-sharing, this study advances digital government theory beyond simple adoption metrics. The findings offer theoretically grounded insights for researchers and practical guidance for policymakers seeking to design and scale sustainable blockchain-enabled public services.</description>

      <title>Are Open-Weight LLMs Ready for Social Media Moderation? A Comparative Study on Bluesky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As internet access expands, so does exposure to harmful content, increasing the need for effective moderation. Research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively utilized for social media moderation tasks, including harmful content detection. While proprietary LLMs have been shown to zero-shot outperform traditional machine learning models, the out-of-the-box capability of open-weight LLMs remains an open question.
  Motivated by recent developments of reasoning LLMs, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art models: four proprietary and three open-weight. Testing with real-world posts on Bluesky, moderation decisions by Bluesky Moderation Service, and annotations by two authors, we find a considerable degree of overlap between the sensitivity (81%--97%) and specificity (91%--100%) of the open-weight LLMs and those (72%--98%, and 93%--99%) of the proprietary ones. Additionally, our analysis reveals that specificity exceeds sensitivity for rudeness detection, but the opposite holds for intolerance and threats. Lastly, we identify inter-rater agreement across human moderators and the LLMs, highlighting considerations for deploying LLMs in both platform-scale and personalized moderation contexts. These findings show open-weight LLMs can support privacy-preserving moderation on consumer-grade hardware and suggest new directions for designing moderation systems that balance community values with individual user preferences.</description>

      <title>Advancing Opinion Dynamics Modeling with Neural Diffusion-Convection-Reaction Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced opinion dynamics modeling is vital for deciphering social behavior, emphasizing its role in mitigating polarization and securing cyberspace. To synergize mechanistic interpretability with data-driven flexibility, recent studies have explored the integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for opinion modeling. Despite this promise, existing methods are tailored to incomplete priors, lacking a comprehensive physical system to integrate dynamics from local, global, and endogenous levels. Moreover, penalty-based constraints adopted in existing methods struggle to deeply encode physical priors, leading to optimization pathologies and discrepancy between latent representations and physical transparency. To this end, we offer a physical view to interpret opinion dynamics via Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system inspired by interacting particle theory. Building upon the Neural ODEs, we define the neural opinion dynamics to coordinate neural networks with physical priors, and further present the OPINN, a physics-informed neural framework for opinion dynamics modeling. Evaluated on real-world and synthetic datasets, OPINN achieves state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting, offering a promising paradigm for the nexus of cyber, physical, and social systems.</description>

      <title>Wikipedia and Grokipedia: A Comparison of Human and Generative Encyclopedias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of Wikipedia and Grokipedia to examine how generative mediation alters content selection, textual rewriting, narrative structure, and evaluative framing in encyclopedic content. We model page inclusion in Grokipedia as a function of Wikipedia page popularity, density of reference, and recent editorial activity. Inclusion is non-uniform: pages with higher visibility and greater editorial conflict in Wikipedia are more likely to appear in Grokipedia. For included pages, we distinguish between verbatim reproduction and generative rewriting. Rewriting is more frequent for pages with higher reference density and recent controversy, while highly popular pages are more often reproduced without modification. We compare editing activity across the two platforms and estimate page complexity using a fitness-complexity framework to assess whether generative mediation alters patterns of editorial participation. To assess narrative organization, we construct actor-relation networks from article texts using abstract meaning representation. Across multiple topical domains, including U.S. politics, geopolitics, and conspiracy-related narratives, narrative structure remains largely consistent between the two sources. Analysis of lead sections shows broadly correlated framing, with localized shifts in laudatory and conflict-oriented language for some topics in Grokipedia. Overall, generative systems preserve the main structural organization of encyclopedic content, while affecting how content is selected, rewritten, and framed.</description>

      <title>Higher-order adaptive behaviors outperform pairwise strategies in mitigating contagion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When exposed to a contagion phenomenon, individuals may respond to the perceived risk of infection by adopting behavioral changes, aiming to reduce their exposure or their risk of infecting others. The social cost of such adaptive behaviors and their impact on the contagion dynamics have been investigated in pairwise networks, with binary interactions driving both contagion and risk perception. However, contagion and adaptive mechanisms can also be driven by group (higher-order) interactions. Here, we consider several adaptive behaviors triggered by awareness of risk perceived through higher-order and pairwise interactions, and we compare their impact on pairwise and higher-order contagion processes. By numerical simulations and a mean-field analytic approach, we show that adaptive behaviors driven by higher-order information are more effective in limiting the spread of a contagion, than similar mechanisms based on pairwise information. Meanwhile, they also entail a lower social cost, measured as the reduction of the intensity of interactions in the population. Indeed, adaptive mechanisms based on higher-order information lead to a heterogeneous risk perception within the population, producing a higher alert on nodes with large hyperdegree (i.e., participating in many groups), on their neighborhoods, and on large groups. This in turn prevents the spreading process to exploit the properties of these nodes and groups, which tend to drive and sustain the dynamics in the absence of adaptive behaviors.</description>

      <title>Link Fraction Mixed Membership Reveals Community Diversity in Aggregated Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community detection is a critical tool for understanding the mesoscopic structure of large-scale networks. However, when applied to aggregated or coarse-grained social networks, disjoint community partitions cannot capture the diverse composition of community memberships within aggregated nodes. While existing mixed membership methods alleviate this issue, they may detect communities that are highly sensitive to the aggregation resolution, not reliably reflecting the community structure of the underlying individual-level network. This paper presents the Link Fraction Mixed Membership (LFMM) method, which computes the mixed memberships of nodes in aggregated networks. Unlike existing mixed membership methods, LFMM is consistent under aggregation. Specifically, we show that it conserves community membership sums at different scales. The method is utilized to study a population-scale social network of the Netherlands, aggregated at different resolutions. Experiments reveal variation in community membership across different geographical regions and evolution over the last decade. In particular, we show how our method identifies large urban hubs that act as the melting pots of diverse, spatially remote communities.</description>

      <title>Invisible Walls in Cities: Designing LLM Agent to Predict Urban Segregation Experience with Social Media Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04773v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding experienced segregation in urban daily life is crucial for addressing societal inequalities and fostering inclusivity. The abundance of user-generated reviews on social media encapsulates nuanced perceptions and feelings associated with different places, offering rich insights into segregation. However, leveraging this data poses significant challenges due to its vast volume, ambiguity, and confluence of diverse perspectives. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Large Language Model (LLM) agent to automate online review mining for segregation prediction. Specifically, we propose a reflective LLM coder to digest social media content into insights consistent with real-world feedback, and eventually produce a codebook capturing key dimensions that signal segregation experience, such as cultural resonance and appeal, accessibility and convenience, and community engagement and local involvement. Guided by the codebook, LLMs can generate both informative review summaries and ratings for segregation prediction. Moreover, we design a REasoning-and-EMbedding (RE'EM) framework, which combines the reasoning and embedding capabilities of language models to integrate multi-channel features for segregation prediction.
  Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our agent substantially improves prediction accuracy, with a 22.79% elevation in R$^{2}$ and a 9.33% reduction in MSE. The derived codebook is generalizable across three different cities, consistently improving prediction accuracy. Moreover, our user study confirms that the codebook-guided summaries provide cognitive gains for human participants in perceiving places of interest (POIs)' social inclusiveness. Our study marks an important step toward understanding implicit social barriers and inequalities, demonstrating the great potential of promoting social inclusiveness with Web technology.</description>

      <title>Beyond Community Notes: A Framework for Understanding and Building Crowdsourced Context Systems for Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms are increasingly adopting features that display crowdsourced context alongside posts, a technique pioneered by X's Community Notes. These systems -- which we term Crowdsourced Context Systems (CCS) -- have the potential to reshape the information ecosystem as major platforms embrace them as alternatives to professional fact-checking. To understand the features and implications of these systems, we conduct a systematic literature review of existing CCS research (n=56) and analyze real-world CCS implementations. Based on our analysis, we develop a framework with two components. First, we present a theoretical model to conceptualize and define CCS. Second, we identify a design space encompassing six aspects: participation, inputs, curation, presentation, platform treatment, and transparency. We also surface normative implications of different CCS design and implementation choices. Our work integrates theoretical, design, and ethical perspectives to establish a foundation for future human-centered research on Crowdsourced Context Systems.</description>
