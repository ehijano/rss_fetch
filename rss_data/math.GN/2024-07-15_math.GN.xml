      <title>On the class of NY compact spaces of finitely supported elements and related classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a compact space $K$ embeds into a $\sigma$-product of compact metrizable spaces ($\sigma$-product of intervals) if and only if $K$ is (strongly countable-dimensional) hereditarily metalindel\"of and every subspace of $K$ has a nonempty relative open second-countable subset. This provides novel characterizations of $\omega$-Corson and $NY$ compact spaces. We give an example of a uniform Eberlein compact space that does not embed into a product of compact metric spaces in such a way that the $\sigma$-product is dense in the image. In particular, this answers a question of Kubi\'s and Leiderman. We also show that for a compact space $K$ the property of being $NY$ compact is determined by the topological structure of the space $C_p(K)$ of continuous real-valued functions of $K$ equipped with the pointwise convergence topology. This refines a recent result of Zakrzewski.</description>

      <title>More on $\mathcal{T}$-closed sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider properties of the diagonal of a continuum that are used later in the paper. We continue the study of $T$-closed subsets of a continuum $X$. We prove that for a continuum $X$, the statements: $\Delta_X$ is a nonblock subcontinuum of $X^2$, $\Delta_X$ is a shore subcontinuum of $X^2$ and $\Delta_X$ is not a strong centre of $X^2$ are equivalent, this result answers in the negative Questions 35 and 36 and Question 38 ($i\in\{4,5\}$) of the paper ``Diagonals on the edge of the square of a continuum, by A. Illanes, V. Mart\'inez-de-la-Vega, J. M. Mart\'inez-Montejano and D. Michalik''. We also include an example, giving a negative answer to Question 1.2 of the paper ``Concerning when $F_1(X)$ is a continuum of colocal connectedness in hyperspaces and symmetric products, Colloquium Math., 160 (2020), 297-307'', by V. Mart\'inez-de-la-Vega, J. M. Mart\'inez-Montejano. We characterised the $T$-closed subcontinua of the square of the pseudo-arc. We prove that the $T$-closed sets of the product of two continua is compact if and only if such product is locally connected. We show that for a chainable continuum $X$, $\Delta_X$ is a $T$-closed subcontinuum of $X^2$ if and only if $X$ is an arc. We prove that if $X$ is a continuum with the property of Kelley, then the following are equivalent: $\Delta_X$ is a $T$-closed subcontinuum of $X^2$, $X^2\setminus\Delta_X$ is strongly continuumwise connected, $\Delta_X$ is a subcontinuum of colocal connectedness, and $X^2\setminus\Delta_X$ is continuumwise connected. We give models for the families of $T$-closed sets and $T$-closed subcontinua of various families of continua.</description>

      <title>Topology-enhanced machine learning model (Top-ML) for anticancer peptide prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, therapeutic peptides have demonstrated great promise for cancer treatment. To explore powerful anticancer peptides, artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches have been developed to systematically screen potential candidates. However, the lack of efficient featurization of peptides has become a bottleneck for these machine-learning models. In this paper, we propose a topology-enhanced machine learning model (Top-ML) for anticancer peptide prediction. Our Top-ML employs peptide topological features derived from its sequence "connection" information characterized by vector and spectral descriptors. Our Top-ML model has been validated on two widely used AntiCP 2.0 benchmark datasets and has achieved state-of-the-art performance. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging novel topology-based featurization to accelerate the identification of anticancer peptides.</description>

      <title>Gauss diagrams as cubic graphs: The choice of the Hamiltonian cycle matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore to what extent the properties of a Gauss diagram are affected by the choice of its Hamiltonian cycle. We present an example of a realizable Gauss diagram and an unrealizable Gauss diagram that differ only by a choice of the Hamiltonian cycle. We present an example of two Gauss diagrams that correspond to different curves and differ only by a choice of the Hamiltonian cycle. We prove that a certain natural type of change of the Hamiltonian cycle preserves the realizability of the Gauss diagram.</description>

      <title>A Distance for Geometric Graphs via the Labeled Merge Tree Interleaving Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric graphs appear in many real-world data sets, such as road networks, sensor networks, and molecules. We investigate the notion of distance between embedded graphs and present a metric to measure the distance between two geometric graphs via merge trees. In order to preserve as much useful information as possible from the original data, we introduce a way of rotating the sublevel set to obtain the merge trees via the idea of the directional transform. We represent the merge trees using a surjective multi-labeling scheme and then compute the distance between two representative matrices. We show some theoretically desirable qualities and present two methods of computation: approximation via sampling and exact distance using a kinetic data structure, both in polynomial time. We illustrate its utility by implementing it on two data sets.</description>
