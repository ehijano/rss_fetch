      <title>Continual Evolution in Nonreciprocal Ecological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedbacks between evolution and ecology are ubiquitous, with ecological interactions determining which mutants are successful, and these mutants in turn modifying community structure. We study the evolutionary dynamics of several ecological models with overlapping niches, including consumer resource and Lotka-Volterra models. Evolution is assumed slow and extinctions are permanent, with ecological dynamics reaching a stable fixed point between introductions of invaders or mutants. When new strains are slowly added to the community, the ecosystem converges, after an initial evolutionary transient, to a diverse eco-evolutionary steady state. In this "Red Queen" phase of continual evolution, the biodiversity continues to turn over without the invasion probability of new variants getting any smaller. For resource-mediated interactions, the Red Queen phase obtains for any amount of asymmetry in the interactions between strains, and is robust to "general fitness" differences in the intrinsic growth rates of strains. Via a dynamical mean field theory framework valid for high-dimensional phenotype space, we analytically characterize the Red Queen eco-evolutionary steady state in a particular limit of model parameters. Scaling arguments enable a more general understanding of the steady state and evolutionary transients toward it. This work therefore establishes simple models of continual evolution in an ecological context without host-pathogen arms races, and points to the generality of Red Queen evolution. However, we also find other eco-evolutionary phases in simple models: For generalized Lotka-Volterra models with weakly asymmetric interactions an "oligarch" phase emerges in which the evolutionary dynamics continually slow down and a substantial fraction of the community's abundance condenses into a handful of slowly turning-over strains.</description>

      <title>Emergenet: A Digital Twin of Sequence Evolution for Scalable Emergence Risk Assessment of Animal Influenza A Strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite having triggered devastating pandemics in the past, our ability to quantitatively assess the emergence potential of individual strains of animal influenza viruses remains limited. This study introduces Emergenet, a tool to infer a digital twin of sequence evolution to chart how new variants might emerge in the wild. Our predictions based on Emergenets built only using 220,151 Hemagglutinnin (HA) sequences consistently outperform WHO seasonal vaccine recommendations for H1N1/H3N2 subtypes over two decades (average match-improvement: 3.73 AAs, 28.40\%), and are at par with state-of-the-art approaches that use more detailed phenotypic annotations. Finally, our generative models are used to scalably calculate the current odds of emergence of animal strains not yet in human circulation, which strongly correlates with CDC's expert-assessed Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) scores (Pearson's $r = 0.721, p = 10^{-4}$). A minimum five orders of magnitude speedup over CDC's assessment (seconds vs months) then enabled us to analyze 6,354 animal strains collected post-2020 to identify 35 strains with high emergence scores ($&gt; 7.7$). The Emergenet framework opens the door to preemptive pandemic mitigation through targeted inoculation of animal hosts before the first human infection.</description>

      <title>Critically assessing atavism, an evolution-centered and deterministic hypothesis on cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer is most commonly viewed as resulting from somatic mutations enhancing proliferation and invasion. Some hypotheses further propose that these new capacities reveal a breakdown of multicellularity allowing cancer cells to escape proliferation and cooperation control mechanisms that were implemented during evolution of multicellularity. Here we critically review one such hypothesis, named ``atavism,'' which puts forward the idea that cancer results from the re-expression of normally repressed genes forming a program, or toolbox, inherited from unicellular or simple multicellular ancestors. This hypothesis places cancer in an interesting evolutionary perspective that has not been widely explored and deserves attention. Thinking about cancer within an evolutionary framework, especially the major transitions to multicellularity, offers particularly promising perspectives. It is therefore of the utmost important to analyze why one approach that tries to achieve this aim, the atavism hypothesis, has not so far emerged as a major theory on cancer. We outline the features of the atavism hypothesis that, would benefit from clarification and, if possible, unification.</description>

      <title>Do SETI Optimists Have a Fine-Tuning Problem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In ecological systems, be it a petri dish or a galaxy, populations evolve from some initial value (say zero) up to a steady state equilibrium, when the mean number of births and deaths per unit time are equal. This equilibrium point is a function of the birth and death rates, as well as the carrying capacity of the ecological system itself. We show that the occupation fraction versus birth-to-death rate ratio is S-shaped, saturating at the carrying capacity for large birth-to-death rate ratios and tending to zero at the other end. We argue that our astronomical observations appear inconsistent with a cosmos saturated with ETIs, and thus SETI optimists are left presuming that the true population is somewhere along the transitional part of this S-curve. Since the birth and death rates are a-priori unbounded, we argue that this presents a fine-tuning problem. Further, we show that if the birth-to-death rate ratio is assumed to have a log-uniform prior distribution, then the probability distribution of the ecological filling fraction is bi-modal - peaking at zero and unity. Indeed, the resulting distribution is formally the classic Haldane prior, conceived to describe the prior expectation of a Bernoulli experiment, such as a technological intelligence developing (or not) on a given world. Our results formally connect the Drake Equation to the birth-death formalism, the treatment of ecological carrying capacity and their connection to the Haldane perspective.</description>
