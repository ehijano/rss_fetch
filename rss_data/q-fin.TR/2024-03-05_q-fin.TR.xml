      <title>Volatility-based strategy on Chinese equity index ETF options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been quick developments of derivative markets in China and standardized derivative trading have reached considerable volumes. In this research, we collect all the daily data of ETF options traded at Shanghai Stock Exchange and start with a simple short-volatility strategy. The strategy delivers nice performance before 2018, providing significant excess return over the buy and hold benchmark. However, after 2018, this strategy starts to deteriorate and no obvious risk-adjusted return is shown. Based on the discussion of relationship between the strategy's performance and market's volatility, we improve the model by adjusting positions and exposure according to volatility forecasts using methods such as volatility momentum and GARCH. The new models have improved performance in different ways, where larger upside capture and smaller drawbacks can be achieved in market fluctuation. This research has shown potentials of volatility-based trading on Chinese equity index options, and with further improvement and implementation considerations, real-world practical trading strategies can be formed.</description>

      <title>Limit Order Book Simulations: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Limit Order Books (LOBs) serve as a mechanism for buyers and sellers to interact with each other in the financial markets. Modelling and simulating LOBs is quite often necessary for calibrating and fine-tuning the automated trading strategies developed in algorithmic trading research. The recent AI revolution and availability of faster and cheaper compute power has enabled the modelling and simulations to grow richer and even use modern AI techniques. In this review we examine the various kinds of LOB simulation models present in the current state of the art. We provide a classification of the models on the basis of their methodology and provide an aggregate view of the popular stylized facts used in the literature to test the models. We additionally provide a focused study of price impact's presence in the models since it is one of the more crucial phenomena to model in algorithmic trading. Finally, we conduct a comparative analysis of various qualities of fits of these models and how they perform when tested against empirical data.</description>
