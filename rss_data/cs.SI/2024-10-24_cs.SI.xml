      <title>Revealing The Secret Power: How Algorithms Can Influence Content Visibility on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online social media platforms significantly influence public debates by shaping the information users encounter. Content visibility on these platforms is regulated by recommendation algorithms designed to maximize user engagement using individual-level data, including personal preferences and interactions. These algorithms play a crucial role in information dissemination, yet their inner workings are often undisclosed, raising concerns about potential manipulation of visibility. While algorithms may be intended to limit the spread of harmful content, they can also be exploited to suppress dissenting voices without users' awareness. The suspicion that platforms deliberately reduce the visibility of certain users or content - commonly known as shadow banning - has garnered significant public attention, with numerous figures advocating for greater transparency around this practice. In this study, we perform a quantitative study geared to identify suspicious changes in content visibility on Twitter (now known as X). We build and study a dataset of over 13 million tweets from more than 5 million users discussing the Ukraine conflict, including each tweet's number of views and metadata, aiming to detect reduced or inflated visibility patterns. We investigate how visibility correlates with factors such as authors' stance, role, interaction networks, and content narratives. Our findings reveal significant variations in visibility, likely driven by algorithmic interventions. These results highlight the need for greater transparency in regulating online information ecosystems to prevent algorithmic manipulation that could undermine public discourse and the fairness of debates.</description>

      <title>Learning Graph Filters for Structure-Function Coupling based Hub Node Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, tools from network science have been leveraged to characterize the organization of both structural and functional networks of the brain. One such measure of network organization is hub node identification. Hubs are specialized nodes within a network that link distinct brain units corresponding to specialized functional processes. Conventional methods for identifying hub nodes utilize different types of centrality measures and participation coefficient to profile various aspects of nodal importance. These methods solely rely on the functional connectivity networks constructed from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), ignoring the structure-function coupling in the brain. In this paper, we introduce a graph signal processing (GSP) based hub detection framework that utilizes both the structural connectivity and the functional activation to identify hub nodes. The proposed framework models functional activity as graph signals on the structural connectivity. Hub nodes are then detected based on the premise that hub nodes are sparse, have higher level of activity compared to their neighbors, and the non-hub nodes' activity can be modeled as the output of a graph-based filter. Based on these assumptions, an optimization framework, GraFHub, is formulated to learn the coefficients of the optimal polynomial graph filter and detect the hub nodes. The proposed framework is evaluated on both simulated data and resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from Human Connectome Project (HCP).</description>

      <title>Measuring Network Dynamics of Opioid Overdose Deaths in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The US opioid overdose epidemic has been a major public health concern in recent decades. There has been increasing recognition that its etiology is rooted in part in the social contexts that mediate substance use and access; however, reliable statistical measures of social influence are lacking in the literature. We use Facebook's social connectedness index (SCI) as a proxy for real-life social networks across diverse spatial regions that help quantify social connectivity across different spatial units. This is a measure of the relative probability of connections between localities that offers a unique lens to understand the effects of social networks on health outcomes. We use SCI to develop a variable, called "deaths in social proximity", to measure the influence of social networks on opioid overdose deaths (OODs) in US counties. Our results show a statistically significant effect size for deaths in social proximity on OODs in counties in the United States, controlling for spatial proximity, as well as demographic and clinical covariates. The effect size of standardized deaths in social proximity in our cluster-robust linear regression model indicates that a one-standard-deviation increase, equal to 11.70 more deaths per 100,000 population in the social proximity of ego counties in the contiguous United States, is associated with thirteen more deaths per 100,000 population in ego counties. To further validate our findings, we performed a series of robustness checks using a network autocorrelation model to account for social network effects, a spatial autocorrelation model to capture spatial dependencies, and a two-way fixed-effect model to control for unobserved spatial and time-invariant characteristics. These checks consistently provide statistically robust evidence of positive social influence on OODs in US counties.</description>

      <title>Detecting fake review buyers using network structure: Direct evidence from Amazon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online reviews significantly impact consumers' decision-making process and firms' economic outcomes and are widely seen as crucial to the success of online markets. Firms, therefore, have a strong incentive to manipulate ratings using fake reviews. This presents a problem that academic researchers have tried to solve over two decades and on which platforms expend a large amount of resources. Nevertheless, the prevalence of fake reviews is arguably higher than ever. To combat this, we collect a dataset of reviews for thousands of Amazon products and develop a general and highly accurate method for detecting fake reviews. A unique difference between previous datasets and ours is that we directly observe which sellers buy fake reviews. Thus, while prior research has trained models using lab-generated reviews or proxies for fake reviews, we are able to train a model using actual fake reviews. We show that products that buy fake reviews are highly clustered in the product-reviewer network. Therefore, features constructed from this network are highly predictive of which products buy fake reviews. We show that our network-based approach is also successful at detecting fake reviews even without ground truth data, as unsupervised clustering methods can accurately identify fake review buyers by identifying clusters of products that are closely connected in the network. While text or metadata can be manipulated to evade detection, network-based features are more costly to manipulate because these features result directly from the inherent limitations of buying reviews from online review marketplaces, making our detection approach more robust to manipulation.</description>

      <title>MiniFed : Integrating LLM-based Agentic-Workflow for Simulating FOMC Meeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Federal Funds rate in the United States plays a significant role in both domestic and international financial markets. However, research has predominantly focused on the effects of adjustments to the Federal Funds rate rather than on the decision-making process itself. Recent advancements in large language models(LLMs) offer a potential method for reconstructing the original FOMC meetings, which are responsible for setting the Federal Funds rate. In this paper, we propose a five-stage FOMC meeting simulation framework, MiniFed, which employs LLM agents to simulate real-world FOMC meeting members and optimize the FOMC structure. This framework effectively revitalizes the FOMC meeting process and facilitates projections of the Federal Funds rate. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MiniFed framework achieves both high accuracy in Federal Funds rate projections and behavioral alignment with the agents' real-world counterparts. Given that few studies have focused on employing LLM agents to simulate large-scale real-world conferences, our work can serve as a benchmark for future developments.</description>

      <title>Metrics for Assessing Inclusivity and Empowerment of People for Supporting the Design of Inclusive Product Lifecycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Design of an inclusive product lifecycle is important for empowering people (stakeholders) with their meaningful inclusion in lifecycle processes. The aim is to use this as an enabler for transition to sustainability by balancing the power relations among the stakeholders. Design of an inclusive product lifecycle for empowerment requires that the nature of inclusion of stakeholders in the lifecycle is such that it leads to their empowerment. Empowerment processes provide opportunities for people to increase their power to sustain the development of inclusive product lifecycles. Analysing power relations is to balance the amount of power of stakeholders with their inclusion in different functions in an inclusive lifecycle design. Inclusivity addresses the context of the lifecycle process to determine who can be included in which phases of the lifecycle and the diversity of people to be empowered. We apply a novel empowerment and inclusivity framework to a series of real-life case studies from literature to identify the major dimensions of empowerment and inclusivity. By analysing the relationships between the dimensions of empowerment and inclusivity, we propose specific metrics for inclusivity and empowerment that have strong causal connections, indicating the kinds of inclusion that should lead to greater empowerment in product lifecycles.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Joint Estimation of Temporal Vertex and Edge Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adaptive estimation of coexisting temporal vertex (node) and edge signals on graphs is a critical task when a change in edge signals influences the temporal dynamics of the vertex signals. However, the current Graph Signal Processing algorithms mostly consider only the signals existing on the graph vertices and have neglected the fact that signals can reside on the edges. We propose an Adaptive Joint Vertex-Edge Estimation (AJVEE) algorithm for jointly estimating time-varying vertex and edge signals through a time-varying regression, incorporating both vertex signal filtering and edge signal filtering. Accompanying AJVEE is a newly proposed Adaptive Least Mean Square procedure based on the Hodge Laplacian (ALMS-Hodge), which is inspired by classical adaptive filters combining simplicial filtering and simplicial regression. AJVEE is able to operate jointly on the vertices and edges by merging two ALMS-Hodge specified on the vertices and edges into a unified formulation. A more generalized case extending AJVEE beyond the vertices and edges is being discussed. Experimenting on real-world traffic networks and population mobility networks, we have confirmed that our proposed AJVEE algorithm could accurately and jointly track time-varying vertex and edge signals on graphs.</description>

      <title>Encoder Embedding for General Graph and Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph encoder embedding, a recent technique for graph data, offers speed and scalability in producing vertex-level representations from binary graphs. In this paper, we extend the applicability of this method to a general graph model, which includes weighted graphs, distance matrices, and kernel matrices. We prove that the encoder embedding satisfies the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem on a per-observation basis. Under certain condition, it achieves asymptotic normality on a per-class basis, enabling optimal classification through discriminant analysis. These theoretical findings are validated through a series of experiments involving weighted graphs, as well as text and image data transformed into general graph representations using appropriate distance metrics.</description>

      <title>Richelieu: Self-Evolving LLM-Based Agents for AI Diplomacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06813v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diplomacy is one of the most sophisticated activities in human society, involving complex interactions among multiple parties that require skills in social reasoning, negotiation, and long-term strategic planning. Previous AI agents have demonstrated their ability to handle multi-step games and large action spaces in multi-agent tasks. However, diplomacy involves a staggering magnitude of decision spaces, especially considering the negotiation stage required. While recent agents based on large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in various applications, they still struggle with extended planning periods in complex multi-agent settings. Leveraging recent technologies for LLM-based agents, we aim to explore AI's potential to create a human-like agent capable of executing comprehensive multi-agent missions by integrating three fundamental capabilities: 1) strategic planning with memory and reflection; 2) goal-oriented negotiation with social reasoning; and 3) augmenting memory through self-play games for self-evolution without human in the loop.</description>

      <title>Explainable Hierarchical Urban Representation Learning for Commuting Flow Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14762v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Commuting flow prediction is an essential task for municipal operations in the real world. Previous studies have revealed that it is feasible to estimate the commuting origin-destination (OD) demand within a city using multiple auxiliary data. However, most existing methods are not suitable to deal with a similar task at a large scale, namely within a prefecture or the whole nation, owing to the increased number of geographical units that need to be maintained. In addition, region representation learning is a universal approach for gaining urban knowledge for diverse metropolitan downstream tasks. Although many researchers have developed comprehensive frameworks to describe urban units from multi-source data, they have not clarified the relationship between the selected geographical elements. Furthermore, metropolitan areas naturally preserve ranked structures, like cities and their inclusive districts, which makes elucidating relations between cross-level urban units necessary. Therefore, we develop a heterogeneous graph-based model to generate meaningful region embeddings at multiple spatial resolutions for predicting different types of inter-level OD flows. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments were conducted using real-world aggregated mobile phone datasets collected from Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. The results indicate that our proposed model outperforms existing models in terms of a uniform urban structure. We extend the understanding of predicted results using reasonable explanations to enhance the credibility of the model.</description>
