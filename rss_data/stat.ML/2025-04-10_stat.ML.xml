      <title>Can SGD Select Good Fishermen? Local Convergence under Self-Selection Biases and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of estimating $k$ linear regressors with self-selection bias in $d$ dimensions with the maximum selection criterion, as introduced by Cherapanamjeri, Daskalakis, Ilyas, and Zampetakis [CDIZ23, STOC'23]. Our main result is a $\operatorname{poly}(d,k,1/\varepsilon) + {k}^{O(k)}$ time algorithm for this problem, which yields an improvement in the running time of the algorithms of [CDIZ23] and [GM24, arXiv]. We achieve this by providing the first local convergence algorithm for self-selection, thus resolving the main open question of [CDIZ23].
  To obtain this algorithm, we reduce self-selection to a seemingly unrelated statistical problem called coarsening. Coarsening occurs when one does not observe the exact value of the sample but only some set (a subset of the sample space) that contains the exact value. Inference from coarse samples arises in various real-world applications due to rounding by humans and algorithms, limited precision of instruments, and lag in multi-agent systems.
  Our reduction to coarsening is intuitive and relies on the geometry of the self-selection problem, which enables us to bypass the limitations of previous analytic approaches. To demonstrate its applicability, we provide a local convergence algorithm for linear regression under another self-selection criterion, which is related to second-price auction data. Further, we give the first polynomial time local convergence algorithm for coarse Gaussian mean estimation given samples generated from a convex partition. Previously, only a sample-efficient algorithm was known due to Fotakis, Kalavasis, Kontonis, and Tzamos [FKKT21, COLT'21].</description>

      <title>Throughput-Optimal Scheduling Algorithms for LLM Inference and AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents rapidly grows, optimizing systems for efficient LLM inference becomes critical. While significant efforts have targeted system-level engineering, little is explored through a mathematical modeling and queuing perspective.
  In this paper, we aim to develop the queuing fundamentals for LLM inference, bridging the gap between queuing and LLM system communities. In particular, we study the throughput aspect in LLM inference systems. We prove that a large class of 'work-conserving' scheduling algorithms can achieve maximum throughput for both individual requests and AI agent workloads, highlighting 'work-conserving' as a key design principle in practice. Evaluations of real-world systems show that Orca and Sarathi-serve are throughput-optimal, reassuring practitioners, while FastTransformer and vanilla vLLM are not maximally stable and should be used with caution.
  Our results highlight the substantial benefits queuing community can offer in improving LLM inference systems and call for more interdisciplinary developments.</description>

      <title>Gradient-based Sample Selection for Faster Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is an effective technique for black-box optimization. However, its applicability is typically limited to moderate-budget problems due to the cubic complexity in computing the Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model. In large-budget scenarios, directly employing the standard GP model faces significant challenges in computational time and resource requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, gradient-based sample selection Bayesian Optimization (GSSBO), to enhance the computational efficiency of BO. The GP model is constructed on a selected set of samples instead of the whole dataset. These samples are selected by leveraging gradient information to maintain diversity and representation. We provide a theoretical analysis of the gradient-based sample selection strategy and obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for our proposed framework. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the computational cost of GP fitting in BO while maintaining optimization performance comparable to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Performance of Rank-One Tensor Approximation on Incomplete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in the estimation of a rank-one tensor signal when only a portion $\varepsilon$ of its noisy observation is available. We show that the study of this problem can be reduced to that of a random matrix model whose spectral analysis gives access to the reconstruction performance. These results shed light on and specify the loss of performance induced by an artificial reduction of the memory cost of a tensor via the deletion of a random part of its entries.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Distance Kernels for MMDs and Applications in Wasserstein Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative distance kernels $K(x,y) := - \|x-y\|$ were used in the definition of maximum mean discrepancies (MMDs) in statistics and lead to favorable numerical results in various applications. In particular, so-called slicing techniques for handling high-dimensional kernel summations profit from the simple parameter-free structure of the distance kernel. However, due to its non-smoothness in $x=y$, most of the classical theoretical results, e.g. on Wasserstein gradient flows of the corresponding MMD functional do not longer hold true. In this paper, we propose a new kernel which keeps the favorable properties of the negative distance kernel as being conditionally positive definite of order one with a nearly linear increase towards infinity and a simple slicing structure, but is Lipschitz differentiable now. Our construction is based on a simple 1D smoothing procedure of the absolute value function followed by a Riemann-Liouville fractional integral transform. Numerical results demonstrate that the new kernel performs similarly well as the negative distance kernel in gradient descent methods, but now with theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Embedding Reliability Verification Constraints into Generation Expansion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generation planning approaches face challenges in managing the incompatible mathematical structures between stochastic production simulations for reliability assessment and optimization models for generation planning, which hinders the integration of reliability constraints. This study proposes an approach to embedding reliability verification constraints into generation expansion planning by leveraging a weighted oblique decision tree (WODT) technique. For each planning year, a generation mix dataset, labeled with reliability assessment simulations, is generated. An WODT model is trained using this dataset. Reliability-feasible regions are extracted via depth-first search technique and formulated as disjunctive constraints. These constraints are then transformed into mixed-integer linear form using a convex hull modeling technique and embedded into a unit commitment-integrated generation expansion planning model. The proposed approach is validated through a long-term generation planning case study for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) region, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving reliable and optimal planning solutions.</description>

      <title>Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader Achieves Best-of-Both-Worlds for the m-Set Semi-Bandit Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a common case of the combinatorial semi-bandit problem, the $m$-set semi-bandit, where the learner exactly selects $m$ arms from the total $d$ arms. In the adversarial setting, the best regret bound, known to be $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{nmd})$ for time horizon $n$, is achieved by the well-known Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) policy, which, however, requires to explicitly compute the arm-selection probabilities by solving optimizing problems at each time step and sample according to it. This problem can be avoided by the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) policy, which simply pulls the $m$ arms that rank among the $m$ smallest (estimated) loss with random perturbation. In this paper, we show that FTPL with a Fr\'echet perturbation also enjoys the optimal regret bound $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{nmd})$ in the adversarial setting and achieves best-of-both-world regret bounds, i.e., achieves a logarithmic regret for the stochastic setting.</description>

      <title>Unifying and extending Diffusion Models through PDEs for solving Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools with applications in computer vision and scientific machine learning (SciML), where they have been used to solve large-scale probabilistic inverse problems. Traditionally, these models have been derived using principles of variational inference, denoising, statistical signal processing, and stochastic differential equations. In contrast to the conventional presentation, in this study we derive diffusion models using ideas from linear partial differential equations and demonstrate that this approach has several benefits that include a constructive derivation of the forward and reverse processes, a unified derivation of multiple formulations and sampling strategies, and the discovery of a new class of models. We also apply the conditional version of these models to solving canonical conditional density estimation problems and challenging inverse problems. These problems help establish benchmarks for systematically quantifying the performance of different formulations and sampling strategies in this study, and for future studies. Finally, we identify and implement a mechanism through which a single diffusion model can be applied to measurements obtained from multiple measurement operators. Taken together, the contents of this manuscript provide a new understanding and several new directions in the application of diffusion models to solving physics-based inverse problems.</description>

      <title>GPT Carry-On: Training Foundation Model for Customization Could Be Simple, Scalable and Affordable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern large language foundation models (LLM) have now entered the daily lives of millions of users. We ask a natural question whether it is possible to customize LLM for every user or every task. From system and industrial economy consideration, general continue-training or fine-tuning still require substantial computation and memory of training GPU nodes, whereas most inference nodes under deployment, possibly with lower-end GPUs, are configured to make forward pass fastest possible. We propose a framework to take full advantages of existing LLMs and systems of online service. We train an additional branch of transformer blocks on the final-layer embedding of pretrained LLMs, which is the base, then a carry-on module merge the base models to compose a customized LLM. We can mix multiple layers, or multiple LLMs specialized in different domains such as chat, coding, math, to form a new mixture of LLM that best fit a new task. As the base model don't need to update parameters, we are able to outsource most computation of the training job on inference nodes, and only train a lightweight carry-on on training nodes, where we consume less than 1GB GPU memory to train a 100M carry-on layer on 30B LLM. We tested Qwen and DeepSeek opensourced models for continue-pretraining and got faster loss convergence. We use it to improve solving math questions with extremely small computation and model size, with 1000 data samples of chain-of-thoughts, and as small as 1 MB parameters of two layer layer carry-on, and the results are promising.</description>

      <title>Universal Scaling Laws of Absorbing Phase Transitions in Artificial Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that conventional artificial deep neural networks operating near the phase boundary of the signal propagation dynamics, also known as the edge of chaos, exhibit universal scaling laws of absorbing phase transitions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We exploit the fully deterministic nature of the propagation dynamics to elucidate an analogy between a signal collapse in the neural networks and an absorbing state (a state that the system can enter but cannot escape from). Our numerical results indicate that the multilayer perceptrons and the convolutional neural networks belong to the mean-field and the directed percolation universality classes, respectively. Also, the finite-size scaling is successfully applied, suggesting a potential connection to the depth-width trade-off in deep learning. Furthermore, our analysis of the training dynamics under the gradient descent reveals that hyperparameter tuning to the phase boundary is necessary but insufficient for achieving optimal generalization in deep networks. Remarkably, nonuniversal metric factors associated with the scaling laws are shown to play a significant role in concretizing the above observations. These findings highlight the usefulness of the notion of criticality for analyzing the behavior of artificial deep neural networks and offer new insights toward a unified understanding of the essential relationship between criticality and intelligence.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Non-Linear Feature Learning with One Gradient Step in Two-Layer Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07891v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature learning is thought to be one of the fundamental reasons for the success of deep neural networks. It is rigorously known that in two-layer fully-connected neural networks under certain conditions, one step of gradient descent on the first layer can lead to feature learning; characterized by the appearance of a separated rank-one component -- spike -- in the spectrum of the feature matrix. However, with a constant gradient descent step size, this spike only carries information from the linear component of the target function and therefore learning non-linear components is impossible. We show that with a learning rate that grows with the sample size, such training in fact introduces multiple rank-one components, each corresponding to a specific polynomial feature. We further prove that the limiting large-dimensional and large sample training and test errors of the updated neural networks are fully characterized by these spikes. By precisely analyzing the improvement in the training and test errors, we demonstrate that these non-linear features can enhance learning.</description>

      <title>DCSI -- An improved measure of cluster separability based on separation and connectedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12806v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether class labels in a given data set correspond to meaningful clusters is crucial for the evaluation of clustering algorithms using real-world data sets. This property can be quantified by separability measures. The central aspects of separability for density-based clustering are between-class separation and within-class connectedness, and neither classification-based complexity measures nor cluster validity indices (CVIs) adequately incorporate them. A newly developed measure (density cluster separability index, DCSI) aims to quantify these two characteristics and can also be used as a CVI. Extensive experiments on synthetic data indicate that DCSI correlates strongly with the performance of DBSCAN measured via the adjusted Rand index (ARI) but lacks robustness when it comes to multi-class data sets with overlapping classes that are ill-suited for density-based hard clustering. Detailed evaluation on frequently used real-world data sets shows that DCSI can correctly identify touching or overlapping classes that do not correspond to meaningful density-based clusters.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Ill-conditioned Hankel Matrix Recovery via Structured Newton-like Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the robust Hankel recovery problem, which simultaneously removes the sparse outliers and fulfills missing entries from the partial observation. We propose a novel non-convex algorithm, coined Hankel Structured Newton-Like Descent (HSNLD), to tackle the robust Hankel recovery problem. HSNLD is highly efficient with linear convergence, and its convergence rate is independent of the condition number of the underlying Hankel matrix. The recovery guarantee has been established under some mild conditions. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show the superior performance of HSNLD against state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the problem of sampling from distributions whose densities are not necessarily smooth nor log-concave. We propose a simple Langevin-based algorithm that does not rely on popular but computationally challenging techniques, such as the Moreau Yosida envelope or Gaussian smoothing. We derive non-asymptotic guarantees for the convergence of the algorithm to the target distribution in Wasserstein distances. Non asymptotic bounds are also provided for the performance of the algorithm as an optimizer, specifically for the solution of associated excess risk optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Universal Architectures for the Learning of Polyhedral Norms and Convex Regularizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the task of learning convex regularizers to guide the reconstruction of images from limited data. By imposing that the reconstruction be amplitude-equivariant, we narrow down the class of admissible functionals to those that can be expressed as a power of a seminorm. We then show that such functionals can be approximated to arbitrary precision with the help of polyhedral norms. In particular, we identify two dual parameterizations of such systems: (i) a synthesis form with an $\ell_1$-penalty that involves some learnable dictionary; and (ii) an analysis form with an $\ell_\infty$-penalty that involves a trainable regularization operator. After having provided geometric insights and proved that the two forms are universal, we propose an implementation that relies on a specific architecture (tight frame with a weighted $\ell_1$ penalty) that is easy to train. We illustrate its use for denoising and the reconstruction of biomedical images. We find that the proposed framework outperforms the sparsity-based methods of compressed sensing, while it offers essentially the same convergence and robustness guarantees.</description>

      <title>A Recursive Partitioning Approach for Dynamic Discrete Choice Modeling in High Dimensional Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic discrete choice models are widely employed to answer substantive and policy questions in settings where individuals' current choices have future implications. However, estimation of these models is often computationally intensive and/or infeasible in high-dimensional settings. Indeed, even specifying the structure for how the utilities/state transitions enter the agent's decision is challenging in high-dimensional settings when we have no guiding theory. In this paper, we present a semi-parametric formulation of dynamic discrete choice models that incorporates a high-dimensional set of state variables, in addition to the standard variables used in a parametric utility function. The high-dimensional variable can include all the variables that are not the main variables of interest but may potentially affect people's choices and must be included in the estimation procedure, i.e., control variables. We present a data-driven recursive partitioning algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of the high-dimensional state space by taking the variation in choices and state transition into account. Researchers can then use the method of their choice to estimate the problem using the discretized state space from the first stage. Our approach can reduce the estimation bias and make estimation feasible at the same time. We present Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the performance of our method compared to standard estimation methods where we ignore the high-dimensional explanatory variable set.</description>

      <title>Estimation of High-Dimensional Markov-Switching VAR Models with an Approximate EM Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regime shifts in high-dimensional time series arise naturally in many applications, from neuroimaging to finance. This problem has received considerable attention in low-dimensional settings, with both Bayesian and frequentist methods used extensively for parameter estimation. The EM algorithm is a particularly popular strategy for parameter estimation in low-dimensional settings, although the statistical properties of the resulting estimates have not been well understood. Furthermore, its extension to high-dimensional time series has proved challenging. To overcome these challenges, in this paper we propose an approximate EM algorithm for Markov-switching VAR models that leads to efficient computation and also facilitates the investigation of asymptotic properties of the resulting parameter estimates. We establish the consistency of the proposed EM algorithm in high dimensions and investigate its performance via simulation studies. We also demonstrate the algorithm by analyzing a brain electroencephalography (EEG) dataset recorded on a patient experiencing epileptic seizure.</description>

      <title>Policy Gradient Converges to the Globally Optimal Policy for Nearly Linear-Quadratic Regulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08431v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear control systems with partial information to the decision maker are prevalent in a variety of applications. As a step toward studying such nonlinear systems, this work explores reinforcement learning methods for finding the optimal policy in the nearly linear-quadratic regulator systems. In particular, we consider a dynamic system that combines linear and nonlinear components, and is governed by a policy with the same structure. Assuming that the nonlinear component comprises kernels with small Lipschitz coefficients, we characterize the optimization landscape of the cost function. Although the cost function is nonconvex in general, we establish the local strong convexity and smoothness in the vicinity of the global optimizer. Additionally, we propose an initialization mechanism to leverage these properties. Building on the developments, we design a policy gradient algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to the globally optimal policy with a linear rate.</description>

      <title>Demystifying amortized causal discovery with transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised learning approaches for causal discovery from observational data often achieve competitive performance despite seemingly avoiding explicit assumptions that traditional methods make for identifiability. In this work, we investigate CSIvA (Ke et al., 2023), a transformer-based model promising to train on synthetic data and transfer to real data. First, we bridge the gap with existing identifiability theory and show that constraints on the training data distribution implicitly define a prior on the test observations. Consistent with classical approaches, good performance is achieved when we have a good prior on the test data, and the underlying model is identifiable. At the same time, we find new trade-offs. Training on datasets generated from different classes of causal models, unambiguously identifiable in isolation, improves the test generalization. Performance is still guaranteed, as the ambiguous cases resulting from the mixture of identifiable causal models are unlikely to occur (which we formally prove). Overall, our study finds that amortized causal discovery still needs to obey identifiability theory, but it also differs from classical methods in how the assumptions are formulated, trading more reliance on assumptions on the noise type for fewer hypotheses on the mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Kullback-Leibler Barycentre of Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem where an agent aims to combine the views and insights of different experts' models. Specifically, each expert proposes a diffusion process over a finite time horizon. The agent then combines the experts' models by minimising the weighted Kullback--Leibler divergence to each of the experts' models. We show existence and uniqueness of the barycentre model and prove an explicit representation of the Radon--Nikodym derivative relative to the average drift model. We further allow the agent to include their own constraints, resulting in an optimal model that can be seen as a distortion of the experts' barycentre model to incorporate the agent's constraints. We propose two deep learning algorithms to approximate the optimal drift of the combined model, allowing for efficient simulations. The first algorithm aims at learning the optimal drift by matching the change of measure, whereas the second algorithm leverages the notion of elicitability to directly estimate the value function. The paper concludes with an extended application to combine implied volatility smile models that were estimated on different datasets.</description>

      <title>Think While You Generate: Discrete Diffusion with Planned Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion has achieved state-of-the-art performance, outperforming or approaching autoregressive models on standard benchmarks. In this work, we introduce Discrete Diffusion with Planned Denoising (DDPD), a novel framework that separates the generation process into two models: a planner and a denoiser. At inference time, the planner selects which positions to denoise next by identifying the most corrupted positions in need of denoising, including both initially corrupted and those requiring additional refinement. This plan-and-denoise approach enables more efficient reconstruction during generation by iteratively identifying and denoising corruptions in the optimal order. DDPD outperforms traditional denoiser-only mask diffusion methods, achieving superior results on language modeling benchmarks such as text8, OpenWebText, and token-based image generation on ImageNet $256 \times 256$. Notably, in language modeling, DDPD significantly reduces the performance gap between diffusion-based and autoregressive methods in terms of generative perplexity.

      <title>Distillation of Discrete Diffusion through Dimensional Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performances in various fields of generative modeling, but suffer from slow sampling speed due to their iterative nature. While this issue is being addressed in continuous domains, discrete diffusion models face unique challenges, particularly in capturing dependencies between elements (e.g., pixel relationships in image, sequential dependencies in language) mainly due to the computational cost of processing high-dimensional joint distributions. In this paper, (i) we propose "mixture" models for discrete diffusion that are capable of treating dimensional correlations while remaining scalable, and (ii) we provide a set of loss functions for distilling the iterations of existing models. Two primary theoretical insights underpin our approach: First, conventional models with element-wise independence can well approximate the data distribution, but essentially require {\it many sampling steps}. Second, our loss functions enable the mixture models to distill such many-step conventional models into just a few steps by learning the dimensional correlations. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in distilling pretrained discrete diffusion models across image and language domains.

      <title>Scalable Reinforcement Post-Training Beyond Static Human Prompts: Evolving Alignment via Asymmetric Self-Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks for large language models (LLM) post-training typically assume a fixed prompt distribution, which is sub-optimal and bottlenecks scalability. Prior works have explored prompt evolving, but are often limited to the supervised fine-tuning stage, and prompts are sampled and evolved uniformly without signals. This empirical work presents a paradigm shift: Evolving Alignment via Asymmetric Self-Play (eva), that casts post-training as an infinite game with regret-based signals for 2 players: (i) a creator, who strategically samples and creates new informative prompts and (ii) a solver, who learns to produce preferred responses. eva is the first method that allows language models to adaptively create training prompts in both offline and online RL post-training. The design is simple, easy-to-use yet remarkably effective: eva sets a new SOTA on challenging benchmarks, without any extra human prompts, e.g. it boosts the win-rate of gemma-2-9b-it on Arena-Hard by 51.6% -&gt; 60.1% for DPO and 52.6% -&gt; 62.4% for RLOO, surpassing claude-3-opus and catching up to gemini-1.5-pro, both of which are orders of magnitude larger. Extensive experiments show eva can create effective RL curricula and is robust across ablations. We believe adaptively evolving prompts are key to designing the next-generation RL post-training scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse weighting with an estimated propensity score is widely used by estimation methods in causal inference to adjust for confounding bias. However, directly inverting propensity score estimates can lead to instability, bias, and excessive variability due to large inverse weights, especially when treatment overlap is limited. In this work, we propose a post-hoc calibration algorithm for inverse propensity weights that generates well-calibrated, stabilized weights from user-supplied, cross-fitted propensity score estimates. Our approach employs a variant of isotonic regression with a loss function specifically tailored to the inverse propensity weights. Through theoretical analysis and empirical studies, we demonstrate that isotonic calibration improves the performance of doubly robust estimators of the average treatment effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning convolution operators associated to compact Abelian groups. We study a regularization-based approach and provide corresponding learning guarantees under natural regularity conditions on the convolution kernel. More precisely, we assume the convolution kernel is a function in a translation invariant Hilbert space and analyze a natural ridge regression (RR) estimator. Building on existing results for RR, we characterize the accuracy of the estimator in terms of finite sample bounds. Interestingly, regularity assumptions which are classical in the analysis of RR, have a novel and natural interpretation in terms of space/frequency localization. Theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>No Trick, No Treat: Pursuits and Challenges Towards Simulation-free Training of Neural Samplers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the sampling problem, where the aim is to draw samples from a distribution whose density is known only up to a normalization constant. Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling to approximate a high-dimensional data distribution have sparked significant interest in developing neural network-based methods for this challenging problem. However, neural samplers typically incur heavy computational overhead due to simulating trajectories during training. This motivates the pursuit of simulation-free training procedures of neural samplers. In this work, we propose an elegant modification to previous methods, which allows simulation-free training with the help of a time-dependent normalizing flow. However, it ultimately suffers from severe mode collapse. On closer inspection, we find that nearly all successful neural samplers rely on Langevin preconditioning to avoid mode collapsing. We systematically analyze several popular methods with various objective functions and demonstrate that, in the absence of Langevin preconditioning, most of them fail to adequately cover even a simple target. Finally, we draw attention to a strong baseline by combining the state-of-the-art MCMC method, Parallel Tempering (PT), with an additional generative model to shed light on future explorations of neural samplers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have shown remarkable performances in system identification, particularly in nonlinear dynamical systems such as thermal processes. However, stability remains a critical challenge in practical applications: although the underlying process may be intrinsically stable, there may be no guarantee that the resulting RNN model captures this behavior. This paper addresses the stability issue by deriving a sufficient condition for Input-to-State Stability based on the infinity-norm (ISS$_{\infty}$) for Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The obtained condition depends on fewer network parameters compared to prior works. A ISS$_{\infty}$-promoted training strategy is developed, incorporating a penalty term in the loss function that encourages stability and an ad hoc early stopping approach. The quality of LSTM models trained via the proposed approach is validated on a thermal system case study, where the ISS$_{\infty}$-promoted LSTM outperforms both a physics-based model and an ISS$_{\infty}$-promoted Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network while also surpassing non-ISS$_{\infty}$-promoted LSTM and GRU RNNs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bounds for Adversarial Constrained Online Convex Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constrained Online Convex Optimization (COCO) can be seen as a generalization of the standard Online Convex Optimization (OCO) framework. At each round, a cost function and constraint function are revealed after a learner chooses an action. The goal is to minimize both the regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV) against an adaptive adversary. We show for the first time that is possible to obtain the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ bound on both regret and CCV, improving the best known bounds of $O \left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ and $\tilde{O} \left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ for the regret and CCV, respectively. Based on a new surrogate loss function enforcing a minimum penalty on the constraint function, we demonstrate that both the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader and the Online Gradient Descent achieve the optimal bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphical Transformation Models (GTMs) are introduced as a novel approach to effectively model multivariate data with intricate marginals and complex dependency structures non-parametrically, while maintaining interpretability through the identification of varying conditional independencies. GTMs extend multivariate transformation models by replacing the Gaussian copula with a custom-designed multivariate transformation, offering two major advantages. Firstly, GTMs can capture more complex interdependencies using penalized splines, which also provide an efficient regularization scheme. Secondly, we demonstrate how to approximately regularize GTMs using a lasso penalty towards pairwise conditional independencies, akin to Gaussian graphical models. The model's robustness and effectiveness are validated through simulations, showcasing its ability to accurately learn parametric vine copulas and identify conditional independencies. Additionally, the model is applied to a benchmark astrophysics dataset, where the GTM demonstrates favorable performance compared to non-parametric vine copulas in learning complex multivariate distributions.</description>

Abstract: Using both observational and experimental data, a causal discovery process can identify the causal relationships between variables. A unique adaptive intervention design paradigm is presented in this work, where causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are for effectively recovered with practical budgetary considerations. In order to choose treatments that optimize information gain under these considerations, an iterative integer programming (IP) approach is proposed, which drastically reduces the number of experiments required. Simulations over a broad range of graph sizes and edge densities are used to assess the effectiveness of the suggested approach. Results show that the proposed adaptive IP approach achieves full causal graph recovery with fewer intervention iterations and variable manipulations than random intervention baselines, and it is also flexible enough to accommodate a variety of practical constraints.</description>
