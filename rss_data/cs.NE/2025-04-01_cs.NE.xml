      <title>Biologically Inspired Spiking Diffusion Model with Adaptive Lateral Selection Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lateral connection is a fundamental feature of biological neural circuits, facilitating local information processing and adaptive learning. In this work, we integrate lateral connections with a substructure selection network to develop a novel diffusion model based on spiking neural networks (SNNs). Unlike conventional artificial neural networks, SNNs employ an intrinsic spiking inner loop to process sequential binary spikes. We leverage this spiking inner loop alongside a lateral connection mechanism to iteratively refine the substructure selection network, enhancing model adaptability and expressivity. Specifically, we design a lateral connection framework comprising a learnable lateral matrix and a lateral mapping function, both implemented using spiking neurons, to dynamically update lateral connections. Through mathematical modeling, we establish that the proposed lateral update mechanism, under a well-defined local objective, aligns with biologically plausible synaptic plasticity principles. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, analyzing the role of substructure selection and lateral connection during training. Furthermore, quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our model consistently surpasses state-of-the-art SNN-based generative models across multiple benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>PlatMetaX: An Integrated MATLAB platform for Meta-Black-Box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The landscape of optimization problems has become increasingly complex, necessitating the development of advanced optimization techniques. Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO), which involves refining the optimization algorithms themselves via meta-learning, has emerged as a promising approach. Recognizing the limitations in existing platforms, we presents PlatMetaX, a novel MATLAB platform for MetaBBO with reinforcement learning. PlatMetaX integrates the strengths of MetaBox and PlatEMO, offering a comprehensive framework for developing, evaluating, and comparing optimization algorithms. The platform is designed to handle a wide range of optimization problems, from single-objective to multi-objective, and is equipped with a rich set of baseline algorithms and evaluation metrics. We demonstrate the utility of PlatMetaX through extensive experiments and provide insights into its design and implementation. PlatMetaX is available at: \href{https://github.com/Yxxx616/PlatMetaX}{https://github.com/Yxxx616/PlatMetaX}.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Integrated Layered Attention (AILA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Adaptive Integrated Layered Attention (AILA), a neural network architecture that combines dense skip connections with different mechanisms for adaptive feature reuse across network layers. We evaluate AILA on three challenging tasks: price forecasting for various commodities and indices (S&amp;P 500, Gold, US dollar Futures, Coffee, Wheat), image recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset, and sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset. In all cases, AILA matches strong deep learning baselines (LSTMs, Transformers, and ResNets), achieving it at a fraction of the training and inference time. Notably, we implement and test two versions of the model - AILA-Architecture 1, which uses simple linear layers as the connection mechanism between layers, and AILA-Architecture 2, which implements an attention mechanism to selectively focus on outputs from previous layers. Both architectures are applied in a single-task learning setting, with each model trained separately for individual tasks. Results confirm that AILA's adaptive inter-layer connections yield robust gains by flexibly reusing pertinent features at multiple network depths. The AILA approach thus presents an extension to existing architectures, improving long-range sequence modeling, image recognition with optimised computational speed, and SOTA classification performance in practice.</description>

      <title>SU-YOLO: Spiking Neural Network for Efficient Underwater Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for oceanic research and industrial safety inspections. However, the complex optical environment and the limited resources of underwater equipment pose significant challenges to achieving high accuracy and low power consumption. To address these issues, we propose Spiking Underwater YOLO (SU-YOLO), a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model. Leveraging the lightweight and energy-efficient properties of SNNs, SU-YOLO incorporates a novel spike-based underwater image denoising method based solely on integer addition, which enhances the quality of feature maps with minimal computational overhead. In addition, we introduce Separated Batch Normalization (SeBN), a technique that normalizes feature maps independently across multiple time steps and is optimized for integration with residual structures to capture the temporal dynamics of SNNs more effectively. The redesigned spiking residual blocks integrate the Cross Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) with the YOLO architecture to mitigate spike degradation and enhance the model's feature extraction capabilities. Experimental results on URPC2019 underwater dataset demonstrate that SU-YOLO achieves mAP of 78.8% with 6.97M parameters and an energy consumption of 2.98 mJ, surpassing mainstream SNN models in both detection accuracy and computational efficiency. These results underscore the potential of SNNs for engineering applications. The code is available in https://github.com/lwxfight/snn-underwater.</description>

      <title>Emergent representations in networks trained with the Forward-Forward algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18353v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Backpropagation algorithm has often been criticised for its lack of biological realism. In an attempt to find a more biologically plausible alternative, the recently introduced Forward-Forward algorithm replaces the forward and backward passes of Backpropagation with two forward passes. In this work, we show that the internal representations obtained by the Forward-Forward algorithm can organise into category-specific ensembles exhibiting high sparsity -- composed of a low number of active units. This situation is reminiscent of what has been observed in cortical sensory areas, where neuronal ensembles are suggested to serve as the functional building blocks for perception and action. Interestingly, while this sparse pattern does not typically arise in models trained with standard Backpropagation, it can emerge in networks trained with Backpropagation on the same objective proposed for the Forward-Forward algorithm.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Optimization of Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Survey and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning models trained on finite data lack a complete understanding of the physical world. On the other hand, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infused with such knowledge through the incorporation of mathematically expressible laws of nature into their training loss function. By complying with physical laws, PINNs provide advantages over purely data-driven models in limited-data regimes. This feature has propelled them to the forefront of scientific machine learning, a domain characterized by scarce and costly data. However, the vision of accurate physics-informed learning comes with significant challenges. This review examines PINNs for the first time in terms of model optimization and generalization, shedding light on the need for new algorithmic advances to overcome issues pertaining to the training speed, precision, and generalizability of today's PINN models. Of particular interest are the gradient-free methods of neuroevolution for optimizing the uniquely complex loss landscapes arising in PINN training. Methods synergizing gradient descent and neuroevolution for discovering bespoke neural architectures and balancing multiple conflicting terms in physics-informed learning objectives are positioned as important avenues for future research. Yet another exciting track is to cast neuroevolution as a meta-learner of generalizable PINN models.</description>

      <title>APTx: better activation function than MISH, SWISH, and ReLU's variants used in deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06119v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Activation Functions introduce non-linearity in the deep neural networks. This nonlinearity helps the neural networks learn faster and efficiently from the dataset. In deep learning, many activation functions are developed and used based on the type of problem statement. ReLU's variants, SWISH, and MISH are goto activation functions. MISH function is considered having similar or even better performance than SWISH, and much better than ReLU. In this paper, we propose an activation function named APTx which behaves similar to MISH, but requires lesser mathematical operations to compute. The lesser computational requirements of APTx does speed up the model training, and thus also reduces the hardware requirement for the deep learning model.

      <title>Nonlinear classification of neural manifolds with contextual information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how neural systems efficiently process information through distributed representations is a fundamental challenge at the interface of neuroscience and machine learning. Recent approaches analyze the statistical and geometrical attributes of neural representations as population-level mechanistic descriptors of task implementation. In particular, manifold capacity has emerged as a promising framework linking population geometry to the separability of neural manifolds. However, this metric has been limited to linear readouts. To address this limitation, we introduce a theoretical framework that leverages latent directions in input space, which can be related to contextual information. We derive an exact formula for the context-dependent manifold capacity that depends on manifold geometry and context correlations, and validate it on synthetic and real data. Our framework's increased expressivity captures representation reformatting in deep networks at early stages of the layer hierarchy, previously inaccessible to analysis. As context-dependent nonlinearity is ubiquitous in neural systems, our data-driven and theoretically grounded approach promises to elucidate context-dependent computation across scales, datasets, and models.</description>
