      <title>$CP$ asymmetries in $\tau\to K_S\pi\nu_\tau$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here the CP asymmetries in the decay rate and angular distributions of $\tau\to K_S\pi\nu_\tau$ decays in the Standard Model (SM) and beyond (BSM). The CP asymmetries in the SM are induced by the CP violation in $K^0-\bar{K}^0$ mixing. To investigate the BSM CP-violating (CPV) effects, a model-independent analysis is performed by using the low-energy effective field theory (LEFT) framework at $\mu=2$~GeV. If one further assumes the BSM physics to stem from above the electroweak scale, the LEFT shall then be matched onto the SM effective field theory (SMEFT), the operators of which contributing to $\tau\to K_S\pi\nu_\tau$ decays will also contribute to the neutron electric dipole moment (EDM) and $D^0-\bar{D}^0$ mixing. The stringent bounds from the latter suggest that no remarkable CPV effects can be observed in either the decay rate or the angular distributions. The prospects for future measurements of these observables are also mentioned.</description>

      <title>$B_c, B^{*}_c, B_s, B^{*}_s, D_s$ and $D^{*}_s$ mass shift in a nuclear medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, we estimate the in-medium mass shift of the two-flavored heavy mesons $B_c, B_c^*, B_s, B_s^*, D_s$ and $D_s^*$ in symmetric nuclear matter. The estimates are made by evaluating the lowest order one-loop self-energies. The enhanced excitations of intermediate state heavy-light quark mesons in symmetric nuclear matter are the origin of their negative mass shift. Our results show that the magnitude of the mass shift for the $B_c$ meson ($\bar{b} c$ or $b \bar{c}$) is larger than those of the $\eta_c (\bar{c} c)$ and $\eta_b (\bar{b} b)$, different from a naive expectation that it would be in-between of them. While, that of the $B_c^*$ shows the in-between of the $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$. We observe that the lighter vector meson excitation in each meson self-energy gives a dominant contribution for the corresponding meson mass shift, $B_c, B_s,$ and $D_s$.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI classification for parton density theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitatively connecting properties of parton distribution functions (PDFs, or parton densities) to the theoretical assumptions made within the QCD analyses which produce them has been a longstanding problem in HEP phenomenology. To confront this challenge, we introduce an ML-based explainability framework, $\texttt{XAI4PDF}$, to classify PDFs by parton flavor or underlying theoretical model using ResNet-like neural networks (NNs). By leveraging the differentiable nature of ResNet models, this approach deploys guided backpropagation to dissect relevant features of fitted PDFs, identifying x-dependent signatures of PDFs important to the ML model classifications. By applying our framework, we are able to sort PDFs according to the analysis which produced them while constructing quantitative, human-readable maps locating the x regions most affected by the internal theory assumptions going into each analysis. This technique expands the toolkit available to PDF analysis and adjacent particle phenomenology while pointing to promising generalizations.</description>

      <title>Muon-induced baryon number violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for charged-lepton flavor violation in muon capture on nuclei is a powerful probe of heavy new physics. A smoking gun signal for $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion is a monochromatic electron with energy almost equal to the muon mass. We show that light new physics can mimic this signature and that it can also lead to electrons above the $\mu \rightarrow e$ signal peak. A concrete example of such light new physics is $\mu^- $-nucleon annihilation into a light dark sector, which can produce an energetic $e^-$ as well as $e^+e^-$ byproducts. Due to the size of the muon mass, the exotic muon capture process can be kinematically allowed, while the otherwise stringent constraints, e.g., from proton decay, are kinematically forbidden. We also discuss other relevant constraints, including those from the stability of nuclei and muon capture in the interior of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>EFT at JADE: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we use the standard model effective field theory to search for signs of new physics beyond the reach of the LHC, we often wonder what we may learn from the effective field theory, and what it would look like to make a discovery via effective field theory. This article presents a case study that provides some answers to these questions. We apply the low-energy effective field theory to $e^+e^- \to \mu^+\mu^-$ data below the Z boson mass from the JADE experiment at DESY. The low-energy effective field theory allows the observation of physics beyond QED in the JADE data and furthermore, by matching the Wilson coefficients to the electroweak theory, a rough measurement of the masses of the W and Z bosons is possible. This rough measurement would have been sufficient to guide the construction of colliders such as the super proton-antiproton synchrotron or the large electron-positron collider, and so we anticipate that a discovery of new physics via effective field theory at the LHC would be similarly sufficient to guide the construction of future colliders.</description>

      <title>Testing the equivalence between the planar Gross-Neveu and Thirring models at $N=1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the Fierz identities predict that the Gross-Neveu and Thirring models should be equivalent when describing systems composed of a single fermionic flavor, $N=1$. Here, we consider the planar version of both models within the framework of the optimized perturbation theory at the two loop level, in order to verify if the predicted equivalence emerges explicitly when different temperature and density regimes are considered. At vanishing densities, our results indicate that both models indeed describe exactly the same thermodynamics, provided that $N=1$. However, at finite chemical potentials we find that the $N=1$ Fierz equivalence no longer holds. After examining the relevant free energies, we have identified the contributions which lead to this puzzling discrepancy. Finally, we discuss different frameworks in which this (so far open) problem could be further understood and eventually circumvented.</description>

      <title>The $q_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $\Delta\phi_{t\bar{t}}$ spectra in top-antitop hadroproduction at NNLL+NNLO: the interplay of soft-collinear resummation and Coulomb singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the differential transverse momentum and azimuthal decorrelation cross sections, $\mathrm{d}\sigma_{t\bar{t}}/\mathrm{d}q_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $\mathrm{d}\sigma_{t\bar{t}}/\mathrm{d}\Delta\phi_{t\bar{t}}$, in top-antitop pair production at the LHC up to NNLL$+$NNLO accuracy. Due to the emergence of Coulomb singularities in both the hard sector and the corresponding anomalous dimension as the relative $t\bar{t}$ pair velocity, $\beta_{t\bar{t}}$, approaches zero, extrapolating the soft-collinear resummation that is derived in the domain where the top and antitop quarks are kinematically well-separated into the full phase space is not trivial. Focussing on two observables that are insensitive to azimuthal asymmetric divergences, $q_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $\Delta\phi_{t\bar{t}}$, we will demonstrate that a literal application of a SCET$+$HQET based resummation onto $\mathrm{d}\sigma_{t\bar{t}}/\mathrm{d}q_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $\mathrm{d}\sigma_{t\bar{t}}/\mathrm{d}\Delta\phi_{t\bar{t}}$ is only possible up to NLL accuracy. Starting at NNLL, however, such a na\"ive procedure will develop power-like divergences in $\beta_{t\bar{t}}$ in the threshold regime. To this end, two prescriptions, dubbed the D- and R-schemes, are introduced to facilitate the extrapolation of the resummation framework from the well-separated region where $\beta_{t\bar{t}}\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$ to the threshold regime $\beta_{t\bar{t}}\to0$, enabling us to compute $\mathrm{d}\sigma_{t\bar{t}}/\mathrm{d}q_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $\mathrm{d}\sigma_{t\bar{t}}/\mathrm{d}\Delta\phi_{t\bar{t}}$ at NNLL$+$NNLO accuracy throughout. Further, by comparing the results of both formulations, we can assess the theoretical uncertainty caused by the truncation of the Coulomb-enhanced terms in the perturbative series.</description>

      <title>Early Dark Energy During Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of an early dark energy component (EDE) present during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) on the elemental abundances of deuterium D/H, and helium $Y_p$, as well as the effective relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$. We consider a simple model of EDE that is constant up to a critical time. After this critical time, the EDE transitions into either a radiation component that interacts with the electromagnetic plasma, a dark radiation component that is uncoupled from the plasma, or kination that is also uncoupled. We use measured values of the abundances and $N_{\rm eff}$ as determined by CMB observations to establish limits on the input parameters of this EDE model. In addition, we explore how those parameters are correlated with BBN inputs; the baryon to photon ratio $\eta_b$, neutron lifetime $\tau_n$, and number of neutrinos $N_\nu$. Finally, we study whether this setup can alleviate the tension introduced by recent measurements of the primordial helium abundance.</description>

      <title>A multicategory jet image classification framework using deep neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet point cloud images are high dimensional data structures that needs to be transformed to a separable feature space for machine learning algorithms to distinguish them with simple decision boundaries. In this article, the authors focus on jet category separability by particle and jet feature extraction, resulting in more efficient training of a simple deep neural network, resulting in a computational efficient interpretable model for jet classification. The methodology is tested with three to five categories of jets from the JetNet benchmark jet tagging dataset, resulting in comparable performance to particle flow network. This work demonstrates that high dimensional datasets represented in separable latent spaces lead to simpler architectures for jet classification.</description>

      <title>Charmless decays of the spin-2 partner of $X(3872)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Belle collaboration recently reported a promising candidate for the spin-2 $D^*\bar{D}^*$ partner of the $X(3872)$, called the $X_2$ for short, having a mass of $(4014.3 \pm 4.0 \pm 1.5)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and a width of $(4 \pm 11 \pm 6)~\mathrm{MeV} $. In present work, we assume the $X_2$ as a pure molecule of the $D^*\bar{D}^*$ under three cases, i.e., pure neutral components ($\theta = 0$), isospin singlet ($\theta = \pi/4$) and neutral components dominant ($\theta = \pi/6$), where $\theta$ is a phase angle describing the proportion of neutral and charged constituents. Using an effective Lagrangian approach, we calculated the partial widths of $X_2\to VV$ and $X_2 \to PP$ ($V$ and $P$ stand for light vector and pseudoscalar mesons, respectively). The predicted decay widths of $X_2 \to VV$ can reach a few hundreds of $\mathrm{keV}$, while the decay widths of $X_2 \to PP$ are about several tens of $\mathrm{keV}$. In addition, the effects from the proportion of neutral and charged constituent on the decay widths of $X_2\to VV$ and $PP$ are also investigated. We hope that the present calculations will be checked experimentally in the future.</description>

      <title>Gluon decay into heavy quark pair under a strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the extreme large magnetic field produced in the initial stage of non-central heavy-ion collision, the dynamical process of gluon decay into heavy quark pair will take place under an external field rather than in vacuum. Unlike in the vacuum case, where the process is forbidden by energy momentum conservation, under the external field, a process emerges considering the background energy which recovers the conservation. We calculate the gluon decay rate at leading order under a uniform magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the systematic uncertainty and biases introduced by theoretical assumptions needed to include large-$x$ DIS data in a global QCD analysis. Working in the CTEQ-JLab framework, we focus on different implementations of higher-twist corrections to the nucleon structure functions and of offshell PDF deformations in deuteron targets and discuss how their interplay impacts the extraction of the $d$-quark PDF and the calculation of the neutron structure function at large $x$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of heavy quarkonium in the spinning black hole background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the thermodynamics of heavy quarkonium in the spinning black hole background. Specifically, we investigate the effect of angular momentum on the interquark distance, free energy, binding energy, entropy, entropic force, and internal energy of heavy quarkonium from the thermodynamic relationship. Our findings indicate that the angular momentum reduces the maximum value of interquark distance, suggesting that it promotes the dissociation of quarkonium. Additionally, we observe that the angular momentum suppresses free energy. From the results of binding energy, the angular momentum favors the melting of meson into a free quark and antiquark. Moreover, the results show that angular momentum increases the entropy and entropic force, thus accelerates the dissociation of quarkonium. The angular momentum increases the internal energy at large interquark distance. Finally, we find that the angular momentum has a more pronounced effect on quarkonium when the axis of quark pair $Q\overline{Q}$ is transverse to the direction of angular momentum.</description>

      <title>On Deep inelastic Electron-Proton Scattering, the Gluon Density and DGLAP Evolution in the low-$x$, low-$Q^2$ domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A careful analysis of the experimental data on deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) by themselves, upon extending standard DGLAP evolution into the low-$x$, low-$Q^2$ domain including the frequent 1.9 GeV$^2$ starting scale for evolution, reveals inconsistency between the evolution prediction and the experimental results. It is futile to fit experimental data at a low-$Q^2$ input scale by unmodified standard evolution. Our result is supported by recent discussions in the literature on the unsatisfactory status of standard fits to the experimental data. The color dipole picture (CDP) quantitatively provides the magnitude of the deviation of standard evolution in the low-$x$, low $Q^2$ domain from experiment.</description>

      <title>A quantitative analysis of Gravitational Wave spectrum sourced from First-Order Chiral Phase Transition of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological first-order chiral phase transition of QCD, and for the first time calculate its parameters which can fully determine the gravitational wave spectrum. With the state-of-the-art calculation from the functional QCD method, we found that the large chemical potential of QCD phase transition results in very weak and fast first-order phase transitions at the temperature lower than $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ MeV. These results further suggest that the GW signals of NANOGrav are very unlikely sourced from the chiral phase transition of QCD.</description>

      <title>Current Status of the Standard Model Prediction for the B_s -&gt; mu^+ mu^- Branching Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare decay B_s -&gt; mu^+ mu^- provides an important constraint on possible deviations from the Standard Model in b-s-l-l interactions. The present weighted average of its branching ratio measurements amounts to (3.34 \pm 0.27) x 10^-9, which remains in good agreement with the theoretical prediction of (3.64 \pm 0.12) x 10^-9 within the Standard Model. In the present paper, we review calculations that have contributed to this prediction, and discuss the associated uncertainties.</description>

      <title>An event generator for neutrino-induced Deep Inelastic Scattering and applications to neutrino astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the recently presented, fully exclusive, next-to-leading-order accurate event generator for the simulation of massless neutral- and charged-current deep inelastic scattering (DIS) to the case of incoming neutrinos. The generator can be used to study neutrino-nucleon interactions at (ultra) high energies, and is relevant for a range of fixed-target collider experiments and large-volume neutrino detectors, investigating atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. The matching with multi-purpose event generators such as PYTHIA 8 is performed with the POWHEG method, and accounts for parton showering and non-perturbative effects such as hadronization. This makes it possible to investigate higher-order perturbative corrections to realistic observables, such as the distribution of charged particles. To illustrate the capabilities of the code we provide predictions for several differential distributions in fixed-target collisions for neutrino energies up to 1 PeV.</description>

      <title>CP Violation of Baryon Decays from $N\pi$ Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a long-standing puzzle that the CP violation (CPV) in the baryon systems has never been well established in experiments, while the CPV of mesons have been observed by decades. In this paper, we propose that the CPV of baryon decays can be generated by the scatterings of a nucleon and a pion into some final states, i.e. $N\pi$ scatterings. Benefited by the fruitful data of $N\pi$ scatterings, we can model-independently analyse the strong phases of $b$-baryon decays using the partial wave amplitudes of $N\pi$ scatterings. This makes a great advantage to predict the CPV of baryon decays. We study the processes of $\Lambda_b^0\to (p\pi^+\pi^-)h^-$, $(p\pi^0)h^-$ with $h=\pi$ or $K$. It is found that the total CPV of the above processes in the invariant mass region of $N\pi$ scatterings are at the order of several percent. More importantly, the regional CPV in the Dalitz plot can reach as large as $20\%$. Therefore, we suggest to measure the CPV of these processes, which has a large possibility to achieve the first observation of CPV in the baryon system.</description>

      <title>Regge trajectories for the hidden bottom tetraquarks in the diquark picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the newly proposed Regge trajectory relation for the heavy-light diquarks alongside the Regge trajectory formula for the heavy-heavy systems to investigate the hidden bottom tetraquarks $(bq)(\bar{b}\bar{q}')$ $(q,\,q'=u,\,d,\,s)$. The Regge trajectory formulas for the hidden bottom tetraquarks are obtained. The masses of the $\lambda$-mode excited states and the $\rho$-mode excited states of the hidden bottom tetraquarks are estimated. Additionally, the $\lambda$-trajectories and the $\rho$-trajectories of the tetraquarks with hidden bottom are discussed. We find that the behavior of the $\rho$-trajectories is different from that of the $\lambda$-trajectories. The $\rho$-trajectories behave as $M{\sim}x_{\rho}^{1/2}$ $(x_{\rho}=n_r,\,l)$ because the $\rho$-mode excitations are in diquark and antidiquark, with both the diquark $(bq)$ and antidiquark $(\bar{b}\bar{q}')$ being the heavy-light systems. Conversely, the $\lambda$-trajectories behave as $M{\sim}x_{\lambda}^{2/3}$ $(x_{\lambda}=N_r,\,L)$ because the $\lambda$-mode excitations occure between diquark $(bq)$ and antidiquark $(\bar{b}\bar{q}')$, with the the diquark $(bq)$ and antidiquark $(\bar{b}\bar{q}')$ forming a heavy-heavy system $(bq)(\bar{b}\bar{q}')$. Moreover, not only the $\lambda$-trajectories but also the $\rho$-trajectories for the hidden bottom tetraquarks are concave downwards in the $(M^2,\,x)$ plane.</description>

      <title>A new possible way to detect Axion Anti-quark Nuggets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The axion anti-quark nugget (A$\bar{\mathrm{Q}}$N) model was developed to explain in a natural way the asymmetry between matter and antimatter in Universe. In this hypothesis, a similitude between the dark and the visible components exists. The lack of observability of any type of dark matter up to now, in particular A$\bar{\mathrm{Q}}$Ns, requires finding new ways of detecting these particles, if they exist. In spite of strong interaction with visible matter, for such objects a very small ratio of cross section to mass is expected and thus huge detector systems are necessary. This paper presents a new idea for the direct detection of the A$\bar{\mathrm{Q}}$Ns using minerals as natural rock deposits acting as paleo-detectors, where the latent signals of luminescence produced by interactions of A$\bar{\mathrm{Q}}$Ns are registered and can be identified as an increased and symmetrical deposited dose. The estimates were made for minerals widely distributed on Earth, for which the TL signal is intense and if the thermal conditions are constant and with low temperatures, the lifetime of the latent signals is kept for geological time scales.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing a Heavy Neutral Lepton at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy lepton singlets $N$ slightly mixed with a standard neutrino $\nu_\ell$ are usually searched at the LHC in the trilepton plus $p_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}$ channel: $pp \to W^+ \to \ell^+ N$ with $N\to \ell^- W^+ \to \ell^- \ell'^+ \nu$. We show that for $m_N&gt;m_W$ the mass of the heavy lepton can be reconstructed. For $m_N\approx 90$-$130$ GeV and the current luminosity (138 fb$^{-1}$ at 13 TeV), we estimate that this reconstruction would set the bound on $|V_{\ell N}|^2$ at $4\times 10^{-4}$, versus the limit around $2\times 10^{-3}$ obtained in a recent CMS analysis or $|V_{\ell N}|^2&lt;10^{-3}$ from flavor and electroweak precision data.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Schwinger mechanism in QCD, and Fredholm alternatives theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel implementation of the Schwinger mechanism in QCD, which fixes uniquely the scale of the effective gluon mass and streamlines considerably the procedure of multiplicative renormalization. The key advantage of this method stems from the nonlinear nature of the dynamical equation that generates massless poles in the longitudinal sector of the three-gluon vertex. An exceptional feature of this approach is an extensive cancellation involving the components of the integral expression that determines the gluon mass; it is triggered once the Schwinger-Dyson equation of the pole-free part of the three-gluon vertex has been appropriately exploited. It turns out that this cancellation is driven by the so-called Fredholm alternatives theorem, which operates among the set of integral equations describing this system. Quite remarkably, in the linearized approximation this theorem enforces the exact masslessness of the gluon. Instead, the nonlinearity induced by the full treatment of the relevant kernel evades this theorem, allowing for the emergence of a nonvanishing mass. The numerical results obtained from the resulting equations are compatible with the lattice findings, and may be further refined through the inclusion of the remaining fundamental vertices of the theory.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of fragmentation functions to charged hadrons with high-precision data from the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fragmentation functions (FFs) are essential non-perturbative QCD inputs for predicting hadron production cross sections in high energy scatterings. In this study, we present a joint determination of FFs for light charged hadrons through a global analysis at next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD. Our analysis incorporates a wide range of precision measurements from the LHC, as well as data from electron-positron collisions and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scatterings. By including measurements of jet fragmentation at the LHC in our global analysis, we are able to impose strong constraints on the gluon FFs. A careful selection of hadron kinematics is applied to ensure the validity of factorization and perturbative calculations of QCD. In addition, we introduce several methodological advances in fitting, resulting in a flexible parametrization form and the inclusion of theoretical uncertainties from perturbative calculations. Our best-fit predictions show very good agreement with the global data, with $\chi^2/N_{pt}\sim 0.90$. We also generate a large number of Hessian error sets to estimate uncertainties and correlations of the extracted FFs. FFs to charged pions (kaons and protons) are well constrained for momentum fractions down to 0.01 (0.1). Total momentum of partons carried by light charged hadrons are determined precisely. Their values for $u$, $d$ quarks and gluon saturate at about 50\% for a lower cut of the momentum fraction of 0.01. Pulls from individual datasets and impact of various choices of the analysis are also studied in details. Additionally, we present an update of the FMNLO program used for calculating hadron production cross sections. Our FFs, including the error sets (denoted as NPC23), are publicly available in the form of LHAPDF6 grids.</description>

      <title>Radiative decays of $P$-wave bottom baryons from light-cone sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a comprehensive investigation on the radiative decays of $P$-wave bottom baryons using the light-cone sum rule method. We analyze their electromagnetic transitions into ground-state bottom baryons together with a photon. Together with their mass spectra and strong decays investigated in Refs. \cite{Yang:2020zrh,Tan:2023opd}, a rather complete QCD sum rule study has been done to understand the $P$-wave singly bottom baryons within the framework of heavy quark effective theory. As summarized in Tables~\ref{tab:candidate}/\ref{tab:candidate6f}, some $P$-wave bottom baryons have limited strong decay widths so that their radiative decay widths become non-negligible. We propose to study these excited bottom baryons and their radiative decays in the future Belle-II, BESIII, and LHCb experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a chiral effective field theory-based approach to connect $DD^*$ scattering observables at the physical and variable pion masses accessible in lattice QCD simulations. We incorporate all relevant scales associated with three-body $DD\pi$ dynamics and the left-hand cut induced by the one-pion exchange for pion masses higher than the physical one, as required by analyticity and unitarity. By adjusting the contact interactions to match experimental data at the physical pion mass and lattice finite-volume energy levels at $m_{\pi} = 280$ MeV, we predict the trajectory of the $T_{cc}$ pole as a function of the pion mass, finding it consistent with the hadronic-molecule scenario. In particular, we find that the explicit treatment of the one-pion exchange has a pronounced effect on the pole trajectory for $m_\pi \gtrsim 230$ MeV by pushing it into the complex energy plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results for the Yukawa-enhanced and Higgs self-coupling type electroweak corrections to di-Higgs production in gluon fusion. The calculation of the corresponding four-scale, two-loop amplitude is carried out retaining the exact symbolic dependence on all masses and scales during the reduction to master integrals. The resulting integrals are then evaluated at high precision using both the series expansion of the differential equations and sector decomposition. Differential cross sections for the di-Higgs invariant mass and the transverse momentum of a Higgs boson are shown, where we find that the corrections are most pronounced at low invariant mass and transverse momentum.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay from Scalar Leptoquarks: Interplay with Neutrino Mass and Flavor Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of neutrinoless double beta decay and its interplay with low-energy flavor observables in a radiative neutrino mass model with scalar leptoquarks $S_1(\bar{3},1,1/3)$ and $\widetilde{R}_2(3,2,1/6)$. We carve out the parameter region consistent with constraints from neutrino mass and mixing, from collider searches, as well as from measurements of several flavor observables, including muon and electron anomalous magnetic moments, charged lepton flavor violation and rare (semi)leptonic kaon and $B$-meson decays. We perform a global analysis to all existing constraints and show the (anti)correlations between all relevant Yukawa couplings satisfying these restrictions. We find that the most stringent constraint on the parameter space comes from $\mu \to e$ conversion in nuclei. We also point out a tension between the $R_{D^{(*)}}$ and muon $(g-2)$ anomalies in this context. Taking benchmark points from these combined allowed regions, we study the implications for neutrinoless double beta decay including the canonical light neutrino and the leptoquark contributions. We find that for normal ordering of neutrino masses, the leptoquark contribution removes the cancellation region that occurs for the canonical case. The effective mass in presence of leptoquarks can lie in the desert region between the standard normal and inverted ordering cases, and this can be probed in future ton-scale experiments like LEGEND-1000 and nEXO. Taking suitable representative values of Yukawa couplings, we also obtain stringent constraints on leptoquark masses from different observables.</description>

      <title>Hyperpolyadic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01366v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of division algebras, the hyperpolyadic algebras, which correspond to the binary division algebras $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{H}$, $\mathbb{O}$ without considering new elements. First, we use the matrix polyadization procedure proposed earlier which increases the dimension of the algebra. The algebras obtained in this way obey binary addition and a nonderived $n$-ary multiplication and their subalgebras are division $n$-ary algebras. For each invertible element we define a new norm which is polyadically multiplicative, and the corresponding map is a $n$-ary homomorphism. We define a polyadic analog of the Cayley-Dickson construction which corresponds to the consequent embedding of monomial matrices from the polyadization procedure. We then obtain another series of $n$-ary algebras corresponding to the binary division algebras which have a higher dimension, that is proportional to the intermediate arities. Second, a new polyadic product of vectors in any vector space is defined. Endowed with this product the vector space becomes a polyadic algebra which is a division algebra under some invertibility conditions, and its structure constants are computed. Third, we propose a new iterative process ("imaginary tower"), which leads to nonunital nonderived ternary division algebras of half the dimension, which we call "half-quaternions" and "half-octonions". The latter are not subalgebras of the binary division algebras, but subsets only, since they have different arity. Nevertheless, they are actually ternary division algebras, because they allow division, and their nonzero elements are invertible. From the multiplicativity of the introduced "half-quaternion" norm we obtain the ternary analog of the sum of two squares identity. We prove that the unitless ternary division algebra of imaginary "half-octonions" we have introduced is ternary alternative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glitches are sudden spin-up events that interrupt the gradual spin-down of rotating neutron stars. They are believed to arise from the rapid unpinning of vortices in the neutron star inner crust. The analogy between the inner crust of neutron stars and dipolar supersolids allows to investigate glitches. Employing such analogy, we numerically analyze the vortex trapping mechanism and how the matter density distribution influences glitches. These results pave the way for the quantum simulation of celestial bodies in laboratories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the decomposition of gauge-theory amplitudes into kinematic and color factors, the color factors (at a given loop order $L$) span a proper subspace of the extended trace space (which consists of single and multiple traces of generators of the gauge group, graded by powers of $N$). Using an iterative process, we systematically construct the $L$-loop color space of four-point amplitudes of fields in the adjoint representation of SU($N$), SO($N$), or Sp($N$). We define the null space as the orthogonal complement of the color space. For SU($N$), we confirm the existence of four independent null vectors (for $L \ge 2$) and for SO($N$) and Sp($N$), we establish the existence of seventeen independent null vectors (for $L \ge 5$). Each null vector corresponds to a group-theory constraint on the color-ordered amplitudes of the gauge theory.</description>

      <title>From Inflation to Quintessence: a History of the Universe in String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a type IIB 4D string model with stabilised moduli which is able to describe the history of the universe from inflation to quintessence. The underlying Calabi-Yau volume is controlled by two moduli which are stabilised by perturbative effects. The lighter of them drives Fibre Inflation at a large energy scale. The two associated axions are ultra-light since they are lifted only at the non-perturbative level. The lighter of them can drive quintessence if its decay constant is large enough to prevent quantum diffusion during inflation from ruining the initial conditions. The right dark energy scale can be obtained via a large suppression from poly-instanton effects. The heavier axion gives a negligible contribution to dark matter since it starts oscillating after matter-radiation equality. If instead none of the two axions has a large decay constant, a mild alignment allows the lighter axion to drive quintessence, while the heavier can be at most a few percent of dark matter due to isocurvature and UV bounds. In both cases dark matter can also come from either primordial black holes or the QCD axion.</description>

      <title>Global aspects of $3$-form gauge theory: implications for axion-Yang-Mills systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the proposition that axion-Yang-Mills systems are characterized by a $3$-form gauge theory in the deep infrared regime. This hypothesis is rigorously examined by initially developing a systematic framework for analyzing $3$-form gauge theory coupled to an axion, specifically focusing on its global properties. The theory consists of a BF term deformed by marginal and irrelevant operators and describes a network of vacua separated by domain walls converging at the junction of an axion string. It encompasses $(-1)$-, $0$-, and $3$-form spontaneously broken global symmetries. Utilizing this framework, in conjunction with effective field theory techniques and 't Hooft anomaly-matching conditions, we argue that the $3$-form gauge theory faithfully captures the infrared physics of the axion-Yang-Mills system. The ultraviolet theory is an $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory endowed with a massless Dirac fermion coupled to a complex scalar and is characterized by chiral and genuine $\mathbb{Z}_m^{(1)}$ 1-form center symmetries, with a mixed anomaly between them. It features two scales: the vev of the complex scalar, $v$, and the strong-coupling scale, $\Lambda$, with $\Lambda \ll v$. Below $v$, the fermion decouples and two symmetries emerge: $U(1)^{(2)}$ $2$-form winding and $\mathbb Z_N^{(1)}$ $1$-form center symmetries. As we flow below $\Lambda$, matching the mixed anomaly necessitates introducing a dynamical $3$-form gauge field of $U(1)^{(2)}$, which appears as the incarnation of a long-range tail of the color field. The infrared theory possesses spontaneously broken chiral, emergent $3$-form, and emergent $(-1)$-form global symmetries. It passes several checks, among which: it displays the expected restructuring in the hadronic sector upon transition between the vacua, and it is consistent under the gauging of the genuine $\mathbb Z_m^{(1)}\subset \mathbb Z_N^{(1)}$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Analog Quantum Simulator of a Quantum Field Theory with Fermion-Spin Systems in Silicon</title>

Abstract: Simulating fermions coupled to spin degrees of freedom, relevant for a range of quantum field theories, represents a promising application for quantum simulators. Mapping fermions to qubits is challenging in $2+1$ and higher spacetime dimensions, and mapping bosons demands substantial quantum-computational overhead. These features complicate the realization of mixed fermion-boson quantum systems in digital quantum computers. We propose a native fermion-(large-)spin analog quantum simulator by utilizing dopant arrays in silicon. Specifically, we show how to use a dynamical lattice of coupled nuclear spins and conduction-band electrons to realize a quantum field theory: an extended Jackiw-Rebbi model involving coupled fermions and quantum rotors. We demonstrate the feasibility of observing dynamical mass generation and a confinement-deconfinement quantum phase transition in 1+1 dimensions on this platform, even in the presence of strong long-range Coulomb interactions. Furthermore, we employ finite-temperature Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov simulations to investigate the dynamics of mass generation in two-dimensional square and honeycomb arrays, showing that this phenomenon can be simulated with realistic experimental parameters. Our findings reveal two distinct phases, and demonstrate robustness against the addition of Coulomb interactions. Finally, we discuss experimental signatures of the phases through transport and local charge sensing in dopant arrays. This study lays the foundation for quantum simulations of quantum field theories exhibiting fermions coupled to spin degrees of freedom using donors in silicon.</description>

Abstract: High-energy collisions at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) will generate a substantial flux of particles along the beam collision axis that current LHC experiments cannot access. Multi-particle production in the far-forward region is particularly relevant to astroparticle physics. High-energy cosmic rays initiate extensive air showers (EASs) in the atmosphere, driven by hadron-ion collisions at low momentum transfer in the non-perturbative regime of QCD. Therefore, understanding high-energy hadronic interactions in the forward region is essential for interpreting EAS data and estimating backgrounds for astrophysical neutrino searches, among other applications. The Forward Physics Facility (FPF) is a proposal to construct a new underground cavern at the HL-LHC dedicated to hosting a range of experiments aimed at detecting particles beyond the current capabilities of LHC experiments. This article will provide an update on the current planning status of the FPF and emphasize its synergies with astroparticle physics.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Imaging of Pion using Lattice QCD: Generalized Parton Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report a lattice calculation of $x$-dependent valence pion generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at zero skewness with multiple values of the momentum transfer $-t$. The calculations are based on an $N_f=2+1$ gauge ensemble of highly improved staggered quarks with Wilson-Clover valence fermion. The lattice spacing is 0.04 fm, and the pion valence mass is tuned to be 300 MeV. We determine the Lorentz-invariant amplitudes of the quasi-GPD matrix elements for both symmetric and asymmetric momenta transfers with similar values and show the equivalence of both frames. Then, focusing on the asymmetric frame, we utilize a hybrid scheme to renormalize the quasi-GPD matrix elements obtained from the lattice calculations. After the Fourier transforms, the quasi-GPDs are then matched to the light-cone GPDs within the framework of large momentum effective theory with improved matching, including the next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative corrections, and leading renormalon and renormalization group resummations. We also present the 3-dimensional image of the pion in impact-parameter space through the Fourier transform of the momentum transfer $-t$.</description>

Abstract: Inflation as the leading paradigm depicting the very early universe physics could leave imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Using currently available CMB observations, we give the first direct evidence of inflation. We discuss the theoretical implications of our results including the energy scale of inflation, inflaton field excursion, Hubble expansion rate during inflation, equation of state of inflation, primordial tensor non-Gaussianity, primordial tensor power spectrum, B-mode anisotropy and inflationary gravitational wave background.</description>

Abstract: Decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons $D$, $D_s$, $\eta_c$ and vector mesons $D^*$, $D_s^*$, $J/\psi$ are determined from $N_f=2+1$ lattice QCD at a lattice spacing $a\sim0.08$ fm. For vector mesons, the decay constants defined by tensor currents are given in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme at $2$ GeV. The calculation is performed on domain wall fermion configurations generated by the RBC-UKQCD Collaborations and the overlap fermion action is used for the valence quarks. Comparing the current results with our previous ones at a coarser lattice spacing $a\sim0.11$ fm gives us a better understanding of the discretization error. We obtain $f_{D_s^*}^T(\overline{\rm MS},\text{2 GeV})/f_{D_s^*}=0.907(20)$ with a better precision than our previous result. Combining our $f_{D_s^*}=277(11)$ MeV with the total width of $D_s^*$ determined in a recent work gives a branching fraction $4.26(52)\times10^{-5}$ for $D_s^*$ leptonic decay.</description>

      <title>Role of clustered nuclear geometry in particle production through p-C and p-O collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range multi-particle correlations in heavy-ion collisions have shown conclusive evidence of the hydrodynamic behavior of strongly interacting matter, and are associated with the final-state azimuthal momentum anisotropy. In small collision systems, azimuthal anisotropy can be influenced by the hadronization mechanism and residual jet-like correlations. Thus, one of the motives of the planned p--O and O--O collisions at the LHC and RHIC is to understand the origin of small system collectivity. As the anisotropic flow coefficients ($v_n$) are sensitive to the initial-state effects including nuclear shape, deformation, and charge density profiles, studies involving $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O nuclei are transpiring due to the presence of exotic $\alpha$ ($^{4}$He) clusters in such nuclei. In this study, for the first time, we investigate the effects of nuclear $\alpha$--clusters on the azimuthal anisotropy of the final-state hadrons in p--C and p--O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 9.9$ TeV within a multi-phase transport model framework. We report the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) and pseudorapidity ($\eta$) spectra, participant eccentricity ($\epsilon_2$) and triangularity ($\epsilon_3$), and estimate the elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$) of the final-state hadrons using the two-particle cumulant method. These results are compared with a model-independent Sum of Gaussians (SOG) type nuclear density profile for $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O nuclei.</description>

Abstract: The nature of dark matter in the Universe is still an open question in astrophysics and cosmology. Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) offer a compelling solution, and traditionally ground-based experiments have eagerly, but to date unsuccessfully, searched for these hypothetical low-mass particles that are expected to be produced in large quantities in the strong electromagnetic fields in the interior of stars. This work offers a fresh look at axions and ALPs by leveraging their conversion into X-rays in the magnetic field of the Sun's atmosphere rather than a laboratory magnetic field. Unique data acquired with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) during the solar minimum in 2020 allows us to set stringent limits on the coupling of axions to photons using state-of-the-art magnetic field models of the solar atmosphere. We report pioneering limits on the axion-photon coupling strength of $6.9\times 10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at 95\% confidence level for axion masses $m_a \lesssim 2\times 10^{-7}$ eV, surpassing current ground-based searches and further probing unexplored regions of the axion-photon coupling parameter space up to axion masses of $m_a \lesssim 5\times 10^{-4}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Constraints on self-interaction cross-sections of dark matter in universal bound states from direct detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lambda- Cold Dark Matter (LambdaCDM) has been successful at explaining the large-scale structures in the universe but faces severe issues on smaller scales when compared to observations. Introducing self-interactions between dark matter particles claims to provide a solution to the small-scale issues in the LambdaCDM simulations while being consistent with the observations at large scales. The existence of the energy region in which these self-interactions between dark matter particles come close to saturating the S-wave unitarity bound can result in the formation of dark matter bound states called darkonium. In this scenario, all the low energy scattering properties are determined by a single parameter, the inverse scattering length gamma. In this work, we set bounds on gamma by studying the impact of darkonium on the observations at direct detection experiments using data from CRESST-III and XENON1T. The exclusion limits on gamma are then subsequently converted to exclusion limits on the self-interaction cross-section and compared with the constraints from astrophysics and N-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Cutkosky rules and 1-loop $\kappa$-deformed amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the Cutkosky cutting rules are still valid term by term in the expansion in powers of $\kappa$ of the $\kappa$-deformed 1-loop correction to the propagator. We first present a general argument which relates each term in the expansion to a non-deformed amplitude containing additional propagators with mass $M&gt;\kappa$. We then show the same thing more pragmatically, by reducing the singularity structure of the coefficients in the expansion of the $\kappa$-deformed amplitude, to the singularity structure of non-deformed loop amplitudes, by using algebraic and analytic identities. We will explicitly show this up to second order in $1/\kappa$, but the technique can be generalized to higher orders in $1/\kappa$. Both the abstract and the more direct approach easily generalize to different deformed theories. We will then compute the full imaginary part of the $\kappa$-deformed 1-loop correction to the propagator in a specific model, up to second order in the expansion in $1/\kappa$, highlighting the usefulness of the approach for the phenomenology of deformed models. This explicitly confirms previous qualitative arguments concerning the behaviour of the decay width of unstable particles in the considered model.</description>

Abstract: A systematic study of intermediate invariant mass dilepton production in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV is performed, using next-to-leading-order (NLO) thermal QCD dilepton emission rates with a multistage dynamical approach which includes event-by-event IP-Glasma initial conditions, relativistic viscous fluid dynamics, and a hadronic afterburner. Considering dilepton yield and anisotropic flow, special attention is paid to the out-of-equilibrium aspects, both thermal and chemical, and to the contribution of the Drell-Yan process. The relative contribution of each of those different channels to dilepton observables is calculated and discussed.</description>

Abstract: A comprehensive set of studies has been conducted to measure the fiducial differential cross sections of Higgs boson production by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. These analyses are based on proton-proton collision data collected by both experiments at the CERN LHC, with a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of up to 140 fb$^{-1}$. Fiducial Differential cross sections are measured for various observables sensitive to the production and decay of the Higgs boson. All measurements align with Standard Model predictions. The results are used to constrain potential anomalous interactions between the Higgs boson and other Standard Model particles.</description>

      <title>Constraints on blue and red tilted primordial power spectra using dwarf galaxy properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the standard $\Lambda$+Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model is well tested on large scales, the primordial power spectrum may deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM spectrum on small scales due to specific dark matter properties or alternative inflationary models. These deviations affect the formation of dark matter structure, which subsequently leads to different observable properties of galaxies. In this work, we study the impact of a blue and red tilted power spectrum on the central density of dwarf galaxies. To do this, we model densities of dwarf galaxies using a combination of high-resolution numerical simulations and galaxy formation model. The model galaxies in $\Lambda$CDM are consistent with observations of 41 faint dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. The deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM power spectrum are constrained by the central matter densities of dwarf galaxies, which set stringent constraints on the possible small-scale tilt of the primordial power spectrum, improving on the current limits. Moreover, similar analysis can be applied to test any feature in the power spectrum at small scales between $k\sim 10-100$~Mpc$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Fermion Self-Energy and Effective Mass in a Noisy Magnetic Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the propagation of QED fermions in the presence of a classical background magnetic field with white-noise stochastic fluctuations. The effects of the magnetic field fluctuations are incorporated into the fermion and photon propagators in a quasi-particle picture, which we developed in previous works using the {\it replica trick}. By considering the strong-field limit, here we explicitly calculate the fermion self-energy involving radiative contributions at first-order in $\alpha_\text{em}$, in order to obtain the noise-averaged mass of the fermion propagating in the fluctuating magnetized medium. Our analytical results reveal a leading double-logarithmic contribution $\sim \left[\ln \left( |e B|/m^2 \right)\right]^2$ to the mass, with an imaginary part representing a spectral broadening proportional to the magnetic noise auto-correlation $\Delta$. While a uniform magnetic field already breaks Lorentz invariance, inducing the usual separation into two orthogonal subspaces (perpendicular and parallel with respect to the field), the presence of magnetic noise further breaks the remaining symmetry, thus leading to distinct spectral widths associated with fermion and anti-fermion, and their spin projection in the quasi-particle picture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of cosmological scalar perturbations in the case that the background radiation is weakly coupled to a light scalar field $\phi$. The light scalar $\phi$ is a homogeneous background field with a large initial value. In the radiation-dominated Universe, the coupling term introduces an effective mass to $\phi$ and the background ultra-relativistic particles. The oscillations of $\phi$ result in the periodic change of the equation of state parameter and the sound speed, which provides a novel mechanism to amplify subhorizon scalar perturbations through parametric resonance. The amplification of scalar perturbations leads to a stochastic gravitational-waves background~(SGWB) expected to be observed by multiband gravitational wave observers. The observation of the SGWB helps to determine the initial value of $\phi$ and the coupling strength of the interaction. This mechanism is generally applicable to the interactions that introduce an effective mass, and we take the interaction between $\phi$ and electrons as a concrete example to illustrate the result. We find that under the condition that the coupling coefficient $\lambda=10^{-16}$ and the initial value $\phi_i=10^{18}$ GeV, the resulting SGWB spectrum is expected to be observed by the future observers including LISA, $Taiji$, DECIGO and BBO.</description>

Abstract: In the previous work, we discussed the cross section and the detection of 4.4-MeV $\gamma$ rays produced in the neutrino neutral-current (NC) reaction $^{16}$O($\nu, \nu^{\prime}$)$^{16}$O(12.97 MeV and 12.53 MeV, $2^-$) in a water Cherenkov detector at the low energy below 100 MeV. In this report, we further investigated both the charged-current (CC) reaction $^{16}$O($\bar\nu_e, e^+$)$^{16}$N(0 MeV, $2^-$) and the NC reaction$^{16}$O($\nu, \nu^{\prime}$)$^{16}$O(12.97 MeV and 12.53 MeV, $2^-$), producing high-energy $\gamma$ rays, in which the more solid identification of the reactions can be applied via the coincidence method.</description>

      <title>Observational prospects of self-interacting scalar superradiance with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current- and next-generation gravitational-wave observatories may reveal new, ultralight bosons. Through the superradiance process, these theoretical particle candidates can form clouds around astrophysical black holes and result in detectable gravitational-wave radiation. In the absence of detections, constraints$-$contingent on astrophysical assumptions$-$have been derived using LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data on boson masses. However, the searches for ultralight scalars to date have not adequately considered self-interactions between particles. Self-interactions that significantly alter superradiance dynamics are generically present for many scalar models, including axion-like dark matter candidates and string axions. We implement the most complete treatment of particle self-interactions available to determine the gravitational-wave signatures expected from superradiant scalar clouds and revisit the constraints obtained in a past gravitational-wave search targeting the black hole in Cygnus X-1. We also project the reach of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories to scalar particle parameter space in the mass-coupling plane. We find that while proposed observatories have insufficient reach to self-interactions that can halt black hole spin-down, next-generation observatories are essential for expanding the search beyond gravitational parameter space and can reach a mass and interaction scale of $\sim 10^{-13}-10^{-12}$ eV/c$^2$ and $\gtrsim 10^{17}$ GeV, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the overlap reduction function of pulsar timing array searches for gravitational waves in modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) searches for gravitational waves (GWs) aim to detect a characteristic correlation pattern in the timing residuals of galactic millisecond pulsars. This pattern is described by the PTA overlap reduction function (ORF) \Gamma_ab(\xi_ab), which is known as the Hellings--Downs (HD) curve in general relativity (GR). In theories of modified gravity, the HD curve often receives corrections. Assuming, e.g., a subluminal GW phase velocity, one finds a drastically enhanced ORF in the limit of small angular separations between pulsar a and pulsar b in the sky, \xi_ab --&gt; 0. In particular, working in harmonic space and performing an approximate resummation of all multipole contributions, the auto correlation coefficient \Gamma_aa seems to diverge. In this paper, we confirm that this divergence is unphysical and provide an exact and analytical expression for \Gamma_aa in dependence of the pulsar distance L_a and the GW phase velocity v_ph. In the GR limit and assuming a large pulsar distance, our expression reduces to \Gamma_aa = 1. In the case of subluminal phase velocity, we show that the regularization of the naive divergent result is a finite-distance effect, meaning that \Gamma_aa scales linearly with fL_a, where f is the GW frequency. For superluminal phase velocity (subluminal group velocity), which is relevant in the case of massive gravity, we correct an earlier analytical result for \Gamma_ab. Our results pave the way for fitting modified-gravity theories with nonstandard phase velocity to PTA data, which requires a proper understanding of the auto correlation coefficient \Gamma_aa.</description>

      <title>The Nature of the High-energy Gamma-Ray Radiation Associated with the High-redshift Blazar B3 1343+451</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-redshift blazars are the most powerful extragalactic astrophysical sources ever detected in the high-energy gamma-ray band. In this study, we present a temporal and spectral analysis of the high-redshift blazar B3 1343+451 based on 14 years of Fermi-LAT observations, spanning from 2008 August 4 to 2022 June 6 (MJD 54686-59733). We extract a seven-day binned $\gamma$-ray light curve in the energy range 0.1--500 GeV and identify seven outburst periods with a peak flux of $&gt;4.32\times10^{-7} \rm ph \cdot cm^{-2} \cdot s^{-1}$. The highest seven day flux (above 100 MeV) reaches $(8.06\pm0.56)\times10^{-7} \rm erg \ cm^{-2} \ s^{-1}$ on MJD = 56,177.16, which is 10 times higher than the flux in the quiescent period. To understand the properties of distant blazar jets, we employ a standard one-zone leptonic scenario and model the multiwavelength spectral energy distributions of one quiescent and seven flaring periods. We find that the $\gamma$-ray spectrum is better reproduced if we assume that the dissipation region of the jet, $R_{\rm diss}$, is located within the molecular torus, where infrared emission is the dominant external photon field. We infer that the jets in higher-redshift blazars have larger power and kinetic energy, where the kinetic energy is significantly greater than the radiation power, and the jet production efficiency suggests that we need to lower the accretion efficiency. These results imply that B3 1343+451 may have a standard thin disk surrounding its massive black hole, and the jets of B3 1343+451 may not be fully explained by the Blandford--Payne process.</description>

      <title>A unified approach to coupled homogeneous linear wave propagation in generic gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave propagation is a common occurrence in all of physics. A linear approximation provides a simpler way to describe various fields related to observable phenomena in laboratory physics as well as astronomy and cosmology, allowing us to probe gravitation through its effect on the trajectories of particles associated with those fields. This paper proposes a unified framework to describe the wave propagation of a set of interacting tensor fields that obey coupled homogeneous linear second-order partial differential equations for arbitrary curved spacetimes, both Lorentzian and metric-affine. We use JWKB Ans\"atze for all fields, written in terms of a perturbation parameter proportional to a representative wavelength among them, deriving a set of hierarchical algebraic and differential equations that link the fields' phases and different order amplitudes. This allows us to reobtain the well-known laws of geometrical optics and beyond geometrical optics in a generalized form, showing that these laws are independent of the rank of the fields involved. This is true as long as what we refer to as the kinetic tensor of a given field satisfies a set of diagonality conditions, which further imply a handful of simplifications on the transport equations obtained in the subleading orders of the JWKB Ans\"atze. We explore these results in several notable examples in Lorentzian and metric-affine spacetimes, illustrating the reach of our derivations in general relativity, reduced Horndeski theories, spacetimes with completely antisymmetric torsion and Weyl spacetimes. The formalism presented herein lays the groundwork for the study of rays associated with different types of waves in curved spacetimes and provides the tools to compute modifications to their brightness evolution laws, consequential distance duality relations, and beyond geometrical optics phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Quark-sector Lorentz violation is studied in the context of Drell-Yan dilepton production including effects from Z-boson exchange. We show the chiral nature of the weak interactions enables parity-violating and spin-dependent effects to be studied using unpolarized initial states. Constraints are placed on dimensionless and CPT-even coefficients for Lorentz violation for the first two generations of quarks using measurements from the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of neutrino decay in the presence of Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) along with the effects of the Majorana phase on neutrino decay in matter in the context of two-flavor neutrino oscillations. These effects are studied on neutrino oscillation probabilities $P_{\alpha \beta} \equiv P(\nu_{\alpha} \to \nu_{\beta})$, and the difference $\Delta P_{\alpha \beta} \equiv P(\nu_{\alpha} \to \nu_{\beta}) - P(\bar {\nu}_{\alpha} \to \bar{\nu}_{\beta})$ for several accelerator and reactor neutrino experiments. We find that for $P_{\alpha \beta}$, the influence of the Majorana phase on decay in matter can be replicated by the simultaneous presence of both decay and NSI. However, precise measurements of the $P_{\alpha \beta}$ and $\Delta P_{\alpha\beta}$ observables have the potential to unequivocally identify the presence of the Majorana phase by discerning its effects from the concurrent presence of both decay and NSI.</description>

      <title>Exciting Ions: a Systematic Treatment of Ultraperipheral Heavy Ion Collisions with Nuclear Breakup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an updated theoretical treatment of ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of heavy ions, within the SuperChic Monte Carlo generator. This in particular accounts for mutual ion excitation through additional photon exchanges between the colliding ions. This effect occurs frequently in UPCs, and indeed can be (and has been) measured in data through the use of zero degree calorimeter (ZDC) detectors installed in the far forward region. The theoretical approach presented here accounts for the non-trivial and non-negligible impact such ion dissociation has on the measured cross sections and distributions of the produced particles in the central detectors. This builds on previous work, whereby the survival factor probability of no additional inelastic ion-ion scattering due to the strong interaction, and its kinematic impact, are also accounted for within the same overall framework. We compare to data from ATLAS and CMS at the LHC, and STAR at RHIC, and find in general encouraging agreement for a range of observables and ZDC neutron tags, with some room for further improvement, suggesting the inclusion of higher order QED effects and/or tuning of the the $\gamma A \to A^*$ cross section may be desirable. Overall, this gives confidence in the approach considered here and for applications to new phenomena within and beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>When the Machine Chimes the Bell: Entanglement and Bell Inequalities with Boosted $t\bar{t}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider provides a unique opportunity to study quantum entanglement and violation of Bell inequalities at the highest energy available today. In this paper, we will investigate these quantum correlations with top quark pair production, which represents a system of two-qubits. The spacelike separation requirement for the two causally disconnected top quarks requires they fly relativistically away from each other, which motivates the use of the boosted top-tagging with the semi-leptonic top pair channel. Although measuring the spin polarization of the hadronic top quark is known to be challenging, our study indicates that it is feasible to reconstruct the spin density matrix of the two-qubit system using an optimal hadronic polarimeter. This is achieved with the aid of jet substructure techniques and NN-inspired reconstruction methods, which improve the mapping between subjets and quarks. We find that entanglement can already be observed at more than $5\sigma$ level with existing data, and violation of Bell inequalities may be probed above 4$\sigma$ level at the HL-LHC with 3 ab$^{-1}$ of data.</description>

      <title>Neutrino CP Measurement in the Presence of RG Running with Mismatched Momentum Transfers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neutrino mixing parameters are expected to have RG running effect in the presence of new physics. If the momentum transfers at production and detection mismatch with each other, the oscillation probabilities are generally modified and become dependent on not just the neutrino energy but also the momentum transfer. Even in the limit of vanishing baseline, the transition probability for the appearance channel is interestingly not zero. This would significantly affect the sensitivity of the genuine leptonic Dirac CP phase. We further explore the possibility of combing the long- and short-baseline neutrino experiments to constrain such RG running effect for the purpose of guaranteeing the CP measurement. To simulate the double dependence on the neutrino energy and momentum transfer, we extend the usual GLoBES simulation of fixed baseline experiments and use a two-dimensional $\chi^2$ analysis to obtain sensitivities.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the momentum-dependent drag and diffusion coefficient of heavy quarks (HQs) moving in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) background. The leading order scattering amplitudes required for this purpose have been obtained using the Gribov-Zwanziger propagator for the mediator gluons to incorporate the non-perturbative effects relevant to the phenomenologically accessible temperature regime. The drag and diffusion coefficients so obtained have been implemented to estimate the temperature and momentum dependence of the energy loss of the HQ as well as the temperature dependence of the specific shear viscosity ($\eta/s$) of the background medium. Our results suggest a higher energy loss of the propagating HQ compared to the perturbative estimates, whereas the $\eta/s$ is observed to comply with the AdS/CFT estimation over a significantly wider temperature range compared to the perturbative expectation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flavor structure of quarks and leptons is not yet fully understood, but it hints a more fundamental theory of non-universal generations. We therefore propose a simple extension of the Standard Model by flipping (i.e., enlarging) the hypercharge $U(1)_Y$ to $U(1)_X\otimes U(1)_N$ for which both $X$ and $N$ depend on generations of both quark and lepton. By anomaly cancellation, this extension not only explains the existence of just three fermion generations as observed but also requires the presence of a right-handed neutrino per generation, which motivates seesaw neutrino mass generation. Furthermore, in its minimal version with a scalar doublet and two scalar singlets, the model naturally generates the measured fermion-mixing matrices while it successfully accommodates several flavor anomalies observed in the neutral meson mixings, $B$-meson decays, lepton-flavor-violating processes of charged leptons, as well as satisfying constraints from particle colliders.</description>

Abstract: Baryon number is an accidental symmetry of the Standard Model at the Lagrangian level. Its violation is arguably one of the most compelling phenomena predicted by physics beyond the Standard Model. Furthermore, there is a large experimental effort to search for it including the Hyper-K, DUNE, JUNO, and THEIA experiments. Therefore, an agnostic, model-independent, analysis of baryon number violation using the power of Effective Field Theory is very timely. In particular, in this work we study the contribution of dimension six and seven effective operators to $|\Delta (B-L)|=0, \, 2$ nucleon decays taking into account the effects of Renormalisation Group Evolution. We obtain lower limits on the energy scale of each operator and study the correlations between different decay modes. We find that for some operators the effect of running is very significant.</description>

Abstract: We thoroughly explore the cosmic gravitational focusing of cosmic neutrino fluid (C$\nu$F) by dark matter (DM) halo using both general relativity for a point source of gravitational potential and Boltzmann equations for continuous overdensities. Derived in the general way for both relativistic and non-relativistic neutrinos, our results show that the effect has fourth power dependence on the neutrino mass and temperature. With nonlinear mass dependence which is different from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large scale structure (LSS) observations, the cosmic gravitational focusing can provide an independent cosmological way of measuring the neutrino mass and ordering. We take DESI as an example to illustrate that the projected sensitivity as well as its synergy with existing terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments and other cosmological observations can significantly improve the neutrino mass measurement.</description>

The photon PDF is constructed using the LuxQED formalism, while QED evolution accounting for O(alpha), O(alpha alphas) and O(alpha^2) corrections is implemented and benchmarked by means of the EKO code. We investigate the impact of QED effects on NNPDF4.0, and compare our results both to our previous NNPDF3.1QED PDF set and to other recent PDF sets that include the photon. We assess the impact of photon-initiated processes and electroweak corrections on a variety of representative LHC processes, and find that they can reach the 5% level in vector boson pair production at large invariant mass.</description>

      <title>Determination of the theory uncertainties from missing higher orders on NNLO parton distributions with percent accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We include uncertainties due to missing higher order corrections to QCD computations (MHOU) used in the determination of parton distributions (PDFs) in the recent NNPDF4.0 set of PDFs. We use our previously published methodology, based on the treatment of MHOUs and their full correlations through a theory covariance matrix determined by scale variation, now fully incorporated in the new NNPDF theory pipeline. We assess the impact of the inclusion of MHOUs on the NNPDF4.0 central values and uncertainties, and specifically show that they lead to improved consistency of the PDF determination with an ensuing moderate reduction of PDF uncertainties at NNLO.</description>

      <title>Sommerfeld Enhancement for Vector Dark Matter in the Fundamental Representation of SU(2)_L</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study an extension of the Standard Model which include a new massive vector field in the fundamental representation of SU(2)_L. The neutral component of the new vector field is a natural dark matter candidate. We compute the Annihilation Cross Section with Sommerfeld Enhancement and the Photon Flux arising from Dark Matter annihilation events. We found that the model exhibits a resonant mass part around the range of 2-10 TeV. This resonance is influenced by the choice of portal Higgs coupling parameter. We show that these predictions can be partially tested by CTA in the near future.</description>

      <title>Flavor-Violating ALPs, Electron g-2, and the Electron-Ion Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the possibility that light axion-like particles (ALPs) with lepton flavor violating couplings could give significant contributions to the electron's anomalous magnetic moment $g_e-2$. Unlike flavor diagonal lepton-ALP couplings, which are exclusively axial, lepton flavor violating couplings can have arbitrary chirality. Focusing on the $e$-$\tau$ ALP coupling, we find that the size of the contribution to $g_e-2$ depends strongly on the chirality of the coupling. A significant part of the parameter space for which such a coupling can explain experimental anomalies in $g_e-2$ can be probed at the Electron-Ion Collider, which is uniquely sensitive to the chirality of the coupling using the polarization of the electron beam.</description>

      <title>The Path to N$^3$LO Parton Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the existing leading (LO), next-to-leading (NLO), and next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) NNPDF4.0 sets of parton distribution functions (PDFs) to approximate next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (aN$^3$LO). We construct an approximation to the N$^3$LO splitting functions that includes all available partial information from both fixed-order computations and from small and large $x$ resummation, and estimate the uncertainty on this approximation by varying the set of basis functions used to construct the approximation. We include known N$^3$LO corrections to deep-inelastic scattering structure functions and extend the FONLL general-mass scheme to $\mathcal{O}\left( \alpha_s^3\right)$ accuracy. We determine a set of aN$^3$LO PDFs by accounting both for the uncertainty on splitting functions due to the incomplete knowledge of N$^3$LO terms, and to the uncertainty related to missing higher corrections (MHOU), estimated by scale variation, through a theory covariance matrix formalism. We assess the perturbative stability of the resulting PDFs, we study the impact of MHOUs on them, and we compare our results to the aN$^3$LO PDFs from the MSHT group. We examine the phenomenological impact of aN$^3$LO corrections on parton luminosities at the LHC, and give a first assessment of the impact of aN$^3$LO PDFs on the Higgs and Drell-Yan total production cross-sections. We find that the aN$^3$LO NNPDF4.0 PDFs are consistent within uncertainties with their NNLO counterparts, that they improve the description of the global dataset and the perturbative convergence of Higgs and Drell-Yan cross-sections, and that MHOUs on PDFs decrease substantially with the increase of perturbative order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of the Efimov effect in the $D^*D^*D^*$ system is explored under the assumption that the heavy partner of the $T_{cc}^+$ exists as a $D^*D^*$ molecule with $(I)J^P=(0)1^+$. The three-to-three relativistic scattering amplitude is obtained from the ladder amplitude formalism, built from an energy-dependent contact two-body potential where the molecular component of the $T_{cc}^*$ state can be varied. We find that $(I)J^P=(\tfrac{1}{2})0^-$ three-body bound states can be formed, with properties that suggest that the Efimov effect can be realised for reasonable values of the molecular probability and binding energy of the $T_{cc}^*$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07601v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dilaton effective field theory (dEFT) describes the long distance behavior of certain confining, near-conformal gauge theories that have been studied via lattice computation. Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (pNGBs), emerging from the breaking of approximate, continuous, internal symmetries, are coupled to an additional scalar particle, the dilaton, arising from the spontaneous breaking of approximate scale invariance. This effective theory has been employed to study possible extensions of the standard model. In this paper, we propose a complementary role for dEFT, as a description of the dark matter of the universe, with the pNGBs identified as the dark-matter particles. We show that this theory provides a natural implementation of the "forbidden" dark matter mechanism, and we identify regions of parameter space for which the thermal history of dEFT yields the measured dark matter relic density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several current measurements of $b \rightarrow s l^+ l^-$ processes are in tension with Standard Model predictions, whereas others (e.g.\ $R_K$ and $R_{K^\ast}$) are in reasonable agreement with them. We examine some recent $Z^\prime$ models that fit the data as a whole appreciably better than does the Standard Model, confronting the models with ATLAS resonance searches in the $e^+e^-$ and $\mu^+\mu^-$ channels. Both channels constrain the models; we find that the searches rule out less than one fifth of the allowed range of $M_{Z^\prime}$. We estimate that the HL-LHC can roughly double the current sensitivity in $M_{Z^\prime}$, but covering the whole parameter space would take a more powerful machine, such as a 100 TeV $pp$ collider.</description>

      <title>NLO thermal corrections to dark matter annihilation cross sections: a novel approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dark matter relic density has been increasingly accurately measured by successive generations of experiments. The Boltzmann equation determines the yields using the dark matter annihilation cross section as one of the inputs; the accurate computation of the latter including thermal contributions thus assumes importance. We report here the next-to-leading order (NLO) thermal corrections to the cross sections for (Majorana) dark matter annihilation to standard model fermions: $\chi \chi \to f \overline{f}$, via charged scalars. We use a novel approach, utilising the technique of Grammer and Yennie, extended to thermal field theories, where the cancellation of soft infra-red divergences occurs naturally. We present the NLO thermal cross sections in full detail for both the relativistic case as well as in the non-relativistic limit. Our independent calculation verifies earlier results where the leading contribution at order ${\cal{O}}(T^2)$ was shown to be proportional to the square of the fermion mass in the non-relativistic limit, just as at leading order. We find that the ${\cal{O}}(T^4)$ contributions have the same dependence on the fermion mass as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the resummed 1-loop correction to a baryonic thermal screening mass. The calculation is carried out in the framework of a dimensionally reduced effective theory, where quarks are heavy fields due to their non-zero Matsubara frequencies. The correction due to interactions is computed at O($g^2_{ }$) in the coupling constant. In order to solve a 3-body Schr\"odinger equation, we exploit a two-dimensional generalization of the hyperspherical harmonics method. At electroweak scale temperatures, the NLO correction represents a $\sim 4.6 \%$ increase of the free-theory value $3\pi T$ of the screening mass.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model at unphysical pion masses and high temperatures. II. The vacuum structure and thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory with cross-channel improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective potential of the $O(N)$ model at large $N$ limit is reinvestigated with varying pion mass and temperature. For large pion masses and high temperatures, we find the phenomenologically favored vacuum, located on the upper branch of the double-branched effective potential for physical $m_\pi$, moves to the lower branch and becomes no longer a local minimum but a saddle point. The existence and running of the tachyon pole are also discussed. These phenomena indicate that the applicable energy range of $O(N)$ model is more and more limited as $m_\pi$ becoming larger and temperature going higher. With the effective coupling constant defined from the effective potential, the possible correspondence between the two branches of the effective potential and the two phases of the theory (distinguished by positive or negative coupling) is verified even with nonzero explicit symmetry breaking and at finite temperature. Also, we generalize the $N/D$ modified $O(N)$ model to study the thermal trajectory of the $\sigma$ pole with the cross-channel contributions considered and find the thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory resembles its counterpart with varying pion mass at zero temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the study of the quark sector of the universal seesaw model with $\mathrm{SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{Y'}}$ gauge symmetry in the massless case of the two lightest quark families. This model aims to explain the mass hierarchy of the third family quark by introducing a vector-like quark (VLQ) partner for each quark. In this model, we introduce $\mathrm{SU(2)_L}$ and $\mathrm{SU(2)_R}$ Higgs doublets. We derive explicitly the Lagrangian for the quark sector, Higgs sector, and kinetic terms of the gauge fields, starting from the Lagrangian, which is invariant under $\mathrm{SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{Y'}}$ gauge symmetry. At each stage of the symmetry breaking, we present the Lagrangian with the remaining gauge symmetry. Additionally, we investigate the flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) of Higgs ($h$) and $Z$-boson in the interaction with the top, heavy top, bottom, and heavy bottom quark.</description>

Abstract: We use the Belle data on the $K^- p$ mass distribution of the $\Lambda_c^+ \to p K^- \pi^+$ reaction near the $\eta \Lambda$ threshold to determine the $\eta \Lambda $ scattering length and effective range. We show that from these data alone we can determine the value of $a$ with better precision than so far determined, and the value of $r_0$ for the first time. The addition of the $K^- p \to \eta \Lambda$ data allows us to improve the precision of these magnitudes, with errors smaller than $15\%$. We also determine with high precision the pole position of the $\Lambda(1670)$.</description>

Abstract: We here report on the progress of the HHH Workshop, that took place in Dubrovnik in July 2023. After the discovery of a particle that complies with the properties of the Higgs boson of the Standard Model, all SM parameters are in principle determined. However, in order to verify or falsify the model, the full form of the potential has to be determined. This includes the measurement of the triple and quartic scalar couplings. We here report on ongoing progress of measurements for multi scalar final states, with an emphasis on three SM-like scalar bosons at 125 GeV, but also mentioning other options. We discuss both experimental progress and challenges as well as theoretical studies and models that can enhance such rates with respect to the SM predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1803.07629v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of kinematical and dynamical conditions necessary for probing highly elusive three-nucleon short range correlations~(3N-SRCs) in nuclei through inclusive electron scattering. The kinematic requirements that should be satisfied in order to isolate 3N-SRCs in inclusive processes are derived. We demonstrate that a sequence of two short-range NN interactions represents the main mechanism for 3N-SRCs in inclusive processes. Within this mechanism we predict a quadratic dependence of the inclusive cross section ratios of nuclei to $^3$He in the 3N-SRC region to the same ratio measured in 2N-SRC domain. The extended analysis of the available data satisfying the necessary 3N-SRC kinematical conditions is presented. This analysis provides tantalizing signatures of scaling associated with the onset of 3N-SRC dominance. The same data are also consistent with the prediction of the quadratic relation between the ratios measured in the 3N and 2N-SRC regions for nuclei ranging $4 \le A \le 197$. This agreement made it possible to extract $a_3(A)$, the probability of 3N-SRCs relative to the A=3 nucleus. We find $a_3(A)$ to be significantly larger in magnitude than the analogous parameter, $a_2(A)$, for 2N-SRCs.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Neural Ratio Estimation for Simulation-based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Likelihood-to-evidence ratio estimation is usually cast as either a binary (NRE-A) or a multiclass (NRE-B) classification task. In contrast to the binary classification framework, the current formulation of the multiclass version has an intrinsic and unknown bias term, making otherwise informative diagnostics unreliable. We propose a multiclass framework free from the bias inherent to NRE-B at optimum, leaving us in the position to run diagnostics that practitioners depend on. It also recovers NRE-A in one corner case and NRE-B in the limiting case. For fair comparison, we benchmark the behavior of all algorithms in both familiar and novel training regimes: when jointly drawn data is unlimited, when data is fixed but prior draws are unlimited, and in the commonplace fixed data and parameters setting. Our investigations reveal that the highest performing models are distant from the competitors (NRE-A, NRE-B) in hyperparameter space. We make a recommendation for hyperparameters distinct from the previous models. We suggest two bounds on the mutual information as performance metrics for simulation-based inference methods, without the need for posterior samples, and provide experimental results. This version corrects a minor implementation error in $\gamma$, improving results.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by conceptual problems in quantum theories of gravity, the gravitational eikonal approach, inspired by its electromagnetic predecessor, has been successfully applied to the transplanckian energy collisions of elementary particles and strings since the late eighties, and to string-brane collisions in the past decade. After the direct detection of gravitational waves from black-hole mergers, most of the attention has shifted towards adapting these methods to the physics of black-hole encounters. For such systems, the eikonal exponentiation provides an amplitude-based approach to calculate classical gravitational observables, thus complementing more traditional analytic methods such as the Post-Newtonian expansion, the worldline formalism, or the Effective-One-Body approach. In this review we summarize the main ideas and techniques behind the gravitational eikonal formalism. We discuss how it can be applied in various different physical setups involving particles, strings and branes and then we mainly concentrate on the most recent developments, focusing on massive scalars minimally coupled to gravity, for which we aim at being as self-contained and comprehensive as possible.</description>

      <title>Can Bell inequalities be tested via scattering cross-section at colliders ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In current studies for testing Bell inequalities at colliders, the reconstruction of spin correlations from scattering cross-sections relies on the bilinear form of the spin correlations, but not all local hidden variable models (LHVMs) have such a property. To demonstrate that a general LHVM cannot be rule out via scattering cross-section data, we propose a specific LHVM, which can exactly duplicate the same scattering cross-section for particle production and decay as the standard quantum theory, making it indistinguishable at colliders in principle. Despite of this, we find that reconstructing spin correlations through scattering cross-sections can still exclude a broad class of LHVMs, e.g., those models employing classical spin correlations as a surrogate for quantum spin correlations.</description>

      <title>One-loop power spectrum in ultra slow-roll inflation and implications for primordial black hole dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the in-in formalism to address the question of whether the size of the one-loop spectrum of curvature fluctuations in ultra-slow-roll inflation models designed for producing a large population of primordial black holes implies a breakdown of perturbation theory. We consider a simplified piece-wise description of inflation, in which the ultra-slow-roll phase is preceded and followed by slow-roll phases linked by transitional periods. We work in the $\delta\phi$-gauge, including all relevant cubic and quartic interactions and the necessary counterterms to renormalize the ultraviolet divergences, regularized by a cutoff. The ratio of the one-loop to the tree-level contributions to the spectrum of curvature perturbations is controlled by the duration of the ultra-slow-roll phase and of the transitions. Our results indicate that perturbation theory does not necessarily break in well-known models proposed to account for all the dark matter in the form of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>External magnetic field induced paramagnetic squeezing effect in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In non-central heavy-ion collisions, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) encounters the most intense magnetic field ever produced in nature, with a strength of approximately 10$^{19 - 20}$ Gauss. Recent lattice-QCD calculations reveal that the QGP exhibits paramagnetic properties at high temperatures. When an external strong magnetic field is applied, it generates an anisotropic squeezing force density that competes with pressure gradients resulting from the purely QGP geometric expansion. In this study, we employ (3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics simulations to estimate the paramagnetic squeezing effect of this force density on the anisotropic expansion of QGP in non-central Pb+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We consider both up-to-date magnetic susceptibility and various magnetic field profiles in this work. We find that the impact of rapidly decaying magnetic fields is insignificant, while enduring magnetic fields produce a strong force density that diminishes the momentum anisotropy of the QGP by up to 10% at the intial stage, leaving a visible imprint on the elliptic flow $v_{2}$ of final charged particles. Our results provide insights into the interplay between magnetic fields and the dynamics of QGP expansion in non-central heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Steady electric currents in magnetized QCD and their use for the equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the emergence of steady electric currents in QCD as a response to a non-uniform magnetic background using lattice simulations with 2 + 1 quark flavors at the physical point, as well as leading-order chiral perturbation theory. Using these currents, we develop a novel method to determine the leading-order coefficient of the equation of state in a magnetic field expansion: the magnetic susceptibility of the QCD medium. We decompose the current expectation value into valence- and sea-quark contributions and demonstrate that the dominant contribution to the electric current is captured by the valence term alone, allowing for a comparably cheap determination of the susceptibility. Our continuum extrapolated lattice results for the equation of state confirm the findings of some of the existing studies in the literature, namely that the QCD medium behaves diamagnetically at low and paramagnetically at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>The Baryon Junction and String Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study junctions between confining strings. We show that the effective theory of such junctions is very predictive with only one new parameter, the junction's mass, controlling the first couple of terms in the expansion in the system size. By open-closed duality these considerations about the baryon junction map to interaction vertices of closed strings. Therefore, we calculate the interaction vertices of closed strings in theories such as Yang-Mills theory. We find some surprising selection rules for string interactions in 3+1 dimensions. Requiring perturbative stability and that the string coupling is weak, we suggest constraints on the junction's mass.</description>

      <title>Canonicalizing zeta generators: genus zero and genus one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zeta generators are derivations associated with odd Riemann zeta values that act freely on the Lie algebra of the fundamental group of Riemann surfaces with marked points. The genus-zero incarnation of zeta generators are Ihara derivations of certain Lie polynomials in two generators that can be obtained from the Drinfeld associator. We characterize a canonical choice of these polynomials, together with their non-Lie counterparts at even degrees $w\geq 2$, through the action of the dual space of formal and motivic multizeta values. Based on these canonical polynomials, we propose a canonical isomorphism that maps motivic multizeta values into the $f$-alphabet. The canonical Lie polynomials from the genus-zero setup determine canonical zeta generators in genus one that act on the two generators of Enriquez' elliptic associators. Up to a single contribution at fixed degree, the zeta generators in genus one are systematically expanded in terms of Tsunogai's geometric derivations dual to holomorphic Eisenstein series, leading to a wealth of explicit high-order computations. Earlier ambiguities in defining the non-geometric part of genus-one zeta generators are resolved by imposing a new representation-theoretic condition. The tight interplay between zeta generators in genus zero and genus one unravelled in this work connects the construction of single-valued multiple polylogarithms on the sphere with iterated-Eisenstein-integral representations of modular graph forms.</description>

      <title>Scale setting and hadronic properties in light quark sector with $(2+1)$-flavor Wilson fermions at the physical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report scale setting and hadronic properties for our new lattice QCD gauge configuration set (HAL-conf-2023). We employ $(2+1)$-flavor nonperturbatively improved Wilson fermions with stout smearing and the Iwasaki gauge action on a $96^4$ lattice, and generate configurations of 8,000 trajectories at the physical point. We show the basic properties of the configurations such as the plaquette value, topological charge distribution and their auto-correlation times. The scale setting is performed by detailed analyses of the $\Omega$ baryon mass. We calculate the physical results of quark masses, decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons and single hadron spectra in light quark sector. The masses of the stable hadrons are found to agree with the experimental values within a sub-percent level.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Polarisability of Octet Baryons via Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing on recent advances in lattice-QCD background-field techniques, the magnetic polarisability of octet baryons is calculated from the first principles of QCD. The results are presented in the context of new constituent quark-model calculations providing a framework for understanding the lattice results and a direct comparison with simulation results at unphysical quark masses. Using smeared quark sources, low-lying Laplacian eigenmode projection and final-state Landau mode projection, considerable attention is devoted to ensuring single-state isolation in the lattice correlation functions. We also introduce new weighting methods to reduce the sensitivity to correlation-function fits, averaging over many fits based on merit drawn from the full correlated $\chi^2$ of the fits. The techniques are implemented on the $32^3 \times 64$, 2+1-flavour dynamical-fermion lattices provided by the PACS-CS collaboration following the introduction of uniform magnetic fields quantised to the lowest nontrivial values available. After some fine tuning of the constituent quark model parameters, we find the model captures the patterns observed in the lattice QCD results very well, providing important insights into the physics underpinning the magnetic polarisabilities. Finally, comparison with the most recent results from experiment proceeds through an effective field theory formalism which incorporates estimates of finite-volume corrections and small electro-quenching corrections as the results are brought to the physical point. We find excellent agreement with experiment where available, including the proton and neutron polarisabilities.</description>
