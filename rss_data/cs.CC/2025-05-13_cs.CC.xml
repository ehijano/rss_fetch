      <title>Safety Analysis in the NGAC Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the safety problem for the next-generation access control (NGAC) model. We show that under mild assumptions it is coNP-complete, and under further realistic assumptions we give an algorithm for the safety problem that significantly outperforms naive brute force search. We also show that real-world examples of mutually exclusive attributes lead to nearly worst-case behavior of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>On Finding Randomly Planted Cliques in Arbitrary Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a planted clique model introduced by Feige where a complete graph of size $c\cdot n$ is planted uniformly at random in an arbitrary $n$-vertex graph. We give a simple deterministic algorithm that, in almost linear time, recovers a clique of size $(c/3)^{O(1/c)} \cdot n$ as long as the original graph has maximum degree at most $(1-p)n$ for some fixed $p&gt;0$. The proof hinges on showing that the degrees of the final graph are correlated with the planted clique, in a way similar to (but more intricate than) the classical $G(n,\frac{1}{2})+K_{\sqrt{n}}$ planted clique model. Our algorithm suggests a separation from the worst-case model, where, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, no polynomial algorithm can find cliques of size $\Omega(n)$ for every fixed $c&gt;0$, even if the input graph has maximum degree $(1-p)n$. Our techniques extend beyond the planted clique model. For example, when the planted graph is a balanced biclique, we recover a balanced biclique of size larger than the best guarantees known for the worst case.</description>

      <title>Cluster Vertex Deletion Problems on Cubic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problems Cluster Vertex Deletion (or Cluster-VD) and its generalization s-Club Cluster Vertex Deletion (or s-Club-VD, for any integer s&gt;= 1), have been introduced with the aim of detecting highly-connected parts in complex systems. Their NP-completeness has been established for several classes of graphs, but remains open for smaller classes, including subcubic planar bipartite graphs and cubic graphs. In this paper, we show that Cluster-VD and more generally s-Club-VD are NP-complete for cubic planar bipartite graphs. We also deduce new results for the related k-Path Vertex Cover problem (or k-PVC), namely 3-PVC is NP-complete for cubic planar bipartite graphs, whereas k-PVC with k&gt;= 4 is NP-complete for subcubic planar (and bipartite, when k is odd) graphs of arbitrarily large girth.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Locality Testing via Trotterized Postselection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The (tolerant) Hamiltonian locality testing problem, introduced in [Bluhm, Caro,Oufkir `24], is to determine whether a Hamiltonian $H$ is $\varepsilon_1$-close to being $k$-local (i.e. can be written as the sum of weight-$k$ Pauli operators) or $\varepsilon_2$-far from any $k$-local Hamiltonian, given access to its time evolution operator and using as little total evolution time as possible, with distance typically defined by the normalized Frobenius norm. We give the tightest known bounds for this problem, proving an $\text{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_2}{(\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_1)^5}}\right)$ evolution time upper bound and an $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_1}\right)$ lower bound. Our algorithm does not require reverse time evolution or controlled application of the time evolution operator, although our lower bound applies to algorithms using either tool.
  Furthermore, we show that if we are allowed reverse time evolution, this lower bound is tight, giving a matching $\text{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_1}\right)$ evolution time algorithm.</description>

      <title>Value Iteration with Guessing for Markov Chains and Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two standard models for probabilistic systems are Markov chains (MCs) and Markov decision processes (MDPs). Classic objectives for such probabilistic models for control and planning problems are reachability and stochastic shortest path. The widely studied algorithmic approach for these problems is the Value Iteration (VI) algorithm which iteratively applies local updates called Bellman updates. There are many practical approaches for VI in the literature but they all require exponentially many Bellman updates for MCs in the worst case. A preprocessing step is an algorithm that is discrete, graph-theoretical, and requires linear space. An important open question is whether, after a polynomial-time preprocessing, VI can be achieved with sub-exponentially many Bellman updates. In this work, we present a new approach for VI based on guessing values. Our theoretical contributions are twofold. First, for MCs, we present an almost-linear-time preprocessing algorithm after which, along with guessing values, VI requires only subexponentially many Bellman updates. Second, we present an improved analysis of the speed of convergence of VI for MDPs. Finally, we present a practical algorithm for MDPs based on our new approach. Experimental results show that our approach provides a considerable improvement over existing VI-based approaches on several benchmark examples from the literature.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of Polynomial Inequalities in Subset Densities and Additive Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many results in extremal graph theory can be formulated as certain polynomial inequalities in graph homomorphism densities. Answering fundamental questions raised by Lov{\'a}sz, Szegedy and Razborov, Hatami and Norine proved that determining the validity of an arbitrary such polynomial inequality in graph homomorphism densities is undecidable. We observe that many results in additive combinatorics can also be formulated as polynomial inequalities in subset's density and its variants. Based on techniques introduced in Hatami and Norine, together with algebraic and graph construction and Fourier analysis, we prove similarly two theorems of undecidability, thus showing that establishing such polynomial inequalities in additive combinatorics are inherently difficult in their full generality.</description>

      <title>Quon Classical Simulation: Unifying Clifford, Matchgates and Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified classical simulation framework for quantum circuits, termed Quon Classical Simulation (QCS), built upon the diagrammatic formalism of the Quon language. Central to this framework is the introduction of magic holes, a topological feature that captures the global source of computational hardness in simulating quantum systems. Unlike conventional measures, the complexity of QCS is governed by the topological entanglement entropy associated with these magic holes. We show that Clifford circuits and Matchgate circuits are free of magic holes and thus efficiently simulable within our model. To capture the interaction structure of magic holes, we define a topological tensor network representation and develop novel skein relations and reduction algorithms to simplify circuit representations. This approach significantly improves the efficiency of classical simulations and provides a unified explanation for the tractability of various known quantum circuit classes. Our work offers a new topological perspective on the classical simulability of quantum systems and topological complexity.</description>

      <title>A proof of P != NP (New symmetric encryption algorithm against any linear attacks and differential attacks)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05022v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: P vs NP problem is the most important unresolved problem in the field of computational complexity. Its impact has penetrated into all aspects of algorithm design, especially in the field of cryptography. The security of cryptographic algorithms based on short keys depends on whether P is equal to NP. In fact, Shannon[1] strictly proved that the one-time-pad system meets unconditional security, but because the one-time-pad system requires the length of key to be at least the length of plaintext, how to transfer the key is a troublesome problem that restricts the use of the one-time-pad system in practice. Cryptography algorithms used in practice are all based on short key, and the security of the short key mechanism is ultimately based on "one-way" assumption, that is, it is assumed that a one-way function exists. In fact, the existence of one-way function can directly lead to the important conclusion P != NP. In this paper, we originally constructed a short-key block cipher algorithm. The core feature of this algorithm is that for any block, when a plaintext-ciphertext pair is known, any key in the key space can satisfy the plaintext-ciphertext pair, that is, for each block, the plaintext-ciphertext pair and the key are independence, and the independence between blocks is also easy to construct. This feature is completely different from all existing short-key cipher algorithms. Based on the above feature, we construct a problem and theoretically prove that the problem satisfies the properties of one-way functions, thereby solving the problem of the existence of one-way functions, that is, directly proving that P != NP.</description>

      <title>One-way Communication Complexity of Minimum Vertex Cover in General Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the communication complexity of the Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) problem on general graphs within the \(k\)-party one-way communication model. Edges of an arbitrary \(n\)-vertex graph are distributed among \(k\) parties. The objective is for the parties to collectively find a small vertex cover of the graph while adhering to a communication protocol where each party sequentially sends a message to the next until the last party outputs a valid vertex cover of the whole graph. We are particularly interested in the trade-off between the size of the messages sent and the approximation ratio of the output solution.
  It is straightforward to see that any constant approximation protocol for MVC requires communicating \(\Omega(n)\) bits. Additionally, there exists a trivial 2-approximation protocol where the parties collectively find a maximal matching of the graph greedily and return the subset of vertices matched. This raises a natural question: \textit{What is the best approximation ratio achievable using optimal communication of \(O(n)\)?} We design a protocol with an approximation ratio of \((2-2^{-k+1}+\epsilon)\) and \(O(n)\) communication for any desirably small constant \(\epsilon&gt;0\), which is strictly better than 2 for any constant number of parties. Moreover, we show that achieving an approximation ratio smaller than \(3/2\) for the two-party case requires \(n^{1 + \Omega(1/\lg\lg n)}\) communication, thereby establishing the tightness of our protocol for two parties.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Matrix Approximation for Neural Network Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have encountered an emerging deployment challenge due to large and expensive memory and computation requirements. In this paper, we present a new Adaptive-Rank Singular Value Decomposition (ARSVD) method that approximates the optimal rank for compressing weight matrices in neural networks using spectral entropy. Unlike conventional SVD-based methods that apply a fixed-rank truncation across all layers, ARSVD uses an adaptive selection of the rank per layer through the entropy distribution of its singular values. This approach ensures that each layer will retain a certain amount of its informational content, thereby reducing redundancy. Our method enables efficient, layer-wise compression, yielding improved performance with reduced space and time complexity compared to static-rank reduction techniques.</description>
