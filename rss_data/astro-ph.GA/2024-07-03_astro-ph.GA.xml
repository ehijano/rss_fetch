      <title>Host Galaxy Demographics Of Individually Detectable Supermassive Black-hole Binaries with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) produce gravitational waves (GWs) that are detectable with pulsar timing arrays. We determine the properties of the host galaxies of simulated MBHBs at the time they are producing detectable GW signals. The population of MBHB systems we evaluate is from the Illustris cosmological simulations taken in tandem with post processing semi-analytic models of environmental factors in the evolution of binaries. Upon evolving to the GW frequency regime accessible by pulsar timing arrays, we calculate the detection probability of each system using a variety of different values for pulsar noise characteristics in a plausible near-future International Pulsar Timing Array dataset. We find that detectable systems have host galaxies that are clearly distinct from the overall binary population and from most galaxies in general. With conservative noise factors, we find that host stellar metallicity, for example, peaks at twice solar metallicity as opposed to the total population of galaxies which peaks at ~0.6 solar metallicity. Additionally, the most detectable systems are much brighter in magnitude and more red in color than the overall population, indicating their likely identity as large ellipticals with diminished star formation. These results can be used to develop effective search strategies for identifying host galaxies and electromagnetic counterparts following GW detection by pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Investigating the ultraviolet and infrared radiation through the turbulent life of molecular clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Molecular Clouds (MCs) are the place where stars are formed and their feedback starts to take place, regulating the evolution of galaxies. Therefore, MCs represent the critical scale at which to study how ultra-violet (UV) photons emitted by young stars are reprocessed in the far-infrared (FIR) by interaction with dust grains, thereby determining the multi-wavelength continuum emission of galaxies. Aims. Our goal is to analyze the UV and IR emission of a MC at different stages of its evolution and relate its absorption and emission properties with its morphology and star formation rate. Such a study is fundamental to determine how the properties of MCs shape the emission from entire galaxies. Method. We consider a radiation-hydrodynamic simulation of a MC with self-consistent chemistry treatment. The MC has a mass $M_{\rm MC} = 10^5 ~ M_\odot$, is resolved down to a scale of $0.06\, \rm pc$, and evolves for $\simeq 2.4$~Myr after the onset of star formation. We post-process the simulation via Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations to compute the detailed UV-to-FIR emission of the MC. Such results are compared with data from physically-motivated analytical models, other simulations, and observations. Results. We find that the simulated MC is globally UV-optically thick, but optically-thin channels allow for photon escape ($0.1\%-10\%$), feature which is not well-captured in the analytical models. Dust temperature spans a wide range ($T_{\rm dust} \sim 20-300$~K) depending on the dust-to-stellar geometry, which is reproduced reasonably well by analytical models. However, the complexity of the dust temperature distribution is not captured in the analytical models, as evidenced by the 10 K (20 K) difference in the mass (luminosity) average temperature. Indeed, the total IR luminosity is the same in all the models, but the IR emission -abridged</description>

      <title>Comparisons Between Resolved Star Formation Rate and Gas Tracers in the Strongly Lensed Galaxy SDSS J0901+1814 at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report new radio observations of SDSS J090122.37+181432.3, a strongly lensed star-forming galaxy at $z=2.26$. We image 1.4 GHz (L-band) and 3 GHz (S-band) continuum using the VLA and 1.2 mm (band 6) continuum with ALMA, in addition to the CO(7-6) and CI(${\rm ^3P_2\rightarrow ^3\!P_1}$) lines, all at $\lesssim1.^{\prime\prime}7$ resolution. Based on the VLA integrated flux densities, we decompose the radio spectrum into its free-free (FF) and non-thermal components. The infrared-radio correlation (IRRC) parameter $q_{\rm TIR}=2.65_{-0.31}^{+0.24}$ is consistent with expectations for star forming galaxies. We obtain radio continuum-derived SFRs that are free of dust extinction, finding $\rm {620}_{-220}^{+280}\,M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$, $\rm {230}_{-160}^{+570}\,M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$, and $\rm {280}_{-120}^{+460}\,M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$ from the FF emission, non-thermal emission, and when accounting for both emission processes, respectively, in agreement with previous results. We estimate the gas mass from the CI(${\rm ^3P_2\rightarrow ^3\!P_1}$) line as $M_{\rm gas}=(1.2\pm0.2)\times10^{11}\,M_\odot$, which is consistent with prior CO(1-0)-derived gas masses. Using our new IR and radio continuum data to map the SFR, we assess the dependence of the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation on choices of SFR and gas tracer for $\sim{\rm kpc}$ scales. The different SFR tracers yield different slopes, with the IR being the steepest, potentially due to highly obscured star formation in J0901. The radio continuum maps have the lowest slopes and overall fidelity for mapping the SFR, despite producing consistent total SFRs. We also find that the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation slope is flattest when using CO(7-6) or CI(${\rm ^3P_2\rightarrow ^3\!P_1}$) to trace gas mass, suggesting that those transitions are not suitable for tracing the bulk molecular gas in galaxies like J0901.</description>

      <title>A central degeneracy induced outer core in fermionic dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several galaxy-scale observations challenge the predictions of the cold dark matter paradigm based on cosmological simulations. The cusp-core problem is one of the most outstanding. However, current simulations are unable to consider quantum statistical effects. For a fermionic dark matter halo, a degenerate inner core induces an extended outer core that dominates in gravity in the region relevant for rotation curve observation. We study the properties of this outer core and show that its density and radius are correlated. The prediction remarkably agrees with the measured scaling relation in both the slope and the magnitude. Such consistency suggests that the observed cored profiles do not contradict massive dark matter but indicate its fermionic nature.</description>

      <title>Tidal mass loss in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy through N-body simulations with Gaia EDR3-based orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) represents a challenge for some globular cluster (GC) formation models, because an exceptionally high fraction of its stellar mass is locked in its GC system. In order to shed light on our understanding of GC formation, we aim to constrain the amount of stellar mass that Fornax has lost via tidal interaction with the Milky Way (MW). Exploiting the flexibility of effective multi-component $N$-body simulations and relying on state-of-the-art estimates of Fornax's orbital parameters, we study the evolution of the mass distribution of the Fornax dSph in observationally justified orbits in the gravitational potential of the MW over 12 Gyr. We find that, though the dark-matter mass loss can be substantial, the fraction of stellar mass lost by Fornax to the MW is always negligible, even in the most eccentric orbit considered. We conclude that stellar-mass loss due to tidal stripping is not a plausible explanation for the unexpectedly high stellar mass of the GC system of the Fornax dSph and we discuss quantitatively the implications for GC formation scenarios.</description>

      <title>PHANGS-MeerKAT and MHONGOOSE HI observations of nearby spiral galaxies: physical drivers of the molecular gas fraction, $R_{\mathrm{mol}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The molecular-to-atomic gas ratio is crucial to the evolution of the interstellar medium in galaxies. We investigate the balance between the atomic ($\Sigma_{\rm HI}$) and molecular gas ($\Sigma_{\rm H2}$) surface densities in eight nearby star-forming galaxies using new high-quality observations from MeerKAT and ALMA (for HI and CO, respectively). We define the molecular gas ratio as $R_{\rm mol} = \Sigma_{\rm H2} / \Sigma_{\rm HI}$ and measure how it depends on local conditions in the galaxy disks using multi-wavelength observations. We find that, depending on the galaxy, HI is detected at $&gt;3\sigma$ out to 20-120 kpc in galactocentric radius ($r_{\rm gal}$). The typical radius at which $\Sigma_{\rm HI}$ reaches 1~$\rm M_\odot~pc^{-2}$ is $r_{\rm HI}\approx22$~kpc, which corresponds to 1-3 times the optical radius ($r_{25}$). $R_{\rm mol}$ correlates best with the dynamical equilibrium pressure, P$_{\rm DE}$, among potential drivers studied, with a median correlation coefficient of $&lt;\rho&gt;=0.89$. Correlations between $R_{\rm mol}$ and star formation rate, total gas and stellar surface density, metallicity, and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$/P$_{\rm DE}$ are present but somewhat weaker. Our results also show a direct correlation between P$_{\rm DE}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, supporting self-regulation models. Quantitatively, we measure similar scalings as previous works and attribute the modest differences that we find to the effect of varying resolution and sensitivity. At $r_{\rm gal} {\gtrsim}0.4~r_{25}$, atomic gas dominates over molecular gas, and at the balance of these two gas phases, we find that the baryon mass is dominated by stars, with $\Sigma_{*} &gt; 5~\Sigma_{\rm gas}$. Our study constitutes an important step in the statistical investigation of how local galaxy properties impact the conversion from atomic to molecular gas in nearby galaxies.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Broad-line Region of Active Galactic Nuclei with Photoionization. I. the Moderate-Accretion Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over three decades of reverberation mapping (RM) studies on local broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have measured reliable black-hole (BH) masses for $&gt; 100$ AGNs. These RM measurements reveal a significant correlation between the Balmer broad-line region size and the AGN optical luminosity (the $R-L$ relation). Recent RM studies for AGN samples with more diverse BH accretion parameters (e.g., mass and Eddington ratio) reveal a substantial intrinsic dispersion around the average $R-L$ relation, suggesting variations in the overall spectral energy distribution shape as functions of accretion parameters. Here we perform a detailed photoionization investigation of expected broad-line properties as functions of accretion parameters, using the latest models for the AGN continuum implemented in {\tt qsosed}. We compare theoretical predictions with observations of a sample of 67 $z\lesssim0.5$ reverberation-mapped AGNs with both rest-frame optical and UV spectra in the moderate-accretion regime (Eddington ratio $\lambda_{\rm Edd}\equiv L/L_{\rm Edd}&lt;0.5$). The UV/optical line strengths and their dependences on accretion parameters can be reasonably well reproduced by the locally-optimally-emitting cloud (LOC) photoionization models. We provide quantitative recipes that use optical/UV line flux ratios to infer the ionizing continuum, which is not directly observable. In addition, photoionization models with universal values of ionization parameter ($\log U_{\rm H}=-2$) and hydrogen density ($\log n({\rm H})=12$) can qualitatively reproduce the observed global $R-L$ relation for the current AGN sample. However, such models fail to reproduce the observed trend of decreasing BLR size with $L/L_{\rm Edd}$ at fixed optical luminosity, which may imply that the gas density increases with the accretion rate.</description>

      <title>ALMA reveals spatially-resolved properties of molecular gas in the host galaxy of FRB 20191001A at z = 0.2340</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of the CO(2-1) emission line with a spatial resolution of 0.9 arcsec ($3.5 \mathrm{kpc}$) from the host galaxy of the fast radio burst (FRB), FRB 20191001A at $z=0.2340$, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This is the first detection of spatially resolved CO emission from the host galaxy of an FRB at a cosmological distance. The inferred molecular gas mass of the host galaxy is $(2.3\pm0.4)\times10^{10} \mathrm{M_\odot}$, indicating that it is gas-rich, as evidenced by the measured molecular gas fraction $\mu_\mathrm{gas}=0.50\pm0.22$. This molecular-gas mass and the star formation rate of the host, $\mathrm{SFR}=8.06\pm2.42 \mathrm{M_\odot yr^{-1}}$, differ from those observed in the other FRB host galaxies with the average $M_\mathrm{gas}=9.6\times10^8 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $\mathrm{SFR}=0.90 \mathrm{M_\odot yr^{-1}}$. This lends further credibility to the hypothesis that FRBs may originate from single or multiple progenitors across a diverse range of galaxy environments. Based on the observed velocity field modeling, we find that the molecular gas disk is dominated by an ordered circular rotation, despite the fact that the host galaxy has a gas-rich companion galaxy with a projected separation of $\sim 25 \mathrm{kpc}$. The formation of the FRB's progenitor might not have been triggered by this interaction. We derive the 3$\sigma$ upper limit of the molecular gas column density at the FRB detection site to be $&lt; 2.1\times 10^{21} \mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ with a 3$\sigma$ upper limit.</description>

      <title>Jetted Subgalactic-Size Radio Sources in Merging Galaxies -- A Jet Redirection Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-standing question concerning Jetted Sub-Galactic Size (JSS) radio sources is whether they will evolve into large radio galaxies, die before escaping the host galaxy, or remain indefinitely confined to their compact size. Our main goal is to propose a scenario that explains the relative number of JSS radio sources and their general properties. We studied the parsec-scale radio morphology of a complete sample of 21 objects using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations at various frequencies and analyzed the morphological characteristics of their optical hosts. Many of these radio sources exhibit radio morphologies consistent with transverse motions of their bright edges and are located in dynamically disturbed galaxies. VLBI images provide evidence for large-angle, short-period precessing jets, and the orbital motion of the radio-loud AGN in a dual or binary system. The majority of JSS radio sources are in systems in different stages of their merging evolution. We propose a scenario where the rapid jet redirection, through precession or orbital motion, prevents the jet from penetrating the interstellar medium (ISM) sufficiently to escape the host galaxy. Most JSS radio sources remain compact due to their occurrence in merging galaxies</description>

      <title>AGN feedback can produce metal enrichment on galaxy scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant (&gt;100 kpc) nebulae associated with active galaxies provide rich information about the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around galaxies, its link with the interstellar medium (ISM) of the hosts and the mechanisms involved in their evolution. We have studied the giant nebula associated with the Teacup (z=0.085) quasar based on VLT MUSE integral field spectroscopy with two main scientific aims: to investigate whether the well known giant (10 kpc) AGN induced outflow has an impact on the distribution of heavy elements in and outside the host galaxy, and to establish whether there is a physical and/or evolutionary link between the CGM and the ISM. We have mapped the O/H and N/O gas abundances in two spatial dimensions across the giant nebula and within the galaxy by means of comparing emission line ratios with photoionization model predictions. We have also compared the kinematics of the giant nebula with that of the gas and the stars in the host galaxy. The widely studied AGN driven outflow responsible for the 10 kpc ionized bubble is enhancing the gas metal abundance up to 10 kpc from the AGN. O/H is solar or slightly higher in the bubble edges, in comparison with the subsolar abundances across the rest of the nebula median (O/H~0.63 (O/H)). The giant nebula shows complex kinematics. In addition to non circular motions, we propose that there is a rotational component that extends up to the nebular edge. It seems to be kinematically coupled at least partially with the stellar component and the ISM of the host galaxy. We conclude that AGN feedback can produce metal enrichment at large extranuclear distances in galaxies (~10 kpc). The dynamics of the giant nebula is consistent with CGM studies based on absorption lines that show evidence for a substantial rotation component in the CGM of numerous galaxies which, moreover, is often kinematically coupled with the ISM and stars of the galaxies.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the interstellar cyanoacetylene radical cation HC$_3$N$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first identification in space of HC$_3$N$^+$, the simplest member of the family of cyanopolyyne cations. Three rotational transitions with half-integer quantum numbers from $J$=7/2 to 11/2 have been observed with the Yebes 40m radio telescope and assigned to HC$_3$N$^+$, which has an inverted $^2\Pi$ ground electronic state. The three rotational transitions exhibit several hyperfine components due to the magnetic and nuclear quadrupole coupling effects of the H and N nuclei. We confidently assign the characteristic rotational spectrum pattern to HC$_3$N$^+$ based on the good agreement between the astronomical and theoretical spectroscopic parameters. We derived a column density of (6.0$\pm$0.6)$\times$10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a rotational temperature of 4.5$\pm$1\,K. The abundance ratio between HC$_3$N and HC$_3$N$^+$ is 3200$\pm$320. As found for the larger members of the family of cyanopolyyne cations (HC$_5$N$^+$ and HC$_7$N$^+$), HC$_3$N$^+$ is mainly formed through the reactions of H$_2$ and the cation C$_3$N$^+$ and by the reactions of H$^+$ with HC$_3$N. In the same manner than other cyanopolyyne cations, HC$_3$N$^+$ is mostly destroyed through a reaction with H$_2$ and a dissociative recombination with electrons.</description>

      <title>The coherent magnetic halo of Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent catalog of Faraday rotation measures (RM) of extragalactic sources together with the synchrotron polarization data from WMAP and Planck provide us with the wealth of information on magnetic fields of the Galaxy. However, the integral character of these observables together with our position inside the Galaxy makes the inference of the coherent Galactic magnetic field (GMF) complicated and ambiguous. We combine several phenomenological components of the GMF -- the spiral arms, the toroidal halo, the X-shaped field and the field of the Local Bubble -- to construct a new model of the regular GMF outside of the thin disk. To have control over the relative contributions of the RM and polarization data to the fit we pay special attention to the estimation of errors in data bins. To this end we develop a systematic method which is uniformly applicable to different data sets. This method takes into account individual measurement errors, the variance in the bin as well as fluctuations in the data at angular scales larger than the bin size. This leads to decrease of the errors and, as a result, to better sensitivity of the data to the model content. We cross checked the stability of our method with the new LOFAR data. We found that the four components listed above are sufficient to fit both the RM and polarization data over the whole sky with only a small fraction masked out. Moreover, we have achieved several important improvements compared to previous approaches. Due to account of our location inside of the Local Bubble our model does not require introduction of striated fields. For the first time we showed that the Fan Region can be modeled as a Galactic-scale feature. The pitch angle of the magnetic field in our fit converged to the value around 20 degrees. Interestingly, with value is very close to the direction of arms inferred recently from Gaia data on upper main sequence stars.</description>

      <title>MICONIC: JWST/MIRI MRS observations of the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of Mrk231</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/MIRI MRS spatially resolved $\sim 5-28\,\mu$m observations of the central ~4-8kpc of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy and broad absorption line quasar Mrk231. These are part of the Mid-Infrared Characterization of Nearby Iconic galaxy Centers (MICONIC) program of the MIRI European Consortium guaranteed time observations. No high excitation lines (i.e., [MgV] at 5.61$\mu$m or [NeV] at 14.32$\mu$m) typically associated with the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) are detected in the nuclear region of Mrk231. This is likely due to the intrinsically X-ray weak nature of its quasar. Some intermediate ionization potential lines, for instance, [ArIII] at 8.99$\mu$m and [SIV] at 10.51$\mu$m, are not detected either, even though they are clearly observed in a star-forming region ~920pc south-east of the AGN. Thus, the strong nuclear mid-infrared (mid-IR) continuum is also in part hampering the detection of faint lines in the nuclear region. The nuclear [NeIII]/[NeII]line ratio is consistent with values observed in star-forming galaxies. Moreover, we resolve for the first time the nuclear starburst in the mid-IR low-excitation line emission (size of ~400pc, FWHM). Several pieces of evidence also indicate that it is partly obscured even at these wavelengths. At the AGN position, the ionized and warm molecular gas emission lines have modest widths (W_80~300km/s). There are, however, weak blueshifted wings reaching velocities v_02~-400km/s in [NeII]. The nuclear starburst is at the center of a large (~8kpc), massive rotating disk with widely-spread, low velocity outflows. Given the high star formation rate of Mrk231, we speculate that part of the nuclear outflows and the large-scale non-circular motions observed in the mid-IR are driven by its powerful nuclear starburst.</description>

      <title>Systematics in ETG Mass Profile Modelling: Strong Lensing &amp; Stellar Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics are independent and powerful methods to probe the total gravitational potential of galaxies, and thus, their total mass profile. However, inherent degeneracies in the individual models makes it difficult to obtain a full understanding of the distribution of baryons and dark matter (DM), although such degeneracies might be broken by the combination of these two tracers, leading to more reliable measurements of the mass distribution of the lens galaxy. We use mock data from IllustrisTNG50 to compare how dynamical-only, lens-only, and joint modelling can constrain the mass distribution of early-type galaxies (ETGs). The joint model consistently outperforms the other models, achivieng a $2\%$ accuracy in recovering the total mass within $2.5R_\text{eff}$. The Einstein radius is robustly recovered for both lens-only and joint models, with the first showing a median fractional error of $-5\%$ and the latter a fractional error consistent with zero. The stellar mass-to-light ratio and total mass density slope are well recovered by all models. In particular, the dynamical-only model achieves an accuracy of $1\%$ for the stellar mass-to-light ratio, while the accuracy of the mass density slope is typically of the order of $5\%$ for all models. However, all models struggle to constrain integrated quantities involving DM and the halo parameters. Nevertheless, imposing more restrictive assumptions on the DM halo, such as fixing the scale radius, could alleviate some of the issues. Finally, we verify that the number of kinematical constraints ($15, 35, 55$ bins) on the kinematical map does not impact the models outcomes.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Diffuse Molecular Media with Non-ideal Magnetohydrodynamics and Consistent Thermochemistry: Numerical Simulations and Dynamic Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent diffuse molecular clouds can exhibit complicated morphologies caused by the interactions among radiation, chemistry, fluids, and fields. We performed full 3D simulations for turbulent diffuse molecular interstellar media, featuring time-dependent non-equilibrium thermochemistry co-evolved with magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Simulation results exhibit the relative abundances of key chemical species (e.g., C, CO, OH) vary by more than one order of magnitude for the "premature" epoch of chemical evolution ($t\lesssim 2\times 10^5~{\rm yr}$). Various simulations are also conducted to study the impacts of physical parameters. Non-ideal MHD effects are essential in shaping the behavior of gases, and strong magnetic fields ($\sim 10~\mu{\rm G}$) tend to inhibit vigorous compressions and thus reduce the fraction of warm gases ($T\gtrsim 10^2~{\rm K}$). Thermodynamical and chemical conditions of the gas are sensitive to modulation by dynamic conditions, especially the energy injection by turbulence. Chemical features, including ionization (cosmic ray and diffuse interstellar radiation), would not directly affect the turbulence power spectra. Nonetheless, their effects are prominent in the distribution profiles of temperatures and gas densities. Comprehensive observations are necessary and useful to eliminate the degeneracies of physical parameters and constrain the properties of diffuse molecular clouds with confidence.</description>

      <title>General-relativistic instability in rapidly accreting supermassive stars in the presence of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collapse of supermassive stars (SMSs) via the general-relativistic (GR) instability would provide a natural explanation to the existence of the most extreme quasars. The presence of dark matter in SMSs is thought to potentially impact their properties, in particular their mass at collapse. Dark matter might be made of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) that can be captured by the gravitational potential well of SMSs due to interaction with the baryonic gas. The annihilation of WIMPs can provide fuel to support the star before H-burning ignition, favouring low densities of baryonic gas, long stellar lifetimes and high final masses. Here, we estimate the impact of dark matter on the GR dynamical stability of rapidly accreting SMSs. We add a dark matter term to the relativistic equation of adiabatic pulsations and apply it to hylotropic structures in order to determine the onset point of the GR instability. We find that, in principle, the dark matter gravitational field can remove completely the GR instability. However, for SMSs fuelled by H-burning, the dark matter densities required to stabilise the star against GR are orders of magnitude above the values that are expected for the dark matter background. On the other hand, for SMSs fuelled by WIMP annihilation, we find that the low densities of baryonic gas inhibit the destabilising GR corrections, which shifts the stability limit by typically an order of magnitude towards higher masses. As long as central temperatures $\lesssim10^7$ K are maintained by WIMP annihilation, the GR instability is reached only for stellar masses $&gt;10^6$ M$_\odot$. Dark matter can impact the GR dynamical stability of SMSs only in the case of energetically significant WIMP annihilation. The detection of a SMS with mass $&gt;10^6$ M$_\odot$ in an atomically cooled halo can be interpreted as an evidence of WIMP annihilation in the star's core.</description>

      <title>Dissociative Recombination of CF$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents our theoretical study of the dissociative recombination (DR) of the closed-shell diatomic system CF$^+$ based on an approach recently applied to the CH$^+$ molecule. Our extended treatment uses the UK R-matrix theory and the multichannel quantum-defect theory procedure to uniformly resolve the direct and indirect mechanisms of DR while bypassing explicit dissociative state and electronic coupling calculations. The theoretical results exhibit good overall agreement with previous experimental measurements. At lower scattering energies, good agreement is found only if the rotational structure of the ion is included and the theoretical cross sections are averaged over initial rotational levels corresponding to the temperature at which the experimental measurements were made. At higher scattering energies, our rotationally resolved results are very similar to those obtained without including the ion's rotational structure.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the X-ray variability in the Lyman continuum emitter Haro 11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lyman break analogs in the local Universe serve as counterparts to Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at high redshifts, which are widely regarded as major contributors to cosmic reionization in the early stages of the Universe. We studied XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of the nearby LBG analog Haro 11, which contains two X-ray-bright sources, X1 and X2. Both sources exhibit Lyman continuum (LyC) leakage, particularly X2. We analyzed the X-ray variability using principal component analysis (PCA) and performed spectral modeling of the X1 and X2 observations made with the Chandra ACIS-S instrument. The PCA component, which contributes to the X-ray variability, is apparently associated with variable emission features, likely from ionized superwinds. Our spectral analysis of the Chandra data indicates that the fainter X-ray source, X2 (X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X} \sim 4 \times 10^{40} $ erg s$^{-1}$), the one with higher LyC leakage, has a much lower absorbing column ($N_{\rm H} \sim 1.2 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$) than the heavily absorbed luminous source X1 ($L_{\rm X} \sim 9 \times 10^{40} $ erg s$^{-1}$ and $N_{\rm H} \sim 11.5 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$). We conclude that X2 is likely less covered by absorbing material, which may be a result of powerful superwinds clearing galactic channels and facilitating the escape of LyC radiation. Much deeper X-ray observations are required to validate the presence of potential superwinds and determine their implications for the LyC escape.</description>

      <title>Cosmic accretion shocks as a tool to measure the dark matter mass of galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological accretion shocks created during the formation of galaxy clusters are a ubiquitous phenomenon all around the Universe. These shocks, and their features, are intimately related with the gravitational energy put into play during galaxy cluster formation. Studying a sample of simulated galaxy clusters and their associated accretion shocks, we show that objects in our sample sit in a plane within the three dimensional-space of cluster total mass, shock radius, and Mach number (a measure of shock intensity). Using this relation, and considering that forthcoming new observations will be able to measure shock radii and intensities, we put forward the idea that the dark matter content of galaxy clusters could be indirectly measured with an error up to around 30 per cent at the $1\sigma$ confidence level. This procedure would be a new and independent method to measure the dark matter mass in cosmic structures, and a novel constraint to the accepted $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Galaxy clustering in modified gravity from full-physics simulations. I: two-point correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an in-depth investigation of galaxy clustering based on a new suite of realistic large-box galaxy-formation simulations in $f(R)$ gravity, with a subgrid physics model that has been recalibrated to reproduce various observed stellar and gas properties. We focus on the two-point correlation functions of the luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and emission line galaxies (ELGs), which are primary targets of ongoing and future galaxy surveys such as DESI. One surprising result is that, due to several nontrivial effects of modified gravity on matter clustering and the galaxy-halo connection, the clustering signal does not depend monotonically on the fifth-force strength. For LRGs this complicated behaviour poses a challenge to meaningfully constraining this model. For ELGs, in contrast, this can be straightforwardly explained by the time evolution of the fifth force, which means that weaker $f(R)$ models can display nearly the same -- up to $25\%$ -- deviations from $\Lambda$CDM as the strongest ones, albeit at lower redshifts. This implies that even very weak $f(R)$ models can be strongly constrained, unlike with most other observations. Our results show that galaxy formation acquires a significant environment dependence in $f(R)$ gravity which, if not properly accounted for, may lead to biased constraints on the model. This highlights the essential role of hydrodynamical simulations in future tests of gravity exploring precision galaxy-clustering data from the likes of DESI and Euclid.</description>

      <title>An Image-Based Search for Pulsar Candidates in the MeerKAT Bulge Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the results of an image-based search for pulsar candidates toward the Galactic bulge. We used mosaic images from the MeerKAT radio telescope, that were taken as part of a 173 deg**2 survey of the bulge and Galactic center of our Galaxy at L band (856-1712 MHz) in all four Stokes I, Q, U and V. The image root-mean-square noise levels of 12-17 uJy/ba represent a significant increase in sensitivity over past image-based pulsar searches. Our primary search criterion was circular polarization, but we used other criteria including linear polarization, in-band spectral index, compactness, variability and multi-wavelength counterparts to select pulsar candidates. We first demonstrate the efficacy of this technique by searching for polarized emission from known pulsars, and comparing our results with measurements from the literature. Our search resulted in a sample of 75 polarized pulsar candidates. Bright stars or young stellar objects were associated with 28 of these sources, including a small sample of highly polarized dwarf stars with pulsar-like steep spectra. Comparing the properties of this sample with the known pulsars, we identified 30 compelling candidates for pulsation follow-up, including two sources with both strong circular and linear polarization. The remaining 17 sources are either pulsars or stars, but we cannot rule out an extragalactic origin or image artifacts among the brighter, flat spectrum objects.</description>

      <title>The impact of incorrect dissociation energies on inferred photospheric abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral synthesis codes are essential for inferring stellar parameters and detailed chemical abundances. These codes require many physical inputs to predict an emergent spectrum. Developers adopt the best measurements of those inputs at the time they release their code, but those measurements usually improve over time faster than the software is updated. In general, the impact of using incorrect or uncertain dissociation energies are largely unknown. Here we evaluate how incorrect dissociation energies impact abundances measured from C2, CN, CH, TiO, and MgO features. For each molecule we synthesised optical spectra of FGKM-type main-sequence and giant stars using the literature dissociation energy, and an incorrect (perturbed) dissociation energy. We find that the uncertainties in the dissociation energies adopted by spectral synthesis codes for CN, CH, TiO, and MgO lead to negligible differences in flux or abundances. C2 is the only diatomic molecule where the uncertainty of the inputted dissociation energy translates to a significant difference in flux, and carbon abundance differences of up to 0.2 dex. For Solar-like stars, the impact on carbon abundance is up to 0.09 dex. These large abundance differences demonstrate the importance of updating the inputs adopted by spectral synthesis codes, as well as a consensus on appropriate values between different codes.</description>

      <title>Radiation MHD Simulations of Soft X-ray Emitting Regions in Changing Look AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01876v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong soft X-ray emission called soft X-ray excess is often observed in luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN). It has been suggested that the soft X-rays are emitted from a warm ($T=10^6\sim10^7\ \rm{K}$) region that is optically thick for the Thomson scattering (warm Comptonization region). Motivated by the recent observations that soft X-ray excess appears in changing look AGN (CLAGN) during the state transition from a dim state without broad emission lines to a bright state with broad emission lines, we performed global three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations assuming that the mass accretion rate increases and becomes around $10$\% of the Eddington accretion rate. The simulation successfully reproduces a warm, Thomson-thick region outside the hot radiatively inefficient accretion flow near the black hole. The warm region is formed by efficient radiative cooling due to inverse Compton scattering. The calculated luminosity $0.01L_{{\rm Edd}}-0.08L_{{\rm Edd}}$ is consistent with the luminosity of CLAGN. We also found that the warm Comptonization region is well described by the steady model of magnetized disks supported by azimuthal magnetic fields. When the anti-parallel azimuthal magnetic fields supporting the radiatively cooled region reconnect around the equatorial plane of the disk, the temperature of the region becomes higher by releasing the magnetic energy transported to the region.</description>

      <title>Search for Classical Cepheids in Galactic Open Clusters and Calibration of the Period Wesenheit Metallicity Relation in the Gaia Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is beneficial to calibrate the period Wesenheit metallicity relation (PWZR) of Delta Cephei stars (DCEPs), i.e., classical Cepheids, using accurate parallaxes of associated open clusters (OCs) from Gaia data release 3 (DR3). To this aim, we obtain a total of 43 OC-DCEPs (including 33 fundamental mode, 9 first overtone mode, and 1 multimode DCEPs.) and calibrate the PWZR as $W_G=(-3.356 \,\pm\, 0.033) \,(\log{P-1})+(-5.947 \,\pm\, 0.025)+(-0.285 \,\pm\, 0.064)[\textrm{Fe/H}]$. The concurrently obtained residual parallax offset in OC, $zp = -4\pm5\,\mu\textrm{as}$, demonstrate the adequacy of the parallax corrections within the magnitude range of OC member stars. By comparing the field DCEPs' DR3 parallaxes with their photometric parallaxes derived by our PWZR, we estimated the residual parallax offset in field DCEPs as $zp = -15\pm3\,\mu\textrm{as}$. Using our PWZR, we estimate the distance modulus of the Large Magellanic Cloud to be $18.482 \,\pm\, 0.040$ mag, which aligns well with the most accurate published value obtained through geometric methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simulation-based framework to forecast the HI power spectrum on non-linear scales ($k\gtrsim 1\ {\rm Mpc^{-1}}$), as measured by interferometer arrays like MeerKAT in the low-redshift ($z\leq 1.0$) universe. Building on a galaxy-based HI mock catalog, we meticulously consider various factors, including the emission line profiles of HI discs and some observational settings, and explore their impacts on the HI power spectrum. While it is relatively insensitive to the profile shape of HI emission line at these scales, we identify a strong correlation with the profile width, that is, the Full Width at Half Maxima (FWHM, also known as $W_{\rm 50}$ in observations) in this work. By modeling the width function of $W_{50}$ as a function of $v_{\rm max}$, we assign each HI source a emission line profile and find that the resulting HI power spectrum is comparatively close to results from particles in the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation. After implementing $k$-space cuts matching the MeerKAT data, our prediction replicates the trend of the measurements obtained by MeerKAT at $z\approx 0.44$, though with a significantly lower amplitude. Utilizing a Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling method, we constrain the parameter $A_{W_{\rm 50}}$ in the $W_{\rm 50}$ models and $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ with the MeerKAT measurements and find that a strong degeneracy exists between these two parameters.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we use the theory of spatial networks to analyze galaxy distributions. The aim is to develop new approaches to study the spatial galaxy environment properties by means of the network parameters. We investigate how each of the network parameters (degree, closeness and betweeness centrality; diameter; giant component; transitivity) map the cluster structure and properties. We measure the network parameters of galaxy samples comprising the Coma Supercluster and 4 regions in their neighborhood ($z&lt;0.0674$) using the catalog produced by \citet{tempel2014flux}. For comparison we repeat the same procedures for Random Geometric Graphs and Segment Cox process, generated with the same dimensions and mean density of nodes. We found that there is a strong correlation between degree centrality and the normalized environmental density. Also, at high degrees there are more elliptical than spiral galaxies, which confirms the density-morphology relation. The mean degree as a function of the connection radius is an estimator of the count-of-spheres and consequently provides the correlation dimension as a function of the connection radius. The correlation dimension indicates high clustering at scales indicated by the network diameter. Further, at this scales, high values of betweeness centrality characterize galaxy bridges connecting dense regions, tracing very well the filamentary structures. Then, since galaxies with the highest closeness centrality belongs to the largest components of the network, associated to supercluster regions, we can produce a catalog of superclusters only by extracting the largest connected components of the network. Establishing the correlation between the well-studied normalized environmental densities and the parameters of the network theory allows us to develop alternative tools to the study of the large-scale structures.</description>

      <title>Albatross: A scalable simulation-based inference pipeline for analysing stellar streams in the Milky Way</title>

Abstract: Stellar streams are potentially a very sensitive observational probe of galactic astrophysics, as well as the dark matter population in the Milky Way. On the other hand, performing a detailed, high-fidelity statistical analysis of these objects is challenging for a number of key reasons. Firstly, the modelling of streams across their (potentially billions of years old) dynamical age is complex and computationally costly. Secondly, their detection and classification in large surveys such as Gaia renders a robust statistical description regarding e.g., the stellar membership probabilities, challenging. As a result, the majority of current analyses must resort to simplified models that use only subsets or summaries of the high quality data. In this work, we develop a new analysis framework that takes advantage of advances in simulation-based inference techniques to perform complete analysis on complex stream models. To facilitate this, we develop a new, modular dynamical modelling code sstrax for stellar streams that is highly accelerated using jax. We test our analysis pipeline on a mock observation that resembles the GD1 stream, and demonstrate that we can perform robust inference on all relevant parts of the stream model simultaneously. Finally, we present some outlook as to how this approach can be developed further to perform more complete and accurate statistical analyses of current and future data.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a Cloud-Cloud Collision from Overshooting Gas in the Galactic Center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with "bar lanes" that bring gas towards the Galactic Center. Gas flowing along these bar lanes often overshoots, and instead of accreting onto the Central Molecular Zone, it collides with the bar lane on the opposite side of the Galaxy. We observed G5, a cloud which we believe is the site of one such collision, near the Galactic Center at (l,b) = (+5.4, -0.4) with the ALMA/ACA. We took measurements of the spectral lines $^{12}$CO J=2-1, $^{13}$CO J=2-1, C$^{18}$O J=2-1, H$_2$CO J=3$_{03}$-2$_{02}$, H$_{2}$CO J=3$_{22}$-2$_{21}$, CH$_{3}$OH J=4$_{22}$-3$_{12}$, OCS J=18-17 and SiO J=5-4. We observed a velocity bridge between two clouds at $\sim$50 km/s and $\sim$150 km/sin our position-velocity diagram, which is direct evidence of a cloud-cloud collision. We measured an average gas temperature of $\sim$60 K in G5 using H$_2$CO integrated intensity line ratios. We observed that the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio in G5 is consistent with optically thin, or at most marginally optically thick $^{12}$CO. We measured 1.5 x 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$(K km/s)$^{-1}$ for the local X$_{CO}$, 10-20x less than the average Galactic value. G5 is strong direct observational evidence of gas overshooting the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) and colliding with a bar lane on the opposite side of the Galactic center.</description>

      <title>eROSITA narrowband maps at the energies of soft X-ray emission lines</title>

Abstract: [abridged] Hot plasma plays a crucial role in regulating the baryon cycle within the Milky Way, flowing from the energetic sources in the Galactic center and disc, to the corona and the halo. This hot plasma represents an important fraction of the Galactic baryons, plays a key role in galactic outflows and is an important ingredient in galaxy evolution models. Taking advantage of the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG))/eROSITA first all-sky survey (eRASS1), in this work, we aim to provide a panoramic view of the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way. Here we present the eROSITA eRASS1 half sky maps in narrow energy bands corresponding to the most prominent soft X-ray lines: OVII and OVIII, which allow us to constrain the distribution of the hot plasma within and surrounding the Milky Way. We corrected the maps by removing the expected contribution associated with the cosmic X-ray background, the time-variable solar wind charge exchange, and the local hot bubble. We applied corrections to mitigate the effect of absorption, therefore highlighting the emission from the CGM of the Milky Way. We use the line ratio of the oxygen lines as a proxy to constrain the temperature of the warm-hot CGM, and we define a pseudo-temperature $\mathcal{T}$ map. The map highlights how different regions are dominated by different thermal components. Towards the outer halo, the temperature distribution of the CGM on angular scales of 2-20 deg is consistent with being constant $\Delta \mathcal{T} / \langle \mathcal{T}\rangle \leq 4\%$, with a marginal detection of $\Delta \mathcal{T} / \langle \mathcal{T}\rangle = 2.7 \% \pm 0.2\%$ (statistical) $\pm 0.6\%$ (systematic) in the southern hemisphere. Instead, significant variations $\sim 12\%$ are observed on many tens of degrees scales when comparing the northern and southern hemispheres.</description>

      <title>The Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) IX. The largest detailed chemical analysis of very metal-poor stars in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most metal-poor stars provide valuable insights into the early chemical enrichment history of a system, carrying the chemical imprints of the first generations of supernovae. The most metal-poor region of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy remains inadequately observed and characterised. To date, only $\sim4$ stars with [Fe/H]~$&lt;-2.0$ have been chemically analysed with high-resolution spectroscopy. In this study, we present the most extensive chemical abundance analysis of 12 low-metallicity stars with metallicities down to [Fe/H]~$=-3.26$ and located in the main body of Sagittarius. These targets, selected from the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey, were observed using the MIKE high-resolution spectrograph at the {\it Magellan-Clay} telescope, which allowed us to measure up to 17 chemical species. The chemical composition of these stars reflects the imprint of a variety of type~II supernovae (SNe~II). A combination of low- to intermediate-mass high-energy SNe and hypernovae ($\sim10-70\msun$) is required to account for the abundance patterns of the lighter elements up to the Fe-peak. The trend of the heavy elements suggests the involvement of compact binary merger events and fast-rotating (up to $\sim300\kms$) intermediate-mass to massive metal-poor stars ($\sim25-120\msun$) that are the sources of rapid and slow processes, respectively. Additionally, asymptotic giant branch stars contribute to a wide dispersion of [Ba/Mg] and [Ba/Eu]. The absence of an $\alpha-$knee in our data indicates that type Ia supernovae did not contribute in the very metal-poor region ([Fe/H]~$\leq-2.0$). However, they might have started to pollute the interstellar medium at [Fe/H]~$&gt;-2.0$, given the relatively low [Co/Fe] in this metallicity region.</description>

      <title>The miniJPAS Survey: The radial distribution of star formation rates in faint X-ray active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of black hole nuclear activity on both the global and radial star formation rate (SFR) profiles in X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the field of miniJPAS, the precursor of the much wider J-PAS project. Our sample includes 32 AGN with z &lt; 0.3 detected via the XMM-Newton and Chandra surveys. For comparison, we assembled a control sample of 71 star-forming (SF) galaxies with similar magnitudes, sizes, and redshifts.
  To derive the global properties of both the AGN and the control SF sample, we used CIGALE to fit the spectral energy distributions derived from the 56 narrowband and 4 broadband filters from miniJPAS. We find that AGN tend to reside in more massive galaxies than their SF counterparts. After matching samples based on stellar mass and comparing their SFRs and specific SFRs (sSFRs), no significant differences appear. This suggests that the presence of AGN does not strongly influence overall star formation.
  However, when we used miniJPAS as an integral field unit (IFU) to dissect galaxies along their position angle, a different picture emerges. We find that AGN tend to be more centrally concentrated in mass with respect to SF galaxies. Moreover, we find a suppression of the sSFR up to 1Re and then an enhancement beyond 1Re , strongly contrasting with the decreasing radial profile of sSFRs in SF galaxies. This could point to an inside-out quenching of AGN host galaxies. These findings suggest that the reason we do not see differences on a global scale is because star formation is suppressed in the central regions and enhanced in the outer regions of AGN host galaxies. While limited in terms of sample size, this work highlights the potential of the upcoming J-PAS as a wide-field low-resolution IFU for thousands of nearby galaxies and AGN.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field and kinetic helicity evolution in simulations of interacting disk galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carried out a parameter study of interacting disk galaxies with impact parameters ranging from central collisions to weakly interacting scenarios. The orientations of the disks were also varied. In particular, we investigated how magnetic field amplification depends on these parameters. We used magnetohydrodynamics for gas disks in combination with live dark-matter halos in adaptive mesh refinement simulations. The disks were initialized using a setup for isolated disks in hydrostatic equilibrium. Small-scale filtering of the velocity and magnetic field allowed us to estimate the turbulent electromotive force (EMF) and kinetic helicity. Time series of the average magnetic field in central and outer disk regions show pronounced peaks during close encounters and mergers. This agrees with observed magnetic fields at different interaction stages. The central field strength exceeds 10 microgauss (corresponding to an amplification factor of 2 to 3) for small impact parameters. As the disks are increasingly disrupted and turbulence is produced by tidal forces, the small-scale EMF reaches a significant fraction of the total EMF. The small-scale kinetic helicity is initially antisymmetric across the disk plane. Though its evolution is sensitive to both the impact parameter and inclinations of the rotation axes with respect to the relative motion of the disks, antisymmetry is generally broken through interactions and the merger remnant loses most of the initial helicity. The EMF and the magnetic field also decay rapidly after coalescence. The strong amplification during close encounters of the interacting galaxies is mostly driven by helical flows and a mean-field dynamo. The small-scale dynamo contributes significantly in post-interaction phases. However, the amplification of the magnetic field cannot be sustained.</description>

      <title>The AURORA Survey: A New Era of Emission-line Diagrams with JWST/NIRSpec</title>

Abstract: We present results on the emission-line properties of z=1.4-7.5 star-forming galaxies in the Assembly of Ultradeep Rest-optical Observations Revealing Astrophysics (AURORA) Cycle 1 JWST/NIRSpec program. Based on its depth, continuous wavelength coverage from 1--5 microns, and medium spectral resolution (R~1000), AURORA includes detections of a large suite of nebular emission lines spanning a broad range in rest wavelength. We investigate the locations of AURORA galaxies in multiple different emission-line diagrams, including traditional "BPT" diagrams of [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [NII]/Halpha, [SII]/Halpha, and [OI]/Halpha, and the "ionization-metallicity" diagram of [OIII]/[OII] (O32) vs. ([OIII]+[OII])/Hbeta (R23). We also consider a bluer rest-frame "ionization-metallicity" diagram introduced recently to characterize z&gt;10 galaxies: [NeIII]/[OII] vs. ([NeIII]+[OII])/Hdelta; as well as longer-wavelength diagnostic diagrams extending into the rest-frame near-IR: [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [SIII]/[SII] (S32); and HeI/Pagamma and [SIII]/Pagamma vs. [FeII]/Pabeta. With a significant boost in signal-to-noise and large, representative samples of individual galaxy detections, the AURORA emission-line diagrams presented here definitively confirm a physical picture in which chemically-young, alpha-enhanced, massive stars photoionize the ISM in distant galaxies with a harder ionizing spectrum at fixed nebular metallicity than in their z~0 counterparts. We also uncover previously unseen evolution prior to z~2 in the [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [NII]/Halpha diagram, which motivates deep NIRSpec observations at even higher redshift. Finally, we present the first statistical sample of rest-frame near-IR emission-line diagnostics in star-forming galaxies at high redshift. In order to truly interpret rest-frame near-IR line ratios including [FeII], we must obtain better constraints on dust depletion in the high-redshift ISM.</description>

      <title>Simulations of galaxy cluster mergers with velocity-dependent, rare and frequent self-interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) has been proposed to solve small-scale problems in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In previous work, constraints on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter have been derived assuming that the self-interaction cross-section is independent of velocity. However, a velocity-dependent cross-section is more natural in most theories of SIDM. Using idealized $N$-body simulations without baryons, we study merging clusters with velocity-dependent SIDM. In addition to the usual rare scattering in the isotropic limit, we also simulate these systems with anisotropic, small-angle (frequent) scatterings. We find that the collision-less brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) has an offset from the DM peak that grows at later stages. Finally, we also extend the existing upper bounds on the velocity-independent, isotropic self-interaction cross-section to the parameter space of rare and frequent velocity-dependent self-interactions by studying the central densities of dark matter-only isolated haloes. For these upper-bound parameters, the DM-BCG offsets just after the first pericentre in the dark matter-only simulations are found to be $\leq$ 10 kpc. On the other hand, because of BCG oscillations, we speculate that the distribution of BCG offsets in a relaxed cluster is a statistically viable probe. Therefore, this motivates further studies of BCG off-centring in hydrodynamic cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>LtU-ILI: An All-in-One Framework for Implicit Inference in Astrophysics and Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Learning the Universe Implicit Likelihood Inference (LtU-ILI) pipeline, a codebase for rapid, user-friendly, and cutting-edge machine learning (ML) inference in astrophysics and cosmology. The pipeline includes software for implementing various neural architectures, training schemata, priors, and density estimators in a manner easily adaptable to any research workflow. It includes comprehensive validation metrics to assess posterior estimate coverage, enhancing the reliability of inferred results. Additionally, the pipeline is easily parallelizable and is designed for efficient exploration of modeling hyperparameters. To demonstrate its capabilities, we present real applications across a range of astrophysics and cosmology problems, such as: estimating galaxy cluster masses from X-ray photometry; inferring cosmology from matter power spectra and halo point clouds; characterizing progenitors in gravitational wave signals; capturing physical dust parameters from galaxy colors and luminosities; and establishing properties of semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. We also include exhaustive benchmarking and comparisons of all implemented methods as well as discussions about the challenges and pitfalls of ML inference in astronomical sciences. All code and examples are made publicly available at https://github.com/maho3/ltu-ili.</description>
