      <title>A Nonlinear Target-Factor Model with Attention Mechanism for Mixed-Frequency Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Mixed-Panels-Transformer Encoder (MPTE), a novel framework for estimating factor models in panel datasets with mixed frequencies and nonlinear signals. Traditional factor models rely on linear signal extraction and require homogeneous sampling frequencies, limiting their applicability to modern high-dimensional datasets where variables are observed at different temporal resolutions. Our approach leverages Transformer-style attention mechanisms to enable context-aware signal construction through flexible, data-dependent weighting schemes that replace fixed linear combinations with adaptive reweighting based on similarity and relevance. We extend classical principal component analysis (PCA) to accommodate general temporal and cross-sectional attention matrices, allowing the model to learn how to aggregate information across frequencies without manual alignment or pre-specified weights. For linear activation functions, we establish consistency and asymptotic normality of factor and loading estimators, showing that our framework nests Target PCA as a special case while providing efficiency gains through transfer learning across auxiliary datasets. The nonlinear extension uses a Transformer architecture to capture complex hierarchical interactions while preserving the theoretical foundations. In simulations, MPTE demonstrates superior performance in nonlinear environments, and in an empirical application to 13 macroeconomic forecasting targets using a selected set of 48 monthly and quarterly series from the FRED-MD and FRED-QD databases, our method achieves competitive performance against established benchmarks. We further analyze attention patterns and systematically ablate model components to assess variable importance and temporal dependence. The resulting patterns highlight which indicators and horizons are most influential for forecasting.</description>

      <title>Is the diurnal pattern sufficient to explain intraday variation in volatility? A nonparametric assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a nonparametric way to test the hypothesis that time-variation in intraday volatility is caused solely by a deterministic and recurrent diurnal pattern. We assume that noisy high-frequency data from a discretely sampled jump-diffusion process are available. The test is then based on asset returns, which are deflated by the seasonal component and therefore homoskedastic under the null. To construct our test statistic, we extend the concept of pre-averaged bipower variation to a general It\^o semimartingale setting via a truncation device. We prove a central limit theorem for this statistic and construct a positive semi-definite estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix. The $t$-statistic (after pre-averaging and jump-truncation) diverges in the presence of stochastic volatility and has a standard normal distribution otherwise. We show that replacing the true diurnal factor with a model-free jump- and noise-robust estimator does not affect the asymptotic theory. A Monte Carlo simulation also shows this substitution has no discernable impact in finite samples. The test is, however, distorted by small infinite-activity price jumps. To improve inference, we propose a new bootstrap approach, which leads to almost correctly sized tests of the null hypothesis. We apply the developed framework to a large cross-section of equity high-frequency data and find that the diurnal pattern accounts for a rather significant fraction of intraday variation in volatility, but important sources of heteroskedasticity remain present in the data.</description>

      <title>Inference from high-frequency data: A subsampling approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show how to estimate the asymptotic (conditional) covariance matrix, which appears in central limit theorems in high-frequency estimation of asset return volatility. We provide a recipe for the estimation of this matrix by subsampling; an approach that computes rescaled copies of the original statistic based on local stretches of high-frequency data, and then it studies the sampling variation of these. We show that our estimator is consistent both in frictionless markets and models with additive microstructure noise. We derive a rate of convergence for it and are also able to determine an optimal rate for its tuning parameters (e.g., the number of subsamples). Subsampling does not require an extra set of estimators to do inference, which renders it trivial to implement. As a variance-covariance matrix estimator, it has the attractive feature that it is positive semi-definite by construction. Moreover, the subsampler is to some extent automatic, as it does not exploit explicit knowledge about the structure of the asymptotic covariance. It therefore tends to adapt to the problem at hand and be robust against misspecification of the noise process. As such, this paper facilitates assessment of the sampling errors inherent in high-frequency estimation of volatility. We highlight the finite sample properties of the subsampler in a Monte Carlo study, while some initial empirical work demonstrates its use to draw feasible inference about volatility in financial markets.</description>

      <title>Distributional Instruments: Identification and Estimation with Quantile Least Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study instrumental-variable designs where policy reforms strongly shift the distribution of an endogenous variable but only weakly move its mean. We formalize this by introducing distributional relevance: instruments may be purely distributional. Within a triangular model, distributional relevance suffices for nonparametric identification of average structural effects via a control function. We then propose Quantile Least Squares (Q-LS), which aggregates conditional quantiles of X given Z into an optimal mean-square predictor and uses this projection as an instrument in a linear IV estimator. We establish consistency, asymptotic normality, and the validity of standard 2SLS variance formulas, and we discuss regularization across quantiles. Monte Carlo designs show that Q-LS delivers well-centered estimates and near-correct size when mean-based 2SLS suffers from weak instruments. In Health and Retirement Study data, Q-LS exploits Medicare Part D-induced distributional shifts in out-of-pocket risk to sharpen estimates of its effects on depression.</description>

      <title>Finite Population Inference for Factorial Designs and Panel Experiments with Imperfect Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a finite population framework for analyzing causal effects in settings with imperfect compliance where multiple treatments affect the outcome of interest. Two prominent examples are factorial designs and panel experiments with imperfect compliance. I define finite population causal effects that capture the relative effectiveness of alternative treatment sequences. I provide nonparametric estimators for a rich class of factorial and dynamic causal effects and derive their finite population distributions as the sample size increases. Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the desirable properties of the estimators. Finally, I use the estimator for causal effects in factorial designs to revisit a famous voter mobilization experiment that analyzes the effects of voting encouragement through phone calls on turnout.</description>

      <title>Local-Polynomial Estimation for Multivariate Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08941v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a multivariate regression discontinuity design in which treatment is assigned by crossing a boundary in the space of multiple running variables. We document that the existing bandwidth selector is suboptimal for a multivariate regression discontinuity design when the distance to a boundary point is used for its running variable, and introduce a multivariate local-linear estimator for multivariate regression discontinuity designs. Our estimator is asymptotically valid and can capture heterogeneous treatment effects over the boundary. We demonstrate that our estimator exhibits smaller root mean squared errors and often shorter confidence intervals in numerical simulations. We illustrate our estimator in our empirical applications of multivariate designs of a Colombian scholarship study and a U.S. House of representative voting study and demonstrate that our estimator reveals richer heterogeneous treatment effects with often shorter confidence intervals than the existing estimator.</description>

      <title>Estimating Time-Varying Parameters of Various Smoothness in Linear Models via Kernel Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14046v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study kernel-based estimation of nonparametric time-varying parameters (TVPs) in linear models. Our contributions are threefold. First, we establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the kernel-based estimator for a broad class of TVPs including deterministic smooth functions, the rescaled random walk, structural breaks, the threshold model and their mixtures. Our analysis exploits the smoothness of the TVP. Second, we show that the bandwidth rate must be determined according to the smoothness of the TVP. For example, the conventional $T^{-1/5}$ rate is valid only for sufficiently smooth TVPs, and the bandwidth should be proportional to $T^{-1/2}$ for random-walk TVPs, where $T$ is the sample size. We show this highlighting the overlooked fact that the bandwidth determines a trade-off between the convergence rate and the size of the class of TVPs that can be estimated. Third, we propose a data-driven procedure for bandwidth selection that is adaptive to the latent smoothness of the TVP. Simulations and an application to the capital asset pricing model suggest that the proposed method offers a unified approach to estimating a wide class of TVP models.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing with Adversarially-Censored Demands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an online dynamic pricing problem where the potential demand at each time period $t=1,2,\ldots, T$ is stochastic and dependent on the price. However, a perishable inventory is imposed at the beginning of each time $t$, censoring the potential demand if it exceeds the inventory level. To address this problem, we introduce a pricing algorithm based on the optimistic estimates of derivatives. We show that our algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ optimal regret even with adversarial inventory series. Our findings advance the state-of-the-art in online decision-making problems with censored feedback, offering a theoretically optimal solution against adversarial observations.</description>
