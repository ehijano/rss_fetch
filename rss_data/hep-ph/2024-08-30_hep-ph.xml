      <title>Gravitino Thermal Production, Dark Matter, and Reheating of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a full one-loop calculation of the gravitino thermal production rate, beyond the so-called hard thermal loop approximation, using the corresponding thermal spectral functions in numerical form on both sides of the light cone. This framework requires a full numerical evaluation. We interpret our results within the framework of a general supergravity-based model, remaining agnostic about the specifics of supersymmetry breaking. In this context, assuming that gravitinos constitute the entirety of the dark matter in the Universe imposes strict constraints on the reheating temperature. For example, with a gluino mass at the current LHC limit, a maximum reheating temperature of $T_\mathrm{reh} \simeq 10^9$ GeV is compatible with a gravitino mass of $m_{3/2} \simeq 1$ TeV. Additionally, with a reheating temperature an order of magnitude lower at $T_\mathrm{reh} \simeq 10^8$ GeV, the common gaugino mass $M_{1/2}$ can range from $2$ to $4 $ TeV within the same gravitino mass range. For much higher values of $M_{1/2}$, which are favored by current accelerator and cosmological data in the context of supersymmetric models, such as $M_{1/2} = 10$ TeV, and for $m_{3/2} \simeq 1$ TeV the reheating temperature compatible with the gravitino dark matter scenario is $ 10^7$ GeV. If other dark matter particles are considered, the reheating temperature could be much lower.</description>

      <title>Discrete Leptonic Flavor Symmetries: UV Mediators and Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the absence of a definitive top-down indication for understanding the peculiar structure of the lepton sector, discrete flavor symmetries offer a profound perspective for examining the intricate patterns of lepton masses and mixings. In this work, drawing upon previous studies on the interplay of flavor symmetries with the potential UV completions from a purely bottom-up perspective, three well-motivated discrete flavor groups, suitable for portraying the leptonic sector as well as the neutrino masses, specifically $A_4$, $A_5$ and $S_4$, are explored within this framework, leading to the comprehensive classification of the NP mediators, along with the tree-level matching relations onto dimension-6 SMEFT operators. Particular emphasis is placed on the discrete leptonic directions, for which a phenomenological analysis is carried out in order to constrain various NP mediators, where significant focus is directed towards the examination of the cLFV operators, which, for the wide range of applicable cases, offer the leading constraint.</description>

      <title>Search for ultralight dark matter in the SuperMAG high-fidelity dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter, such as kinetically mixed dark-photon dark matter (DPDM) or axionlike-particle dark matter (axion DM), can source an oscillating magnetic-field signal at Earth's surface. Previous work searched for this signal in a publicly available dataset of global magnetometer measurements maintained by the SuperMAG collaboration. This "low-fidelity" dataset reported measurements with a 1-minute time resolution, allowing the search to set leading direct constraints on DPDM and axion DM with Compton frequencies $f_\mathrm{DM}\leq1/(1\,\mathrm{min})$ [corresponding to masses $m_\mathrm{DM}\leq7\times10^{-17}\,\mathrm{eV}$]. More recently, a dedicated experiment undertaken by the SNIPE Hunt collaboration has also searched for this same signal at higher frequencies $f_\mathrm{DM}\geq0.5\,\mathrm{Hz}$ (or $m_\mathrm{DM}\geq2\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{eV}$). In this work, we search for this signal of ultralight DM in the SuperMAG "high-fidelity" dataset, which features a 1-second time resolution, allowing us to probe the gap in parameter space between the low-fidelity dataset and the SNIPE Hunt experiment. The high-fidelity dataset exhibits lower geomagnetic noise than the low-fidelity dataset and features more data than the SNIPE Hunt experiment, making it a powerful probe of ultralight DM. Our search finds no robust DPDM or axion DM candidates. We set constraints on DPDM and axion DM parameter space for $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{Hz}\leq f_\mathrm{DM}\leq0.98\,\mathrm{Hz}$ (or $4\times10^{-18}\,\mathrm{eV}\leq m_\mathrm{DM}\leq4\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{eV}$). Our results are the leading direct constraints on both DPDM and axion DM in this mass range, and our DPDM constraint surpasses the leading astrophysical constraint in a narrow range around $m_{A'}\approx2\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Effective interactions and on-shell recursion relation for massive spin 3/2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use on-shell methods to compute all three-point interactions of massive spin-3/2 particles involving a graviton and particles of spin $\leq 1$. By employing the massive spinor-helicity formalism we identify the interactions which have a smooth massless limit as expected from the superHiggs mechanism. These interactions are then used to on-shell construct four-point massive spin-3/2 amplitudes using an all-line transverse shift for the external momenta, which correctly reproduces the contact gravitino interactions in the $N=1$ supergravity Lagrangian. The on-shell constructed four-point amplitudes are also used to derive well-known unitarity bounds in supergravity. In particular, by adding scalar and pseudoscalar interactions to construct the four-point massive spin-3/2 amplitudes that scale as $E^2$ in the high-energy limit, we recover the on-shell Polonyi model with a Planck scale unitarity bound. These effective three-point interactions and on-shell recursion relations provide an alternative and simpler way to study the interactions of massive spin-3/2 particles without a Lagrangian or the use of Feynman diagrams.</description>

      <title>Improved Treatment of Bosonic Dark Matter Dynamics in Neutron Stars: Consequences and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is conceivable that a bosonic dark matter (DM) with non-gravitational interactions with SM particles will be accumulated at the center of a neutron star (NS) and can lead to black hole formation. In contrast to previous works with a fixed NS temperature, we dynamically determine the formation of Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) for a given set of DM parameters, namely the DM-neutron scattering cross-section ($\sigma_{\chi n}$), the thermal average of DM annihilation cross-section ($\langle\sigma v\rangle$) and the DM mass ($m_\chi$). For both non-annihilating and annihilating DM with $\langle\sigma v\rangle \leq 10^{-26}{~\rm cm^3~ s^{-1}}$, the BEC forms for $m_\chi \lesssim 10 ~{\rm TeV}$. In case of non-annihilating DM, observations of old NS allow $\sigma_{\chi n}\lesssim 10^{-52}~{\rm cm^2}$ for $10 {~\rm MeV} \leq m_{\chi} \lesssim 10 {~\rm GeV}$ (with BEC) and $\sigma_{\chi n}\lesssim 10^{-47}~{\rm cm^2}$ for $5 {~\rm TeV} \lesssim m_\chi \lesssim 30 {~\rm PeV} $ (without BEC). This analysis shows the mass window, $10 {~\rm GeV} \lesssim m_\chi \lesssim 5 {~\rm TeV}$ unconstrained, subject only to direct detection experiments. In the annihilating DM scenario, the exclusion limits on DM parameters become weaker and even vanish for typical WIMP annihilation cross-section. However, the late-time heating of the NS enables us to probe the region with $\sigma_{\chi n}\gtrsim 10^{-47}~{\rm cm^2}$, using the James Webb Space Telescope in the foreseeable future. When our results are viewed in the context of indirect searches of DM, it provides a lower limit on the $\langle\sigma v\rangle$, which is sensitive to the DM thermal state.</description>

      <title>Constraints on $\tau$ electromagnetic moments via tau pair production at the Muon colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous magnetic ($\tilde{a}_\tau$) and electric dipole ($\tilde{d}_\tau$) moment of tau lepton described in $\tau\bar{\tau}\gamma$ vertices are studied via $\mu^{+}\mu^{-} \rightarrow \tau^+\bar{\tau}^-$ process at the Muon colliders designed with the proposed center-of-mass-energy / integrated luminosity configurations of 3 TeV/ 1 ab$^{-1}$ and 10 TeV/ 10 ab$^{-1}$.We obtained the $95\%$ confidence level limits on the $\tilde{a}_\tau$ and $\tilde{d}_\tau$ parameters without and with systematic uncertainty of $10\%$ and compared with the experimental results.The most stringent limits on the anomalous couplings without systematic uncertainty are $-2.63\times10^{-4}&lt; \tilde{a}_\tau &lt;2. 65\times10^{-4}$ and $\mid \tilde{d}_\tau \mid \leq 1.47\times10^{-18} e cm$ at $\sqrt s =10$ TeV and $L_{int}$=10 ab$^{-1}$ option of the Muon collider. Our results show that the Muon colliders lead to a remarkable improvement on the current experimental limits of the anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments of the tau lepton.</description>

      <title>The Standard Model of Particle Physics as an effective theory from two non-universal $U(1)$'s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility of obtaining the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics as an effective theory of a more fundamental one, whose electroweak sector includes two non-universal local $U(1)$ gauge groups, with the chiral anomaly cancellation taking place through an interplay among families. As a result of the spontaneous symmetry breaking, a massive gauge boson $Z'$ arises, which couples differently to the third family of fermions (by assumption, we restrict ourselves to the scenario in which the $Z'$ couples in the same way to the first two families). Two Higgs doublets and one scalar singlet are necessary to generate the SM fermion masses and break the gauge symmetries. We show that in our model, the flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) of the Higgs sector are identically zero if each right-handed SM fermion is only coupled with a single Higgs doublet. This result represents a FCNC cancellation mechanism different from the usual procedure in Two-Higgs Doublet Models~(2HDM). The non-universal nature of our solutions requires the presence of three right-handed neutrino fields, one for each family. Our model generates all elements of the Dirac mass matrix for quarks and leptons, which is quite non-trivial for non-universal models. Thus, we can fit all the masses and mixing angles with two scalar doublets. Finally, we show the distribution of solutions for the scalar boson masses in our model by scanning well-motivated intervals for the model parameters. We consider two possibilities for the scalar potential and compare these results with the Higgs-like resonant signals recently reported by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC. Finally, we also report collider, electroweak, and flavor constraints on the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Future targets for light gauge bosons from cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic strings, theoretical one-dimensional topological defects from the early universe, provide a valuable opportunity for exploring dark matter (DM) production and gravitational wave (GW) emission. Our study investigates the production of gauge bosons and GW emission from cosmic string decay, considering the constraints imposed by cosmological observations. We specifically examine how gauge bosons radiated from strings contribute to DM and dark radiation, with limits set by the observed DM abundance and cosmic microwave background data, respectively. Additionally, we analyze the gravitational wave spectrum of this model across both low and high frequencies. Notably, the spectrum typically follows a $f^{-1/3}$ pattern at high frequencies, beyond the pivot frequency $f_*$. We derive an analytical expression for the frequency $f_*$ and confirm its accuracy through numerical verification. Furthermore, we compare the GW spectrum of this model with the forecasted capabilities of future GW observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, the Big Bang Observer, and $\mu$Ares. Finally, we discuss how these considerations impact the model parameters, specifically the gauge boson mass and the energy scale of U(1) symmetry breaking, providing insights into how cosmic strings could enhance our understanding of DM and GW astronomy.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the semileptonic $B_c\to D_s^*\mu^+ \mu^-$ decay mode in the effective field theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrepancies have been noted between experimental measurements and Standard Model predictions for various observables related to the $B\to(K, K^*,\phi) ll$ processes. Recently, the Belle-II Collaboration observed a $2.8\sigma$ deviation from Standard Model predictions in the branching ratio of the $B \to K \nu_l \bar{\nu_l}$ decay mode. In this context, we investigate the exclusive semileptonic $B_c\to D_s^{*}\mu^+ \mu^-$ decay mode, mediated by $b\to s$ quark level transition, using Effective Field Theory formalism. We perform a global fit to the new parameters using existing experimental data on $b \to s \mu^+ \mu^-$. We then estimate the branching ratio and other observables such as forward-backward asymmetry, lepton polarisation asymmetry, and the lepton non-universality parameter of the $B_c\to D_s^{(*)}\mu^+ \mu^-$ process. Although this process has not yet been detected experimentally, we offer predictions and discuss the observables for $B_c\to D_s^{*}\mu^+ \mu^-$ in both the Standard Model and potential new physics scenarios.</description>

      <title>Event-activity-dependent beauty-baryon enhancement in simulations with color junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results from ALICE and CMS show a low-transverse-momentum enhancement of charm baryon-to-meson production ratios over model predictions based on e$^+$e$^-$ collisions. Several mechanisms are proposed to understand this phenomenon. New measurements by the LHCb and ALICE experiments show a similar enhancement in the beauty sector. We explore this enhancement in terms of event activity using the color-reconnection beyond leading order approximation model. We propose sensitive probes relying on the event shape that will allow for the differentiation between the proposed beauty-production scenarios using freshly collected LHC Run-3 data, and we also compare these to predictions for charm. Our results will contribute to a deeper theoretical understanding of the heavy-flavor baryon enhancement and its relation to baryon enhancement in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a gauge singlet scalar with mass around $1-10$ TeV as a thermal heavy dark matter candidate along with a dilaton as a Higgs portal mediator in a dimensionless scalar extension of the Standard Model. We demonstrate analytically that such a model gives rise to very strong first-order electroweak phase tyransition through supercooling. We calculate the corresponding gravitational wave signals due to bubble collisions during the phase transition. The produced gravitational waves can detected by future space-based gravitational wave detectors in the frequency range from $10^{-4}$ Hz to $0.1$ Hz.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic responses of a nonextensive quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the nonextensive distribution functions and the gluon polarization tensor obtained from kinetic theory, we derive the longitudinal and transverse gluon self-energies for the quark-gluon plasma. The electric permittivity $\varepsilon$ and the magnetic permeability $\mu_M$ are evaluated from the gluon self-energies, through which the real part of the square of the refraction index ${\rm Re}\, n^2$ and the Depine-Lakhtakia index $n_{DL}$ are investigated. The real part of $\varepsilon$ displays a frequency pole $\omega_d=p$, which is just the position of the frequency inflexion of the imaginary part of $\varepsilon$. The nonextensive parameter $q$ significantly affects the real and imaginary parts of $\varepsilon$ in the space-like region $\omega&lt;p$. While the frequency pole $\omega_d=p$ remains unchanged as $q$ increases. The magnetic permeability, ${\rm Re}\, n^2$ and the Depine-Lakhtakia index $n_{DL}$ diverge at frequency $\omega_m$. As $q$ increases, the pole frequency $\omega_m$ shifts to large frequency region. The Depine-Lakhtakia index $n_{DL}$ becomes negative in a quite large frequency region $\omega\in[\omega_c, \omega_m]$. When $q$ increases, the frequency range for $n_{DL}&lt;0$ becomes wider. Nevertheless, there are no propagating modes for the negative refraction. In addition, as momentum $p$ increases, the electric permittivity, the magnetic permeability, ${\rm Re}\, n^2$ and $n_{DL}$ are sensitive to the change of $p$, which indicates the importance of the spatial dispersion in the electromagnetic responses of the QGP.</description>

      <title>On the Schwinger effect during axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pair-creation of charged particles in a strong gauge-field background - the renowned Schwinger effect - can strongly alter the efficiency of gauge-field production during axion inflation. It is therefore crucial to have a clear understanding and proper description of this phenomenon to obtain reliable predictions for the physical observables in this model. In the present work, we revisit the problem of Schwinger pair-production during axion inflation in the presence of both electric and magnetic fields and improve on the state of the art in two ways: (i) taking into account that the electric- and magnetic-field three-vectors are in general noncollinear, we derive the vector decomposition of the Schwinger-induced current in terms of these fields and determine the corresponding effective electric and magnetic conductivities; (ii) by identifying the physical momentum scale associated with the pair-creation process, we incorporate Schwinger damping of the gauge field in a scale-dependent fashion in the relevant equations of motion. Implementing this new description in the framework of the gradient-expansion formalism, we obtain numerical results in a benchmark scenario of axion inflation and perform a comprehensive comparison with earlier results in the literature. In some cases, the resulting energy densities of the produced gauge fields differ from the old results by more than one order of magnitude, which reflects the importance of taking the new effects into account.</description>

      <title>AAK24: Global QCD analysis on polarized parton distribution in the presence of $A_2$ asymmetry measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces {\tt AAK24}, a Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) QCD analysis of polarized data from both polarized Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) and Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) experiments on the nucleon. The {\tt AAK24} QCD analysis incorporates SU(2) and SU(3) symmetry breaking, specifically $\delta \bar{u} \neq \delta \bar{d} \neq \delta \bar{s}$, while assuming $\delta \bar{s}$ and $\delta s$ are equal. Emphasizing the significance of the semi-inclusive data, the study explores the determination of polarized sea quark distributions. Recent experimental data from {\tt JLAB17}, {\tt COMPASS16}, and {\tt COMPASS17}, including the $A_2$ asymmetry measurements along with SIDIS observables, are thoroughly examined for their impact on the central values of polarized PDFs, their uncertainties, and overall fit quality. Additionally, we include the nonperturbative target mass corrections (TMC) as well as higher-twist terms (HT) which are particularly important. In this work, the uncertainties are quantified using the standard Hessian method. The main results and findings of the {\tt AAK24} QCD analysis show overall good agreement with the analyzed experimental data, aligning well with other polarized PDF determinations, particularly {\tt DSSV14}, {\tt LSS10}, {\tt JAM17}, and {\tt AKS14}, all considering SU(2) and SU(3) symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Cold Quark Matter: Renormalization Group Improvement at next-to-next-to leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend previous next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) calculations of the QCD pressure at zero temperature and non-zero baryonic densities using the renormalization group optimized perturbation theory (RGOPT), which entails an all-order RG-invariant resummation. First, we consider the approximation of three massless quark flavors, and then adding the running strange quark mass dependence. The resulting pressure displays a sizeably reduced sensitivity to variations of the arbitrary renormalization scale as compared to the state-of-the-art NNLO results. This confirms previous NLO investigations that the RGOPT resummation scheme provides improved convergence properties and reduced renormalization scale uncertainties, thus being a promising prescription to improve perturbative QCD at high and mid range baryonic densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that various nucleon "radii" that appear in the literature, e.g."charge", "gravitational", "mass" or "mechanical, do not have a direct geometric meaning and do not give an idea of the physical size of the nucleon. In the framework of the Gribov parton scheme we show that at high enough energy the gluon cloud of the nucleon shows up and begins to define the interaction region of nucleon-nucleon scattering.</description>

      <title>Chiral oscillations in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac particles have two intrinsic degrees-of-freedom, helicity and chirality. While helicity is conserved in time, chirality is not constant under time evolution for massive particles, yielding the phenomenon of chiral oscillations. So far, chiral oscillations have been mainly described in the framework of single particle relativistic quantum mechanics. In this paper, we present a quantum field theory approach to chiral oscillations in analogy with the one used to describe flavor mixing and oscillations. By taking the expectation value of chiral charges, we obtain the same chiral oscillation formula derived via standard relativistic quantum mechanics. We find that chiral charges are diagonalized by a Bogoliubov transformation: this implies that the vacuum for particles with definite chirality is orthogonal to the one for those with definite energy. In the case of neutrinos, our results can be further extended to include also flavor oscillations.</description>

      <title>Electron Scattering at the Intensity Frontier with SoLID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solenoidal Large Intensity Device (SoLID) is a large acceptance spectrometer capable of operating at the luminosity frontier. It is proposed to fully exploit the scientific potential of the continuous electron beam accelerator facility (CEBAF) 12 GeV energy upgrade at Jefferson Lab. Its conceptual design is mature, having passed multiple reviews and been validated by a successful pre-R\&amp;D phase. The envisioned scientific program consists of three avenues of research, namely the 3D momentum imaging of the structure of the nucleon, the origin of the proton mass through the gluonic gravitational form factors (GFFs), and the search of physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. These avenues are complemented by a growing supplemental list of run group experiments that address a variety of important topics.</description>

      <title>Orbital Dynamics of the Solar Basin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the solar basin -- the accumulated population of weakly-interacting particles on bound orbits in the Solar System. We focus on particles starting off on Sun-crossing orbits, corresponding to initial conditions of production inside the Sun, and investigate their evolution over the age of the Solar System. A combination of analytic methods, secular perturbation theory, and direct numerical integration of orbits sheds light on the long- and short-term evolution of a population of test particles orbiting the Sun and perturbed by the planets. Our main results are that the effective lifetime of a solar basin at Earth's location is $\tau_{\rm eff} = 1.20\pm 0.09 \,\mathrm{Gyr}$, and that there is annual (semi-annual) modulation of the basin density with known phase and amplitude at the fractional level of 6.5% (2.2%). These results have important implications for direct detection searches of solar basin particles, and the strong temporal modulation signature yields a robust discovery channel. Our simulations can also be interpreted in the context of gravitational capture of dark matter in the Solar System, with consequences for any dark-matter phenomenon that may occur below the local escape velocity.</description>

      <title>Boson Cloud Atlas: Direct Observation of Superradiance Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight scalars emerge naturally in several motivated particle physics scenarios and are viable candidates for dark matter. While laboratory detection of such bosons is challenging, their existence in nature can be imprinted on measurable properties of astrophysical black holes (BHs). The phenomenon of superradiance can convert the BH spin kinetic energy into a bound cloud of scalars. In this letter, we propose a new technique for directly measuring the mass of a dark cloud around a spinning BH. We compare the measurement of the BH spin obtained with two independent electromagnetic techniques: continuum fitting and iron K$\alpha$ spectroscopy. Since the former technique depends on a dynamical observation of the BH mass while the latter does not, a mismatch between the two measurements can be used to infer the presence of additional extended mass around the BH. We find that a precision of $\sim 1\%$ on the two spin measurements is required to exclude the null hypothesis of no dark mass around the BH at a 2$\sigma$ confidence level for dark masses about a few percent of the BH mass, as motivated in some superradiance scenarios.</description>

      <title>Higher-order gaugino condensates on a twisted $\mathbb T^4$: In the beginning, there was semi-classics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the gaugino condensates, $\left\langle \prod_{i=1}^k \text{tr}(\lambda\lambda)(x_i) \right\rangle $ for $1$ $\leq$ $k$ $\le$ $N-1$, in $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory on a small four-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^4$, subject to 't Hooft twisted boundary conditions. Two recent advances are crucial to performing the calculations and interpreting the result: the understanding of generalized anomalies involving $1$-form center symmetry and the construction of multi-fractional instantons on the twisted $\mathbb T^4$. These self-dual classical configurations have topological charge $k/N$ and can be described as a sum over $k$ closely packed lumps in an instanton liquid. Using the path integral formalism, we perform the condensate calculations in the semi-classical limit and find, assuming gcd$(k,N)=1$, $\left\langle \prod_{i=1}^k \text{tr}(\lambda\lambda)(x_i) \right\rangle = {\bf n}^{-1} \; N^2\left(16\pi^2 \Lambda^3\right)^k$, where $\Lambda$ is the strong-coupling scale and ${\bf n}$ is a normalization constant. We determine the normalization constant, using path integral, as ${\bf n} = N^2$, which is $N$ times larger than the normalization used in our earlier publication arXiv:2210.13568. This finding resolves the extra-factor-of-$N$ discrepancy encountered there, aligning our results with those obtained through direct supersymmetric methods on $\mathbb R^4$. The normalization constant ${\bf n}$ can be interpreted within the Euclidean path-integral formulation as the Witten index $I_W$. It is well-established that a Hamiltonian calculation of $I_W$ yields $I_W=N$, suggesting that while ${\bf n}=N^2$ correctly reproduces the condensate result, it presents a puzzle in reconciling the Witten index computation via the path integral formalism, an issue warranting further investigation.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Stasis from a Single Annihilating Particle Species: Extending Stasis Into the Thermal Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that extended cosmological epochs can exist during which the abundances associated with different energy components remain constant despite cosmological expansion. Indeed, this "stasis" behavior has been found to arise generically in many BSM theories containing large towers of states, and even serves as a cosmological attractor. However, all previous studies of stasis took place within non-thermal environments, or more specifically within environments in which thermal effects played no essential role in realizing or sustaining the stasis. In this paper, we demonstrate that stasis can emerge and serve as an attractor even within thermal environments, with thermal effects playing a critical role in the stasis dynamics. Moreover, within such environments, we find that no towers of states are needed -- a single state experiencing two-body annihilations will suffice. This work thus extends the stasis phenomenon into the thermal domain and demonstrates that thermal effects can also generally give rise to an extended stasis epoch, even when only a single matter species is involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of high-energy events can take place in the seconds leading up to a binary neutron-star merger. Mechanisms involving tidal resonances, electrodynamic interactions, or shocks in mass-loaded wakes have been proposed as instigators of these precursors. With a view of gravitational-wave and multimessenger astrophysics more broadly, premerger observations and theory are reviewed emphasising how gamma-ray precursors and dynamical tides can constrain the neutron-star equation of state, thermodynamic microphysics, and evolutionary pathways. Connections to post-merger phenomena, notably gamma-ray bursts, are discussed together with how magnetic fields, spin and misalignment, crustal elasticity, and stratification gradients impact observables.</description>

      <title>Strange stars admixed with dark matter: equiparticle model in a two fluid approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we explore the possible scenario of strange stars admixed with fermionic or bosonic dark matter. For the description of the ``visible'' sector, we use a specific phenomenological quark model that takes into account in-medium effects for the quark masses through a suitable baryonic density dependence, in which the free parameters are chosen from the analysis of the stellar matter stability window (parametrizations presenting lower energy per baryon than iron nuclei). In the case of the dark sector, we investigate the predictions of fermionic and bosonic models. In the former we consider a spin $1/2$ dark particle, and the latter is described by a dark scalar meson. Both models present a repulsive vector interaction, particularly important for the bosonic model since it helps avoiding the collapse of the star due to the lack of the degeneracy pressure. Our results point out to possible stable strange stars configurations in agreement with data from PSR~J0030+0451, PSR~J0740+6620, NICER and HESS~J1731-347. As another feature, we find stars with dark matter halo configurations for lower values of the dark particle mass.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing the sources of dielectron anisotropic flow at low beam energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present calculations of dielectron anisotropic flow in heavy-ion collisions at HADES beam energies from a hadronic transport approach. The ongoing experimental analysis employs the traditional reaction plane method to evaluate the flow coefficients $v_n$ and claims to see isotropic radiation from the thermal quark-gluon plasma. We show in this work, that in the region above the pion mass, the dilepton flow measurement might suffer from cancellation effects that mask the complicated underlying dynamics. Contributions from different baryonic and mesonic resonances show collective behaviour with different signs and lead to an overall vanishing elliptic flow. To differentiate the different contributions, we propose to employ the scalar product method, which exploits the previously measured hadronic flow to create different reference planes. As a proof of concept, we calculate the $v_2$ of dielectrons for Ag+Ag collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.55$ $\mathrm{GeV}$ with both methods and investigate the contribution of each source, concluding that the scalar product method provides the proton and pion tagged flow coefficients as two distinct measurements, disentangling the various dilepton sources.</description>

      <title>Flavor Dependence of Charged Pion Fragmentation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have measured the flavor dependence of multiplicities for pi^+ and pi^- production in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) on proton and deuteron targets to explore a possible charge symmetry violation in fragmentation functions. The experiment used an electron beam with energies of 10.2 and 10.6 GeV at Jefferson Lab and the Hall-C spectrometers. The electron kinematics spanned the range 0.3&lt;x&lt;0.6, 2&lt;Q^2&lt;5.5 GeV^2, and 4&lt;W^2&lt;11 GeV^2. The pion fractional momentum range was 0.3&lt; z &lt;0.7, and the transverse momentum range was 0&lt;p_T&lt;0.25 GeV/c. Assuming factorization at low p_T and allowing for isospin breaking, we find that the results can be described by two ``favored" and two ``un-favored" effective low $p_T$ fragmentation functions that are flavor-dependent. However, they converge to a common flavor-independent value at the lowest x or highest W of this experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the existence of massive neutron stars and asymptotic freedom of QCD place robust upper bounds on the lowest sound speed of the ultra-dense matter unattainable in neutron stars. Our approach does not rely on explicitly representing the equation of state in the density range $\sim 2-40 n_0$, and does not require probabilistic interpretations. The upper limit decreases rapidly when the maximum mass of neutron stars is greater than about $2.5M_\odot$. Discovery of $\sim 3 M_\odot$ neutron stars would strongly support first-order phase transitions at high baryon densities</description>

Abstract: A model of dark sector where $O({\rm few~GeV})$ mass dark matter particles $\chi$ couple to a lighter dark force mediator $V$, $m_V \ll m_\chi$, is motivated by the recently discovered mismatch between simulated and observed shapes of galactic haloes. Such models, in general, provide a challenge for direct detection efforts and collider searches. We show that for a large range of coupling constants and masses, the production and decay of the bound states of $\chi$, such as $0^{-+}$ and $1^{--}$ states, $\eta_D$ and $ \Upsilon_D$, is an important search channel. We show that $e^+e^-\to \eta_D +V$ or $\Upsilon_D +\gamma$ production at $B$-factories for $\alpha_D &gt; 0.1$ is sufficiently strong to result in multiple pairs of charged leptons and pions via $\eta_D\to 2V \to 2(l^+l^-)$ and $\Upsilon_D\to 3V \to 3(l^+l^-)$ $(l=e,\mu,\pi)$. The absence of such final states in the existing searches performed at \babar\ and Belle sets new constraints on the parameter space of the model. We also show that a search for multiple bremsstrahlung of dark force mediators, $e^+e^-\to \chi\bar\chi+nV$, resulting in missing energy and multiple leptons, will further improve the sensitivity to self-interacting dark matter.</description>

      <title>Search for baryon junctions in photonuclear processes and isobar collisions at RHIC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.05685v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the early development of Quantum Chromodynamics, it was proposed that baryon number could be carried by a non-perturbative Y-shaped topology of gluon fields, called the gluon junction, rather than by the valence quarks as in the QCD standard model. A puzzling feature of ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions is the apparent substantial baryon excess in the midrapidity region that could not be adequately accounted for in most conventional models of quark and diquark transport. The transport of baryonic gluon junctions is predicted to lead to a characteristic exponential distribution of net-baryon density with rapidity and could resolve the puzzle. In this context we point out that the rapidity density of net-baryons near midrapidity indeed follows an exponential distribution with a slope of $-0.61\pm0.03$ as a function of beam rapidity in the existing global data from A+A collisions at AGS, SPS and RHIC energies. To further test if quarks or gluon junctions carry the baryon quantum number, we propose to study the absolute magnitude of the baryon vs. charge stopping in isobar collisions at RHIC. We also argue that semi-inclusive photon-induced processes ($\gamma+p$/A) at RHIC kinematics provide an opportunity to search for the signatures of the baryon junction and to shed light onto the mechanisms of observed baryon excess in the mid-rapidity region in ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. Such measurements can be further validated in A+A collisions at the LHC and $e+p$/A collisions at the EIC.</description>

Abstract: Dynamical theories of dark energy predict new degrees of freedom with particular environmental sensitivity to avoid constraints on fifth forces. We show that the similar, yet complementary multi-purpose detector setup of the ATLAS and CMS experiments provides a unique opportunity to place sensitivity on such scenarios in a narrow, yet relevant parameter range. Furthermore, our investigation gives rise to a novel phenomenological signature that the LHC experiments can pursue to exploit their complementary detector design from a BSM perspective.</description>

      <title>Probing some photon portals to new physics at intensity frontier experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A number of extensions of the Standard Model predict the existence of new light, weakly-coupled particles that couple to the visible sector through higher-dimensional operators containing one or two photons, suppressed by a high new physics scale, and thus have long lifetimes. In this work, we study the prospects for detecting three $\sim\,$sub-GeV such long-lived particles (LLP) at intensity frontier experiments: a massive spin-2 mediator ($G$), a dark axion portal, and a light neutralino coupled to ALPino or gravitino. We consider the production and visible decays of these particles in several current and proposed beam dump experiments (CHARM, NuCal, SeaQuest, NA62, SHiP) as well as in the LHC detectors (FASER, FASER$\nu$, FLArE, MATHUSLA). In addition to the usual displaced vertex signature, we also examine the impact of electron scattering signature and the Primakoff-like process which leads to conversion of $G$ into a photon or to the secondary LLP production via upscattering of the lighter dark sector state on dense material put in front of the detector. In all cases, we find the SHiP experiment could provide the strongest constraints for the displaced vertex search, while FASER2/FPF could provide complementary coverage of the $\gamma c\tau \sim 1$ m decay length region of the parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the kinetic mixing between the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photon and the birefringent dark photon. These birefringent dark photon may exist in parity-violating dark sector, for example, through the coupling to axion field. We show that the birefringence of the dark photon propagates to the CMB photon, but the resulting birefringence may not be isotropic over the sky, but will be anisotropic in general. Moreover, our investigation sheds light on the essential role played by kinetic mixing in the generation of two fundamental characteristics of the CMB: circular polarization and spectral distortion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to use atoms and molecules as quantum sensors of axion-mediated monopole-dipole forces. We show that electron spin precession experiments using atomic and molecular beams are well-suited for axion searches thanks to the presence of co-magnetometer states and single-shot temporal resolution. Experimental strategies to detect axion gradients from localised sources and the earth are presented, taking ACME III as a prototype example. Other possibilities including atomic beams, and laser-cooled atoms and molecules are discussed.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection in Collider Physics via Factorized Observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To maximize the discovery potential of high-energy colliders, experimental searches should be sensitive to unforeseen new physics scenarios. This goal has motivated the use of machine learning for unsupervised anomaly detection. In this paper, we introduce a new anomaly detection strategy called FORCE: factorized observables for regressing conditional expectations. Our approach is based on the inductive bias of factorization, which is the idea that the physics governing different energy scales can be treated as approximately independent. Assuming factorization holds separately for signal and background processes, the appearance of non-trivial correlations between low- and high-energy observables is a robust indicator of new physics. Under the most restrictive form of factorization, a machine-learned model trained to identify such correlations will in fact converge to the optimal new physics classifier. We test FORCE on a benchmark anomaly detection task for the Large Hadron Collider involving collimated sprays of particles called jets. By teasing out correlations between the kinematics and substructure of jets, our method can reliably extract percent-level signal fractions. This strategy for uncovering new physics adds to the growing toolbox of anomaly detection methods for collider physics with a complementary set of assumptions.</description>

      <title>Anomaly detection with flow-based fast calorimeter simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, several normalizing flow-based deep generative models have been proposed to accelerate the simulation of calorimeter showers. Using CaloFlow as an example, we show that these models can simultaneously perform unsupervised anomaly detection with no additional training cost. As a demonstration, we consider electromagnetic showers initiated by one (background) or multiple (signal) photons. The CaloFlow model is designed to generate single photon showers, but it also provides access to the shower likelihood. We use this likelihood as an anomaly score and study the showers tagged as being unlikely. As expected, the tagger struggles when the signal photons are nearly collinear, but is otherwise effective. This approach is complementary to a supervised classifier trained on only specific signal models using the same low-level calorimeter inputs. While the supervised classifier is also highly effective at unseen signal models, the unsupervised method is more sensitive in certain regions and thus we expect that the ultimate performance will require a combination of these approaches.</description>

      <title>Small instanton-induced flavor invariants and the axion potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small instantons which increase the axion mass due to an appropriate modification of QCD at a UV scale $\Lambda_{\rm SI}$, can also enhance the effect of CP-violating operators to shift the axion potential minimum by an amount, $\theta_{\rm ind}$, proportional to the flavorful couplings in the SMEFT. Since physical observables must be flavor basis independent, we construct a basis of determinant-like flavor invariants that arise from instanton calculations containing the effects of dimension-six CP-odd operators at the scale $\require{cancel}\Lambda_{\cancel{\rm CP}}$. This new basis provides a more reliable estimate of the shift $\theta_{\rm ind}$, that is severely constrained by neutron electric dipole moment experiments. In particular, for the case of four-quark, semi-leptonic and gluon dipole operators, these invariants are then used to provide improved limits on the ratio of scales $\require{cancel}\Lambda_{\rm SI}/\Lambda_{\cancel{\rm CP}}$ for different flavor scenarios. The CP-odd flavor invariants also provide a classification of the leading effects from Wilson coefficients, and as an example, we show that a semi-leptonic four-fermion operator is subdominant compared to the four-quark operators. More generally, the flavor invariants, together with an instanton NDA, can be used to more accurately estimate small instanton effects in the axion potential that arise from any SMEFT operator.</description>

Abstract: Multiparticle cumulants method can be used to reveal long-range collectivity in small and large colliding systems. The four-particle symmetric cumulant $sc_{2,4} \left \{ 4 \right \}$, three-particle asymmetric cumulant $ac_{2} \left \{ 3 \right \}$, and the normalized cumulants $nsc_{2,4} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ and $nac_{2} \left \{ 3 \right \}$ from the transverse momentum conservation and flow are calculated. The interplay between the two effects is also investigated. Our results are in a good agreement with the recent ATLAS measurements of multiparticle azimuthal correlations with the subevent cumulant method, which provides insight into the origin of collective flow in small systems.</description>

      <title>On the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Debye shielding cannot be employed to constrain the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles, contrary to what is stated in the previous literature. Current model-independent bounds on the monopole abundance are then revisited for unit Dirac magnetic charge. We find that the Andromeda Parker bound can be employed to set an upper limit on the monopole flux at the level of $F_M\lesssim 5.3\times 10^{-19}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}\text{sr}^{-1}$ for a monopole mass $10^{13}\,\text{GeV}/c^2\lesssim m\lesssim 10^{16}\,\text{GeV}/c^2$, which is more stringent than the MACRO direct search limit by two orders of magnitude. This translates into stringent constraints on the monopole density parameter $\Omega_M$ at the level of $10^{-7}-10^{-4}$ depending on the mass. For larger monopole masses the scenarios in which magnetic monopoles account for all or the majority of dark matter are disfavored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known difficulty of perturbative approaches to quantum field theory at finite temperature is the necessity to address theoretical constraints that are not present in the vacuum theory. In this work, we use lattice simulations of scalar correlation functions in massive $\phi^{4}$ theory to analyse the extent to which these constraints affect the perturbative predictions. We find that the standard perturbative predictions deteriorate even in the absence of infrared divergences at relatively low temperatures, and that this is directly connected to the analytic structure of the propagators used in the expansion. This suggests that the incorporation of non-perturbative thermal effects in the propagators is essential for a consistent perturbative formulation of scalar quantum field theories at finite temperature. By utilising the spectral constraints imposed on finite-temperature correlation functions, we explore how these effects manifest themselves in the lattice data, and discuss why the presence of distinct thermoparticle excitations provides a potential resolution to these issues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to do a systematic feasibility study of measuring in backward region deeply virtual Compton scattering on the pion in Sullivan processes in the framework of collinear QCD factorization where pion to photon transition distribution amplitudes (TDAs) describe the photon content of the $\pi$ meson. Our approach employs TDAs based on the overlap of light front wave functions, using a previously developed pion light-front wave function and deriving a consistent model for the light front wave functions of the photon. This work is expected to lead us to an estimate of the cross-sections that could be measured in the future U.S. and China's electron-ion colliders. It will also provide a comparison with the forward Sullivan DVCS case, which gives access to pion GPDs and for which a strong signal is expected.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of pseudoscalar mesons in a contact interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the unique role played by the gravitational form factors (GFFs) in unraveling the internal mechanics of hadrons, we examine the GFFs of ground state pseudoscalar mesons $\pi$, $\eta_c$, $\eta_b$ and the hypothetical {\em strangeonium} $\eta_s(s\bar{s})$. We adopt the coupled framework of Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations within a contact interaction, and employ a novel approach to the dressed amputated meson-meson scattering amplitude which makes connection with the energy-momentum tensor and with the GFFs. The resulting GFFs fulfill the anticipated symmetry constraints. The corresponding charge and mass radii and the $D-$term are also computed. We show that the $D-$term for the pseudoscalar mesons is bounded within the $(-1, -1/3)$ range; these bounds correspond to the massless (chiral limit) and infinitely massive cases, respectively. Considering the current interest in the GFFs, understanding the \textit{D}-term of pseudoscalar mesons and their GFFs can provide an important first step for future endeavors in the field.</description>

Abstract: Novel interactions beyond the four known fundamental forces in nature (electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions), may arise due to "new physics" beyond the standard model, manifesting as a "fifth force". This review is focused on spin-dependent fifth forces mediated by exotic bosons such as spin-0 axions and axionlike particles and spin-1 Z' bosons, dark photons, or paraphotons. Many of these exotic bosons are candidates to explain the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and their interactions may violate fundamental symmetries. Spin-dependent interactions between fermions mediated by the exchange of exotic bosons have been investigated in a variety of experiments, particularly at the low-energy frontier. Experimental methods and tools used to search for exotic spin-dependent interactions, such as atomic comagnetometers, torsion balances, nitrogen-vacancy spin sensors, and precision atomic and molecular spectroscopy, are described. A complete set of interaction potentials, derived based on quantum field theory with minimal assumptions and characterized in terms of reduced coupling constants, are presented. A comprehensive summary of existing experimental and observational constraints on exotic spin-dependent interactions is given, illustrating the current research landscape and promising directions of further research.</description>

      <title>A new formulation of strong-field magnetohydrodynamics for neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a formulation of magnetohydrodynamics which can be used to describe the evolution of strong magnetic fields in neutron star interiors. Our approach is based on viewing magnetohydrodynamics as a theory with a one-form global symmetry and developing an effective field theory for the hydrodynamic modes associated with this symmetry. In the regime where the local velocity and temperature variations can be neglected, we derive the most general constitutive relation consistent with symmetry constraints for the electric field in the presence of a strong magnetic field. This constitutive relation not only reproduces the phenomena of Ohmic decay, ambipolar diffusion, and Hall drift derived in a phenomenological model by Goldreich and Reisenegger, but also reveals new terms in the evolution of the magnetic field which cannot easily be seen from such microscopic models. This formulation gives predictions for novel diffusion behaviors of small perturbations around a constant background magnetic field, and for the two-point correlation functions among various components of the electric and magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Machine learning study to identify collective flow in small and large colliding systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective flow has been found to be similar between small colliding systems ($p$ $+$ $p$ and $p$ $+$ A collisions) and large colliding systems (peripheral A $+$ A collisions) at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. In order to study the differences of collective flow between small and large colliding systems, we employ a point cloud network to identify $p$ $+$ Pb collisions and peripheral Pb $+$ Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV generated from a multiphase transport model (AMPT). After removing the discrepancies in the pseudorapidity distribution and the $p_{\rm T}$ spectra, we capture the discrepancy in collective flow. Although the verification accuracy of our PCN is limited due to similar event-by-event distributions of elliptic and triangular flow, we demonstrate that collective flow between $p$ $+$ Pb collisions and peripheral Pb $+$ Pb collisions becomes more distinct with increasing final hadron multiplicity and parton scattering cross section. This study not only highlights the potential of PCN techniques in advancing the understanding of collective flow in varying colliding systems, but more importantly lays the groundwork for the future PCN-related research.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background detection using NANOGrav 15-year data set in the context of massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convincing evidence of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background has been found by the NANOGrav Collaboration in the 15-year data set. From this signal, we can evaluate the possibility of its source being from the early Universe through the tensor perturbations induced by a massive spin-2 graviton field. We consider a time-dependent model of the minimal theory of massive gravity and find values of the graviton mass, mass cutoff time, and Hubble rate of inflation that amplify the energy spectra of primordial GWs sufficiently to reproduce the signal from the NANOGrav data within 1-3 standard deviation. However, a suppression mechanism for high-frequency modes must be introduced to conservatively obey the big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound. While there are regions of the parameter space that reproduce the signal, it remains a challenge to simultaneously respect the BBN and cosmic microwave background bounds without making the graviton mass cutoff time too deep into the matter-dominated era.</description>

      <title>The worldvolume fermion as baryon in holographic QCD with instanton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the worldvolume fermion on the flavor brane in the D0-D4/D8 model which is holographically equivalent to the four-dimensional QCD with instantons, or equivalently with a theta angle. The action for the worldvolume fermion is obtained by the T-duality rules in string theory and we accordingly derive its effectively five-dimensional, canonical four-dimensional forms by using the systematical dimensional reduction and decomposition of spinor. Afterwards, we employ the AdS/CFT dictionary in order to evaluate the two-point correlation function as the spectral function for the worldvolume fermion and interpret the fermion as baryon by analyzing its quantum number with the baryon vertex in holography. In this sense, the interacted action involving the worldvolume fermion and gauge field on the flavor brane are finally derived in holography which describes the various interaction of meson and baryon with instantons in large-N limit. Therefore, this work provides a holographic picture to describe baryon and its interactions based on string theory, in particular, in the presence of instantons or a theta angle.</description>

      <title>Neural Simulation-Based Inference of the Neutron Star Equation of State directly from Telescope Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00287v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a unique opportunity to study strongly interacting matter under extreme density conditions. The intricacies of matter inside neutron stars and their equation of state are not directly visible, but determine bulk properties, such as mass and radius, which affect the star's thermal X-ray emissions. However, the telescope spectra of these emissions are also affected by the stellar distance, hydrogen column, and effective surface temperature, which are not always well-constrained. Uncertainties on these nuisance parameters must be accounted for when making a robust estimation of the equation of state. In this study, we develop a novel methodology that, for the first time, can infer the full posterior distribution of both the equation of state and nuisance parameters directly from telescope observations. This method relies on the use of neural likelihood estimation, in which normalizing flows use samples of simulated telescope data to learn the likelihood of the neutron star spectra as a function of these parameters, coupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to efficiently sample from the corresponding posterior distribution. Our approach surpasses the accuracy of previous methods, improves the interpretability of the results by providing access to the full posterior distribution, and naturally scales to a growing number of neutron star observations expected in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Impact of Dark Sector Preheating on CMB Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prediction of a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of curvature and tensor fluctuations is among the main features of cosmic inflation. The current measurements of the primordial fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide tight constraints on the amplitude of the scalar and tensor spectra, and the scalar tilt. However, the precise connection between these observables and a given inflationary model, depends on the expansion history between the end of inflation and the beginning of the radiation dominated era, which corresponds to the reheating epoch. This mapping between horizon exit and reentry of fluctuations, parametrized by the number of $e$-folds $N_*$, can therefore be affected by the presence of a transient epoch of non-perturbative particle production during reheating ({\em preheating}). Using a combination of perturbative and lattice computations, we quantify the impact of preheating in a non-equilibrated dark matter sector on the CMB observables, under the assumption of a simultaneous perturbative decay of the inflaton into Standard Model particles. Combined with structure formation constraints, this allows us to impose stringent bounds on the post-inflationary reheating temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of high-redshift supermassive black holes (SMBHs) via the direct collapse of baryonic clouds, where the unwanted formation of molecular hydrogen is successfully suppressed by a Lyman-Werner (LW) photon background from relic particle decay. We improve on existing studies by dynamically simulating the collapse, accounting for the adiabatic contraction of the DM halo, as well as the in-situ production of the LW photons within the cloud which reduce the impact of the cloud's shielding. We find a viable parameter space where the decay of either some of the dark matter or all of a subdominant decaying species successfully allows direct collapse of the cloud to a SMBH.</description>

      <title>Reassessing constant-roll Warm Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Departing from standard slow-roll conditions is one way of putting the inflationary paradigm to test, and constraining the dynamics of the inflaton field with a constant-rate of roll of the inflaton field, a.k.a. the constant-roll scenario, is one way of exploring such deviation from the standard slow-roll dynamics. In this manuscript we explore such a possibility in a variant inflationary scenario, known as Warm Inflation. We construct and derive the conditions for having constant-roll WI models where inflation lasts at least for 60 $e-$folds, gracefully exits the constant-roll inflation phase, and maintains near thermal equilibrium of the system which is an essential feature of WI in the slow-roll regime. We show that while certain models of WI (the ones with dissipative coefficient as a function of temperature alone) can accommodate constant-roll dynamics, others (with dissipative coefficient as a function of temperature and the inflaton field both) fail to maintain thermal equilibrium once the constant-roll condition is imposed and hence cannot produce a constant-roll WI phase.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds on the Mass of Fundamental Fields from Primordial Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations in the vacuum zero point energy associated to quantum fields and their statistical distributions during inflation. It is shown that the perturbations in the vacuum zero point energy have large amplitudes which are highly non-Gaussian. The effects of vacuum zero point fluctuations can be interpreted as the loop corrections in primordial power spectrum and bispectrum. Requiring that the primordial curvature perturbation to remain nearly Gaussian and the loop corrections to be under perturbative control impose strong upper bounds on the mass of fundamental fields during inflation. We show that the fundamental fields can not be much heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation, otherwise their vacuum zero point fluctuations induce large non-Gaussianities in primordial perturbations. Considering the observational upper bound on tensor to scalar ratio, we conclude that all fundamental fields are lighter than $10^{14}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Probing collectivity in heavy-ion collisions with fluctuations of the $p_T$ spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event-by-event fluctuations in the initial stages of ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions depend little on rapidity. The hydrodynamic expansion which occurs in later stages then gives rise to correlations among outgoing particles which depend weakly on their relative rapidity. Azimuthal correlations, through which anisotropic flow ($v_n(p_T)$) is defined, have been the most studied. Here we study a new observable introduced in 2020 by Schenke, Shen and Teaney and dubbed $v_0(p_T)$, which quantifies the relative change in the $p_T$ spectrum induced by a fluctuation. We describe how it can be measured. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we make quantitative predictions for $v_0(p_T)$ of charged and identified hadrons. We then discuss how $v_0(p_T)$ relates to two phenomena which have been measured: The increase of the mean transverse momentum in ultracentral collisions, and the event-by-event fluctuations of the transverse momentum per particle $[ p_T]$. We show that $v_0(p_T)$ determines the dependence of these quantities on the $p_T$ cuts implemented in the analysis. We quantitatively explain the rise of $\sigma_{p_T}$ observed by ATLAS as the upper $p_T$-cut is increased from $2$ to $5$~GeV/$c$.</description>

      <title>Exact Results for Scaling Dimensions of Composite Operators in the $\phi^4$ Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the scaling dimension $\Delta_n$ for the class of composite operators $\phi^n$ in the $\lambda \phi^4$ theory taking the double scaling limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $\lambda \rightarrow 0$ with fixed $\lambda n$ via a semiclassical approach. Our results resum the leading power of $n$ at any loop order. In the small $\lambda n$ regime we reproduce the known diagrammatic results and predict the infinite series of higher-order terms. For intermediate values of $\lambda n$ we find that $\Delta_n/n$ increases monotonically approaching a $(\lambda n)^{1/3}$ behavior in the $\lambda n \to \infty$ limit. We further generalize our results to the $\displaystyle{\left(\vec{\phi} \cdot \vec{\phi}\right)^{n/2}}$ operators in the $O(N)$ model.</description>

      <title>Vertex correction to nuclear matrix elements of double-$\beta$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The predicted neutrinoless double-$\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay is the crucial phenomenon to prove the existence of the Majorana neutrino, which gives a foundation to leptogenesis to explain the matter prevalence of the universe. The nuclear matrix element (NME) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay is an important theoretical quantity to determine the effective neutrino mass and help the detector design for the next generation of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay search. Reliable calculation of this NME is a long-standing problem because of the diversity of the predicted values of the NME. The main reason for this difficulty is that the effective strength of the Gamow-Teller transition operator $g_A$ for this decay is unknown. I will show the lowest-order vertex corrections for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ and the $2\nu\beta\beta$ NME of $^{136}$Xe in the framework of the hybrid application of the quantum field theory to the leptons and the Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger perturbation to the nucleus. The unperturbed nuclear states are obtained by the quasiparticle random-phase approximation. These corrections reduce the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME by 30%. The effective $g_A$ referring to this reduced NME is also obtained, and it is shown for the first time that the effective $g_A$ for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME is not quite different from that for the $2\nu\beta\beta$ NME; the difference is only 10%. This indicates the possibility that the phenomenological effective $g_A$ to reproduce the experimental half-life of the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay can be approximately used for the calculation of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME.</description>
