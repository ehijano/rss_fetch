      <title>Speech to Speech Synthesis for Voice Impersonation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous models have shown great success in the fields of speech recognition as well as speech synthesis, but models for speech to speech processing have not been heavily explored. We propose Speech to Speech Synthesis Network (STSSN), a model based on current state of the art systems that fuses the two disciplines in order to perform effective speech to speech style transfer for the purpose of voice impersonation. We show that our proposed model is quite powerful, and succeeds in generating realistic audio samples despite a number of drawbacks in its capacity. We benchmark our proposed model by comparing it with a generative adversarial model which accomplishes a similar task, and show that ours produces more convincing results.</description>

      <title>Generative Audio Extension and Morphing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In audio-related creative tasks, sound designers often seek to extend and morph different sounds from their libraries. Generative audio models, capable of creating audio using examples as references, offer promising solutions. By masking the noisy latents of a DiT and applying a novel variant of classifier-free guidance on such masked latents, we demonstrate that: (i) given an audio reference, we can extend it both forward and backward for a specified duration, and (ii) given two audio references, we can morph them seamlessly for the desired duration. Furthermore, we show that by fine-tuning the model on different types of stationary audio data we mitigate potential hallucinations. The effectiveness of our method is supported by objective metrics, with the generated audio achieving Fr\'echet Audio Distances (FADs) comparable to those of real samples from the training data. Additionally, we validate our results through a subjective listener test, where subjects gave positive ratings to the proposed model generations. This technique paves the way for more controllable and expressive generative sound frameworks, enabling sound designers to focus less on tedious, repetitive tasks and more on their actual creative process.</description>

      <title>AudioChat: Unified Audio Storytelling, Editing, and Understanding with Transfusion Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent breakthroughs, audio foundation models struggle in processing complex multi-source acoustic scenes. We refer to this challenging domain as audio stories, which can have multiple speakers and background/foreground sound effects. Compared to traditional audio processing tasks, audio stories introduce new layers of semantic, temporal, and physical complexity. To address this challenge, we propose AudioChat, a framework for developing audio foundation models that can generate, edit, and understand audio stories. AudioChat introduces a new paradigm in which LLM-based toolcalling agents simulate interactions between users and the system, and these simulated dialogues are used as training data. We also introduce a novel Audio Transfusion Forcing objective to train the AudioChat model, allowing it to simultaneously decompose high-level instructions via structured chain-of-thought reasoning and perform interactive multi-turn audio understanding/generation. To evaluate generation and editing performance, we develop three new metrics that directly measure task performance instead of relying upon distribution-based scoring. We highly encourage readers to visit our demo to better understand the capabilities of AudioChat: https://wanchichen.github.io/audiochat/.</description>

      <title>Voice-Driven Semantic Perception for UAV-Assisted Emergency Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted networks are increasingly foreseen as a promising approach for emergency response, providing rapid, flexible, and resilient communications in environments where terrestrial infrastructure is degraded or unavailable. In such scenarios, voice radio communications remain essential for first responders due to their robustness; however, their unstructured nature prevents direct integration with automated UAV-assisted network management. This paper proposes SIREN, an AI-driven framework that enables voice-driven perception for UAV-assisted networks. By integrating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based semantic extraction and Natural Language Processing (NLP) validation, SIREN converts emergency voice traffic into structured, machine-readable information, including responding units, location references, emergency severity, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. SIREN is evaluated using synthetic emergency scenarios with controlled variations in language, speaker count, background noise, and message complexity. The results demonstrate robust transcription and reliable semantic extraction across diverse operating conditions, while highlighting speaker diarization and geographic ambiguity as the main limiting factors. These findings establish the feasibility of voice-driven situational awareness for UAV-assisted networks and show a practical foundation for human-in-the-loop decision support and adaptive network management in emergency response operations.</description>

      <title>Art2Mus: Artwork-to-Music Generation via Visual Conditioning and Large-Scale Cross-Modal Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music generation has advanced markedly through multimodal deep learning, enabling models to synthesize audio from text and, more recently, from images. However, existing image-conditioned systems suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) they are typically trained on natural photographs, limiting their ability to capture the richer semantic, stylistic, and cultural content of artworks; and (ii) most rely on an image-to-text conversion stage, using language as a semantic shortcut that simplifies conditioning but prevents direct visual-to-audio learning. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce ArtSound, a large-scale multimodal dataset of 105,884 artwork-music pairs enriched with dual-modality captions, obtained by extending ArtGraph and the Free Music Archive. We further propose ArtToMus, the first framework explicitly designed for direct artwork-to-music generation, which maps digitized artworks to music without image-to-text translation or language-based semantic supervision. The framework projects visual embeddings into the conditioning space of a latent diffusion model, enabling music synthesis guided solely by visual information. Experimental results show that ArtToMus generates musically coherent and stylistically consistent outputs that reflect salient visual cues of the source artworks. While absolute alignment scores remain lower than those of text-conditioned systems-as expected given the substantially increased difficulty of removing linguistic supervision-ArtToMus achieves competitive perceptual quality and meaningful cross-modal correspondence. This work establishes direct visual-to-music generation as a distinct and challenging research direction, and provides resources that support applications in multimedia art, cultural heritage, and AI-assisted creative practice. Code and dataset will be publicly released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>AutoProsody: A Prosodic Feature Extraction Tool for Indian Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The availability of prosodic information from speech signals is useful in a wide range of applications. However, deriving this information from speech signals can be a laborious task involving manual intervention. Therefore, the current work focuses on developing a tool that can provide prosodic annotations corresponding to a given speech signal, particularly for Indian languages. The proposed Segmentation with Intensity, Tones and Break Indices (SIToBI) tool provides time-aligned phoneme, syllable, and word transcriptions, syllable-level pitch contour annotations, break indices, and syllable-level relative intensity indices. The tool focuses more on syllable-level annotations since Indian languages are syllable-timed. Indians, regardless of the language they speak, may exhibit influences from other languages. As a result, other languages spoken in India may also exhibit syllable-timed characteristics. The accuracy of the annotations derived from the tool is analyzed by comparing them against manual annotations and the tool is observed to perform well. While the current work focuses on three languages, namely, Tamil, Hindi, and Indian English, the tool can easily be extended to other Indian languages and possibly other syllable-timed languages as well.</description>

      <title>Prototype-Based Disentanglement for Controllable Dysarthric Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dysarthric speech exhibits high variability and limited labeled data, posing major challenges for both automatic speech recognition (ASR) and assistive speech technologies. Existing approaches rely on synthetic data augmentation or speech reconstruction, yet often entangle speaker identity with pathological articulation, limiting controllability and robustness.
  In this paper, we propose ProtoDisent-TTS, a prototype-based disentanglement TTS framework built on a pre-trained text-to-speech backbone that factorizes speaker timbre and dysarthric articulation within a unified latent space. A pathology prototype codebook provides interpretable and controllable representations of healthy and dysarthric speech patterns, while a dual-classifier objective with a gradient reversal layer enforces invariance of speaker embeddings to pathological attributes. Experiments on the TORGO dataset demonstrate that this design enables bidirectional transformation between healthy and dysarthric speech, leading to consistent ASR performance gains and robust, speaker-aware speech reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Array-Aware Ambisonics and HRTF Encoding for Binaural Reproduction With Wearable Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel method for binaural reproduction from arbitrary microphone arrays, based on array-aware optimization of Ambisonics encoding through Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) pre-processing. The proposed approach integrates array-specific information into the HRTF processing pipeline, leading to improved spatial accuracy in binaural rendering. Objective evaluations demonstrate superior performance under simulated wearable-array and head rotations compared to conventional Ambisonics encoding method. A listening experiment further confirms that the method achieves significantly higher perceptual ratings in both timbre and spatial quality. Fully compatible with standard Ambisonics, the proposed method offers a practical solution for spatial audio rendering in applications such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and wearable audio capture.</description>

      <title>MCIF: Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction-Following Benchmark from Scientific Talks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have laid the foundation for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which unify text, speech, and vision within a single framework. As these models are rapidly evolving toward general-purpose instruction following across diverse and complex tasks, a key frontier is evaluating their crosslingual and multimodal capabilities over both short- and long-form inputs. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on a single modality at a time, rely on short-form inputs, or lack human annotations--hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first crosslingual human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks on NLP and beyond. MCIF evaluates instruction following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over different input lengths and spans four macro-tasks: recognition, translation, question answering, and summarization. It covers three core modalities (speech, vision, and text) and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and Chinese), fully aligned across all dimensions. This parallel design enables a systematic evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret instructions across languages and effectively integrate multimodal contextual information. Our benchmarking and analysis of 23 models highlight universal challenges across modalities and tasks, indicating substantial room for improvement in future MLLMs development.

      <title>Resp-Agent: An Agent-Based System for Multimodal Respiratory Sound Generation and Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based respiratory auscultation is currently hindered by two fundamental challenges: (i) inherent information loss, as converting signals into spectrograms discards transient acoustic events and clinical context; (ii) limited data availability, exacerbated by severe class imbalance. To bridge these gaps, we present Resp-Agent, an autonomous multimodal system orchestrated by a novel Active Adversarial Curriculum Agent (Thinker-A$^2$CA). Unlike static pipelines, Thinker-A$^2$CA serves as a central controller that actively identifies diagnostic weaknesses and schedules targeted synthesis in a closed loop. To address the representation gap, we introduce a Modality-Weaving Diagnoser that weaves EHR data with audio tokens via Strategic Global Attention and sparse audio anchors, capturing both long-range clinical context and millisecond-level transients. To address the data gap, we design a Flow Matching Generator that adapts a text-only Large Language Model (LLM) via modality injection, decoupling pathological content from acoustic style to synthesize hard-to-diagnose samples. As a foundation for these efforts, we introduce Resp-229k, a benchmark corpus of 229k recordings paired with LLM-distilled clinical narratives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Resp-Agent consistently outperforms prior approaches across diverse evaluation settings, improving diagnostic robustness under data scarcity and long-tailed class imbalance. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/zpforlove/Resp-Agent.</description>
