      <title>Compensation-based risk-sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the mathematical problem of allocating payouts (compensations) in an endowment contingency fund using a risk-sharing rule that satisfies full allocation. Besides the participants, an administrator manages the fund by collecting ex-ante contributions to establish the fund and distributing ex-post payouts to members. Two types of administrators are considered. An 'active' administrator both invests in the fund and receives the payout of the fund when no participant receives a payout. A 'passive' administrator performs only administrative tasks and neither invests in nor receives a payout from the fund. We analyze the actuarial fairness of both compensation-based risk-sharing schemes and provide general conditions under which fairness is achieved. The results extend earlier work by Denuit and Robert (2025) and Dhaene and Milevsky (2024), who focused on payouts based on Bernoulli distributions, by allowing for general non-negative loss distributions.</description>

      <title>Optimized Multi-Level Monte Carlo Parametrization and Antithetic Sampling for Nested Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating risk measures such as large loss probabilities and Value-at-Risk is fundamental in financial risk management and often relies on computationally intensive nested Monte Carlo methods. While Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) techniques and their weighted variants are typically more efficient, their effectiveness tends to deteriorate when dealing with irregular functions, notably indicator functions, which are intrinsic to these risk measures. We address this issue by introducing a novel MLMC parametrization that significantly improves performance in practical, non-asymptotic settings while maintaining theoretical asymptotic guarantees. We also prove that antithetic sampling of MLMC levels enhances efficiency regardless of the regularity of the underlying function. Numerical experiments motivated by the calculation of economic capital in a life insurance context confirm the practical value of our approach for estimating loss probabilities and quantiles, bridging theoretical advances and practical requirements in financial risk estimation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sampling for Realized Variance Estimation in Time-Changed Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11833v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the benefits of sampling intraday returns in intrinsic time for the realized variance (RV) estimator. We theoretically show in finite samples that depending on the permitted sampling information, the RV estimator is most efficient under either hitting time sampling that samples whenever the price changes by a pre-determined threshold, or under the new concept of realized business time that samples according to a combination of observed trades and estimated tick variance. The analysis builds on the assumption that asset prices follow a diffusion that is time-changed with a jump process that separately models the transaction times. This provides a flexible model that allows for leverage specifications and Hawkes-type jump processes and separately captures the empirically varying trading intensity and tick variance processes, which are particularly relevant for disentangling the driving forces of the sampling schemes. Extensive simulations confirm our theoretical results and show that for low levels of noise, hitting time sampling remains superior while for increasing noise levels, realized business time becomes the empirically most efficient sampling scheme. An application to stock data provides empirical evidence for the benefits of using these intrinsic sampling schemes to construct more efficient RV estimators as well as for an improved forecast performance.</description>
