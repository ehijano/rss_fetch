      <title>Mathematical Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Utilizing Machine Learning Tools for Assessing the Impact of Climate Lobbying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate policy and legislation has a significant influence on both domestic and global responses to the pressing environmental challenges of our time. The effectiveness of such climate legislation is closely tied to the complex dynamics among elected officials, a dynamic significantly shaped by the relentless efforts of lobbying. This project aims to develop a novel compartmental model to forecast the trajectory of climate legislation within the United States. By understanding the dynamics surrounding floor votes, the ramifications of lobbying, and the flow of campaign donations within the chambers of the U.S. Congress, we aim to validate our model through a comprehensive case study of the American Clean Energy and Security Act (ACESA). Our model adeptly captures the nonlinear dynamics among diverse legislative factions, including centrists, ardent supporters, and vocal opponents of the bill, culminating in a rich dynamics of final voting outcomes. We conduct a stability analysis of the model, estimating parameters from public lobbying records and a robust body of existing literature. The numerical verification against the pivotal 2009 ACESA vote, alongside contemporary research, underscores the models promising potential as a tool to understand the dynamics of climate lobbying. We also analyse the pathways of the model that aims to guide future legislative endeavors in the pursuit of effective climate action.</description>

      <title>Fees in AMMs: A quantitative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the ever evolving landscape of decentralized finance automated market makers (AMMs) play a key role: they provide a market place for trading assets in a decentralized manner. For so-called bluechip pairs, arbitrage activity provides a major part of the revenue generation of AMMs but also a major source of loss due to the so-called 'informed orderflow'. Finding ways to minimize those losses while still keeping uninformed trading activity alive is a major problem in the field. In this paper we will investigate the mechanics of said arbitrage and try to understand how AMMs can maximize the revenue creation or in other words minimize the losses. To that end, we model the dynamics of arbitrage activity for a concrete implementation of a pool and study its sensitivity to the choice of fee aiming to maximize the revenue for the AMM. We identify dynamical fees that mimic the directionality of the price due to asymmetric fee choices as a promising avenue to mitigate losses to toxic flow. This work is based on and extends a recent article by some of the authors.</description>
