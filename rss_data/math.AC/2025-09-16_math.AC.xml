      <title>Purity and distances between conjugates of elements over henselian valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a henselian valued field $(K,v)$ and a separable-algebraic element $a\in\overline{K}\setminus K$, we consider the set $S_K(a):= \{ v(a-a^\prime) \mid a^\prime\neq a \text{ is a $K$-conjugate of $a$} \}$. The central aim of this paper is to provide a bound for the cardinality of the set $S_K(a)$, and to characterize the elements $a$ for which this set is a singleton. Connections of this set with the notion of \textit{depth} of $a$ has also been explored. We show that $S_K(a)$ is a singleton whenever $K(a)|K$ is a minimal extension. A stronger version of this result is obtained when $a$ has depth one over $K$. We also provide a host of examples illustrating that the bounds obtained are strict.
  Apart from being of independent interest, another primary motivation for considering this problem comes from the study of ramification ideals. In the depth one case, when $K(a)|K$ is a Galois extension, we obtain intimate connections between the cardinalities of $S_K(a)$ and the number of ramification ideals of the extension $(K(a)|K,v)$. In particular, we show that these cardinalities are same whenever the extension is defectless and non-tame, or whenever $(K,v)$ has rank one. In order to obtain these results, we provide comprehensive descriptions of the ramification ideals of $(K(a)|K,v)$ which extend the known results in this direction.</description>

      <title>Injective modules over pseudo-krullian orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of rings, pseudo-krullian orders, consider the Serre quotients of their module categories with respect to pseudo-isomorphisms and describe injective objects in such quotient categories and its global homological dimension. These results generalize the results of I. Beck for the case of Krull rings. In particular, we establish the global homological dimension of the category of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over an order over a noetherian ring of Krull dimension 2.</description>

      <title>Polymatroidal ideals and their asymptotic syzygies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $I$ be a polymatroidal ideal. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the homological shift ideals of powers of polymatroidal ideals. We prove that the first homological shift algebra $\text{HS}_1(\mathcal{R}(I))$ of $I$ is generated in degree one as a module over the Rees algebra $\mathcal{R}(I)$ of $I$. We conjecture that the $i$th homological shift algebra $\text{HS}_i(\mathcal{R}(I))$ of $I$ is generated in degrees $\le i$, and we confirm it in many significant cases. We show that $I$ has the $1$st homological strong persistence property, and we conjecture that the sequence $\{\text{Ass}\,\text{HS}_i(I^k)\}_{k&gt;0}$ of associated primes of $\text{HS}_i(I^k)$ becomes an increasing chain for $k\ge i$. This conjecture is established when $i=1$ and for many families of polymatroidal ideals. Finally, we explore componentwise polymatroidal ideals, and we prove that $\text{HS}_1(I)$ is again componentwise polymatroidal, if $I$ is componentwise polymatroidal.</description>

      <title>Cohen-Macaulay Type via Lattice Homology and the Motivic Poincar\'e Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give results on reduced complex-analytic curve germs which relate their indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay (MCM) modules to their lattice homology groups and related invariants, thereby providing a connection between the algebraic theory of MCM modules and techniques arising from low-dimensional topology. In particular, we characterize the germs $(C, o)$ of finite Cohen-Macaulay type in terms of the lattice homology $\mathbb{H}_*(C, o)$, and those of tame type in terms of the lattice homologies and associated spectral sequences of $(C, o)$ and its subcurves, including the distinction between germs of finite and infinite growth. As a consequence of these results, we obtain corresponding characterizations of a germ's Cohen-Macaulay type in terms of the motivic Poincar\'e series.</description>

      <title>Line graphs of simplicial complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.13463v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the line graph of a pure simplicial complex. We prove that, as in the case of line graphs of simple graphs, one can compute the second graded Betti number of the facet ideal of a pure simplicial complex in terms of the combinatorial structure of its line graph. We characterize those pure simplicial complexes whose line graph is a complete (bipartite) graph. We give conditions that line graphs of simplicial complexes should fulfill.</description>

      <title>New Results On $S-r-$ideals in Commutative Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article studies the notion of $S-r-$ideals in commutative ring $H$, where $S$ is a multiplicatively closed subset of $H$. Some basic properties of $S-r-$ideals are given. Various characterizations of $S-r-$ideals are presented. Also, $S-uz-$ring is defined and it is proved that $H$ is an $S-uz-$ring if and only if every maximal ideal disjoint from $S$ is an $S-r-$ideal provided $S$ is finite. In addition, the $S-r-$ideal concept is examined in amalgamation and trivial extension. Finally, $S-r-$ideals are studied in polynomial rings and it is investigated that when $A[x]$ is an $S-r-$ideal of $H[x].$</description>

      <title>$\delta$-rings, perfectoid towers, and lim Cohen-Macaulay sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to study basic structures and interrelations of $\delta$-rings, perfectoid towers, and lim Cohen-Macaulay sequences over Noetherian rings in positive or mixed characteristic. Then we discuss some methods for constructing perfectoid towers, dealing with $p$-torsion free and $p$-torsion cases, respectively. Some interesting examples arise as quotients by monomial or binomial ideals or determinantal rings. We also explain a geometric method with a view toward constructing rings with certain singularities.</description>

      <title>Exact Algorithms for Computing Generalized Eigenspaces of Matrices via Jordan-Krylov Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04807v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An effective exact method is proposed for computing generalized eigenspaces of a matrix of integers or rational numbers. Keys of our approach are the use of minimal annihilating polynomials and the concept of the Jourdan-Krylov basis. A new method, called Jordan-Krylov elimination, is introduced to design an algorithm for computing Jordan-Krylov basis. The resulting algorithm outputs generalized eigenspaces as a form of Jordan chains. Notably, in the output, components of generalized eigenvectors are expressed as polynomials in the associated eigenvalue as a variable.</description>

      <title>Integral transforms on singularity categories for Noetherian schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies conditions under which integral transforms induce exact functors on singularity categories between schemes that are proper over a Noetherian base scheme. A complete characterization for this behavior is provided, which extends earlier work of Ballard and Rizzardo. We leverage a description of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves as finite cohomological functors on the category of perfect complexes, which is an application of Neeman's approximable triangulated categories, to reduce arguments to an affine local setting. Moreover, we study adjoints of such functors, extend a result of Olander to varieties with mild singularities, and provide an obstruction for derived equivalences between singular varieties.</description>
