      <title>Nearly Tight Bounds on Approximate Equilibria in Spatial Competition on the Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Hotelling's model of spatial competition, a unit mass of voters is distributed in the interval $[0,1]$ (with their location corresponding to their political persuasion), and each of $m$ candidates selects as a strategy his distinct position in this interval. Each voter votes for the nearest candidate, and candidates choose their strategy to maximize their votes. It is known that if there are more than two candidates, equilibria may not exist in this model. It was unknown, however, how close to an equilibrium one could get. Our work studies approximate equilibria in this model, where a strategy profile is an (additive) $\epsilon$-equilibria if no candidate can increase their votes by $\epsilon$, and provides tight or nearly-tight bounds on the approximation $\epsilon$ achievable.
  We show that for 3 candidates, for any distribution of the voters, $\epsilon \ge 1/12$. Thus, somewhat surprisingly, for any distribution of the voters and any strategy profile of the candidates, at least $1/12$th of the total votes is always left ``on the table.'' Extending this, we show that in the worst case, there exist voter distributions for which $\epsilon \ge 1/6$, and this is tight: one can always compute a $1/6$-approximate equilibria. We then study the general case of $m$ candidates, and show that as $m$ grows large, we get closer to an exact equilibrium: one can always obtain an $1/(m+1)$-approximate equilibria in polynomial time. We show this bound is asymptotically tight, by giving voter distributions for which $\epsilon \ge 1/(m+3)$.</description>

      <title>Agent-Constrained Truthful Two-Facility Location Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a truthful two-facility location problem in which there is set of agents with private locations on the line of real numbers, and the goal is to place two facilities at different locations chosen from the set of those reported by the agents. Given a feasible solution, each agent suffers an individual cost which is either its total distance to both facilities (sum-variant) or its distance to the farthest facility (max-variant). For both variants, we show tight bounds on the approximation ratio of deterministic and randomized mechanisms in terms of the social cost, the total individual cost of the agents.</description>

      <title>Playing Games with your PET: Extending the Partial Exploration Tool to Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present version 2.0 of the Partial Exploration Tool (PET), a tool for verification of probabilistic systems. We extend the previous version by adding support for stochastic games, based on a recent unified framework for sound value iteration algorithms. Thereby, PET2 is the first tool implementing a sound and efficient approach for solving stochastic games with objectives of the type reachability/safety and mean payoff. We complement this approach by developing and implementing a partial-exploration based variant for all three objectives. Our experimental evaluation shows that PET2 offers the most efficient partial-exploration based algorithm and is the most viable tool on SGs, even outperforming unsound tools.</description>

      <title>Imprecise Probabilities Meet Partial Observability: Game Semantics for Robust POMDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) rely on the key assumption that probability distributions are precisely known. Robust POMDPs (RPOMDPs) alleviate this concern by defining imprecise probabilities, referred to as uncertainty sets. While robust MDPs have been studied extensively, work on RPOMDPs is limited and primarily focuses on algorithmic solution methods. We expand the theoretical understanding of RPOMDPs by showing that 1) different assumptions on the uncertainty sets affect optimal policies and values; 2) RPOMDPs have a partially observable stochastic game (POSG) semantic; and 3) the same RPOMDP with different assumptions leads to semantically different POSGs and, thus, different policies and values. These novel semantics for RPOMDPS give access to results for the widely studied POSG model; concretely, we show the existence of a Nash equilibrium. Finally, we classify the existing RPOMDP literature using our semantics, clarifying under which uncertainty assumptions these existing works operate.</description>

      <title>Controlling Borda Elections by Adding or Deleting either Votes or Candidates: Complete and Top-Truncated Votes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An election is defined as a pair of a set of candidates C=\{c_1,\cdots,c_m\} and a multiset of votes V=\{v_1,\cdots,v_n\}, where each vote is a linear order of the candidates. The Borda election rule is characterized by a vector \langle m-1,m-2,\cdots,0\rangle, which means that the candidate ranked at the i-th position of a vote v receives a score m-i from v, and the candidate receiving the most score from all votes wins the election. Here, we consider the control problems of a Borda election, where the chair of the election attempts to influence the election outcome by adding or deleting either votes or candidates with the intention to make a special candidate win (constructive control) or lose (destructive control) the election. Control problems have been extensively studied for Borda elections from both classical and parameterized complexity viewpoints. We complete the parameterized complexity picture for Borda control problems by showing W[2]-hardness with the number of additions/deletions as parameter for constructive control by deleting votes, adding candidates, or deleting candidates. The hardness result for deleting votes settles an open problem posed by Liu and Zhu. Following the suggestion by Menon and Larson, we also investigate the impact of introducing top-truncated votes, where each voter ranks only t out of the given m candidates, on the classical and parameterized complexity of Borda control problems. Constructive Borda control problems remain NP-hard even with t being a small constant. Moreover, we prove that in the top-truncated case, constructive control by adding/deleting votes problems are FPT with the number \ell of additions/deletions and t as parameters, while for every constant t\geq 2, constructive control by adding/deleting candidates problems are W[2]-hard with respect to \ell.</description>

      <title>Committee Elections with Candidate Attribute Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many real-world applications of committee elections, the candidates are associated with certain attributes and the chosen committee is required to satisfy some constraints posed on the candidate attributes. For instance, when dress collocation, it is generally acknowledged that when wearing a tie, you'd better wear a shirt, and wearing a suit, you'd better wear leather shoes. Here, dresses are categorized by upper garment, lower garment, shoes et.al, and upper garment is with the attribute tie and shirt, lower garment is with the attribute suit, and shoes is with the attribute leather. And two constraints "tie infers shirt" and "suit infers leather shoes" are proposed. We study this variant of committee elections from the computational complexity viewpoint. Given a set of candidates, each with some attributes and a profit, and a set of constraints, given as propositional logical expressions of the attributes, the task is to compute a set of k candidates, whose attributes satisfy all constraints and whose total profit achieves a given bound. We achieve a dichotomy concerning classical complexity with no length limit on constraints: the problem is polynomial-time solvable, if the following two conditions are fulfilled: 1) each candidate has only one attribute and 2) each attribute occurs at most once in the constraints. It becomes NP-hard if one of the two conditions is violated. Moreover, we examine its parameterized complexity. The parameterization with the number of constraints, the size of the committee, or the total profit bound as parameter leads to para-NP-hardness or W[1]-hardness, while with the number of attributes or the number of candidates as parameter, the problem turns out to be fixed-parameter tractable.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-Time Computation of Exact $\Phi$-Equilibria in Polyhedral Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a well-known fact that correlated equilibria can be computed in polynomial time in a large class of concisely represented games using the celebrated Ellipsoid Against Hope algorithm (Papadimitriou and Roughgarden, 2008; Jiang and Leyton-Brown, 2015). However, the landscape of efficiently computable equilibria in sequential (extensive-form) games remains unknown. The Ellipsoid Against Hope does not apply directly to these games, because they do not have the required "polynomial type" property. Despite this barrier, Huang and von Stengel (2008) altered the algorithm to compute exact extensive-form correlated equilibria.
  In this paper, we generalize the Ellipsoid Against Hope and develop a simple algorithmic framework for efficiently computing saddle-points in bilinear zero-sum games, even when one of the dimensions is exponentially large. Moreover, the framework only requires a "good-enough-response" oracle, which is a weakened notion of a best-response oracle.
  Using this machinery, we develop a general algorithmic framework for computing exact linear $\Phi$-equilibria in any polyhedral game (under mild assumptions), including correlated equilibria in normal-form games, and extensive-form correlated equilibria in extensive-form games. This enables us to give the first polynomial-time algorithm for computing exact linear-deviation correlated equilibria in extensive-form games, thus resolving an open question by Farina and Pipis (2023). Furthermore, even for the cases for which a polynomial time algorithm for exact equilibria was already known, our framework provides a conceptually simpler solution.</description>

      <title>Scalable Mechanism Design for Multi-Agent Path Finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) involves determining paths for multiple agents to travel simultaneously and collision-free through a shared area toward given goal locations. This problem is computationally complex, especially when dealing with large numbers of agents, as is common in realistic applications like autonomous vehicle coordination. Finding an optimal solution is often computationally infeasible, making the use of approximate, suboptimal algorithms essential. Adding to the complexity, agents might act in a self-interested and strategic way, possibly misrepresenting their goals to the MAPF algorithm if it benefits them. Although the field of mechanism design offers tools to align incentives, using these tools without careful consideration can fail when only having access to approximately optimal outcomes. In this work, we introduce the problem of scalable mechanism design for MAPF and propose three strategyproof mechanisms, two of which even use approximate MAPF algorithms. We test our mechanisms on realistic MAPF domains with problem sizes ranging from dozens to hundreds of agents. We find that they improve welfare beyond a simple baseline.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Prosumer Policies in Periodic Double Auctions Inspired by Equilibrium Analysis (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a periodic double auction (PDA) wherein the main participants are wholesale suppliers and brokers representing retailers. The suppliers are represented by a composite supply curve and the brokers are represented by individual bids. Additionally, the brokers can participate in small-scale selling by placing individual asks; hence, they act as prosumers. Specifically, in a PDA, the prosumers who are net buyers have multiple opportunities to buy or sell multiple units of a commodity with the aim of minimizing the cost of buying across multiple rounds of the PDA. Formulating optimal bidding strategies for such a PDA setting involves planning across current and future rounds while considering the bidding strategies of other agents. In this work, we propose Markov perfect Nash equilibrium (MPNE) policies for a setup where multiple prosumers with knowledge of the composite supply curve compete to procure commodities. Thereafter, the MPNE policies are used to develop an algorithm called MPNE-BBS for the case wherein the prosumers need to re-construct an approximate composite supply curve using past auction information. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on the PowerTAC wholesale market simulator against several baselines and state-of-the-art bidding policies.</description>
