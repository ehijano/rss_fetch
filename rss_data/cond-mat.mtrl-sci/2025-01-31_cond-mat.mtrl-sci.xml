      <title>Soliquidy: a descriptor for atomic geometrical confusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tailoring material properties often requires understanding the solidification process. Herein, we introduce the geometric descriptor Soliquidy, which numerically captures the Euclidean transport cost between the translationally disordered versus ordered states of a materials. As a testbed, we apply Soliquidy to the classification of glass-forming metal alloys. By extending and combining an experimental library of metallic thin-films (glass/no-glass) with the aflow.org computational database (geometrical and energetic information of mixtures) we found that the combination of Soliquity and formation enthalpies generates an effective classifier for glass formation. Such classifier is then used to tackle a public dataset of metallic glasses showing that the glass-agnostic assumptions of Soliquity can be useful for understanding kinetically-controlled phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Learning Metal Microstructural Heterogeneity through Spatial Mapping of Diffraction Latent Space Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To leverage advancements in machine learning for metallic materials design and property prediction, it is crucial to develop a data-reduced representation of metal microstructures that surpasses the limitations of current physics-based discrete microstructure descriptors. This need is particularly relevant for metallic materials processed through additive manufacturing, which exhibit complex hierarchical microstructures that cannot be adequately described using the conventional metrics typically applied to wrought materials. Furthermore, capturing the spatial heterogeneity of microstructures at the different scales is necessary within such framework to accurately predict their properties. To address these challenges, we propose the physical spatial mapping of metal diffraction latent space features. This approach integrates (i) point diffraction data encoding via variational autoencoders or contrastive learning and (ii) the physical mapping of the encoded values. Together these steps offer a method offers a novel means to comprehensively describe metal microstructures. We demonstrate this approach on a wrought and additively manufactured alloy, showing that it effectively encodes microstructural information and enables direct identification of microstructural heterogeneity not directly possible by physics-based models. This data-reduced microstructure representation opens the application of machine learning models in accelerating metallic material design and accurately predicting their properties.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Resolved Core Exciton Dynamics in LiF Using Attosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to control absorption by modifying the polarization of light presents an exciting opportunity to experimentally determine the orbital alignment of absorption features. Here, attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the polarization dependence of core exciton dynamics in LiF thin films at the Li+ K edge. XUV pulses excite electrons from the Li 1s core level into the conduction band, allowing for the formation of a p-orbital-like core exciton, aligned along the XUV light polarization axis. A sub-5 fs near-infrared (NIR) probe pulse then arrives at variable time delays, perturbing the XUV-excited states and allowing the coherence decay of the core exciton to be mapped. The coherence lifetimes are found to be ~2.4 +- 0.4 fs, which is attributed to a phonon-mediated dephasing mechanism as in previous core exciton studies. The differential absorption features are also shown to be sensitive to the relative polarization of the XUV and NIR fields. The parallel NIR probe induces couplings between the initial XUV-excited p-like bright exciton and s-like dark excitons. When crossed pump and probe polarizations are used, the coupling between the bright and dark states is no longer dipole-allowed, and the transient absorption signal associated with the coupling is suppressed by approximately 90%. This interpretation is supported by simulations of a few-level model system, as well as analysis of the calculated band structure. The results indicate that laser polarization can serve as a powerful experimental tool for exploring the orbital alignment of core excitonic states in solid-state materials.</description>

      <title>A tomographic interpretation of structure-property relations for materials discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) for materials have demonstrated that "simple" materials representations (e.g., the chemical formula alone without structural information) can sometimes achieve competitive property prediction performance in common-tasks. Our physics-based intuition would suggest that such representations are "incomplete", which indicates a gap in our understanding. This work proposes a tomographic interpretation of structure-property relations of materials to bridge that gap by defining what is a material representation, material properties, the material and the relationships between these three concepts using ideas from information theory. We verify this framework performing an exhaustive comparison of property-augmented representations on a range of material's property prediction objectives, providing insight into how different properties can encode complementary information.</description>

      <title>Charge state tuning of spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are among the most extensively studied optically active spin defects in van der Waals crystals, due to their promising potential to develop two-dimensional (2D) quantum sensors. In this letter, we demonstrate the tunability of the charge state of boron vacancies in ultrathin hBN layers, revealing a transition from the optically active singly negatively charged state to the optically inactive doubly negatively charged state when sandwiched between graphene electrodes. Notably, there is a photoluminescence quenching of a few percent upon the application of a bias voltage between the electrodes. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of considering the charge state of optically active defects in 2D materials, while also showing that the negatively charged boron vacancy remains robust against external perpendicular electric fields. This stability makes it a promising candidate for integration into various van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Exciton-polariton condensate in the van der Waals magnet CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals magnets are an emergent material class of paramount interest for fundamental studies in coupling light with matter excitations, which are uniquely linked to their underlying magnetic properties. Among these materials, the magnetic semiconductor CrSBr is possibly a first playground where we can study simultaneously the interaction of photons, magnons, and excitons at the quantum level. Here we demonstrate a coherent macroscopic quantum phase, the bosonic condensation of exciton-polaritons, which emerges in a CrSBr flake embedded in a fully tunable cryogenic open optical cavity. The Bose condensate is characterized by a highly non-linear threshold-like behavior, and coherence manifests distinctly via its first and second order quantum coherence. We find that the condensate's non-linearity is highly susceptible to the magnetic order in CrSBr, and encounters a sign change depending on the antiferro- and ferromagnetic ordering. Our findings open a route towards magnetically controllable quantum fluids of light, and optomagnonic devices where spin magnetism is coupled to on-chip Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Refining interface stress measurement in nanomultilayers through layer corrugation and interface roughness corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new models that incorporate layer corrugation and interface roughness into standard approaches for measuring interface stress in nanomultilayers (NMLs). Applied to Cu/W NMLs, these models show that ignoring such features can inflate measured interface stress by up to 0.4 J/m^2. However, corrugation and roughness alone cannot account for the extreme stresses reported, suggesting that atomic-scale phenomena (e.g., intermixing and metastable phase formation at the interfaces) dominate. These findings highlight the importance of balancing bilayer counts and thickness-to-roughness ratios for reliable stress quantification, providing a practical pathway to designing and characterizing advanced nanocomposite coatings with improved accuracy.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the crystallization kinetics of Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ nanoconfined in superlattice geometries for phase change memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase change materials are the most promising candidates for the realization of artificial synapsis for neuromorphic computing. Different resistance levels corresponding to analogic values of the synapsis conductance can be achieved by modulating the size of an amorphous region embedded in its crystalline matrix. Recently, it has been proposed that a superlattice made of alternating layers of the phase change compound Sb$_2$Te$_3$ and of the TiTe$_2$ confining material allows for a better control of multiple intermediate resistance states and for a lower drift with time of the electrical resistance of the amorphous phase. In this work, we consider to substitute Sb$_2$Te$_3$ with the Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ prototypical phase change compound that should feature better data retention. By exploiting molecular dynamics simulations with a machine learning interatomic potential, we have investigated the crystallization kinetics of Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ nanoconfined in geometries mimicking Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$/TiTe$_2$ superlattices. It turns out that nanoconfinement induces a slight reduction in the crystal growth velocities with respect to the bulk, but also an enhancement of the nucleation rate due to heterogeneous nucleation. The results support the idea of investigating Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$/TiTe$_2$ superlattices for applications in neuromorphic devices with improved data retention. The effect on the crystallization kinetics of the addition of van der Waals interaction to the interatomic potential is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Implications of the multi-minima character of molecular crystal phases onto the free energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, significant advancements in computational methods have dramatically enhanced the precision in determining the energetic ranking of different phases of molecular crystals. The developments mainly focused on providing accurate dispersion corrected exchange correlation functionals and methods for describing the vibrational entropy contributions to the free energy at finite temperatures. Several molecular crystals phases were recently found to have of multi-minima character. For our investigations we highlight the multi-minima character in the example of the molecular crystal consisting of N-(4-Methylbenzylidene)-4-methylalanine. We explore its potential energy landscape on the full DFT level or with a machine learned potential that was fitted to DFT data. We calculate not only many local minima but also exact barriers along transformation pathways to demonstrate the multi-minima character of our system. Furthermore, we present a framework, based on the quantum superposition method, that includes both configurational and vibrational entropy. As an example, we show for our system that the transition temperature between two of its phases is afflicted by an error of about 200 K if the multi-minima character is not taken into account. This indicates that it is absolutely essential to consider configurational entropy to obtain reliable finite temperature free energy rankings for complex molecular crystals.</description>

      <title>Elastic constants of single-crystalline NiTi studied by resonant ultrasound spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contactless, laser-based resonant ultrasound spectroscopy was utilized to monitor changes in elastic properties in single-crystalline NiTi shape memory alloy. It was observed that the elastic behavior of the temperature-induced B19$^\prime$ martensite adopts the symmetry elements of the parent austenite phase, and thus, the changes over the transformation temperature can be represented by the temperature evolution of three cubic elastic coefficients. The experiments confirm that the transition during the cooling run is preceded by pronounced softening of the $c_{44}$ elastic coefficient, which leads to nearly complete vanishing of elastic anisotropy prior to the transition. Below the transition, this coefficient remains soft, and the character of anisotropy switches from $c_{44}/c^\prime&gt;1$ to $c_{44}/c^\prime&lt;1$. We rationalize this behavior from the mechanical instability of the B19$^\prime$ lattice with respect to shears along the (001)$_{B19^\prime}$ plane, which is known from first-principles calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) with in situ diagnostics offers a transformative approach to accelerate, understand, and control thin film synthesis by uncovering relationships between synthesis conditions and material properties. In this study, we demonstrate the application of deep learning to predict the stoichiometry of Sr$_x$Ti$_{1-x}$O3 thin films using reflection high-energy electron diffraction images acquired during pulsed laser deposition. A gated convolutional neural network trained for regression of the Sr atomic fraction achieved accurate predictions with a small dataset of 31 samples. Explainable AI techniques revealed a previously unknown correlation between diffraction streak features and cation stoichiometry in Sr$_x$Ti$_{1-x}$O3 thin films. Our results demonstrate how ML can be used to transform a ubiquitous in situ diagnostic tool, that is usually limited to qualitative assessments, into a quantitative surrogate measurement of continuously valued thin film properties. Such methods are critically needed to enable real-time control, autonomous workflows, and accelerate traditional synthesis approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of a particle with vacuum fluctuations -- which theoretically exist even in the complete absence of matter -- can lead to observable irreversible decoherence, if it were possible to switch on and off the particle charge suddenly. We compute the leading order decoherence effect for such a scenario and propose an experimental setup for its detection. Such a measurement might provide further insights into the nature of vacuum fluctuations and a novel precision test for the decoherence theory.</description>

      <title>Tensor Completion for Surrogate Modeling of Material Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When designing materials to optimize certain properties, there are often many possible configurations of designs that need to be explored. For example, the materials' composition of elements will affect properties such as strength or conductivity, which are necessary to know when developing new materials. Exploring all combinations of elements to find optimal materials becomes very time consuming, especially when there are more design variables. For this reason, there is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to predict a material's properties. In this work, we model the optimization of certain material properties as a tensor completion problem, to leverage the structure of our datasets and navigate the vast number of combinations of material configurations. Across a variety of material property prediction tasks, our experiments show tensor completion methods achieving 10-20% decreased error compared with baseline ML models such as GradientBoosting and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), while maintaining similar training speed.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Modeling of Microstructure Complexity Using Digital Libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microstructure evolution in matter is often modeled numerically using field or level-set solvers, mirroring the dual representation of spatiotemporal complexity in terms of pixel or voxel data, and geometrical forms in vector graphics. Motivated by this analog, as well as the structural and event-driven nature of artificial and spiking neural networks, respectively, we evaluate their performance in learning and predicting fatigue crack growth and Turing pattern development. Predictions are made based on digital libraries constructed from computer simulations, which can be replaced by experimental data to lift the mathematical overconstraints of physics. Our assessment suggests that the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model offers superior predictive accuracy with fewer parameters and less memory usage, alleviating the accuracy-cost tradeoff in contrast to the common practices in computer vision tasks. Examination of network architectures shows that these benefits arise from its reduced weight range and sparser connections. The study highlights the capability of event-driven models in tackling problems with evolutionary bulk-phase and interface behaviors using the digital library approach.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Topological Hinge States in the Higher-Order Topological Insulator WTe$_2$ Based on the Fractional Josephson Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) represent a novel class of topological materials, characterised by the emergence of topological boundary modes at dimensions two or more lower than those of bulk materials. Recent experimental studies have identified conducting channels at the hinges of HOTIs, although their topological nature remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated Shapiro steps in Al-WTe$_2$-Al proximity Josephson junctions (JJs) under microwave irradiation and examined the topological properties of the hinge states in WTe$_2$. Specifically, we analysed the microwave frequency dependence of the absence of the first Shapiro step in hinge-dominated JJs, attributing this phenomenon to the 4$\pi$-periodic current-phase relationship characteristic of topological JJs. These findings may encourage further research into topological superconductivity with topological hinge states in superconducting hybrid devices based on HOTIs. Such advances could lead to the realisation of Majorana zero modes for topological quantum physics and pave the way for applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Pathways to Bubble and Skyrmion Lattice Formation in Fe/Gd Multilayers</title>

Abstract: The creation and control of magnetic spin textures is of great interest in fundamental research and future device-oriented applications. Fe/Gd multilayers host a rich variety of magnetic textures including topologically trivial bubbles and topologically protected skyrmions. Using time-resolved Kerr spectroscopy, we highlight how various control strategies, including temperature, out-of-plane magnetic fields and femtosecond light excitation, can be used to create such textures via different pathways. We find that varying the magnetic field for constant temperature leads to a different ($H, T$)-phase diagram of magnetic textures than moving along a temperature trajectory for constant magnetic field. Micromagnetic simulations corroborate this finding and allow to visualize the different paths taken. Furthermore, we show that the creation of bubbles and skyrmions in this material via impulsive light excitation is not solely governed by temperature-driven processes, since bubbles and skyrmions can be stabilized in parts of the ($H, T$)-phase diagram, where neither the constant temperature nor the constant magnetic field trajectory predict their existence. Using this phase diagram, we reason why bubble and skyrmion creation in this particular system is only possible from the stripe domain state. Our observations provide a versatile toolkit for tailoring the creation of magnetic spin textures in Fe/Gd multilayers.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Enumeration of Three-Dimensional Photonic Crystals Enabled through Deep Learning Assisted Fourier Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) photonic structures enable numerous applications through their unique ability to guide, trap, and manipulate light. Constructing new functional photonic crystals remains a significant challenge since traditional design principles based on band structure calculations require numerous time-consuming computations. Additionally, traditional design is based on enumerated structures making it difficult to find novel functional geometries. Here, we propose an ultra-fast photonic crystal performance prediction method to enable efficient structure optimization of arbitrary 3D photonic crystals even with multiple variable modulation. Our methodology combines Fourier synthesis-enabling the creation of any smooth geometry within a crystallographic space group-with deep learning, which facilitates efficient photonic characterization within the vast parameter space. Over 2 million structures can be explored within 2 hours using a mainstream desktop workstation. The ideal structures with desired band properties, such as large photonic bandgap, specific frequency ranges, etc., could be rapidly discovered. We systematically confirmed the well-documented assumption that the most significant photonic bandgaps are found in minimal surface morphologies, in which the single diamond (dia net) with Fd3m (227) symmetry reigns supreme among known photonic structures, followed by the chiral single gyroid (srs net) with I4132 (214) symmetry. Additionally, a less well-known 3D photonic crystal with lcs topology within Ia3d (230) was rediscovered to exhibit a wide complete photonic bandgap, comparable to the diamond and the gyroid net. Our method not only validates the assumed hierarchy of photonic structures but also lays the foundation for the tailored design of functional materials and offers fresh insights into the advancement of next-generation optical devices and information technology.</description>

      <title>Effect of photoinduced screening on the spectroscopic signature of exciton-phonon coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The light-mediated interaction of fermionic and bosonic excitations governs the optoelectronic properties of condensed matter systems. In photoexcited semiconductors, the coupling of electron-hole pairs (excitons) to coherent optical phonons enables a modulation of the excitonic resonance that is phase-locked to the frequency of the coupled vibrational mode. Moreover, due to the Coulombic nature of excitons, their dynamics are sensitive to transient changes in the screening by the photoexcited carriers. Interestingly, the effect of photoinduced screening on the transient optical signal originating from the exciton dynamics coupled to phonons is not yet established. By means of broadband transient reflectance spectroscopy, we disclose how exciton-phonon coupling manifests in either presence or absence of dynamical screening in a layered semiconductor. Further, we unveil the promoting role of photoinduced screening on these exciton-phonon coupled dynamics as opposed to the case in which the unscreened exciton-exciton repulsion likely dominates the nonequilibrium optical response. These findings set a protocol to look at an excitonic resonance and its fundamental many-body interactions on the ultrafast timescale, and provide new perspectives on the access to nonequilibrium coupled dynamics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic geometry to quantum geometry nonlinear transports</title>

Abstract: Nonlinear transports (NLTs) have garnered broad attention based on their topological origin in quantum geometry. When quantum geometry meets magnetic geometry in magnets, their crossover excites diverse phenomena particularly related to antiferromagnetic spintronics. However, very few material platforms have been predicted and experimentally verified to date, where the material pool was subconsciously narrowed down due to the demand for spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Therefore, to boost antiferromagnetic spintronics, we consider the magnetic order induced quantum geometry and corresponding NLTs in antiferromagnets (AFMs). By integrating the state-of-the-art spin space group theory into the symmetry analysis, we find that collinear and coplanar magnetic geometry can only induce NLT driven by Berry curvature dipole, and noncoplanar one may trigger NLT driven by dipoles of Berry curvature, inverse mass, and quantum metric. Remarkably, a materials database of 260 AFMs with SOC-free NLT effects is established. Several prototypical material candidates are presented by first-principles calculations, including collinear AFM VNb$_3$S$_6$ with NLT driven by Berry curvature dipole, and a room-temperature noncoplanar AFM CrSe with NLTs driven by quantum metric dipole. Our work not only provides a universal theoretical framework for studying various magnetism-driven transport effects, but also predicts broad, experimentally accessible material platforms for antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Through-Thickness Modelling of Metal Rolling using Multiple-Scale Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new semi-analytic model of the metal rolling process is introduced, which, for the first time, is able to predict the through-thickness stress and strain oscillations present in long thin roll-gaps. The model is based on multiple-scales asymptotics, assuming a long thin roll-gap and a comparably small Coulomb friction coefficient. The leading-order solution varies only on a long lengthscale corresponding to the roll-gap length and matches with slab models. The next-order correction varies on both this long lengthscale and a short lengthscale associated with the workpiece thickness, and reveals rapid stress and strain oscillation both in the rolling direction and through the thickness. For this initial derivation, the model assumes a rigid perfectly-plastic material behaviour. Despite these strong assumptions, this model compares well with finite element simulations that employ more realistic material behaviour (including elasticity and strain hardening). These assumptions facilitate the simplest possible model to provide a foundational understanding of the complex through-thickness behaviour observed in the finite element simulations, while requiring an order of only seconds to compute. This model can form the foundation of further improved models with more complicated mechanics in the future. Matlab code for evaluating the model is provided in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Constructing multicomponent cluster expansions with machine-learning and chemical embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cluster expansions are commonly employed as surrogate models to link the electronic structure of an alloy to its finite-temperature properties. Using cluster expansions to model materials with several alloying elements is challenging due to a rapid increase in the number of fitting parameters and training set size. We introduce the embedded cluster expansion (eCE) formalism that enables the parameterization of accurate on-lattice surrogate models for alloys containing several chemical species. The eCE model simultaneously learns a low dimensional embedding of site basis functions along with the weights of an energy model. A prototypical senary alloy comprised of elements in groups 5 and 6 of the periodic table is used to demonstrate that eCE models can accurately reproduce ordering energetics of complex alloys without a significant increase in model complexity. Further, eCE models can leverage similarities between chemical elements to efficiently extrapolate into compositional spaces that are not explicitly included in the training dataset. The eCE formalism presented in this study unlocks the possibility of employing cluster expansion models to study multicomponent alloys containing several alloying elements.</description>

      <title>A Boltzmann statistical approach for the analysis of polarization states in mixed phase ferroelectric materials: application to morphological phase boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferroelectrics are widely used for a broad array of technological applications due to their attractive electrical and electromechanical properties. In order to obtain large functional properties, material compositions are often designed to favor a coexistence of multiple ferroelectric phases. For such compositions, the macroscopically observed properties are variously attributed to easier domain switching and/or phase transition. Nevertheless, modelling of concurrent domain switching and phase transition in mixed phase ferroelectrics remains a challenging task. Here, a methodology is presented to quantitatively evaluate the volume fractions of different domain variants in a mixed phase ferroelectric under complex electromechanical loading. The methodology combines the phenomenology of Landau free energy of ferroelectric phases with Boltzmann statistical analysis, and is presented for Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 near morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). It is shown that specific grain orientation has a significant effect on how proximity to phase boundary affects microscopic phenomena at the single-crystal level. An estimate of phase and domain switching behavior in a polycrystalline aggregate is subsequently obtained, and the resultant polarization and strain responses at the macroscopic level are computed for a material with random texture. The results indicate the progressive evolution of domain and phase fractions in a material near MPB with mixed ferroelectric phases. We show that in polycrystalline materials with compositions slightly on the tetragonal side of MPB, grains that exhibit large 90 domain switching have a larger contribution to the macroscopic strain response as compared to grains that undergo tetragonal-to-rhombohedral phase-switching.</description>

      <title>Mode-coupling formulation of heat transport in anharmonic materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The temperature-dependent phonons are a generalization of interatomic force constants varying in T, which as found widespread use in computing the thermal transport of materials. A formal justification for using this combination to access thermal conductivity in anharmonic crystals, beyond the harmonic approximation and perturbation theory, is still lacking. In this work, we derive a theory of heat transport of anharmonic crystals, using the mode-coupling theory of anharmonic lattice dynamics. Starting from the Green-Kubo formula, we develop the thermal conductivity tensor based on the system's dynamical susceptibility, or spectral function. Our results account for both the diagonal and off-diagonal contributions of the heat current, with and without collective effects. We implement our theory in the TDEP package, and have notably introduced a Monte Carlo scheme to compute phonon scattering due to third- and fourth-order interactions, achieving a substantial reduction in computational cost which enables full convergence of such calculations for the first time. We apply our methodology to systems with varying regimes of anharmonicity and thermal conductivity to demonstrate its universality. These applications highlight the importance of the phonon renormalizations and their interactions beyond the harmonic order. Overall, our work advances the understanding of thermal conductivity in anharmonic crystals and provides a theoretically robust framework for predicting heat transport in complex materials.</description>

Abstract: Ion Beam Analysis (IBA) is an established tool for material characterization, providing precise information on elemental composition, depth profiles, and structural information in the region near the surface of materials. However, traditional data processing methods can be slow and computationally intensive, limiting the efficiency and speed of the analysis. This article explores the current landscape of applying Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA) in the field of IBA, demonstrating the immense potential to optimize and accelerate processes. We present how ML has been employed to extract valuable insights from large datasets, automate repetitive tasks, and enhance the interpretability of results, with practical examples of applications in various IBA techniques, such as RBS, PIXE, and others. Finally, perspectives on using MLA to approach open problems in IBA are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Exploring the defect landscape and dopability of chalcogenide perovskite BaZrS3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BaZrS3 is a chalcogenide perovskite that has shown great promise as a photovoltaic absorber over the last few years. Despite its impressive electronic and optical properties, native point defects and impurities could impose significant limitations on the photovoltaic performance of BaZrS3. Such defects may form spontaneously, create deep levels that act as traps for carriers, and influence the device performance by changing the concentrations of electrons and holes. On the other hand, functional dopants that dominate over native defects can help tune the nature of conductivity in BaZrS3. In this work, we applied first principles computations to comprehensively investigate the defect landscape of BaZrS3, including all intrinsic defects and select impurities and dopants. BaZrS3 intrinsically exhibits n-type equilibrium conductivity under Zr-rich and Zr-poor conditions, as determined by low energy vacancy and interstitial defects. O and H impurities create relatively low energy neutral and donor-type defects. La and Nb are calculated to be stable donor-type defects, which will make BaZrS3 even more n-type, whereas As and O form amphoteric defects, which generally show higher formation energies than native defects. This work highlights the difficulty of tuning the electrical properties of BaZrS3 via doping, especially making it more p-type. However, it points to some possible avenues to inform our future work.</description>

      <title>Connectivity-Dependent Attenuation Factor in Nanographene-Based Molecular Wires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.09936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing molecular nanowires with high electrical conductance that facilitate efficient charge transport over long distances is highly desirable for future molecular-scale circuitry. However, most molecular wires act as tunnel barriers, and their electrical conductance decays exponentially with increasing length. Only recently have a few studies shown increasing conductance with length. In this study, we identify a new class of molecular wires that exhibit both an increase and a decrease in room-temperature conductance with length (a dual attenuation factor), depending on their connection points to the electrodes. We show that this dual attenuation factor is an inherent property of these graphene-like nanowires, and its demonstration depends on the constructive quantum interference pattern for different connectivities to the electrodes. This is significant because a given nanographene molecular wire can show both negative and positive attenuation factors. This enables the systematic design of connectivity-dependent high/low-conductance molecular wires for future molecular-scale circuitry.</description>

Abstract: Two common difficulties in the design of topological quantum materials are that the desired features lie too far from the Fermi level and are spread over a too-large energy range. Doping-induced states at the Fermi level provide a solution, where nontrivial topological properties are enforced by the doping-reduced symmetry. To show this, we consider a regular placement of dopants in a lattice of space group (SG) 176 ($P6\text{}_3/m$), which reduces the symmetry to SG 143 ($P3$). Our two- and four-band models feature double Weyl points, Chern bands, Van Hove singularities, nontrivial multiband quantum geometry due to mixed orbital character, and singular flat bands. We relate these features to density-functional theory (DFT) calculations for dopant and vacancy bands of lead apatite Pb$_{10}($PO$_4)_6$O and Pb$_{10}($PO$_4)_6($OH$)_2$, the van der Waals ferromagnet Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, the semiconductor SiC, and the 2D dichalcogenide MoS$_2$.</description>

Abstract: Correlated topological materials often maintain a delicate balance among physical symmetries: many topological orders are symmetry protected, while most correlated phenomena arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is rare to find cases where symmetry breaking induces a non-trivial topological phase. Here, we present the discovery of such a phase in Ta2Pd3Te5, where Coulomb interactions form excitons, which condense below 100 K, opening a topological gap and creating a topological excitonic insulator. Our spectroscopy reveals the full spectral bulk gap stemming from exciton condensation. This excitonic insulator state spontaneously breaks mirror symmetries but involves a very weak structural coupling, as indicated by photoemission spectroscopy, thermodynamic measurements, and a detailed structural analysis. Notably, scanning tunneling microscopy uncovers gapless boundary modes in the bulk insulating phase. Their magnetic field response, together with theoretical modeling, suggests a topological origin. These observations establish Ta2Pd3Te5 as the first confirmed topological excitonic insulator in a three-dimensional crystal. This allows to access the associated physics through bulk-sensitive techniques. Furthermore, we uncover another surprising aspect of the topological excitonic insulator, a secondary excitonic instability near 5 K that breaks the translational symmetry. The wavevector of this state shows an unprecedented magnetic field tunability. Thus, we unveil a unique sequence of topological exciton condensations in a bulk crystal, offering new opportunities to study critical behavior and excitations.</description>

      <title>Quantum correction to the orbital Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluations of the orbital Hall effect (OHE) have only retained inter-band matrix elements of the position operator. Here we evaluate the OHE including all matrix elements of the position operator, including the technically challenging intra-band elements. We recover previous results and find quantum corrections due to the non-commutativity of the position and velocity operators and inter-band matrix elements of the orbital angular momentum. The quantum corrections dominate the OHE responses of the topological antiferromagnet CuMnAs and of massive Dirac fermions.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of molten salts: insights from molecular dynamics simulations and fundamental bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use extensive molecular dynamics simulations to calculate thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity in two common molten salts, LiF and KCl. Our analysis includes the total thermal conductivity and intrinsic conductivity involving mass currents measured experimentally. The latter shows good agreement with the experimental data. We also calculate their key thermodynamic properties such as constant-pressure and constant-volume specific heats. We subsequently compare the results to the lower bound for thermal diffusivity expressed in terms of fundamental physical constants. Using this comparison and recent theoretical insights into thermodynamic and transport properties in liquids, we interpret thermal properties on the basis of atomistic dynamics and phonon excitations. We finally find that thermal diffusivity of molten salts is close to their kinematic viscosity.</description>

      <title>An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Physics-based battery model parametrisation from impedance data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-invasive parametrisation of physics-based battery models can be performed by fitting the model to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data containing features related to the different physical processes. However, this requires an impedance model to be derived, which may be complex to obtain analytically. We have developed the open-source software PyBaMM-EIS that provides a fast method to compute the impedance of any PyBaMM model at any operating point using automatic differentiation. Using PyBaMM-EIS, we investigate the impedance of the single particle model, single particle model with electrolyte (SPMe), and Doyle-Fuller-Newman model, and identify the SPMe as a parsimonious option that shows the typical features of measured lithium-ion cell impedance data. We provide a grouped parameter SPMe and analyse the features in the impedance related to each parameter. Using the open-source software PyBOP, we estimate 18 grouped parameters both from simulated impedance data and from measured impedance data from a LG M50LT lithium-ion battery. The parameters that directly affect the response of the SPMe can be accurately determined and assigned to the correct electrode. Crucially, parameter fitting must be done simultaneously to data across a wide range of states-of-charge. Overall, this work presents a practical way to find the parameters of physics-based models.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Lattice Effect Originated Metal-Insulator Transition in FeSe$_x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the structural, electrical transport, and magnetic properties of FeSe$_{\it{x}}$ ($\it{x}$ = 1.14, 1.18, 1.23, 1.28, and 1.32) to unravel the mechanism of the metal-insulator transition observed in these systems. For this, we systematically evaluated the structural parameters of FeSe$_{\it{x}}$ as a function of Se concentration and temperature. We observe increased lattice constants and cell volume with increased Se concentration. On the other hand, the temperature-dependent XRD studies suggest unusual lattice change around the metal-insulator (MI) transition temperature of the respective compositions. This remarkable observation suggests that the anomalous lattice effect originates the MI transition in these systems. Additionally, our density of states (DOS) calculations on FeSe$_{1.14}$ qualitatively explain the MI transition, as the low-temperature (50 K) structure DOS suggests a metallic nature and the high-temperature (300 K) structure DOS shows a gap near the Fermi level.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional talc as a natural hyperbolic material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates that two-dimensional talc, a naturally abundant mineral, supports hyperbolic phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) at mid-infrared wavelengths, thus offering a low-cost alternative to synthetic polaritonic materials. Using scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) and synchrotron infrared nano spectroscopy (SINS), we reveal tunable HPhP modes in talc flakes of a long lifetime. These results highlight the potential of natural 2D talc crystals to constituting an effective platform for establishing scalable optoelectronic and photonic devices.</description>
