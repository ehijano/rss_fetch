      <title>Well-posedness of Keller-Segel systems on compact metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemotaxis phenomena govern the directed movement of micro-organisms in response to chemical stimuli. In this paper, we investigate two Keller--Segel systems of reaction-advection-diffusion equations modeling chemotaxis on thin networks. The distinction between two systems is driven by the rate of diffusion of the chemo-attractant. The intermediate rate of diffusion { is} modeled by a coupled pair of parabolic equations, while the rapid rate is described by a parabolic equation coupled with an elliptic one. Assuming the polynomial rate of growth of the chemotaxis sensitivity coefficient, we prove local well-posedness of both systems on compact metric graphs, and, in particular, prove existence of unique classical solutions. This is achieved by constructing sufficiently regular mild solutions via analytic semigroup methods and combinatorial description of the heat kernel on metric graphs. The regularity of mild solutions is shown by applying abstract semigroup results to semi-linear parabolic equations on compact graphs. In addition, for logistic type Keller--Segel systems we prove global well-posedness and, in some special cases, global uniform boundedness of solutions.</description>

      <title>On the eigenvalue problem for a bulk/surface elliptic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper addresses the doubly elliptic eigenvalue problem $$\begin{cases} -\Delta u=\lambda u \qquad &amp;\text{in $\Omega$,}\\ u=0 &amp;\text{on $\Gamma_0$,}\\ -\Delta_\Gamma u +\partial_\nu u =\lambda u\qquad &amp;\text{on $\Gamma_1$,} \end{cases} $$ where $\Omega$ is a bounded open subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ ($N\ge 2$) with $C^1$ boundary $\Gamma=\Gamma_0\cup\Gamma_1$, $\Gamma_0\cap\Gamma_1=\emptyset$, $\Gamma_1$ being nonempty and relatively open on $\Gamma$. Moreover $\mathcal{H}^{N-1}(\overline{\Gamma}_0\cap\overline{\Gamma}_1)=0$ and $\mathcal{H}^{N-1}(\Gamma_0)&gt;0$. We recognize that $L^2(\Omega)\times L^2(\Gamma_1)$ admits a Hilbert basis of eigenfunctions of the problem and we describe the eigenvalues. Moreover, when $\Gamma$ is at least $C^2$ and $\overline{\Gamma}_0\cap\overline{\Gamma}_1=\emptyset$, we give several qualitative properties of the eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity formulas and (S$_+$)-property: old and new</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between monotonicity formulas and the (S$_+$)-property is that, for some popular differential operators, the former is used to prove the latter. The purpose of this paper is to explore this connection, remark how in the past both the monotonicity formulas and the (S$_+$)-property were focused exclusively on power-law growth and prove the same type of results for a more general class of operators.</description>

      <title>Zaremba problem with degenerate weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish Zaremba problem for Laplacian and $p$-Laplacian with degenerate weights when the Dirichlet condition is only imposed in a set of positive weighted capacity. We prove weighted Sobolev-Poincar\'{e} inequality with sharp scaling-invariant constants involving weighted capacity. Then we show higher integrability of the gradient of the solution (Meyers estimate) with minimal conditions on the part of the boundary where the Dirichlet condition is assumed. Our results are new both for the linear $p=2$ and nonlinear case and include problems with the weight not only as a measure but also as a multiplier of the gradient of the solution.</description>

      <title>An existence and uniqueness result to evolution equations with sign-changing pseudo-differential operators and its applications to logarithmic Laplacian operators and second-order differential operators without ellipticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We broaden the domain of the Fourier transform to contain all distributions without using the Paley-Wiener theorem and devise a new weak formulation built upon this extension. This formulation is applicable to evolution equations involving pseudo-differential operators, even when the signs of their symbols may vary over time. Notably, our main operator includes the logarithmic Laplacian operator $\log (-\Delta)$ and a second-order differential operator whose leading coefficients are not positive semi-definite.</description>

      <title>Fractional Laplace operator on finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays a great attention has been focused on the discrete fractional Laplace operator as the natural counterpart of the continuous one. In this paper, we discretize the fractional Laplace operator $(-\Delta)^{s}$ for an arbitrary finite graph and any positive real number $s$. It is shown that $(-\Delta)^{s}$ can be explicitly represented by eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator $-\Delta$. Moreover, we study its important properties, such as $(-\Delta)^{s}$ converges to $-\Delta$ as $s$ tends to $1$; while $(-\Delta)^{s}$ converges to the identity map as $s$ tends to $0$ on a specific function space. For related problems involving the fractional Laplace operator, we consider the fractional Kazdan-Warner equation and obtain several existence results via variational principles and the method of upper and lower solutions.</description>

      <title>Variational properties of space-periodic standing waves of nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equations with general nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic waves are standing wave solutions of nonlinear Schr\''odinger equations whose profile is periodic in space dimension one. We consider general nonlinearities and provide variational characterizations for the periodic wave profiles. This involves minimizing energy while keeping mass and momentum constant, as well as minimizing the action over the Nehari manifold. These variational approaches are considered both in the periodic and anti-periodic settings, and for focusing and defocusing nonlinearities. In appendix, we study the existence properties of periodic solutions of the triple power nonlinearity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By dispersive models of fluid mechanics  we are referring to the Euler-Lagrange equations for the  constrained Hamilton action functional  where  the internal  energy depends on high order derivatives of unknowns. The mass conservation law is considered as a constraint.  The corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations  include, in particular,  the van der Waals--Korteweg model  of capillary fluids, the model of fluids containing small gas bubbles and  the model describing long free-surface gravity waves. We obtain new conservation laws  generalizing  the helicity conservation  for classical barotropic fluids.</description>

      <title>On the smallness of mean oscillations and regularity of weak solutions to regular/degenerate strongly coupled parabolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It will be established that the mean oscillation of bounded weak solutions to strongly coupled parabolic systems is small in small balls. If the systems are regular elliptic then their bounded weak solutions are H\"older continuous. Further assumptions on the systems will even prove that these solutions exist globally. Weak solutions to degenerate systems of porous media type are also studied.</description>

      <title>Energy solutions of the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem for fractional nonlinear diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is concerned with the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem for fractional (and non-fractional) nonlinear diffusion equations posed in bounded domains. Main results consist of well-posedness in an energy class with no sign restriction and convergence of such (possibly sign-changing) energy solutions to asymptotic profiles after a proper rescaling. They will be proved in a variational scheme only, without any use of semigroup theories nor classical quasilinear parabolic theories. Proofs are self-contained and performed in a totally unified fashion for both fractional and non-fractional cases as well as for both porous medium and fast diffusion cases.</description>

      <title>Minimizing movements for the generalized power mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a conjecture of De Giorgi, we consider the Almgren-Taylor-Wang scheme for mean curvature flow, where the volume penalization is replaced by a term of the form \[ \int_{E\Delta F} f\Big(\frac{ {\rm d}_F }{\tau}\Big)~dx \] for $f$ ranging in a large class of strictly increasing continuous functions. In particular, our analysis covers the case \[ f(r) = r^\alpha, \qquad r \geq 0, \quad \alpha&gt;0, \] considered by De Giorgi. We show that the generalized minimizing movement scheme converges to the geometric evolution equation \[ f(v) = - \kappa\quad \text{on $\partial E(t)$,} \] where $\{E(t)\}$ are evolving subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n,$ $v$ is the normal velocity of $\partial E(t),$ and $\kappa$ is the mean curvature of $\partial E(t)$. We extend our analysis to the anisotropic setting, and in the presence of a driving force. We also show that minimizing movements coincide with the smooth classical solution as long as the latter exists. Finally, we prove that in the absence of forcing, mean convexity and convexity are preserved by the weak flow.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Euclidean product structure: breakdown for low Sobolev exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general toolbox to study $W^{1,p}$ solutions of differential inclusions $\nabla u \in K$ for unbounded sets $K$. A key notion is the concept that a subset $K$ of the space $\mathbb{R}^{d \times m}$ of $d \times m$ matrices can be reduced to another set $K'$. We then use this framework to show that the product rigidity for Sobolev maps fails for $p&lt;2$, and also apply our toolbox to simplify several examples from the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study minimizers of the Landau-de Gennes energy in $\mathbb{R}^3\setminus B_1(0)$ with external magnetic field in the large particle limit. We impose strong tangential anchoring and uniaxiality of the $Q-$tensor on the boundary. We derive a lower bound for the energy in terms of the boundary condition and show in the extreme cases that the longitudinal director field is energy minimizing, indicating the presence of two half-point defects, so called boojums, at two opposite points of the sphere. Using a recovery sequence, we show that the energy bound is optimal.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Limits for Stochastic Interacting Particles on Digraph Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many natural phenomena are effectively described by interacting particle systems, which can be modeled using either deterministic or stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In this study, we specifically investigate particle systems modeled by SDEs, wherein the mean field limit converges to a Vlasov-Fokker-Planck-type equation. Departing from conventional approaches in stochastic analysis, we explore the network connectivity between particles using diagraph measures (DGMs). DGMs are one possible tool to capture sparse, intermediate and dense network/graph interactions in the mean-field thereby going beyond more classical approaches such as graphons. Since the main goal is to capture large classes of mean-field limits, we set up our approach using measure-theoretic arguments and combine them with suitable moment estimates to ensure approximation results for the mean-field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three main topics were raised in this discussion session, which took place on the 19th of June at the NumHyp-2015 meeting: nonlinear resonance for 1D systems of balance laws, dispersive extensions of standard hyperbolic conservation laws, and the validation of weakly dispersive shallow water wave models. An introductory overview with many bibliographic references is provided for all these topics. Based on kinetic formulation, a numerical strategy that can overcome resonance issues is presented, and a well-balanced (WB) technique for Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations is outlined. This WB scheme relies on the spectral representation of stationary solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an inversion theorem for the Fourier transform defined for normal functions, in the case when such functions are of moderate decrease, and in dimensions 2 and 3. This improves on Carleson's general almost everywhere convergence result for square integrable functions to everywhere convergence, in the special case of normal functions of moderate decrease. The class of normal functions appear in Physics and the everywhere convergence is important for further analysis of wave equations and no radiation properties of electromagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>An ordinary differential equation for entropic optimal transport and its linearly constrained variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the solution to the entropically regularized optimal transport problem by a well-posed ordinary differential equation (ODE). Our approach works for discrete marginals and general cost functions, and in addition to two marginal problems, applies to multi-marginal problems and those with additional linear constraints. Solving the ODE gives a new numerical method to solve the optimal transport problem, which has the advantage of yielding the solution for all intermediate values of the ODE parameter (which is equivalent to the usual regularization parameter). We illustrate this method with several numerical simulations. The formulation of the ODE also allows one to compute derivatives of the optimal cost when the ODE parameter is $0$, corresponding to the fully regularized limit problem in which only the entropy is minimized.</description>

      <title>Effect of random noises on pathwise solutions to the high-dimensional modified Euler-Poincar\'{e} system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.09603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem for the stochastically perturbed high-dimensional modified Euler-Poincar\'{e} system (MEP2) on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d$, $d\geq 1$. We first establish a local well-posedness framework in the sense of Hadamard for the MEP2 driven by general nonlinear multiplicative noises. Then two kinds of global existence and uniqueness results are demonstrated: One indicates that the MEP2 perturbed by nonlocal-type random noises with proper intensity admits a unique large global strong solution; The other one infers that, if the initial data is sufficiently small, then the MEP2 perturbed by linear multiplicative noise has a unique global solution with high probability. In the case of one dimension, we find that the stochastic MEP2 will break down in finite time when the initial data meets appropriate shape condition.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of the wave equation on larger-dimension tori with rough dampings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03733v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with uniform stabilization of the damped wave equation. When the manifold is compact and the damping is continuous, the geometric control condition is known to be necessary and sufficient. In the case where the damping is a sum of characteristic functions of polygons on a two-dimensional torus, a result by Burq-G\'erard states that stabilization occurs if and only if every geodesic intersects the interior of the damped region or razes damped polygons on both sides. We give a natural generalization of their result to a sufficient condition on tori of any dimension $d \geq 3$. In some particular cases, we show that this sufficient condition can be weakened.</description>

      <title>Global solutions for a 2D chemotaxis-fluid system with large measures as initial density and vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a chemotaxis-fluid system in the whole plane $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ which describes the motion of bacteria suspended in a Navier-Stokes fluid and attracted by a chemical (oxygen). Employing the vorticity formulation for the fluid equations, we obtain local and global solutions with large (Radon) measures as initial data for the bacterial density and vorticity. The gravitational/centrifugal potential is taken with finite $L^{2}$-gradient that can be large. The uniqueness property is also discussed. For the global result, we need to assume a smallness condition only on the $L^{\infty}$-norm of the initial oxygen concentration. In comparison with previous works, our results provide a new class for the initial density and vorticity, as well as for the potential, covering particularly singular measures such as Dirac delta, measure concentrated on smooth curves (filaments and rings), among others. For that, we approach the system via critical functional spaces, Kato-type norms, and suitable $L^{p}$-estimates uniformly in time.</description>

      <title>Analysis and numerical simulation of a generalized compressible Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes model with friction effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new generalized compressible diphasic Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard model that we name G-NSCH. This new G-NSCH model takes into account important properties of diphasic compressible fluids such as possible non-matching densities and contrast in mechanical properties (viscosity, friction) between the two phases of the fluid. the model also comprises a term to account for possible exchange of mass between the two phases. Our G-NSCH system is derived rigorously and satisfies basic mechanics of fluids and thermodynamics of particles. Under some simplifying assumptions, we prove the existence of global weak solutions. We also propose a structure preserving numerical scheme based on the scalar auxiliary variable method to simulate our system and present some numerical simulations validating the properties of the numerical scheme and illustrating the solutions of the G-NSCH model.</description>

      <title>Dimensional reduction for a system of 2D anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anyons with a statistical phase parameter $\alpha\in(0,2)$ are a kind of quasi-particles that, for topological reasons, only exist in a 1D or 2D world. We consider the dimensional reduction for a 2D system of anyons in a tight wave-guide. More specifically, we study the 2D magnetic-gauge picture model with an imposed anisotropic harmonic potential that traps particles much stronger in the $y$-direction than in the $x$-direction. We prove that both the eigenenergies and the eigenfunctions are asymptotically decoupled into the loose confining direction and the tight confining direction during this reduction. The limit 1D system for the $x$-direction is given by the impenetrable Tonks-Girardeau Bose gas, which has no dependency on $\alpha$, and no trace left of the long-range interactions of the 2D model.</description>

      <title>Extension of convex functions from a hyperplane to a half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that a possibly infinite-valued proper lower semicontinuous convex function on ${\mathbb R}^n$ has an extension to a convex function on the half-space ${\mathbb R}^n\times[0,\infty)$ which is finite and smooth on the open half-space ${\mathbb R}^n\times(0,\infty)$. The result is applied to nonlinear elasticity, where it clarifies how the condition of polyconvexity of the free-energy density $\psi(Dy)$ is best expressed when $\psi(A)\to\infty$ as $\det A\to 0+$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have established a coherent framework for applying variational methods to partial differential equations on hypergraphs, which includes the propositions of calculus and function spaces on hypergraphs. Several results related to the maximum principle on hypergraphs have also been proven. As applications, we demonstrated how these can be used to study partial differential equations on hypergraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use ideas from quantitative homogenization to show that nonconstant harmonic functions on the percolation cluster cannot satisfy certain structural constraints, for example, a Lipschitz bound. These unique-continuation-type results are false on the full lattice and hence the disorder is utilized in an essential way.</description>

      <title>Periodic finite-band solutions to the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation by the Fokas method: inverse and direct problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Riemann--Hilbert (RH) approach to the construction of periodic finite-band solutions to the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation. An RH problem for the solution of the finite-band problem has been recently derived via the Fokas method [1,2]. Building on this method, a finite-band solution to the NLS equation can be given in terms of the solution of an associated RH problem, the jump conditions for which are characterized by specifying the endpoints of the arcs defining the contour of the RH problem and the constants (so-called phases) involved in the jump matrices. In our work, we solve the problem of retrieving the phases given the solution of the NLS equation evaluated at a fixed time. Our findings are corroborated by numerical examples of phases computation, demonstrating the viability of the method proposed.</description>

      <title>Spherical maximal functions and Hardy spaces for Fourier integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Hardy spaces for Fourier integral operators to obtain bounds for spherical maximal functions in $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$, $n\geq2$, where the radii of the spheres are restricted to a compact subset of $(0,\infty)$. These bounds extend to general hypersurfaces with non-vanishing Gaussian curvature, to the complex spherical means, and to geodesic spheres on compact manifolds. We also obtain improved maximal function bounds and pointwise convergence statements for wave equations, both on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and on compact manifolds. The maximal function bounds are essentially sharp for all $p\in[1,2]\cup [\frac{2(n+1)}{n-1},\infty]$, for each such hypersurface, every complex spherical mean, and on every manifold.</description>

      <title>Classical-Quantum correspondence in Lindblad evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for the Lindblad evolution defined using (at most) quadratically growing classical Hamiltonians and (at most) linearly growing classical jump functions (quantized into jump operators assumed to satisfy certain ellipticity conditions and modeling interaction with a larger system), the evolution of a quantum observable remains close to the classical Fokker--Planck evolution in the Hilbert--Schmidt norm for times vastly exceeding the Ehrenfest time (the limit of such agreement with no jump operators). The time scale is the same as in two recent papers by Hern\'andez--Ranard--Riedel but the statement and methods are different.</description>
