      <title>Toward Ethical Spatial Analysis: Addressing Endogenous Bias Through Visual Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial analysis can generate both exogenous and endogenous biases, which will lead to ethics issues. Exogenous biases arise from external factors or environments and are unrelated to internal operating mechanisms, while endogenous biases stem from internal processes or technologies. Although much attention has been given to exogenous biases, endogenous biases in spatial analysis have been largely overlooked, and a comprehensive methodology for addressing them is yet to be developed. To tackle this challenge, we propose that visual analytics can play a key role in understanding geographic data and improving the interpretation of analytical results. In this study, we conducted a preliminary investigation using various visualization techniques to explore endogenous biases. Our findings demonstrate the potentials of visual analytics to uncover hidden biases and identify associated issues. Additionally, we synthesized these visualization strategies into a framework that approximates a method for detecting endogenous biases. Through this work, we advocate for the integration of visualization at three critical stages of spatial analysis in order to minimize errors, address ethical concerns, and reduce misinterpretations associated with endogenous biases.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Symmetry Discovery for Classical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a data-driven, deep-learning-based Machine-Learning Symmetry Discovery (MLSD) algorithm to automate the discovery of continuous Lie group symmetries in classical mechanical systems from their time-evolution trajectory data. MLSD uses neural networks (NNs) to predict conserved physical quantities that implement symmetry transformations of the phase space coordinates. After training, MLSD is able to identify the Lie algebra, particularly non-abelian ones, as indicated by the Lie algebra structure coefficients. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the MLSD method, we applied it to simulated data from the classical three-dimensional Kepler problem and the harmonic oscillator. The results show that the algorithm successfully identified the hidden symmetry groups of both systems.</description>

      <title>Differential cross section measurements of top quark pair production for variables of the dineutrino system with the CMS experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential top quark pair cross sections are measured in the dilepton final state as a function of kinematic variables associated to the dineutrino system. The measurements are performed making use of the Run 2 dataset collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC collider, corresponding to proton-proton collisions recorded at center of mass energy of 13 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The measured cross sections are found in agreement with theory predictions and Monte Carlo simulations of standard model processes.</description>

      <title>Characterising the dynamics of unlabelled temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks model the architecture backbone of complex systems. The backbone itself can change over time leading to what is called `temporal networks'. Interpreting temporal networks as trajectories in graph space of a latent graph dynamics has recently enabled the extension of concepts and tools from dynamical systems and time series to networks. Here we address temporal networks with unlabelled nodes, a case that has received relatively little attention so far. Situations in which node labelling cannot be tracked over time often emerge in practice due to technical challenges, or privacy constraints. In unlabelled temporal networks there is no one-to-one matching between a network snapshot and its adjacency matrix. Characterizing the dynamical properties of such unlabelled network trajectories is nontrivial. We here exploit graph invariants to extend to the unlabelled setting network-dynamical quantifiers of linear correlations and dynamical instability. In particular, we focus on autocorrelation functions and the sensitive dependence on initial conditions. We show with synthetic graph dynamics that the measures are capable of recovering and estimating these dynamical fingerprints even when node labels are unavailable. We also validate the methods for some empirical temporal networks with removed node labels.</description>

      <title>Effective Energy, Interactions And Out Of Equilibrium Nature Of Scalar Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the effective energy, $E_\text{eff}$ of a stationary probability distribution is a challenge for non-equilibrium steady states. Its solution could offer a novel framework for describing and analyzing non-equilibrium systems. In this work, we address this issue within the context of scalar active matter, focusing on the continuum field theory of Active Model B+. We show that the Wavelet Conditional Renormalization Group method allows us to estimate the effective energy of active model B+ from samples obtained by numerical simulations. We investigate the qualitative changes of $E_\text{eff}$ as the activity level increases. Our key finding is that in the regimes corresponding to low activity and to standard phase separation the interactions in $E_\text{eff}$ are short-ranged, whereas for strong activity the interactions become long-ranged and lead to micro-phase separation. By analyzing the violation of Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem and entropy production patterns, which are directly accessible within the WCRG framework, we connect the emergence of these long-range interactions to the non-equilibrium nature of the steady state. This connection highlights the interplay between activity, range of the interactions and the fundamental properties of non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Spatiotemporal Resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general, the comprehension of any type of complex system depends on the resolution used to look at the phenomena occurring within it. But identifying a priori, for example, the best time frequencies/scales to study a certain system over-time, or the spatial distances at which looking for correlations, symmetries, and fluctuations, is most often non-trivial. Here we describe an unsupervised approach that, starting solely from the data of a system, allows learning the characteristic length-scales of the key events/processes dominating it and the optimal spatiotemporal resolutions to characterize them. We test this approach on time-series data obtained from simulation or experimental trajectories of various example many-body complex systems ranging from the atomic- to the macroscopic-scale and having diverse internal dynamic complexities. Our method automatically performs the analysis of the system's data, analyzing correlations at all relevant inter-particle distances and at all possible inter-frame intervals in which their time-series can be subdivided: namely, at all space-and-time resolutions. The optimal spatiotemporal resolution for studying a certain system thus steps-out as that maximizing information extraction-and-classification from the system's data, which we prove being related to the characteristic spatiotemporal length-scales of the local/collective physical events dominating it. This approach is broadly applicable and can be used to optimize the study of different types of data (static distributions, time-series, or signals). The concept of 'optimal resolution' has general character and provides a robust basis to characterize any type of system based on its data, as well as to guide data analysis in general.</description>
