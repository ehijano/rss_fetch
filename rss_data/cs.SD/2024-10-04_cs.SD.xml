      <title>PerTok: Expressive Encoding and Modeling of Symbolic Musical Ideas and Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Cadenza, a new multi-stage generative framework for predicting expressive variations of symbolic musical ideas as well as unconditional generations. To accomplish this we propose a novel MIDI encoding method, PerTok (Performance Tokenizer) that captures minute expressive details whilst reducing sequence length up to 59% and vocabulary size up to 95% for polyphonic, monophonic and rhythmic tasks. The proposed framework comprises of two sequential stages: 1) Composer and 2) Performer. The Composer model is a transformer-based Variational Autoencoder (VAE), with Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)ROPE and an autoregressive decoder modified to more effectively integrate the latent codes of the input musical idea. The Performer model is a bidirectional transformer encoder that is separately trained to predict velocities and microtimings on MIDI sequences. Objective and human evaluations demonstrate Cadenza's versatile capability in 1) matching other unconditional state-of-the-art symbolic models in musical quality whilst sounding more expressive, and 2) composing new, expressive ideas that are both stylistically related to the input whilst providing novel ideas to the user. Our framework is designed, researched and implemented with the objective of ethically providing inspiration for musicians.</description>

      <title>Generating Symbolic Music from Natural Language Prompts using an LLM-Enhanced Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen many audio-domain text-to-music generation models that rely on large amounts of text-audio pairs for training. However, symbolic-domain controllable music generation has lagged behind partly due to the lack of a large-scale symbolic music dataset with extensive metadata and captions. In this work, we present MetaScore, a new dataset consisting of 963K musical scores paired with rich metadata, including free-form user-annotated tags, collected from an online music forum. To approach text-to-music generation, we leverage a pretrained large language model (LLM) to generate pseudo natural language captions from the metadata. With the LLM-enhanced MetaScore, we train a text-conditioned music generation model that learns to generate symbolic music from the pseudo captions, allowing control of instruments, genre, composer, complexity and other free-form music descriptors. In addition, we train a tag-conditioned system that supports a predefined set of tags available in MetaScore. Our experimental results show that both the proposed text-to-music and tags-to-music models outperform a baseline text-to-music model in a listening test, while the text-based system offers a more natural interface that allows free-form natural language prompts.</description>

      <title>MDSGen: Fast and Efficient Masked Diffusion Temporal-Aware Transformers for Open-Domain Sound Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MDSGen, a novel framework for vision-guided open-domain sound generation optimized for model parameter size, memory consumption, and inference speed. This framework incorporates two key innovations: (1) a redundant video feature removal module that filters out unnecessary visual information, and (2) a temporal-aware masking strategy that leverages temporal context for enhanced audio generation accuracy. In contrast to existing resource-heavy Unet-based models, MDSGen employs denoising masked diffusion transformers, facilitating efficient generation without reliance on pre-trained diffusion models. Evaluated on the benchmark VGGSound dataset, our smallest model (5M parameters) achieves 97.9% alignment accuracy, using 172x fewer parameters, 371% less memory, and offering 36x faster inference than the current 860M-parameter state-of-the-art model (93.9% accuracy). The larger model (131M parameters) reaches nearly 99% accuracy while requiring 6.5x fewer parameters. These results highlight the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>SoundMorpher: Perceptually-Uniform Sound Morphing with Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SoundMorpher, a sound morphing method that generates perceptually uniform morphing trajectories using a diffusion model. Traditional sound morphing methods models the intractable relationship between morph factor and perception of the stimuli for resulting sounds under a linear assumption, which oversimplifies the complex nature of sound perception and limits their morph quality. In contrast, SoundMorpher explores an explicit proportional mapping between the morph factor and the perceptual stimuli of morphed sounds based on Mel-spectrogram. This approach enables smoother transitions between intermediate sounds and ensures perceptually consistent transformations, which can be easily extended to diverse sound morphing tasks. Furthermore, we present a set of quantitative metrics to comprehensively assess sound morphing systems based on three objective criteria, namely, correspondence, perceptual intermediateness, and smoothness. We provide extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of SoundMorpher in real-world scenarios, highlighting its potential impact on various applications such as creative music composition, film post-production and interactive audio technologies.</description>

      <title>A Pilot Study of Applying Sequence-to-Sequence Voice Conversion to Evaluate the Intelligibility of L2 Speech Using a Native Speaker's Shadowings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utterances by L2 speakers can be unintelligible due to mispronunciation and improper prosody. In computer-aided language learning systems, textual feedback is often provided using a speech recognition engine. However, an ideal form of feedback for L2 speakers should be so fine-grained that it enables them to detect and diagnose unintelligible parts of L2 speakers' utterances. Inspired by language teachers who correct students' pronunciation through a voice-to-voice process, this pilot study utilizes a unique semi-parallel dataset composed of non-native speakers' (L2) reading aloud, shadowing of native speakers (L1) and their script-shadowing utterances. We explore the technical possibility of replicating the process of an L1 speaker's shadowing L2 speech using Voice Conversion techniques, to create a virtual shadower system. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the VC system in simulating L1's shadowing behavior. The output of the virtual shadower system shows a reasonable similarity to the real L1 shadowing utterances in both linguistic and acoustic aspects.</description>

      <title>CoLLAP: Contrastive Long-form Language-Audio Pretraining with Musical Temporal Structure Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling temporal characteristics plays a significant role in the representation learning of audio waveform. We propose Contrastive Long-form Language-Audio Pretraining (\textbf{CoLLAP}) to significantly extend the perception window for both the input audio (up to 5 minutes) and the language descriptions (exceeding 250 words), while enabling contrastive learning across modalities and temporal dynamics. Leveraging recent Music-LLMs to generate long-form music captions for full-length songs, augmented with musical temporal structures, we collect 51.3K audio-text pairs derived from the large-scale AudioSet training dataset, where the average audio length reaches 288 seconds. We propose a novel contrastive learning architecture that fuses language representations with structured audio representations by segmenting each song into clips and extracting their embeddings. With an attention mechanism, we capture multimodal temporal correlations, allowing the model to automatically weigh and enhance the final fusion score for improved contrastive alignment. Finally, we develop two variants of the CoLLAP model with different types of backbone language models. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple long-form music-text retrieval datasets, we demonstrate consistent performance improvement in retrieval accuracy compared with baselines. We also show the pretrained CoLLAP models can be transferred to various music information retrieval tasks, with heterogeneous long-form multimodal contexts.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Variational Autoencoders for Spectrogram Compression in Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks audio features as spectrograms show better results than Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), but in practice they are hard to use due to a complex dimensionality of a feature space. The following paper presents an alternative approach towards generating compressed spectrogram representation, based on Convolutional Variational Autoencoders (VAE). A Convolutional VAE model was trained on a subsample of the LibriSpeech dataset to reconstruct short fragments of audio spectrograms (25 ms) from a 13-dimensional embedding. The trained model for a 40-dimensional (300 ms) embedding was used to generate features for corpus of spoken commands on the GoogleSpeechCommands dataset. Using the generated features an ASR system was built and compared to the model with MFCC features.</description>

      <title>A GEN AI Framework for Medical Note Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing administrative burden of medical documentation, particularly through Electronic Health Records (EHR), significantly reduces the time available for direct patient care and contributes to physician burnout. To address this issue, we propose MediNotes, an advanced generative AI framework designed to automate the creation of SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) notes from medical conversations. MediNotes integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to capture and process both text and voice inputs in real time or from recorded audio, generating structured and contextually accurate medical notes. The framework also incorporates advanced techniques like Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for efficient model fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, MediNotes offers a query-based retrieval system, allowing healthcare providers and patients to access relevant medical information quickly and accurately. Evaluations using the ACI-BENCH dataset demonstrate that MediNotes significantly improves the accuracy, efficiency, and usability of automated medical documentation, offering a robust solution to reduce the administrative burden on healthcare professionals while improving the quality of clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>Harmony and Duality: An introduction to Music Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop aspects of music theory related to harmony, such as scales, chord formation and improvisation from a combinatorial perspective. The goal is to provide a foundation for this subject by deriving the basic structure from a few assumptions, rather than writing down long lists of chords/scales to memorize without an underlying principle. Our approach involves introducing constraints that limit the possible scales we can consider. For example, we may impose the constraint that two voices cannot be only a semitone apart as this is too dissonant. We can then study scales that do not contain notes that are a semitone apart. A more refined constraint avoids three voices colliding by studying scales that do not have three notes separated only by semitones. Additionally, we require that our scales are complete, which roughly means that they are the maximal sets of tones that satisfy these constraints. As it turns out, completeness as applied to these simple two/three voice constraints characterizes the types of scales that are commonly used in music composition. Surprisingly, there is a correspondence between scales subject to the two-voice constraint and those subject to the three-voice constraint. We formulate this correspondence as a duality statement that provides a way to understand scales subject to one type of constraint in terms of scales subject to the other. Finally, we combine these constraint ideas to provide a classification of chords.</description>

      <title>ESC: Efficient Speech Coding with Cross-Scale Residual Vector Quantized Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural speech codecs aim to compress input signals into minimal bits while maintaining content quality in a low-latency manner. However, existing neural codecs often trade model complexity for reconstruction performance. These codecs primarily use convolutional blocks for feature transformation, which are not inherently suited for capturing the local redundancies in speech signals. To compensate, they require either adversarial discriminators or a large number of model parameters to enhance audio quality. In response to these challenges, we introduce the Efficient Speech Codec (ESC), a lightweight, parameter-efficient speech codec based on a cross-scale residual vector quantization scheme and transformers. Our model employs mirrored hierarchical window transformer blocks and performs step-wise decoding from coarse-to-fine feature representations. To enhance bitrate efficiency, we propose a novel combination of vector quantization techniques along with a pre-training paradigm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ESC can achieve high-fidelity speech reconstruction with significantly lower model complexity, making it a promising alternative to existing convolutional audio codecs.</description>

      <title>GALD-SE: Guided Anisotropic Lightweight Diffusion for Efficient Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech enhancement is designed to enhance the intelligibility and quality of speech across diverse noise conditions. Recently, diffusion model has gained lots of attention in speech enhancement area, achieving competitive results. Current diffusion-based methods blur the signal with isotropic Gaussian noise and recover clean speech from the prior. However, these methods often suffer from a substantial computational burden. We argue that the inefficiency partially stems from the oversight that speech enhancement is not purely a generative task; it primarily involves noise reduction and completion of missing information, while the clean clues in the original mixture do not need to be regenerated. In this paper, we propose a method that introduces noise with anisotropic guidance during the diffusion process, allowing the neural network to preserve clean clues within noisy recordings. This approach substantially reduces computational complexity while exhibiting robustness against various forms of noise interference and speech distortion. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results with only approximately 4.5 million parameters, a number significantly lower than that required by other diffusion methods. This effectively narrows the model size disparity between diffusion-based and predictive speech enhancement approaches. Additionally, the proposed method performs well in very noisy scenarios, demonstrating its potential for applications in highly challenging environments.</description>

      <title>A Fly on the Wall -- Exploiting Acoustic Side-Channels in Differential Pressure Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential Pressure Sensors are widely deployed to monitor critical environments. However, our research unveils a previously overlooked vulnerability: their high sensitivity to pressure variations makes them susceptible to acoustic side-channel attacks. We demonstrate that the pressure-sensing diaphragms in DPS can inadvertently capture subtle air vibrations caused by speech, which propagate through the sensor's components and affect the pressure readings. Exploiting this discovery, we introduce BaroVox, a novel attack that reconstructs speech from DPS readings, effectively turning DPS into a "fly on the wall." We model the effect of sound on DPS, exploring the limits and challenges of acoustic leakage. To overcome these challenges, we propose two solutions: a signal-processing approach using a unique spectral subtraction method and a deep learning-based approach for keyword classification. Evaluations under various conditions demonstrate BaroVox's effectiveness, achieving a word error rate of 0.29 for manual recognition and 90.51% accuracy for automatic recognition. Our findings highlight the significant privacy implications of this vulnerability. We also discuss potential defense strategies to mitigate the risks posed by BaroVox.</description>

      <title>Melody Is All You Need For Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Melody Guided Music Generation (MMGen) model, the first novel approach using melody to guide the music generation that, despite a pretty simple method and extremely limited resources, achieves excellent performance. Specifically, we first align the melody with audio waveforms and their associated descriptions using the multimodal alignment module. Subsequently, we condition the diffusion module on the learned melody representations. This allows MMGen to generate music that matches the style of the provided audio while also producing music that reflects the content of the given text description. To address the scarcity of high-quality data, we construct a multi-modal dataset, MusicSet, which includes melody, text, and audio, and will be made publicly available. We conduct extensive experiments which demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model both in terms of experimental metrics and actual performance quality.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination in Large Language, Image, Video and Audio Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09589v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of foundation models (FMs) across language, image, audio, and video domains has shown remarkable capabilities in diverse tasks. However, the proliferation of FMs brings forth a critical challenge: the potential to generate hallucinated outputs, particularly in high-stakes applications. The tendency of foundation models to produce hallucinated content arguably represents the biggest hindrance to their widespread adoption in real-world scenarios, especially in domains where reliability and accuracy are paramount. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of recent developments that aim to identify and mitigate the problem of hallucination in FMs, spanning text, image, video, and audio modalities. By synthesizing recent advancements in detecting and mitigating hallucination across various modalities, the paper aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, developers, and practitioners. Essentially, it establishes a clear framework encompassing definition, taxonomy, and detection strategies for addressing hallucination in multimodal foundation models, laying the foundation for future research in this pivotal area.</description>

      <title>Continual Test-time Adaptation for End-to-end Speech Recognition on Noisy Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning-based end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has made significant strides but still struggles with performance on out-of-domain samples due to domain shifts in real-world scenarios. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods address this issue by adapting models using test samples at inference time. However, current ASR TTA methods have largely focused on non-continual TTA, which limits cross-sample knowledge learning compared to continual TTA. In this work, we first propose a Fast-slow TTA framework for ASR that leverages the advantage of continual and non-continual TTA. Following this framework, we introduce Dynamic SUTA (DSUTA), an entropy-minimization-based continual TTA method for ASR. To enhance DSUTA robustness for time-varying data, we design a dynamic reset strategy to automatically detect domain shifts and reset the model, making it more effective at handling multi-domain data. Our method demonstrates superior performance on various noisy ASR datasets, outperforming both non-continual and continual TTA baselines while maintaining robustness to domain changes without requiring domain boundary information.</description>

      <title>PSLM: Parallel Generation of Text and Speech with LLMs for Low-Latency Spoken Dialogue Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal language models that process both text and speech have a potential for applications in spoken dialogue systems. However, current models face two major challenges in response generation latency: (1) generating a spoken response requires the prior generation of a written response, and (2) speech sequences are significantly longer than text sequences. This study addresses these issues by extending the input and output sequences of the language model to support the parallel generation of text and speech. Our experiments on spoken question answering tasks demonstrate that our approach improves latency while maintaining the quality of response content. Additionally, we show that latency can be further reduced by generating speech in multiple sequences. Demo samples are available at https://rinnakk.github.io/research/publications/PSLM.</description>

      <title>SonicSense: Object Perception from In-Hand Acoustic Vibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce SonicSense, a holistic design of hardware and software to enable rich robot object perception through in-hand acoustic vibration sensing. While previous studies have shown promising results with acoustic sensing for object perception, current solutions are constrained to a handful of objects with simple geometries and homogeneous materials, single-finger sensing, and mixing training and testing on the same objects. SonicSense enables container inventory status differentiation, heterogeneous material prediction, 3D shape reconstruction, and object re-identification from a diverse set of 83 real-world objects. Our system employs a simple but effective heuristic exploration policy to interact with the objects as well as end-to-end learning-based algorithms to fuse vibration signals to infer object properties. Our framework underscores the significance of in-hand acoustic vibration sensing in advancing robot tactile perception.</description>

      <title>dMel: Speech Tokenization made Simple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing by leveraging self-supervised pretraining on vast textual data. Inspired by this success, researchers have investigated complicated speech tokenization methods to discretize continuous speech signals so that language modeling techniques can be applied to speech data. However, existing approaches either model semantic (content) tokens, potentially losing acoustic information, or model acoustic tokens, risking the loss of semantic (content) information. Having multiple token types also complicates the architecture and requires additional pretraining. Here we show that discretizing mel-filterbank channels into discrete intensity bins produces a simple representation (dMel), that performs better than other existing speech tokenization methods. Using an LM-style transformer architecture for speech-text modeling, we comprehensively evaluate different speech tokenization methods on speech recognition (ASR) and speech synthesis (TTS). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of dMel in achieving high performance on both tasks within a unified framework, paving the way for efficient and effective joint modeling of speech and text.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparse Coding with the Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm for Speech Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers are exploring novel computational paradigms such as sparse coding and neuromorphic computing to bridge the efficiency gap between the human brain and conventional computers in complex tasks. A key area of focus is neuromorphic audio processing. While the Locally Competitive Algorithm has emerged as a promising solution for sparse coding, offering potential for real-time and low-power processing on neuromorphic hardware, its applications in neuromorphic speech classification have not been thoroughly studied. The Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm builds upon the Locally Competitive Algorithm by dynamically adjusting the modulation parameters of the filter bank to fine-tune the filters' sensitivity. This adaptability enhances lateral inhibition, improving reconstruction quality, sparsity, and convergence time, which is crucial for real-time applications. This paper demonstrates the potential of the Locally Competitive Algorithm and its adaptive variant as robust feature extractors for neuromorphic speech classification. Results show that the Locally Competitive Algorithm achieves better speech classification accuracy at the expense of higher power consumption compared to the LAUSCHER cochlea model used for benchmarking. On the other hand, the Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm mitigates this power consumption issue without compromising the accuracy. The dynamic power consumption is reduced to a range of 4 to 13 milliwatts on neuromorphic hardware, three orders of magnitude less than setups using Graphics Processing Units. These findings position the Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm as a compelling solution for efficient speech classification systems, promising substantial advancements in balancing speech classification accuracy and power efficiency.</description>

      <title>WaveletGPT: Wavelets Meet Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new wave of artificial intelligence advancements impacting every scientific field and discipline. They are trained on a simple objective: to predict the next token given the previous context. We live in a world where most of the data around us, e.g., text, audio, and music, has a multi-scale structure associated with it. This paper infuses LLMs with traditional signal processing ideas, namely wavelets, during pre-training to take advantage of the structure. Without adding \textbf{any extra parameters} to a GPT-style LLM architecture, we achieve the same pre-training performance almost twice as fast in text, raw audio, and symbolic music. This is achieved by imposing a structure on intermediate embeddings. When trained for the same number of training steps, we achieve significant gains in performance, which is comparable to pre-training a larger neural architecture. Our architecture allows every next token prediction access to intermediate embeddings at different temporal resolutions in every Transformer decoder block. This work will hopefully pave the way for incorporating multi-rate signal processing ideas into traditional LLM pre-training. Further, we showcase pushing model performance by improving internal structure instead of just going after scale.</description>

      <title>TCSinger: Zero-Shot Singing Voice Synthesis with Style Transfer and Multi-Level Style Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot singing voice synthesis (SVS) with style transfer and style control aims to generate high-quality singing voices with unseen timbres and styles (including singing method, emotion, rhythm, technique, and pronunciation) from audio and text prompts. However, the multifaceted nature of singing styles poses a significant challenge for effective modeling, transfer, and control. Furthermore, current SVS models often fail to generate singing voices rich in stylistic nuances for unseen singers. To address these challenges, we introduce TCSinger, the first zero-shot SVS model for style transfer across cross-lingual speech and singing styles, along with multi-level style control. Specifically, TCSinger proposes three primary modules: 1) the clustering style encoder employs a clustering vector quantization model to stably condense style information into a compact latent space; 2) the Style and Duration Language Model (S\&amp;D-LM) concurrently predicts style information and phoneme duration, which benefits both; 3) the style adaptive decoder uses a novel mel-style adaptive normalization method to generate singing voices with enhanced details. Experimental results show that TCSinger outperforms all baseline models in synthesis quality, singer similarity, and style controllability across various tasks, including zero-shot style transfer, multi-level style control, cross-lingual style transfer, and speech-to-singing style transfer. Singing voice samples can be accessed at https://tcsinger.github.io/.</description>
