      <title>The Importance of Causality in Decision Making: A Perspective on Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causality is receiving increasing attention in the Recommendation Systems (RSs) community, which has realised that RSs could greatly benefit from causality to transform accurate predictions into effective and explainable decisions. Indeed, the RS literature has repeatedly highlighted that, in real-world scenarios, recommendation algorithms suffer many types of biases since assumptions ensuring unbiasedness are likely not met. In this discussion paper, we formulate the RS problem in terms of causality, using potential outcomes and structural causal models, by giving formal definitions of the causal quantities to be estimated and a general causal graph to serve as a reference to foster future research and development.</description>

      <title>Financial Sentiment Analysis on News and Reports Using Large Language Models and FinBERT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis (FSA) is crucial for evaluating market sentiment and making well-informed financial decisions. The advent of large language models (LLMs) such as BERT and its financial variant, FinBERT, has notably enhanced sentiment analysis capabilities. This paper investigates the application of LLMs and FinBERT for FSA, comparing their performance on news articles, financial reports and company announcements. The study emphasizes the advantages of prompt engineering with zero-shot and few-shot strategy to improve sentiment classification accuracy. Experimental results indicate that GPT-4o, with few-shot examples of financial texts, can be as competent as a well fine-tuned FinBERT in this specialized field.</description>

      <title>Price-guided user attention in large-scale E-commerce group recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing group recommender systems utilize attention mechanisms to identify critical users who influence group decisions the most. We analyzed user attention scores from a widely-used group recommendation model on a real-world E-commerce dataset and found that item price and user interaction history significantly influence the selection of critical users. When item prices are low, users with extensive interaction histories are more influential in group decision-making. Conversely, their influence diminishes with higher item prices. Based on these observations, we propose a novel group recommendation approach that incorporates item price as a guiding factor for user aggregation. Our model employs an adaptive sigmoid function to adjust output logits based on item prices, enhancing the accuracy of user aggregation. Our model can be plugged into any attention-based group recommender system if the price information is available. We evaluate our model's performance on a public benchmark and a real-world dataset. We compare it with other state-of-the-art group recommendation methods. Our results demonstrate that our price-guided user attention approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of hit ratio and mean square error.</description>

      <title>BayesCNS: A Unified Bayesian Approach to Address Cold Start and Non-Stationarity in Search Systems at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information Retrieval (IR) systems used in search and recommendation platforms frequently employ Learning-to-Rank (LTR) models to rank items in response to user queries. These models heavily rely on features derived from user interactions, such as clicks and engagement data. This dependence introduces cold start issues for items lacking user engagement and poses challenges in adapting to non-stationary shifts in user behavior over time. We address both challenges holistically as an online learning problem and propose BayesCNS, a Bayesian approach designed to handle cold start and non-stationary distribution shifts in search systems at scale. BayesCNS achieves this by estimating prior distributions for user-item interactions, which are continuously updated with new user interactions gathered online. This online learning procedure is guided by a ranker model, enabling efficient exploration of relevant items using contextual information provided by the ranker. We successfully deployed BayesCNS in a large-scale search system and demonstrated its efficacy through comprehensive offline and online experiments. Notably, an online A/B experiment showed a 10.60% increase in new item interactions and a 1.05% improvement in overall success metrics over the existing production baseline.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Point-of-Interest Recommendation: Models, Architectures, and Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of smartphones and Location-Based Social Networks has led to a massive influx of spatio-temporal data, creating unparalleled opportunities for enhancing Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation systems. These advanced POI systems are crucial for enriching user experiences, enabling personalized interactions, and optimizing decision-making processes in the digital landscape. However, existing surveys tend to focus on traditional approaches and few of them delve into cutting-edge developments, emerging architectures, as well as security considerations in POI recommendations. To address this gap, our survey stands out by offering a comprehensive, up-to-date review of POI recommendation systems, covering advancements in models, architectures, and security aspects. We systematically examine the transition from traditional models to advanced techniques such as large language models. Additionally, we explore the architectural evolution from centralized to decentralized and federated learning systems, highlighting the improvements in scalability and privacy. Furthermore, we address the increasing importance of security, examining potential vulnerabilities and privacy-preserving approaches. Our taxonomy provides a structured overview of the current state of POI recommendation, while we also identify promising directions for future research in this rapidly advancing field.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately recommending products has long been a subject requiring in-depth research. This study proposes a multimodal paradigm for clothing recommendations. Specifically, it designs a multimodal analysis method that integrates clothing description texts and images, utilizing a pre-trained large language model to deeply explore the hidden meanings of users and products. Additionally, a variational encoder is employed to learn the relationship between user information and products to address the cold start problem in recommendation systems. This study also validates the significant performance advantages of this method over various recommendation system methods through extensive ablation experiments, providing crucial practical guidance for the comprehensive optimization of recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying User Coherence: A Unified Framework for Cross-Domain Recommendation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness of Recommender Systems (RS) is closely tied to the quality and distinctiveness of user profiles, yet despite many advancements in raw performance, the sensitivity of RS to user profile quality remains under-researched. This paper introduces novel information-theoretic measures for understanding recommender systems: a "surprise" measure quantifying users' deviations from popular choices, and a "conditional surprise" measure capturing user interaction coherence. We evaluate 7 recommendation algorithms across 9 datasets, revealing the relationships between our measures and standard performance metrics. Using a rigorous statistical framework, our analysis quantifies how much user profile density and information measures impact algorithm performance across domains. By segmenting users based on these measures, we achieve improved performance with reduced data and show that simpler algorithms can match complex ones for low-coherence users. Additionally, we employ our measures to analyze how well different recommendation algorithms maintain the coherence and diversity of user preferences in their predictions, providing insights into algorithm behavior. This work advances the theoretical understanding of user behavior and practical heuristics for personalized recommendation systems, promoting more efficient and adaptive architectures.</description>

      <title>Long-Sequence Recommendation Models Need Decoupled Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifelong user behavior sequences, comprising up to tens of thousands of history behaviors, are crucial for capturing user interests and predicting user responses in modern recommendation systems. A two-stage paradigm is typically adopted to handle these long sequences: a few relevant behaviors are first searched from the original long sequences via an attention mechanism in the first stage and then aggregated with the target item to construct a discriminative representation for prediction in the second stage. In this work, we identify and characterize, for the first time, a neglected deficiency in existing long-sequence recommendation models: a single set of embeddings struggles with learning both attention and representation, leading to interference between these two processes. Initial attempts to address this issue using linear projections -- a technique borrowed from language processing -- proved ineffective, shedding light on the unique challenges of recommendation models. To overcome this, we propose the Decoupled Attention and Representation Embeddings (DARE) model, where two distinct embedding tables are initialized and learned separately to fully decouple attention and representation. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that DARE provides more accurate search of correlated behaviors and outperforms baselines with AUC gains up to 0.9% on public datasets and notable online system improvements. Furthermore, decoupling embedding spaces allows us to reduce the attention embedding dimension and accelerate the search procedure by 50% without significant performance impact, enabling more efficient, high-performance online serving.</description>

      <title>A GEN AI Framework for Medical Note Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing administrative burden of medical documentation, particularly through Electronic Health Records (EHR), significantly reduces the time available for direct patient care and contributes to physician burnout. To address this issue, we propose MediNotes, an advanced generative AI framework designed to automate the creation of SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) notes from medical conversations. MediNotes integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to capture and process both text and voice inputs in real time or from recorded audio, generating structured and contextually accurate medical notes. The framework also incorporates advanced techniques like Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for efficient model fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, MediNotes offers a query-based retrieval system, allowing healthcare providers and patients to access relevant medical information quickly and accurately. Evaluations using the ACI-BENCH dataset demonstrate that MediNotes significantly improves the accuracy, efficiency, and usability of automated medical documentation, offering a robust solution to reduce the administrative burden on healthcare professionals while improving the quality of clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>Attention in Large Language Models Yields Efficient Zero-Shot Re-Rankers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information retrieval (IR) systems have played a vital role in modern digital life and have cemented their continued usefulness in this new era of generative AI via retrieval-augmented generation. With strong language processing capabilities and remarkable versatility, large language models (LLMs) have become popular choices for zero-shot re-ranking in IR systems. So far, LLM-based re-ranking methods rely on strong generative capabilities, which restricts their use to either specialized or powerful proprietary models. Given these restrictions, we ask: is autoregressive generation necessary and optimal for LLMs to perform re-ranking? We hypothesize that there are abundant signals relevant to re-ranking within LLMs that might not be used to their full potential via generation. To more directly leverage such signals, we propose in-context re-ranking (ICR), a novel method that leverages the change in attention pattern caused by the search query for accurate and efficient re-ranking. To mitigate the intrinsic biases in LLMs, we propose a calibration method using a content-free query. Due to the absence of generation, ICR only requires two ($O(1)$) forward passes to re-rank $N$ documents, making it substantially more efficient than generative re-ranking methods that require at least $O(N)$ forward passes. Our novel design also enables ICR to be applied to any LLM without specialized training while guaranteeing a well-formed ranking. Extensive experiments with two popular open-weight LLMs on standard single-hop and multi-hop information retrieval benchmarks show that ICR outperforms RankGPT while cutting the latency by more than 60% in practice. Through detailed analyses, we show that ICR's performance is specially strong on tasks that require more complex re-ranking signals. Our findings call for further exploration on novel ways of utilizing open-weight LLMs beyond text generation.</description>

      <title>Domain-Specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation Using Vector Stores, Knowledge Graphs, and Tensor Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are pre-trained on large-scale corpora and excel in numerous general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as question answering (QA). Despite their advanced language capabilities, when it comes to domain-specific and knowledge-intensive tasks, LLMs suffer from hallucinations, knowledge cut-offs, and lack of knowledge attributions. Additionally, fine tuning LLMs' intrinsic knowledge to highly specific domains is an expensive and time consuming process. The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process has recently emerged as a method capable of optimization of LLM responses, by referencing them to a predetermined ontology. It was shown that using a Knowledge Graph (KG) ontology for RAG improves the QA accuracy, by taking into account relevant sub-graphs that preserve the information in a structured manner. In this paper, we introduce SMART-SLIC, a highly domain-specific LLM framework, that integrates RAG with KG and a vector store (VS) that store factual domain specific information. Importantly, to avoid hallucinations in the KG, we build these highly domain-specific KGs and VSs without the use of LLMs, but via NLP, data mining, and nonnegative tensor factorization with automatic model selection. Pairing our RAG with a domain-specific: (i) KG (containing structured information), and (ii) VS (containing unstructured information) enables the development of domain-specific chat-bots that attribute the source of information, mitigate hallucinations, lessen the need for fine-tuning, and excel in highly domain-specific question answering tasks. We pair SMART-SLIC with chain-of-thought prompting agents. The framework is designed to be generalizable to adapt to any specific or specialized domain. In this paper, we demonstrate the question answering capabilities of our framework on a corpus of scientific publications on malware analysis and anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Unified Multi-Modal Interleaved Document Representation for Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information Retrieval (IR) methods aim to identify relevant documents in response to a given query, which have gained remarkable attention due to their successful application in various natural language tasks. However, existing approaches typically consider only the textual information within the documents, which overlooks the fact that documents can contain multiple modalities, including texts, images, and tables. Further, they often segment each long document into multiple discrete passages for embedding, preventing them from capturing the overall document context and interactions between paragraphs. We argue that these two limitations lead to suboptimal document representations for retrieval. In this work, to address them, we aim to produce more comprehensive and nuanced document representations by holistically embedding documents interleaved with different modalities. Specifically, we achieve this by leveraging the capability of recent vision-language models that enable the processing and integration of text, images, and tables into a unified format and representation. Moreover, to mitigate the information loss from segmenting documents into passages, instead of representing and retrieving passages individually, we further merge the representations of segmented passages into one single document representation, while we additionally introduce a reranking strategy to decouple and identify the relevant passage within the document if necessary. Then, through extensive experiments on diverse information retrieval scenarios considering both the textual and multimodal queries, we show that our approach substantially outperforms relevant baselines, thanks to the consideration of the multimodal information interleaved within the documents in a unified way.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Practicality of Generative Retrieval on Dynamic Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18952v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Benchmarking the performance of information retrieval (IR) is mostly conducted with a fixed set of documents (static corpora). However, in realistic scenarios, this is rarely the case and the documents to be retrieved are constantly updated and added. In this paper, we focus on Generative Retrievals (GR), which apply autoregressive language models to IR problems, and explore their adaptability and robustness in dynamic scenarios. We also conduct an extensive evaluation of computational and memory efficiency, crucial factors for real-world deployment of IR systems handling vast and ever-changing document collections. Our results on the StreamingQA benchmark demonstrate that GR is more adaptable to evolving knowledge (4 -- 11%), robust in learning knowledge with temporal information, and efficient in terms of inference FLOPs (x 2), indexing time (x 6), and storage footprint (x 4) compared to Dual Encoders (DE), which are commonly used in retrieval systems. Our paper highlights the potential of GR for future use in practical IR systems within dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Language Representations Can be What Recommenders Need: Findings and Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies empirically indicate that language models (LMs) encode rich world knowledge beyond mere semantics, attracting significant attention across various fields. However, in the recommendation domain, it remains uncertain whether LMs implicitly encode user preference information. Contrary to prevailing understanding that LMs and traditional recommenders learn two distinct representation spaces due to the huge gap in language and behavior modeling objectives, this work re-examines such understanding and explores extracting a recommendation space directly from the language representation space. Surprisingly, our findings demonstrate that item representations, when linearly mapped from advanced LM representations, yield superior recommendation performance. This outcome suggests the possible homomorphism between the advanced language representation space and an effective item representation space for recommendation, implying that collaborative signals may be implicitly encoded within LMs. Motivated by these findings, we explore the possibility of designing advanced collaborative filtering (CF) models purely based on language representations without ID-based embeddings. To be specific, we incorporate several crucial components to build a simple yet effective model, with item titles as the input. Empirical results show that such a simple model can outperform leading ID-based CF models, which sheds light on using language representations for better recommendation. Moreover, we systematically analyze this simple model and find several key features for using advanced language representations: a good initialization for item representations, zero-shot recommendation abilities, and being aware of user intention. Our findings highlight the connection between language modeling and behavior modeling, which can inspire both natural language processing and recommender system communities.</description>

      <title>Ink and Individuality: Crafting a Personalised Narrative in the Age of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00026v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Individuality and personalization comprise the distinctive characteristics that make each writer unique and influence their words in order to effectively engage readers while conveying authenticity. However, our growing reliance on LLM-based writing assistants risks compromising our creativity and individuality over time. We often overlook the negative impacts of this trend on our creativity and uniqueness, despite the possible consequences. This study investigates these concerns by performing a brief survey to explore different perspectives and concepts, as well as trying to understand people's viewpoints, in conjunction with past studies in the area. Addressing these issues is essential for improving human-computer interaction systems and enhancing writing assistants for personalization and individuality.</description>

      <title>Graph Chain-of-Thought: Augmenting Large Language Models by Reasoning on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while exhibiting exceptional performance, suffer from hallucinations, especially on knowledge-intensive tasks. Existing works propose to augment LLMs with individual text units retrieved from external knowledge corpora to alleviate the issue. However, in many domains, texts are interconnected (e.g., academic papers in a bibliographic graph are linked by citations and co-authorships) which form a (text-attributed) graph. The knowledge in such graphs is encoded not only in single texts/nodes but also in their associated connections. To facilitate the research of augmenting LLMs with graphs, we manually construct a Graph Reasoning Benchmark dataset called GRBench, containing 1,740 questions that can be answered with the knowledge from 10 domain graphs. Then, we propose a simple and effective framework called Graph Chain-of-thought (Graph-CoT) to augment LLMs with graphs by encouraging LLMs to reason on the graph iteratively. Each Graph-CoT iteration consists of three sub-steps: LLM reasoning, LLM-graph interaction, and graph execution. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on GRBench, where Graph-CoT outperforms the baselines consistently. The code is available at https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Graph-CoT.</description>

      <title>BlueTempNet: A Temporal Multi-network Dataset of Social Interactions in Bluesky Social</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized social media platforms like Bluesky Social (Bluesky) have made it possible to publicly disclose some user behaviors with millisecond-level precision. Embracing Bluesky's principles of open-source and open-data, we present the first collection of the temporal dynamics of user-driven social interactions. BlueTempNet integrates multiple types of networks into a single multi-network, including user-to-user interactions (following and blocking users) and user-to-community interactions (creating and joining communities). Communities are user-formed groups in custom Feeds, where users subscribe to posts aligned with their interests. Following Bluesky's public data policy, we collect existing Bluesky Feeds, including the users who liked and generated these Feeds, and provide tools to gather users' social interactions within a date range. This data-collection strategy captures past user behaviors and supports the future data collection of user behavior.</description>

      <title>Stalactite: Toolbox for Fast Prototyping of Vertical Federated Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models trained on datasets owned by different organizations and physically located in remote databases offer benefits in many real-world use cases. State regulations or business requirements often prevent data transfer to a central location, making it difficult to utilize standard machine learning algorithms. Federated Learning (FL) is a technique that enables models to learn from distributed datasets without revealing the original data. Vertical Federated learning (VFL) is a type of FL where data samples are divided by features across several data owners. For instance, in a recommendation task, a user can interact with various sets of items, and the logs of these interactions are stored by different organizations. In this demo paper, we present \emph{Stalactite} - an open-source framework for VFL that provides the necessary functionality for building prototypes of VFL systems. It has several advantages over the existing frameworks. In particular, it allows researchers to focus on the algorithmic side rather than engineering and to easily deploy learning in a distributed environment. It implements several VFL algorithms and has a built-in homomorphic encryption layer. We demonstrate its use on a real-world recommendation datasets.</description>

      <title>Do We Need Domain-Specific Embedding Models? An Empirical Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embedding models play a crucial role in representing and retrieving information across various NLP applications. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have further enhanced the performance of embedding models, which are trained on massive amounts of text covering almost every domain. These models are often benchmarked on general-purpose datasets like Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), where they demonstrate superior performance. However, a critical question arises: Is the development of domain-specific embedding models necessary when general-purpose models are trained on vast corpora that already include specialized domain texts? In this paper, we empirically investigate this question, choosing the finance domain as an example. We introduce the Finance Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (FinMTEB), a counterpart to MTEB that consists of financial domain-specific text datasets. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art embedding models on FinMTEB and observe a significant performance drop compared to their performance on MTEB. To account for the possibility that this drop is driven by FinMTEB's higher complexity, we propose four measures to quantify dataset complexity and control for this factor in our analysis. Our analysis provides compelling evidence that state-of-the-art embedding models struggle to capture domain-specific linguistic and semantic patterns. Moreover, we find that the performance of general-purpose embedding models on MTEB is not correlated with their performance on FinMTEB, indicating the need for domain-specific embedding benchmarks for domain-specific embedding models. This study sheds light on developing domain-specific embedding models in the LLM era. FinMTEB comes with open-source code at https://github.com/yixuantt/FinMTEB</description>

      <title>LML-DAP: Language Model Learning a Dataset for Data-Augmented Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classification tasks are typically handled using Machine Learning (ML) models, which lack a balance between accuracy and interpretability. This paper introduces a new approach to using Large Language Models (LLMs) for classification tasks in an explainable way. Unlike ML models that rely heavily on data cleaning and feature engineering, this method streamlines the process using LLMs. This paper proposes a new concept called "Language Model Learning (LML)" powered by a new method called "Data-Augmented Prediction (DAP)". The classification is performed by LLMs using a method similar to humans manually exploring and understanding the data and deciding classifications using data as a reference. In the LML process, a dataset is summarized and evaluated to determine the features that lead to the classification of each label the most. In the process of DAP, the system uses the data summary and a row of the testing dataset to automatically generate a query, which is used to retrieve relevant rows from the dataset. A classification is generated by the LLM using data summary and relevant rows, ensuring satisfactory accuracy even with complex data using context-aware decision-making. LML and DAP unlock the possibilities of new applications. The proposed method uses the words "Act as an Explainable Machine Learning Model" in the prompt to enhance the interpretability of the predictions by allowing users to review the logic behind each prediction. In some test cases, the system scored an accuracy above 90%, proving the effectiveness of the system and its potential to outperform conventional ML models in various scenarios.
