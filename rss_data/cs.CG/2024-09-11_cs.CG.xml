      <title>Harmonic Chain Barcode and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistence barcode is a topological descriptor of data that plays a fundamental role in topological data analysis. Given a filtration of the space of data, a persistence barcode tracks the evolution of its homological features. In this paper, we introduce a novel type of barcode, referred to as the canonical barcode of harmonic chains, or harmonic chain barcode for short, which tracks the evolution of harmonic chains. As our main result, we show that the harmonic chain barcode is stable and it captures both geometric and topological information of data. Moreover, given a filtration of a simplicial complex of size $n$ with $m$ time steps, we can compute its harmonic chain barcode in $O(m^2n^{\omega} + mn^3)$ time, where $n^\omega$ is the matrix multiplication time. Consequently, a harmonic chain barcode can be utilized in applications in which a persistence barcode is applicable, such as feature vectorization and machine learning. Our work provides strong evidence in a growing list of literature that geometric (not just topological) information can be recovered from a persistence filtration.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Motion Planning: Multi-Agent Path Finding in a Densely Packed, Bounded Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Multi-Agent Path Finding for arrangements of labeled agents in the interior of a simply connected domain: Given a unique start and target position for each agent, the goal is to find a sequence of parallel, collision-free agent motions that minimizes the overall time (the makespan) until all agents have reached their respective targets. A natural case is that of a simply connected polygonal domain with axis-parallel boundaries and integer coordinates, i.e., a simple polyomino, which amounts to a simply connected union of lattice unit squares or cells. We focus on the particularly challenging setting of densely packed agents, i.e., one per cell, which strongly restricts the mobility of agents, and requires intricate coordination of motion.
  We provide a variety of novel results for this problem, including (1) a characterization of polyominoes in which a reconfiguration plan is guaranteed to exist; (2) a characterization of shape parameters that induce worst-case bounds on the makespan; (3) a suite of algorithms to achieve asymptotically worst-case optimal performance with respect to the achievable stretch for cases with severely limited maneuverability. This corresponds to bounding the ratio between obtained makespan and the lower bound provided by the max-min distance between the start and target position of any agent and our shape parameters.
  Our results extend findings by Demaine et al. (SIAM Journal on Computing, 2019) who investigated the problem for solid rectangular domains, and in the closely related field of Permutation Routing, as presented by Alpert et al. (Computational Geometry, 2022) for convex pieces of grid graphs.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Cycle Tracking in Dynamic Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a nested tracking framework for analyzing cycles in 2D force networks within granular materials. These materials are composed of interacting particles, whose interactions are described by a force network. Understanding the cycles within these networks at various scales and their evolution under external loads is crucial, as they significantly contribute to the mechanical and kinematic properties of the system. Our approach involves computing a cycle hierarchy by partitioning the 2D domain into segments bounded by cycles in the force network. We can adapt concepts from nested tracking graphs originally developed for merge trees by leveraging the duality between this partitioning and the cycles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two force networks derived from experiments with photoelastic disks.</description>

      <title>Local Decomposition of Hexahedral Singular Nodes into Singular Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hexahedral (hex) meshing is a long studied topic in geometry processing with many fascinating and challenging associated problems. Hex meshes vary in complexity from structured to unstructured depending on application or domain of interest. Fully structured meshes require that all interior mesh edges are adjacent to exactly four hexes. Edges not satisfying this criteria are considered singular and indicate an unstructured hex mesh. Singular edges join together into singular curves that either form closed cycles, end on the mesh boundary, or end at a singular node, a complex junction of more than two singular curves. While all hex meshes with singularities are unstructured, those with more complex singular nodes tend to have more distorted elements and smaller scaled Jacobian values. In this work, we study the topology of singular nodes. We show that all eight of the most common singular nodes are decomposable into just singular curves. We further show that all singular nodes, regardless of edge valence, are locally decomposable. Finally we demonstrate these decompositions on hex meshes, thereby decreasing their distortion and converting all singular nodes into singular curves. With this decomposition, the enigmatic complexity of 3D singular nodes becomes effectively 2D.</description>

      <title>Faster, Deterministic and Space Efficient Subtrajectory Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a trajectory $T$ and a distance $\Delta$, we wish to find a set $C$ of curves of complexity at most $\ell$, such that we can cover $T$ with subcurves that each are within Fr\'echet distance $\Delta$ to at least one curve in $C$. We call $C$ an $(\ell,\Delta)$-clustering and aim to find an $(\ell,\Delta)$-clustering of minimum cardinality. This problem variant was introduced by Akitaya $et$ $al.$ (2021) and shown to be NP-complete. The main focus has therefore been on bicriterial approximation algorithms, allowing for the clustering to be an $(\ell, \Theta(\Delta))$-clustering of roughly optimal size.
  We present algorithms that construct $(\ell,4\Delta)$-clusterings of $\mathcal{O}(k \log n)$ size, where $k$ is the size of the optimal $(\ell, \Delta)$-clustering. We use $\mathcal{O}(n \log^2 n + n \cdot (k + \ell) \log n)$ space and $\mathcal{O}(k n^3 \log^4 n)$ time. Our algorithms significantly improve upon the clustering quality (improving the approximation factor in $\Delta$) and size (whenever $\ell \in \Omega(\log n)$). We offer deterministic running times comparable to known expected bounds. Additionally, we give a near-quadratic improvement upon the dependency on $n$ in the space usage.</description>

      <title>A statistical framework for analyzing shape in a time series of random geometric objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework to analyze shape descriptors that capture the geometric features of an ensemble of point clouds. At the core of our approach is the point of view that the data arises as sampled recordings from a metric space-valued stochastic process, possibly of nonstationary nature, thereby integrating geometric data analysis into the realm of functional time series analysis. Our framework allows for natural incorporation of spatial-temporal dynamics, heterogeneous sampling, and the study of convergence rates. Further, we derive complete invariants for classes of metric space-valued stochastic processes in the spirit of Gromov, and relate these invariants to so-called ball volume processes. Under mild dependence conditions, a weak invariance principle in $D([0,1]\times [0,\mathscr{R}])$ is established for sequential empirical versions of the latter, assuming the probabilistic structure possibly changes over time. Finally, we use this result to introduce novel test statistics for topological change, which are distribution-free in the limit under the hypothesis of stationarity. We explore these test statistics on time series of single-cell mRNA expression data, using shape descriptors coming from topological data analysis.</description>
