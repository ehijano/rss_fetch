      <title>Variational wavefunctions for fractional topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) host bands with opposite Chern number for the two spin species and could thus be host for fractional topological insulator states. In multicomponent quantum Hall systems, where the spins have equal Chern number, the resulting topological liquid states can be well modeled by trial wavefunctions such as the Halperin $(lmn)$ wavefunctions. These wavefunctions are exact zero energy states of certain short-range (pseudopotential) Hamiltonians. However, we show that such a construction fails in the case where the Chern numbers of the two spins are opposite, since the electrons with opposite Chern number cannot avoid one another. This underlines the importance of suppressing the short-range interspin Coulomb repulsion in order to realize fractional topological insulators in twisted TMDs. We introduce a trial wavefunction for the opposite Chern number Landau levels for filling factor $\nu=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3}$ in terms of pairing of composite fermions and show that it has good overlaps with the exact diagonalization ground state when the short-range Coulomb repulsion is sufficiently softened.</description>

      <title>Nonflat bands and chiral symmetry in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive effective theories for magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) based on the mean-field normal state at charge neutrality of a tight-binding model, thereby including the renormalizations coming from integrating out high-energy modes. In these models, the flat bands display a sizable increase of the bandwidth, and the corresponding wavefunctions flow towards the limit of perfect particle-hole symmetry and sublattice polarization. We further represent the flat bands in the 'vortex Chern' basis and also discuss the implications on the dynamics regarding the 'flat' and 'chiral' symmetries of MATBG, as manifested in the symmetry-broken states at neutrality.</description>

      <title>Dispersive dark excitons in van der Waals ferromagnet CrI3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-flip dark excitons are optical-dipole-forbidden quasiparticles with remarkable potential in optoelectronics, especially when they are realized within cleavable van der Waals materials. Despite this potential, dark excitons have not yet been definitively identified in ferromagnetic van der Waals materials. Here, we report two dark excitons in a model ferromagnetic material CrI3 using high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and show that they feature narrower linewidths compared to the bright excitons previously reported in this material. These excitons are shown to have spin-flip character, to disperse as a function of momentum, and to change through the ferromagnetic transition temperature. Given the versatility of van der Waals materials, these excitons hold promise for new types of magneto-optical functionality.</description>

      <title>Detection and control of electronic orbital magnetism by spin waves in honeycomb ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring and manipulating the orbital degrees of freedom in solids has become a fascinating research topic in modern magnetism. Here, we demonstrate that spin waves can provide a way to control electronic orbital magnetism by the mechanism of scalar spin chirality, allowing for experimental detection using techniques such as the magneto-optical Kerr effect and scanning transmission electron microscopy. By applying linear spin wave theory, we uncover that electronic magnon-driven orbital magnetization is extremely sensitive to the character of the magnonic excitations. Furthermore, we show that both the induced electronic orbital magnetism and the Nernst transport properties of the orbital angular momentum can be regulated by the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, Kitaev interaction, as well as the direction and magnitude of the external magnetic field. We argue that magnon-mediated electronic orbital magnetism presents an emergent variable which has to be taken into account when considering the physics of coupling magnonic excitiations to phonons and light.</description>

      <title>From Complexification to Self-Similarity: New Aspects of Quantum Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are a fascinating area of condensed matter physics. The extension through complexification not only broadens the scope of this field but also offers a new framework for understanding criticality and its statistical implications. This mini review provides a concise overview of recent developments in complexification, primarily covering finite temperature and equilibrium quantum phase transitions, as well as their connection with dynamical quantum phase transitions and non-Hermitian physics, with a particular focus on the significance of Fisher zeros. Starting from the newly discovered self-similarity phenomenon associated with complex partition functions, we further discuss research on self-similar systems briefly. Finally, we offer a perspective on these aspects.</description>

      <title>Detecting Many-Body Scars from Fisher Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of interacting quantum systems still defy precise understanding. One example is the so-called quantum many-body scars (QMBSs), where a set of energy eigenstates evade thermalization to give rise to long-lived oscillations. Despite the success of viewing scars from the perspectives of symmetry, commutant algebra and quasiparticles, it remains a challenge to elucidate the mechanism underlying all QMBS and to distinguish them from other forms of ergodicity breaking. In this work, we introduce an alternative route to detect and diagnose QMBS based on Fisher zeros, i.e. the patterns of zeros of the analytically continued partition function $Z$ on the complex $\beta$ (inverse temperature) plane. For systems with scars, a continuous line of Fisher zeros will appear off the imaginary $\beta$ axis and extend upward, separating the $\beta$ plane into regions with distinctive thermalization behaviors. This conjecture is motivated from interpreting the complex $Z$ as the survival amplitude of the thermofield double state, and it is validated by analyzing two models with QMBS, the $\bar{P}X\bar{P}$ model and the Ising chain in external fields. These models also illustrate another scenario of ergodicity breaking, where lines of Fisher zeros repeatedly intersect the imaginary $\beta$ axis. This ``statistical mechanics" approach places QMBS within the same framework of thermal and dynamical phase transitions. It has the advantage of easily spotting the emergence of scars without exhaustively examining each individual quantum state.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning of many-body electronic correlation entropy from local measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of quantum correlations in many-body systems is instrumental to understanding the nature of emergent phenomena in quantum materials. The correlation entropy serves as a key metric for assessing the complexity of a quantum many-body state in interacting electronic systems. However, its determination requires the measurement of all single-particle correlators across a macroscopic sample, which can be impractical. Machine learning methods have been shown to allow learning the correlation entropy from a reduced set of measurements, yet these methods assume that the targeted system is contained in the set of training Hamiltonians. Here we show that a transfer learning strategy enables correlation entropy learning from a reduced set of measurements in families of Hamiltonians never considered in the training set. We demonstrate this transfer learning methodology in a wide variety of interacting models including local and non-local attractive and repulsive many-body interactions, long-range hopping, doping, magnetic field, and spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, we show how this transfer learning methodology allows detecting quantum many-body phases never observed during their training set without prior knowledge about them. Our results demonstrate that correlation entropy learning can be potentially performed experimentally without requiring training in the experimentally realized Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Distinct terahertz third-harmonic generation of many-body excitonic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of an electron-hole plasma governed by strong Coulomb interaction is a challenging many-body problem.We report on experimental realization of electron-hole many-body states in the picosecond time scale, with tunable densities in a representative semiconductor Cu$_2$O. By using time-resolved optical-pump terahertz third-harmonic-generation spectroscopy, we study the nonlinear terahertz dynamical characteristics of the many-body electron-hole states. We find not only efficient and nonperturbative terahertz third-harmonic yield associated with the excitonic formation, but also a nonmonotonic dependence of the excitonic nonlinear response on the electron-hole density, reflecting the exciton dissociation at high charge density. Our results provide an efficient excitonic sensing of the far-from-equilibrium electron-hole many-body states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hybridization between plasmons, phonons, and electronic sound in ionic crystals using the Debye model, where the ionic background is modeled as a homogeneous, isotropic, elastic medium. We explicitly obtain the energies and the damping of the hybrid plasmon-sound modes in the hydrodynamic regime and calculate the corresponding dynamic structure factor. We show that the direct Coulomb interaction between the ions is essential to obtain a collective sound mode with linear dispersion.</description>

      <title>Bridging conformal field theory and parton approaches to SU(n)_k chiral spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the SU(n)_k Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model in conformal field theory to construct lattice wave functions in both one and two dimensions. It is unveiled that these wave functions can be reinterpreted as parton states, which enables efficient conversion to matrix product states such that many physical properties can be evaluated directly. In one dimension, these wave functions describe critical spin chains whose universality classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the WZW models used in the construction. In two dimensions, our constructions yield model wave functions for chiral spin liquids, and we show how to find all topological sectors of them in a systematic way. Using the null vectors of Kac-Moody algebras, parent Hamiltonians of the SU(3)_k series are derived. The SU(3)_k chiral spin liquids are lattice analogs of non-Abelian spin-singlet fractional quantum Hall states, and the k = 2 member hosts Fibonacci anyons.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless region and magnetization plateaus in easy-axis triangular weak-dimer antiferromaget K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic phase diagram of the bilayer triangular antiferromagnet K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$, unveiling a rich interplay between geometric frustration, bilayer coupling, and symmetry-driven phenomena. High-field magnetization measurements reveal fractional magnetization plateaus at 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, and 5/6 of the saturation magnetization. To elucidate the experimental magnetic phase diagram at low fields, we propose that K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$ can be described as an easy-axis triangular weak-dimer antiferromagnet. We emphasize the critical role of the emergent $U(1) \otimes S_3$ symmetry, where $S_3 = \mathbb{Z}_3 \otimes \mathbb{Z}_2^d$, in determining the magnetic phases at low fields. The remarkable agreement between the experimental and theoretical phase diagrams suggests that the phase transitions are governed by this symmetry. Notably, our combined experimental and theoretical results identify a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase region at finite fields. These findings provide new insights into the phase structure of frustrated magnets and establish K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$ as a compelling platform for exploring unconventional quantum phenomena in $U(1) \otimes S_3$ systems.</description>

      <title>Stacking disorder in novel ABAC-stacked brochantite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, weak interactions or slight changes to the structure can tip the delicate balance of exchange interactions, sending the system into a different ground state. Brochantite, Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$, has a copper sublattice composed of distorted triangles, making it a likely host for frustrated magnetism, but exhibits stacking disorder. The lack of synthetic single crystals has limited research on the magnetism in brochantite to powders and natural mineral crystals. We grew crystals which we find to be a new polytype with a tendency toward ABAC stacking and some anion disorder, alongside the expected stacking disorder. Comparison to previous results on natural mineral specimens suggests that cation disorder is more deleterious to the magnetism than anion and stacking disorder. Our specific heat data suggest a double transition on cooling into the magnetically ordered state.</description>

      <title>Weak electronic correlations in the cobalt oxychalcogenide superconductor Na2CoSe2O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the newly discovered Co-based superconductor Na2CoSe2O, we performed systematic calculations of its electronic band structures using the density functional theory (DFT) plus the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) approaches. Our comparative studies reveal weakly correlated and itinerant nature of the Co-3d electrons and show no sign of fluctuating local moments as expected in many other unconventional superconductors, although the Co eg orbitals are close to half filling. These suggest that Na2CoSe2O is a normal paramagnetic metal and its superconductivity might not be of strongly correlated nature, contrary to the initial speculation. We suggest future investigations of electron-phonon interactions to clarify its pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Large moir\'{e} superstructure of stacked incommensurate charge density waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in van der Waals heterostructures have opened the new frontier of moir\'{e} physics, whereby tuning the interlayer twist angle or adjusting lattice parameter mismatch have led to a plethora of exotic phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity and fractional quantum spin Hall effect. We extend the concept of moir\'{e} engineering to materials that host incommensurate orders, where we discovered a long-period, thermally-hysteretic moir\'{e} superlattice in a layered charge density wave (CDW) compound, EuTe$_\text{4}$. Using high-momentum-resolution X-ray diffraction performed on ultrathin flakes, we found two coexisting, incommensurate CDWs with slightly mismatched in-plane wavevectors. The interaction between these two CDWs leads to their joint commensuration with the high-symmetry lattice as well as a large moir\'{e} superstructure with an in-plane period of 13.6~nm. Due to different out-of-plane orders of the incommensurate CDWs, the moir\'{e} superstructure exhibits a clear thermal hysteresis, accounting for the large hysteresis observed in electrical resistivity and numerous metastable states induced by light or electrical pulses. Our findings pave the way for a new development in moir\'{e} engineering based on an incommensurate lattice. They further highlight the important role of interlayer ordering in determining the macroscopic properties of these stacked incommensurate structures.</description>

Abstract: We report a detailed study of soft-point-contact spectroscopy of the superconducting topological nodal-line semimetal Sn$_{0.15}$NbSe$_{1.75}$ with the superconducting transition temperature $T_{c}=9.5$ K. In the normal state, we observe prominent asymmetric double peaks in the differential conductance $dI/dV$. The asymmetric $dI/dV$ curves are attributed to Fano resonance, quantum interference between two distinct tunneling paths of transmitting electrons into flat energy bands and dispersive bands. A phenomenological double Fano resonance model reveals the hybridization between these bands below the hybridization temperature $T_{\mathrm{hyb}}=23$ K. This hybridization drives an opening of a pseudogap below a characteristic temperature $T_{\mathrm{PG}}=6.8$ K. In the superconducting state, we observe an unusual upper critical field that increases linearly with decreasing temperatures from $0.4T_{c}$ to $0.01T_{c}$, suggestive of a possible exotic superconducting state. Our results suggest the presence of surface flat energy bands that stem from nontrivial topological nature of nodal lines in the bulk band structure and the hybridization between the surface flat bands and bulk bands in Sn$_{0.15}$NbSe$_{1.75}$.</description>

      <title>Probing the Quantized Berry Phases in 1H-NbSe$_2$ Using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy</title>

Abstract: Topologically trivial insulators are classified into two primary categories: unobstructed and obstructed atomic insulators. While both types can be described by exponentially localized Wannier orbitals, a defining feature of obstructed atomic insulators is that the centers of charge of these orbitals are positioned at empty sites within the unit cell, rather than on atoms. Despite extensive theoretical predictions, the unambiguous and quantitative experimental identification of an obstructed atomic phase has remained elusive. In this work, we present the first direct experimental evidence of such a phase in 1H-NbSe$_2$. We develop a novel method to extract the inter-orbital correlation functions from the local spectral function probed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), leveraging the orbital wave functions obtained from ab initio calculations. Applying this technique to STM images, we determine the inter-orbital correlation functions for the atomic band of 1H-NbSe$_2$ that crosses the Fermi level. Our results show that this band realizes an optimally compact obstructed atomic phase, providing the first unambiguous experimental identification of such a phase. Our approach of deconvolving the STM signal using ab initio orbital wave functions is broadly applicable to other material platforms, offering a powerful tool for exploring other electronic phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of a (de)confined phase in QFT is well-defined in the presence of $1$-form symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking. However, in scenarios where such symmetries are absent, confinement is not a well-defined phase property. In this work, we propose that, when restricting to a specific submanifold of the parameter space - namely at zero temperature and fixed quark mass - the confined and color-superconducting (CSC) phases of scalar QCD can be distinguished through the different organization of their spectra, as seen from the perspective of the baryon symmetry. The analysis is performed in terms of an appropriate higher-categorical representation theory, recently developed for generalized symmetries. Consistent with expectations, we find that the confined phase permits only particles with integer baryon charges, while the CSC phase is characterized by the coexistence of bare quarks and vortices, exhibiting a non-trivial Aharonov-Bohm effect between these excitations.</description>

      <title>Transparent Correlated Metallic Perovskites with Conducive Chemical Disorder</title>

Abstract: This manuscript presents a working model linking chemical disorder and transport properties in correlated-electron perovskites with high-entropy formulations and a framework to actively design them. We demonstrate this new learning in epitaxial Sr$x$(Ti,Cr,Nb,Mo,W)O$3$ thin films that exhibit exceptional crystalline fidelity despite a diverse chemical formulation where most B-site species are highly misfit with respect to valence and radius. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy confirm a unique combination of chemical disorder and structural perfection in thick epitaxial layers. This combination produces significant electron correlation, low electrical resistivity, and an optical transparency window that surpasses that of constituent end-members, with a flattened frequency- and temperature-dependent response. We address the computational challenges of modeling such systems and investigate short-range ordering using cluster expansion. These results showcase that unusual d-metal combinations access an expanded property design space that is predictable using end-member characteristics -- though unavailable to them -- thus offering performance advances in optical, spintronic, and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Fate of Bosonic Topological Edge Modes in the Presence of Many-Body Interactions</title>

Abstract: Many magnetic materials are predicted to exhibit bosonic topological edge modes in their excitation spectra, because of the nontrivial topology of their magnon, triplon, or other quasi-particle band structures. However, there is a discrepancy between theory prediction and experimental observation, which suggests some underlying mechanism that intrinsically suppresses the expected experimental signatures, like the thermal Hall current. Many-body interactions that are not accounted for in the non-interacting quasi-particle picture are most often identified as the reason for the absence of the topological edge modes. Here we report persistent bosonic edge modes at the boundaries of a ladder quantum paramagnet with gapped triplon excitations in the presence of the full many-body interaction. We use tensor network methods to resolve topological edge modes in the time-dependent spin-spin correlations and the dynamical structure factor, which is directly accessible experimentally. We further show that signatures of these edge modes survive even when the non-interacting quasi-particle theory breaks down, discuss the topological phase diagram of the model, demonstrate the fractionalization of its low-lying excitations, and propose potential material candidates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of correlated electron materials are often intricately linked to Van Hove singularities (VHS) in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. The class of these VHS is of great importance, with higher-order ones -- with power-law divergence in the density of states -- leaving frequently distinct signatures in physical properties. We use a new theoretical method to detect and analyse higher-order VHS (HOVHS) in two-dimensional materials and apply it to the electronic structure of the surface layer of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. We then constrain a low energy model of the VHS of the surface layer of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ against angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and quasiparticle interference data to analyse the VHS near the Fermi level. We show how these VHS can be engineered into HOVHS.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Decoupling of Single Impurity Anderson Model through Auxiliary Majorana Fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method to study the time evolution of the single impurity Anderson model which exploits a mean field decoupling of the interacting impurity and the non-interacting bath (in form of a chain). This is achieved by the introduction of a pair of auxiliary Majorana fermions between the impurity and the chain. After decoupling, we obtain a self-consistent set of equations for the impurity and chain. First, we study the behavior of the system in equilibrium at zero temperature. We obtain a phase transition as a function of the interaction at the impurity and the coupling between the impurity and the chain between the Kondo regime, where the mean field parameters are zero and, hence, we have a well-defined spin at the impurity, to a phase where mean field parameters acquire finite values leading to a screening of the impurity spin by conduction bath electrons. In the latter case, we observe charge and spin fluctuations at the impurity site. Starting from this equilibrium ground state at zero temperature we quench in the interaction strength at the impurity and/or the hybridization strength between the impurity and the chain and study the time evolution of the system. We find that for quenches to weak to intermediate coupling the system converges to the equilibrium state defined by the final set of parameters after the quench. We analyze the oscillation frequency and as well as the thermalization rate during this quench. A quench to a strong interaction value results in persistent oscillations and a trapping of the system in a non-thermal state. We speculate that these two regimes of different long-time behavior are separated by a dynamical phase transition.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the formation of novel pair density waves (PDWs) in strongly correlated electronic systems remains challenging. Recent mean-field studies suggest that PDW phases may arise in strong-coupling multiband superconductors by virtue of the quantum geometric properties of paired electrons. However, scrutiny through sophisticated many-body calculations has been lacking. Employing large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain in the strong-coupling regime the phase diagram as a function of doping concentration and a tuning interaction parameter for a simple two-orbital model that incorporates quantum geometric effects. The phase diagram reveals a robust PDW phase spanning a broad range of parameters, characterized by a Luttinger parameter $K_{sc} \sim 0.3$ and the absence of coexisting competing spin or charge density wave orders. The observed pairing field configuration aligns with the phenomenological understanding that quantum geometry can promote PDW formation. Our study provides the most compelling numerical evidence to date for quantum-geometry-facilitated intrinsic PDW order in strongly correlated systems, paving the way for further exploration of novel PDW orders and quantum geometric effects in such systems.</description>

      <title>Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18981v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros were used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. It remains unclear, however, how Fisher zeros can be employed to better understand quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the analytically continued one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude, including its scaling behavior at the quantum critical point. We point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The exact analytical results are corroborated by the numerical tensor renormalization group. We further show that similar patterns of Fisher zeros also emerge in other spin models. Therefore, the approach outlined may serve as a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the excitation spectra of a spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg trimer spin chain by employing a combination of numerical and theoretical techniques. Utilizing the Krylov-space correction-vector method in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we calculate both the direct and indirect resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra for the trimer spin chain. To interpret the observed features in the RIXS spectra, we perform a theoretical perturbative analysis to compute the energy dispersions which are then utilized to determine the density of states (DOS) for both the single-particle and the two-particle excitation spectra. Our results show that the single-particle continua of the direct RIXS spectrum align with the energy levels observed in the DOS spectra of spinon, doublon, and quarton excitations. Furthermore, the two-particle continua are revealed in the indirect RIXS process, where all possible single particle excitations combine to form the various two-particle excitations of the trimer spin chain. Based on our calculations, we propose the RIXS mechanism of generating the fractionalized (spinon) and collective (doublon and quarton) excitations in the trimer spin chain at both the $L$-edge and the $K$-edge, including discussing the interplay of these excitations in the RIXS spectrum for various trimer coupling strength. The computed energy range of the excitations suggest the possibility of experimental detection at both the $L$-edge and the $K$-edge within the current capabilities of RIXS instrumentation resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10312v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising and 3-state Potts models. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensors with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>

Abstract: The continuous improvement of fabrication techniques and high-quality semiconductor-superconductor interfaces allowed for unprecedented tunability of Josephson junction arrays (JJA), making them a promising candidate for analog quantum simulations of many-body phenomena. While most experimental proposals so far focused on quantum simulations of ensembles of two-level systems, the possibility of tuning the current-phase relation beyond the sinusoidal regime paves the way for studying statistical physics models with larger local Hilbert spaces. Here, we investigate a particular JJA architecture that can be mapped into a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model. Through matrix-product-states simulations and bosonization analysis, we show that few experimentally accessible control parameters allow for the exploration of the rich phase diagrams of the associated low-energy field theories. Our results expand the horizon for analog quantum simulations with JJAs towards models that can not be efficiently captured with qubit architectures.</description>

We also obtain bootstrap bounds on thermal phase transition as well as preliminary results in the ungauged two-matrix quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</description>

Abstract: We study multiplicative Chern insulators (MCIs) as canonical examples of multiplicative topological phases of matter. Constructing the MCI Bloch Hamiltonian as a symmetry-protected tensor product of two topologically non-trivial parent Chern insulators (CIs), we study two-dimensional (2D) MCIs and introduce 3D mixed MCIs, constructed by requiring the two 2D parent Hamiltonians share only one momentum component. We study the 2D MCI response to time reversal symmetric flux insertion, observing a $4\pi$ Aharonov-Bohm effect, relating these topological states to fractional quantum Hall states via the effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. As part of this response, we observe evidence of quantisation of a proposed topological invariant for compactified many-body states, to a rational number, suggesting higher-dimensional topology may also be relevant. Finally, we study effects of bulk perturbations breaking the symmetry-protected tensor product structure of the child Hamiltonian, finding the MCI evolves adiabatically into a topological skyrmion phase.</description>
