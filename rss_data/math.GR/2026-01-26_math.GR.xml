      <title>The probability of generating a uniserial group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Famously, every finite simple group $G$ can be generated by a pair of elements. Moreover, Liebeck and Shalev (1995) proved that the probability that a pair of elements generate $G$ tends to $1$ as $|G| \to \infty$. More generally, work of Lucchini and Menegazzo (1997) implies that $G$ can be generated by a pair of elements whenever $G$ has a unique chief series. In this paper, we generalize the theorem of Liebeck and Shalev by proving that if $G$ has a unique chief series and the unique simple quotient of $G$ is $S$, then the probability that a pair of elements generate $G$ tends to $1$ as $|S| \to \infty$. As a consequence of our main theorem, for any profinite group $G$ where the open normal subgroups form a chain, the probability that a pair of elements topologically generate $G$ is positive. Along the way, we establish results on the maximal subgroup zeta function of groups with a unique minimal normal subgroup.</description>

      <title>Virtual retracts in groups acting on rooted trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study virtual retracts in groups acting on rooted trees. We show that finitely generated branch groups do not have the local retraction (LR) property. Furthermore, we specialize to iterated monodromy groups of post-critically finite quadratic complex polynomials and show that the (LR) property characterizes, among post-critically finite quadratic complex polynomials, those with a euclidean orbifold, i.e. the powering map and the Chebyshev polynomial. Lastly, we show that periodic quadratic complex polynomials provide new examples of pro-$2$ groups with complete finitely generated Hausdorff spectrum.</description>

      <title>Local limit theorems for random isometries of the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a random walk $(Y_N)_{N\geq 0}$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ generated by successively applying independent random isometries, drawn from a fixed measure $\mu$, to the point $0$. When the support of $\mu$ is finite and includes an irrational rotation satisfying a Diophantine condition, we establish a local central limit theorem (LCLT) for $Y_N$ down to super-polynomially small scales. When $\mu$ includes rotations satisfying a further algebraic condition, we prove that a LCLT holds down to the scale $\exp(-cN^{1/3}/(\log N)^2)$. Due to group-theoretic obstructions, this is sharp for symmetric $\mu$, up to the $\log$ factor. Lastly for a special class of asymmetric $\mu$, we obtain an LCLT down to the much finer scale $\exp(-cN^{1/2})$. The proofs relate the fine-scale distribution of $Y_N$ to a question about the values of integer polynomials on the unit circle.</description>

      <title>Homomorphisms between Bott-Samelson bimodules corresponding to sequences of reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the space of all bimodule homomorphisms $R_x\otimes_R R(\underline{t})\otimes_R R_y\to R_z\otimes_R R(\underline{t}')\otimes_R R_w$ as a one-sided module, where $R_x,R_y,R_z,R_w$ are standard twisted bimodules and $R(\underline{t})$ and $R(\underline{t}')$ are the Bott-Samelson bimodules corresponding to sequences of reflections $\underline{t}$ and $\underline{t}'$ respectively. We prove that this module is always reflexive under some reasonable restrictions on the representation of the underlying Coxeter group.
  However, unlike the case where $\underline{t}$ and $\underline{t}'$ contain only simple reflections, this module does not need any longer to be free. We provide a series of counterexamples already for the symmetric groups $S_n$, where $n\ge4$. The projective dimension of the modules dual to them is $n-3$ and thus serves to measure the deviation from the free modules.
  When placed within a geometric framework, these examples show how to find fibers of points fixed by the compact torus in the Bott-Samelson resolutions (as in the original definition by Raoul Bott and Hans Samelson) with non-vanishing odd cohomology.</description>

      <title>On the depth of subgroups of simple groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The depth of a subgroup $H$ of a finite group $G$ is a positive integer defined with respect to the inclusion of the corresponding complex group algebras $\mathbb{C}H \subseteq \mathbb{C}G$. This notion was originally introduced by Boltje, Danz and K\"{u}lshammer in 2011, and it has been the subject of numerous papers in recent years. In this paper, we study the depth of core-free subgroups, which allows us to apply powerful computational and probabilistic techniques that were originally designed for studying bases for permutation groups. We use these methods to prove a wide range of new results on the depth of subgroups of almost simple groups, significantly extending the scope of earlier work in this direction. For example, we establish best possible bounds on the depth of irreducible subgroups of classical groups and primitive subgroups of symmetric groups. And with the exception of a handful of open cases involving the Baby Monster, we calculate the exact depth of every subgroup of every almost simple sporadic group. We also present a number of open problems and conjectures.</description>

      <title>The Addition Theorem for the Algebraic Entropy of Torsion Nilpotent Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Addition Theorem for the algebraic entropy of group endomorphisms of torsion
  abelian groups was proved by Dikranjan, Goldsmith, Salce and Zanardo.
  It was later extended by Shlossberg to torsion nilpotent groups of class 2.
  As our main result, we prove the Addition Theorem for endomorphisms of torsion
  nilpotent groups of arbitrary nilpotency class.
  As an application, we show that if $G$ is a torsion nilpotent group, then for every
  $\phi\in\operatorname{End}(G)$ either the entropy is infinite or $h(\phi)=\log(\alpha)$
  for a positive integer $\alpha$.
  We further obtain, for automorphisms of locally finite groups, the Addition Theorem
  with respect to every term of the upper central series; in particular, it holds
  for automorphisms of $\omega$-hypercentral groups.
  Finally, we establish a reduction principle: if $\mathfrak X$ is a class of locally finite groups closed under taking subgroups and quotients, then the Addition Theorem for endomorphisms holds in
  $\mathfrak X$ if and only if it holds for locally finite groups generated by bounded
  sets.</description>

      <title>Primes and The Field of Values of Characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. For $p=2$, the fields of values of the complex irreducible characters of finite groups whose degrees are not divisible by $p$ have been classified; for odd primes $p$, a conjectural classification has been proposed. In this work, we extend this conjecture to characters whose degrees are divisible by arbitrary powers of $p$, and we provide some evidence supporting its validity.</description>
