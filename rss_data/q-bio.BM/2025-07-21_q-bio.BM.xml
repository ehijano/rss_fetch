      <title>A Collaborative Framework Integrating Large Language Model and Chemical Fragment Space: Mutual Inspiration for Lead Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization algorithm is essential in computer-aided drug design by progressively exploring chemical space to design lead compounds with high affinity to target protein. However current methods face inherent challenges in integrating domain knowledge, limiting their performance in identifying lead compounds with novel and valid binding mode. Here, we propose AutoLeadDesign, a lead compounds design framework that inspires extensive domain knowledge encoded in large language models with chemical fragments to progressively implement efficient exploration of vast chemical space. The comprehensive experiments indicate that AutoLeadDesign outperforms baseline methods. Significantly, empirical lead design campaigns targeting two clinically relevant targets (PRMT5 and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) demonstrate AutoLeadDesign's competence in de novo generation of lead compounds achieving expert-competitive design efficacy. Structural analysis further confirms their mechanism-validated inhibitory patterns. By tracing the process of design, we find that AutoLeadDesign shares analogous mechanisms with fragment-based drug design which traditionally rely on the expert decision-making, further revealing why it works. Overall, AutoLeadDesign offers an efficient approach for lead compounds design, suggesting its potential utility in drug design.</description>

      <title>MolPIF: A Parameter Interpolation Flow Model for Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in deep learning for molecular generation show promise in accelerating drug discovery. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) have recently shown impressive performance across diverse chemical tasks, with their success often ascribed to the paradigm of modeling in a low-variance parameter space. However, the Bayesian inference-based strategy imposes limitations on designing more flexible distribution transformation pathways, making it challenging to adapt to diverse data distributions and varied task requirements. Furthermore, the potential for simpler, more efficient parameter-space-based models is unexplored. To address this, we propose a novel Parameter Interpolation Flow model (named PIF) with detailed theoretical foundation, training, and inference procedures. We then develop MolPIF for structure-based drug design, demonstrating its superior performance across diverse metrics compared to baselines. This work validates the effectiveness of parameter-space-based generative modeling paradigm for molecules and offers new perspectives for model design.</description>

      <title>MoDyGAN: Combining Molecular Dynamics With GANs to Investigate Protein Conformational Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensively exploring protein conformational landscapes remains a major challenge in computational biology due to the high computational cost involved in dynamic physics-based simulations. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline, MoDyGAN, that leverages molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to explore protein conformational spaces. MoDyGAN contains a generator that maps Gaussian distributions into MD-derived protein trajectories, and a refinement module that combines ensemble learning with a dual-discriminator to further improve the plausibility of generated conformations. Central to our approach is an innovative representation technique that reversibly transforms 3D protein structures into 2D matrices, enabling the use of advanced image-based GAN architectures. We use three rigid proteins to demonstrate that MoDyGAN can generate plausible new conformations. We also use deca-alanine as a case study to show that interpolations within the latent space closely align with trajectories obtained from steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. Our results suggest that representing proteins as image-like data unlocks new possibilities for applying advanced deep learning techniques to biomolecular simulation, leading to an efficient sampling of conformational states. Additionally, the proposed framework holds strong potential for extension to other complex 3D structures.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Pretraining for Molecular Property Prediction in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in property prediction, but they often require large amounts of labeled data. The challenge is that, in real-world applications, labels are extremely scarce, as obtaining them through laboratory experimentation is both expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we introduce MoleVers, a versatile pretrained molecular model designed for various types of molecular property prediction in the wild, i.e., where experimentally-validated labels are scarce. MoleVers employs a two-stage pretraining strategy. In the first stage, it learns molecular representations from unlabeled data through masked atom prediction and extreme denoising, a novel task enabled by our newly introduced branching encoder architecture and dynamic noise scale sampling. In the second stage, the model refines these representations through predictions of auxiliary properties derived from computational methods, such as the density functional theory or large language models. Evaluation on 22 small, experimentally-validated datasets demonstrates that MoleVers achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the effectiveness of its two-stage framework in producing generalizable molecular representations for diverse downstream properties.</description>
