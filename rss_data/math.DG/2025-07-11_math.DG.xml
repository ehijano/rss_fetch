      <title>Null Distance and Temporal Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of null distance was introduced by Sormani and Vega as part of a broader program to develop a theory of metric convergence adapted to Lorentzian geometry. Given a time function $\tau$ on a spacetime $(M,g)$, the associated null distance $\hat{d}_\tau$ is constructed from and closely related to the causal structure of $M$. While generally only a semi-metric, $\hat{d}_\tau$ becomes a metric when $\tau$ satisfies the local anti-Lipschitz condition.
  In this work, we focus on temporal functions, that is, differentiable functions whose gradient is everywhere past-directed timelike. Sormani and Vega showed that the class of $C^1$ temporal functions coincides with that of $C^1$ locally anti-Lipschitz time functions. When a temporal function $f$ is smooth, its level sets $M_t = f^{-1}(t)$ are spacelike hypersurfaces and thus Riemannian manifolds endowed with the induced metric $h_t$. Our main result establishes that, on any level set $M_t$ where the gradient $\nabla f$ has constant norm, the null distance $\hat{d}_f$ is bounded above by a constant multiple of the Riemannian distance $d_{h_t}$.
  Applying this result to a smooth regular cosmological time function $\tau_g$ -- as introduced by Andersson, Galloway, and Howard -- we prove a theorem confirming a conjecture of Sakovich and Sormani (arXiv:2410.16800, 2025): if the diameters of the level sets $M_t = \tau_g^{-1}(t)$ shrink to zero as $t \to 0$, then the spacetime exhibits a Big Bang singularity, as defined in their work.</description>

      <title>Refined Kato type inequalities and new vanishing theorems on complete K\"ahler and quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a complete Riemannian manifold satisfying a weighted Poincar\'{e} inequality and having a bounded below Ricci curvature, various vanishing theorems for harmonic functions and harmonic 1-forms have been published. We generalized these results to $L^p$-integrable pluriharmonic functions and harmonic 1-forms on complete K\"{a}hler and quaternionic K\"{a}hler manifolds respectively by utilizing the B\"ochner technique and several refined Kato type inequalities. Moreover, we also prove the vanishing property of pluriharmonic functions with finite $L^p$ energy on complete K\"{a}hler manifolds satisfying a Sobolev type inequality.</description>

      <title>Fenchel-Willmore inequality for submanifolds in manifolds with non-negative $k$-Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a sharp Fenchel-Willmore inequality for closed submanifolds of arbitrary dimension and codimension immersed in a complete Riemannian manifold with non-negative intermediate Ricci curvature and Euclidean volume growth. In the hypersurface case, this reduces to non-negative Ricci curvature. We also characterize the equality case. This generalizes the recent work of Agostiniani, Fogagnolo, and Mazzieri \cite{Agostiniani-Fogagnolo-Mazzieri}, as well as classical results by Chen, Fenchel, Willmore, and others.</description>

      <title>Quantitative isoperimetric inequalities in capillarity problems and cones in strong and barycentric forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantitative isoperimetric inequalities for two different perimeter-type functionals. We first consider classical capillarity functionals, which measure the perimeter of sets in a Euclidean half-space, assigning a constant weight $\lambda \in (-1, 1)$ to the portion of the boundary that lies on the boundary of the half-space. We then consider the relative perimeter of sets contained in some suitable convex cone in the Euclidean space. In both settings, we establish sharp quantitative isoperimetric inequalities in the so-called strong form. More precisely, we show that the isoperimetric deficit of a competitor not only controls the Fraenkel asymmetry, but it also controls an oscillation asymmetry that measures how much the unit normals to the boundary of a competitor deviate from those of an isoperimetric set. Our technique is also able to explicitly identify a center that can be employed to compute the asymmetries. In particular, we also derive barycentric versions of these quantitative isoperimetric inequalities (both in the classical and in the strong form). The proofs are based on the derivation of Fuglede-type estimates for graphs defined on general spherically convex domains, in combination with a new application of the selection principle that directly provides the inequalities in barycentric form.</description>

      <title>Turing complete Navier-Stokes steady states via cosymplectic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we construct stationary solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations on certain Riemannian $3$-manifolds that exhibit Turing completeness, in the sense that they are capable of performing universal computation. This universality arises on manifolds admitting nonvanishing harmonic 1-forms, thus showing that computational universality is not obstructed by viscosity, provided the underlying geometry satisfies a mild cohomological condition. The proof makes use of a correspondence between nonvanishing harmonic $1$-forms and cosymplectic geometry, which extends the classical correspondence between Beltrami fields and Reeb flows on contact manifolds.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Structure of the Equilateral Pentagon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combinatorial structure of the realization space of the euqilateral pentagon linkage is closely related to a tiling of the hyperbolic plane by right-angled pentagons. In this correspondence lower dimensional faces of the tiling correspond to degenerate realizations of the linkage. We extend this combinatorial correspondence to a full conformal parameterization of the space of all such linkaged controlled by one point in the hyperbolic plane. To do so we exploit the symmetry of the realization space, combine it with the Riemann mapping theorem and a normalization procedure introduced by Springborn. The resulting parameterization is "democratic" in the sense of Yoshida Masaaki: All points are treated exactly equal.</description>

      <title>Manifolds with kinks and the asymptotic behavior of the graph Laplacian operator with Gaussian kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce manifolds with kinks, a class of manifolds with possibly singular boundary that notably contains manifolds with smooth boundary and corners. We derive the asymptotic behavior of the Graph Laplace operator with Gaussian kernel and its deterministic limit on these spaces as bandwidth goes to zero. We show that this asymptotic behavior is determined by the inward sector of the tangent space and, as special cases, we derive its behavior near interior and singular points. Lastly, we show the validity of our theoretical results using numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Short Simple Orthogonal Geodesic Chords on a 2-Disk with Convex Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of at least two distinct short, simple orthogonal geodesic chords on a Riemannian 2-disk $M$ with convex boundary. The lengths of these curves are bounded in terms of the length of $\partial M$, the diameter of $M$, and the area of $M$. We also prove the existence of a short, simple geodesic chord on any Riemannian 2-disk.</description>

We then use ideas from symplectic and Riemannian geometry to prove these generalized versions for smooth Jordan curves in the hyperbolic plane, and we prove a rectangular inscription theorem for smooth Jordan curves on the two sphere that do not intersect their antipodal.</description>

      <title>Positive paths in diffeomorphism groups of manifolds with a contact distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a cooriented contact manifold $(M,\xi)$, it is possible to define a notion of positivity on the group $\mathrm{Diff}(M)$ of diffeomorphisms of $M$, by looking at paths of diffeomorphisms that are positively transverse to the contact distribution $\xi$. We show that, in contrast to the analogous notion usually considered on the group of diffeomorphisms preserving $\xi$, positivity on $\mathrm{Diff}(M)$ is completely flexible. In particular, we show that for the standard contact structure on $\mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$ any two diffeomorphisms are connected by a positive path. This result generalizes to compactly supported diffeomorphisms on a large class of contact manifolds. As an application we answer a question about Legendrians in thermodynamic phase space posed by Entov, Polterovich and Ryzhik in the context of thermodynamic processes.</description>

      <title>The Smooth Power of the "Neandertal Method"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe an algorithmic method to transform a Euclidean wallpaper pattern into a Circle Limit-style picture \`a la Escher. The design goals for the method are to be mathematically sound, aesthetically pleasing and fast to compute. It turns out that a certain class of conformal maps is particularly well-suited for the problem. Moreover, in our specific application, a very simple method, sometimes jokingly called the "Neandertal Method" for its almost brutal simplicity, proves to be highly efficient, as it can easily be parallelized to be run on the GPU, unlike many other approaches.</description>

      <title>The $\mathcal{D}$-Geometric Hilbert Scheme -- Part I: Involutivity and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a moduli space of formally integrable and involutive ideal sheaves arising from systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) in the algebro-geometric setting, by introducing the $\mathcal{D}$-Hilbert and $\mathcal{D}$-Quot functors in the sense of Grothendieck and establishing their representability. Central to this construction is the notion of Spencer (semi-)stability, which presents an extension of classical stability conditions from gauge theory and complex geometry, and which provides the boundedness needed for our moduli problem. As an application, we show that for flat connections on compact K\"ahler manifolds, Spencer poly-stability of the associated PDE ideal is equivalent to the existence of a Hermitian-Yang-Mills metric. This result provides a refinement of the classical Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau correspondence, and identifies Spencer cohomology and stability as a unifying framework for geometric PDEs.</description>

      <title>Spectral networks for polynomial cubic differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cubic differentials and their spectral networks on Riemann surfaces, focusing on the polynomial case on the Riemann sphere. We introduce the notion of spectral core as the primary tool for our study, refining the classical notion of core in the theory of flat surfaces, and show that it controls the birthing process of spectral network trajectories. As an application, we completely characterize the polynomial cubic differentials having saddle connections or critical tripods when the degree $d$ is at most $3$; in particular, we obtain the relevant degenerations as the phase is varied and determine explicitly the wall-and-chamber structure. In this case, we obtain the BPS structure according to Gaiotto-Moore-Neitzke's algorithm, and verify that it satisfies the Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formula. In physics language, this corresponds to computing the BPS spectrum of a certain four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ quantum field theory, known as the $(A_{2},A_{d-1})$ generalized Argyres-Douglas theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the Ricci flow out of spaces with edge type conical singularities along a closed, embedded curve. Under the additional assumption that for each point of the curve, our space is locally modelled on the product of a fixed positively curved cone and a line, we show existence of a solution to Ricci flow $(M,g(t))$ for $t\in (0,T],$ which converges back to the singular space as $t\searrow 0$ in the pointed Gromov-Hausdorff topology. We also prove curvature estimates for the solution and, for edge points, we show that the tangent flow at these points is a positively curved expanding Ricci soliton solution crossed with a line.</description>

      <title>Almost Calabi-Yau with torsion 6-manifolds and the instanton condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is observed that on a compact almost complex Calabi-Yau with torsion (ACYT) 6-manifold with co-closed Lee form the curvature of the torsion connection is an $SU(3)$-instanton if and only if the torsion is parallel with respect to the torsion connection. The same conclusion holds for any (non necessarily compact) balanced ACYT 6-manifold. In particular, on a CYT 6-manifold the Strominger-Bismut connection is an $SU(3)$-instanton if and only if the torsion is parallel with respect to the Strominger-Bismut connection provided either the CYT 6-manifold is compact with co-closed Lee form or it is a balanced CYT 6-manifold.</description>

      <title>Marginally outer trapped tubes in de Sitter spacetime</title>

Abstract: We prove two results which are relevant for constructing marginally outer trapped tubes (MOTTs) in de Sitter spacetime. The first one holds more generally, namely for spacetimes satisfying the null convergence condition and containing a timelike conformal Killing vector with a "temporal function". We show that all marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTSs) in such a spacetime are unstable. This prevents application of standard results on the propagation of stable MOTSs to MOTTs. On the other hand, it was shown recently that, for every sufficiently high genus, there exists a smooth, complete family of CMC surfaces embedded in the round 3-sphere S3. This family connects a Lawson minimal surface with a doubly covered geodesic 2-sphere. We show by a simple scaling argument that this result translates to an existence proof for complete MOTTs with CMC sections in de Sitter spacetime. Moreover, the area of these sections increases strictly monotonically. We compare this result with an area law obtained before for holographic screens.</description>

      <title>An essential one sided boundary singularity for a $3$-dimensional area minimizing current in $\mathbb{R}^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a $3$-dimensional area minimizing current $T$ in $\mathbb{R}^5$ whose boundary contains a real analytic surface of multiplicity $2$ at which $T$ has a density $1$ essential boundary singularity with a flat tangent cone. This example shows that the boundary regularity theory we developed with Reinaldo Resende in another paper, which extends Allard's classical boundary regularity result to higher boundary multiplicity, is dimensionally sharp.
  The construction of $T$ relies on the prescription of boundary data with non-trivial topology, which makes it a flexible technique and gives rise to a wide family of singular examples.
  In order to understand the examples, we develop a boundary regularity theory for a class of area minimizing $m$-dimensional currents whose boundary consists of smooth $(m-1)$-dimensional surfaces with multiplicities meeting along an $(m-2)$-dimensional smooth submanifold.</description>

      <title>New chaos decomposition of Gaussian nodal volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the random variable defined by the volume of the zero set of a smooth Gaussian field, on a general Riemannian manifold possibly with boundary, a fundamental object in probability and geometry. We prove a new explicit formula for its Wiener-It\^o chaos decomposition that is notably simpler than existing alternatives and which holds in greater generality, without requiring the field to be compatible with the geometry of the manifold. A key advantage of our formulation is a significant reduction in the complexity of computing the variance of the nodal volume. Unlike the standard Hermite expansion, which requires evaluating the expectation of products of $2+2n$ Hermite polynomials, our approach reduces this task--in any dimension $n$--to computing the expectation of a product of just four Hermite polynomials. As a consequence, we establish a new exact formula for the variance, together with lower and upper bounds. Importantly, in contrast to previous results, our approach applies to highly non-isotropic situations, allowing the study of Riemannian random waves on arbitrary manifolds. By introducing two parameters associated to any Gaussian field: the frequency and the eccentricity, we quantify the deviation from the standard settings (e.g., spheres) and establish a quantitative version of Berry's cancellation phenomenon valid on all manifolds.</description>
