      <title>Observation and modeling of a geo-effective event observed on 2011 May 28 from the solar surface to 1au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive observational and modeling study of a geo-effective event with D_ST index of -80 nT observed on 2011 May 28 when a coronal hole was bordering an active region. We analyze HMI and EUV images and found that this event involved two filament eruptions ~8 hours apart from two different active region closed to each other. We produce 3D magnetic field configurations for the active regions that are consistent with the observations and employ numerical models to track the CME/ICME propagation up to 1\,au. From our, magnetic models we found that the nearby coronal hole reduced the stability threshold of the flux ropes, with axial flux values approximately three times lower than in comparable cases without coronal holes. A derivative analysis applied to STEREO coronagraph and OMNI database in situ data revealed no evidence of CME-CME interaction during the early stages of their evolution and identified distinct signatures of two CMEs, along with the interacting flow associated with the nearby coronal hole at 1 au. Moreover, we used hydrodynamic simulations constrained by remote sensing and in situ data to track the different structures in the solar wind. We found a good agreement between data and the models. Additionally, we found that the presence of the coronal hole may have suppressed interactions between CMEs, with the transients subsequently propagating along the solar wind streams emerging from the coronal hole.</description>

      <title>Buildup, Explosion, and Untwisting of a Solar Active Region Jet Observed with Solar Orbiter, IRIS, and SDO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present detailed analysis of an active region coronal jet accompanying a minifilament eruption that is fully captured and well-resolved in high spatial resolution 174A coronal images from Solar Orbiters Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI). The active region jet is simultaneously observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). An erupting minifilament is rooted at the edge of an active region where mixed-polarity magnetic flux is present. Minority-polarity positive flux merges and cancels with the active regions dominant negative flux at an average rate of 1019 Mx/hr, building a minifilament-holding flux rope and triggering its eruption. The eruption shows a slow rise followed by a fast rise, akin to large-scale filament eruptions. EUI images and Mg II k spectra, displaying simultaneously blueshifts and redshifts at the opposite edges of the spire, indicate counterclockwise untwisting of the jet spire. This jet is the clearest, most comprehensively observed active-region jet with this instrument set, displaying striking similarities with quiet Sun and coronal hole jets. Its magnetic, thermal, and kinetic
  energies suggest a significant contribution to local coronal heating. We conclude that magnetic flux cancelation builds a minifilament-carrying twisted flux rope and also eventually triggers the flux ropes eruption that makes the coronal jet, in line with our recent results on the buildup and explosion of solar coronal jets in quiet Sun and coronal holes. That is, this active region jet clearly works the same way as the vast majority of quiet Sun and coronal hole jets.</description>

      <title>Empirical Optimization of the Source-Surface Height in the PFSS extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential field source surface (PFSS) method is a widely used magnetic field extrapolation technique in the space weather community. The only free parameter in the PFSS method is the source-surface height ($R_{\rm SS}$), beyond which all field lines are open. Although $R_{\rm SS}$ is known to vary with solar activity, there is no consensus on how to determine it for a given surface magnetic field distribution. In this study, we investigate the nature of $R_{\rm SS}$ using a long-period (2006-2023) data, covering two solar minima and one maximum. We adopt ADAPT-GONG magnetograms and determine $R_{\rm SS}$ by matching the open flux estimated from observations at 1 au with that calculated using the PFSS method. Our analysis reveals that $R_{\rm SS}$ increases slightly after the solar minima and around the solar maximum, and that it can be characterized by both the mean unsigned photospheric magnetic field strength and the dipolarity parameter $f_{\rm dip}$, defined as $f_{\rm dip} = B_{\rm dip}^2/(B_{\rm dip}^2 + B_{\rm quad}^2 + B_{\rm oct}^2)$, with $B_{\rm dip}$, $B_{\rm quad}$, and $B_{\rm oct}$ denoting the magnitudes of dipolar, quadrupolar, and octupolar components of photospheric radial magnetic field, respectively. Our results suggest that $R_{\rm SS}$ does not exhibit a simple monotonic dependence on the solar activity and must be determined by properly considering both surface magnetic field strength and global field structure.</description>

      <title>Abundance Pattern Fitting with Bayesian Inference: Constraining First Stars' Properties and Their Explosion Mechanism with Extremely Metal-poor Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor stars preserve a fossil record of the Universe's earliest chemical enrichment by the supernova explosions from the evolution of first generation of stars, also referred to as Population III (or Pop III). By applying Bayesian inference to the analysis of abundance patterns of these ancient stars, this study presents a systematic investigation into the properties and explosion mechanism of Pop III stars. We apply NLTE corrections to enhance the reliability of abundance measurements, which significantly reduces the discrepancies in abundances between observations and theoretical yields for odd-Z elements, such as Na and Al. Our Bayesian framework also enables the incorporation of explodability and effectively mitigates biases introduced by varying resolutions across different supernova model grids. In addition to confirming a top-heavy ($\alpha=0.54$) initial mass function for massive Pop III stars, we derive a robust mass--energy relation ($E\propto M^2$) of the first supernovae. These findings demonstrate that stellar abundance analysis provides a powerful and independent approach for probing early supernova physics and the fundamental nature of the first stars.</description>

      <title>Accessing the fine temporal scale of EUV brightenings and their quasi-periodic pulsations: 1 second cadence observations by Solar Orbiter/EUI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small scale extreme ultraviolet (EUV) transient brightenings are observationally abundant and critically important to investigate. Determining whether they share the same physical mechanisms as larger scale flares would have significant implications for the coronal heating problem. A recent study has revealed that quasi periodic pulsations (QPPs), a common feature in both solar and stellar flares, may also be present in EUV brightenings in the quiet Sun (QS). We aim to characterise the properties of EUV brightenings and their associated QPPs in both QS and active regions (ARs) using unprecedented 1 s cadence observations from Solar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI). We applied an automated detection algorithm to analyse statistical properties of EUV brightenings. QPPs were identified using complementary techniques optimised for both stationary and non stationary signals, including a Fourier based method, ensemble empirical mode decomposition, and wavelet analysis. Over 500000 and 300000 brightenings were detected in ARs and QS regions, respectively. Brightenings with lifetimes shorter than 3 s were detected, demonstrating the importance of high temporal resolution. QPP periods span from 5 to over 500 s and show similar distributions between AR and QS. We found a consistent power law scaling, with a weak correlation and a large spread, between QPP period and lifetime in EUV brightenings, solar, and stellar flares. The results support the interpretation that EUV brightenings may represent a small scale manifestation of the same physical mechanisms driving larger solar and stellar flares. Furthermore, the similarity in the statistical properties of EUV brightenings and their associated QPPs between AR and QS regions suggests that the underlying generation mechanisms may not strongly depend on the large scale magnetic environment.</description>

      <title>An interferometric mid-infrared study of the eruptive star binary Z CMa with MATISSE/VLTI. I. Imaging the protoplanetary disks during the 2023 outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mid-infrared (MIR) emitting regions of the individual protoplanetary disks in the binary system Z CMa are resolved by MATISSE/VLTI. The observations were obtained during a serendipitous large outburst of the HBe star that lasted more than 100 days, while the FUor companion is presumed to be in quiescence. The size of the MIR-emitting disk region of the more massive HBe star increases toward longer wavelengths from $&lt;14$ mas at 3.5$\mu m$ to $\ll 50$ mas at 11.5$\mu m$ . The lack of substructures in the HBe disk might suggest that it is a continuous disk; however, this could be due to observational constraints. We also note a radial variation of the silicate absorption feature over the disk, where the optical depth increases inwards of $&lt;$40~au radii. This contradicts the scenario of a carved, dusty cocoon surrounding the HBe star. In the case of the less massive FUor companion, the MIR-emitting region is much smaller with an angular size $\leq$15 mas (or else a physical radius $&lt;9$ au) in all bands, suggesting a compact disk. Both disks are aligned within uncertainties, and their orientation agrees with that of the known jets. Furthermore, MATISSE data place the binary's separation at $117.88 \pm 0.73$ mas and a position angle of $139.16^o\,\pm\,0.29^o$ east of north. Our estimates for the orbital elements gave an eccentric orbit ($e\sim0.17$) with a moderate inclination ($i\sim 66$\degr). The derived total mass is $M_{\rm total} = 16.4^{+2.1}_{-2.3}$ M$_\odot$, while the period is approximately 950 years. Our MATISSE imaging of the Herbig disk during outburst indicates a temperature gradient for the disk, while imaging of the FUor companion's disk corroborates previous studies showing that FUor disks are rather compact in the MIR. We cannot infer any misalignment between the MATISSE results and earlier ALMA/JVLA data, nor can we infer any influence from the alleged flyby event.</description>

      <title>An in-depth study of brown dwarfs with TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of a deficit of brown dwarfs (BDs) in close orbit around main-sequence stars is one of the most intriguing questions in stellar physics. This so-called BD desert may result from the transition between two different dominant formation processes occurring for different mass regimes. While the BD mass derived from radial-velocity measurements helps confirm the nature of the analyzed objects, the BD radius obtained from transits is important to better constrain the BD age, as BDs are believed to contract with age. Such objects with well-constrained parameters, although in small number, are of prime interest for deeper investigations of BD structure and chemical composition. The present document aims at presenting the first results of a search for BD transits among a sample of approximately 3300 host star candidates observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite during Cycle 6.</description>

      <title>Exploring Complexity Measures for Analysis of Solar Wind Structures and Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use statistical complexity and information theory metrics to study structure within solar wind time series. We explore this using entropy-complexity and information planes, where the measure for entropy is formed using either permutation entropy or the degree distribution of a horizontal visibility graph (HVG). The entropy is then compared to the Jensen complexity (Jensen-Shannon complexity plane) and Fisher information measure (Fisher-Shannon information plane), formed both from permutations and the HVG approach. Additionally we characterise the solar wind time series by studying the properties of the HVG degree distribution. Four types of solar wind intervals have been analysed, namely fast streams, slow streams, magnetic clouds and sheath regions, all of which have distinct origins and interplanetary characteristics. Our results show that, overall, different metrics give similar results but Fisher-Shannon, which gives a more local measure of complexity, leads to a larger spread of values in the entropy-complexity plane. Magnetic cloud intervals stood out in all approaches, in particular when analysing the magnetic field magnitude. Differences between solar wind types (except for magnetic clouds) were typically more distinct for larger time lags, suggesting universality in fluctuations for small scales. The fluctuations within the solar wind time series were generally found to be stochastic, in agreement with previous studies. The use of information theory tools in the analysis of solar wind time series can help to identify structures and provide insight into their origin and formation.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Reconstruction and Propagation of an Asymmetric Flux-rope Coronal Mass Ejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the characterization of a coronal mass ejection (CME) observed on 22 October 2003 by the LASCO-C2 and C3 coronagraphs over a time interval of 6 hours. This CME clearly appears as an asymmetric flux-rope in self-similar expansion and in spite of having a single vantage point, this relatively simple morphology and the geometry of the observations allow us to reconstruct its shape and its trajectory. The images are first processed in order to remove most of the background or foreground coronal structures (essentially streamers) which are superimposed on the CME. The analysis is based on forward modeling of an asymmetric structure where the plasma is homogeneously distributed in a thin shell and synthetic images are calculated from Thomson scattering by the electrons. They are best fitted to the images to determine the exact shape of the flux rope, and to track its evolution characterized by a radial propagation in self-similar expansion. The analysis supports the forward propagation (over the backward one) characterized by constant accelerations of 76 and 46 m/sec^2 for the front and rear parts of the CME, respectively. The respective velocities at 20 Rsun reach 2000 and 1100 km/s, and its mass unbiased by projection effects is estimated at 1.7x10^16 g. Altogether, these are quite exceptionally large values among CMEs and imply a very energetic event. No erupting event could be identified at or near the calculated initial location of the CME. It lies 25{\deg} west of the active region NOAA 10484, the site of contemporary, violent, and recurrent solar eruptions (the ``Halloween event'') and a putative connection would require a strong deflection over a very short path. Therefore, the origin of this CME remains unclear.</description>

      <title>Kinetic collisionless model of the solar transition region and corona with spatially intermittent heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a three-dimensional kinetic model of the solar transition region and corona in which the plasma above the chromosphere is collisionless and embedded in a uniform magnetic field. Heating occurs intermittently at discrete locations on the chromospheric surface, modeled through a surface coarse-graining procedure that produces non-thermal boundary conditions for the Vlasov equation. The resulting stationary distribution functions generate suprathermal particle populations and naturally lead to a temperature inversion via gravitational filtering, without any local coronal heating. The model reproduces realistic temperature and density profiles with a thin transition region and a hot corona, consistent with solar observations. These results demonstrate that the spatial intermittency of heating at the chromospheric interface is sufficient to account for the formation of the transition region and the high-temperature corona.</description>

      <title>Near-continuous tracking of solar active region NOAA 13664 over three solar rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic flux emergence and decay in the Sun span from days to months. However, their tracking is typically limited to about half a solar rotation when relying on single-vantage-point observations. Combining observations from both the Earth-facing and far side of the Sun, we monitored the magnetic and coronal evolution and characterised the non-potentiality of one of the most complex and eruptive regions of the past two decades, over more than three full solar rotations. We used photospheric magnetograms and EUV filtergrams from the Solar Orbiter and the Solar Dynamics Observatory along with flare detections from the GOES and the STIX instrument on board the Solar Orbiter. All images were deprojected into a common coordinate system and merged into a unified dataset. We tracked the evolution of magnetic flux and EUV emission and computed magnetic field parameters from the line-of-sight magnetograms to quantify the region's non-potentiality. We identified the region's initial emergence and followed its evolution through to its decay. The region developed through successive flux emergence episodes over a period of 20 days, reached its peak complexity one month after the first emergence, and gradually decayed over the subsequent two months. Unlike many complex regions, it consistently maintained high levels of non-potentiality for most of its lifetime, sustaining equally strong flaring activity. The derived time series of non-potentiality parameters, the first of their kind, far exceeded the typical 14-day window imposed by solar rotation and were remarkably consistent, exhibiting strong correlation with the flaring activity of the region. Multi-vantage-point observations can significantly improve our understanding of how magnetic flux emerges, evolves, and drives solar activity, beyond the two-week limit imposed by solar rotation on observations along the Sun-Earth line.</description>

      <title>Dormant BH candidates from Gaia DR3 summary diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rigorous identification of candidates for dormant black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs) in binaries using summary statistics from Gaia DR3, rather than full orbital solutions. Although Gaia astrometric orbits have already revealed a small sample of compact object binaries, many systems remain undetected due to stringent quality cuts imposed on the published orbits. Using a forward-modelling framework that simulates Gaia observables, in particular the renormalised unit weight error (ruwe) and radial velocity (RV) scatter, we infer posterior distributions for companion mass and orbital period via MCMC sampling, marginalising over nuisance orbital parameters. We validate our approach by comparing the predicted masses and periods against full orbit solutions from DR3, and by successfully recovering known compact object binaries as promising candidates. The method is best suited for systems with red giant primaries, which have more reliable Gaia RV scatter and a light centroid more likely dominated by one component, compared to main-sequence stars. And they are less likely to be triples with short-period inner binaries, which produce confounding signatures. We apply the method to three million giants and identify 556 systems with best-fit companion masses $\gtrsim 3\,M_\odot$. Recovery simulations suggest our selection method is substantially more sensitive than the DR3 non-single-star catalogue, particularly for binaries with periods below 1 year and above $\sim 6$ years. These candidates represent promising targets for spectroscopic follow-up and Gaia DR4 analysis to confirm the presence of compact objects. Candidate main-sequence stars with massive companions face a larger set of confounding effects. Therefore, we present an analogous catalogue of 279 additional `main sequence' candidates only as an appendix.</description>

      <title>The inertial dip as a window on the convective core dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma Dor stars are ideal targets for studies of the innermost dynamical properties of stars, due to their rich frequency spectrum of gravito-inertial modes propagating in the radiative envelope. Recent studies found that these modes could couple at the core-to-envelope interface with pure inertial modes in their sub-inertial regime, forming the so-called inertial dip in the period-spacing pattern of these stars. The inertial dip, as formed by core modes, stands out as a unique probe of core properties. We aim in this work to explore the effect of core magnetism on its structure, property of key relevance in modern stellar physics. We describe the outlines of our model and the geometry of the considered field. We give the coupling equation and the variation of the dip shape and location with increasing magnetic contrast between the core and the envelope. We compare our findings to the ones obtained in a hydrodynamical, differentially-rotating case. We show hints at potentially lifting the degeneracy between the signatures of core-to-envelope differential rotation and core magnetic fields. Together, these two cases can be considered as an exploration of different magnetic regimes potentially reached in the core of gamma Dor stars.</description>

      <title>The influence of rotation and metallicity on the explodability of massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the late stages of massive stellar evolution, failed supernovae (FSN) may form through core-collapse processes. The traditional evaluation criterion $\xi_{2.5}$ $=$ 0.45, primarily established using non-rotating progenitor models, suffers from significant inaccuracies when applied to rotating pre-supernova systems. The effects of metallicity and rotation on the explodability landscapes of massive stars lack robust quantification. We aim to investigate how rotation and metallicity influence the explodability of massive stars. We investigate how rotation and metallicity affect stellar explodability using MESA simulations with initial rotational velocities of $0$, $300$, and $600~\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$ at three metallicities ($Z_{\odot}$, $1/10,Z_{\odot}$, $1/50,Z_{\odot}$). Core-collapse phases are simulated with GR1D to determine critical heating efficiencies. Our results yield revised $\xi_{2.5}$ criteria: 0.45 for non-rotating models; 0.48 for $300~\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$; 0.47 for $600~\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$ at solar metallicity; and 0.59 for low-metallicity models. Chemically homogeneous evolution in rapidly rotating low-metallicity stars significantly raises the compactness limit for successful explosions and narrows the zero-age main sequence mass range for failed supernovae. Rotation substantially affects the explodability of low-metallicity massive stars, underscoring the importance of incorporating rotational effects in models of core-collapse supernova progenitors.</description>

      <title>StarEmbed: Benchmarking Time Series Foundation Models on Astronomical Observations of Variable Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are increasingly being adopted as highly-capable general-purpose time series representation learners. Although their training corpora are vast, they exclude astronomical time series data. Observations of stars produce peta-scale time series with unique challenges including irregular sampling and heteroskedasticity. We introduce StarEmbed, the first public benchmark for rigorous and standardized evaluation of state-of-the-art TSFMs on stellar time series observations (``light curves''). We benchmark on three scientifically-motivated downstream tasks: unsupervised clustering, supervised classification, and out-of-distribution source detection. StarEmbed integrates a catalog of expert-vetted labels with multi-variate light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, yielding ~40k hand-labeled light curves spread across seven astrophysical classes. We evaluate the zero-shot representation capabilities of three TSFMs (MOIRAI, Chronos, Chronos-Bolt) and a domain-specific transformer (Astromer) against handcrafted feature extraction, the long-standing baseline in the astrophysics literature. Our results demonstrate that these TSFMs, especially the Chronos models, which are trained on data completely unlike the astronomical observations, can outperform established astrophysics-specific baselines in some tasks and effectively generalize to entirely new data. In particular, TSFMs deliver state-of-the-art performance on our out-of-distribution source detection benchmark. With the first benchmark of TSFMs on astronomical time series data, we test the limits of their generalization and motivate a paradigm shift in time-domain astronomy from using task-specific, fully supervised pipelines toward adopting generic foundation model representations for the analysis of peta-scale datasets from forthcoming observatories.</description>

      <title>Comparing LSTM-Based Sequence-to-Sequence Forecasting Strategies for 24-Hour Solar Proton Flux Profiles Using GOES Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar Proton Events (SPEs) cause significant radiation hazards to satellites, astronauts, and technological systems. Accurate forecasting of their proton flux time profiles is crucial for early warnings and mitigation. This paper explores deep learning sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models based on Long Short-Term Memory networks to predict 24-hour proton flux profiles following SPE onsets. We used a dataset of 40 well-connected SPEs (1997-2017) observed by NOAA GOES, each associated with a &gt;=M-class western-hemisphere solar flare and undisturbed proton flux profiles. Using 4-fold stratified cross-validation, we evaluate seq2seq model configurations (varying hidden units and embedding dimensions) under multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only input vs. combined proton+X-ray input, (ii) original flux data vs. trend-smoothed data, and (iii) autoregressive vs. one-shot forecasting. Our major results are as follows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than autoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative approaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform proton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or reverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances the performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray channel. Fourth, while models trained on trendsmoothed data perform best on average, the best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting that architectural choices can sometimes outweigh the benefits of data preprocessing.</description>

      <title>Infall Explains the Disk Kinematics of AB Aur Without Gravitational Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Late-stage infall onto protoplanetary disks can produce large scale spiral arms. In this paper we used 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics and radiative transfer simulations to study the kinematic perturbations induced in disks by infalling material. We found that deviations from Keplerian rotation are predominantly in the radial and vertical velocity components, spatially correlated with spiral arms in the gas surface density. The infall produces observable wiggles in the channel maps, analogous to those produce by the gravitational instability (GI), along with large-scale arcs and filaments. GI induced spiral arms produce radial velocity perturbations that point towards the center of the spiral arm owing to their higher self-gravity. We found a similar signature from infall-induced spiral arms, despite not including self-gravity in our simulation. Our study suggests that recent evidence of GI in the kinematics of the disk around AB Aur may instead be due to the observed infall, without the need for invoking GI.</description>

Abstract: Purpose To investigate synthesis of nuclei in pycnonuclear reactions in dense medium of neutron stars on the basis of understanding, how the compound nucleus is formed during collision of two nuclei. To implement microscopic formulation of nuclear interactions and fusion in pycnonuclear reactions in dense medium. Methods (1) Nuclei synthesis in pycnonuclear reaction in dense medium of neutron star is investigated in the folding approximation of the cluster model. (2) Formation of compound nucleus in dense medium is studied with the method of Multiple Internal Reflections. Results (1) Wave functions of resonance states of \isotope[24]{Mg} are determined by interaction of two \isotope[12]{C} nuclei. (2) Clear maxima of probability of formation of compound nucleus in dense stellar medium are established at first time. (3) Difference between quasibound energies for potential of Woods-Saxon type and folding potentials with the shell-model approximation for wave functions is essential. (4) Formation of the compound nucleus is much more probable in the quasibound states than in states of zero-point vibrations. (5) Only the first quasibound energies for $\isotope[12]{C} + \isotope[12]{C}$ are smaller than the barrier maximums. At these energies compound nuclear system has barrier which prevents its decay going through tunneling phenomenon. This is the new excited nucleus \isotope[24]{Mg} synthesised in the neutron star. \item[Conclusions] Cluster approach with folding potential provides significant modification of picture of formation of compound nucleus, previously obtained concerning the potential of Woods-Saxon type. The highest precision is provided by the folding potential, created by semi-realistic nucleon-nucleon potential and shell-model description of the internal structure of interacting $p$-shell nuclei.</description>

Abstract: Collision broadening by molecular hydrogen of sodium and potassium is one of the major broadening mechanisms in the atmospheres of brown dwarf stars and exoplanets at an effective temperature of about 1000K. The accurate computation of line profiles from collision broadening at high density requires use of a Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function inside the model atmosphere code. We strongly warn that use of Lorentzian profiles at a high perturber density neglects radiation during close collisions and may lead to erroneous conclusions.</description>

      <title>Radio emission from beyond the light cylinder in millisecond pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A striking aspect of the radio profiles of many millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is that they consist of components separated from each other by regions lacking in emission. We devise a technique for determining "disjoint" from "contiguous" components and show that 35% of MSPs have disjoint components as opposed to only 3% of the slow pulsar population. We surmise that the pulsars with these disjoint components show evidence for both emission above the polar cap and from the current sheet beyond the light cylinder, co-located with gamma-ray emission. For a sub-class of radio MSPs only the light cylinder emission is being observed. It is our contention that almost all of the current population of gamma-ray MSPs show evidence for co-located radio emission. A simple geometric explanation allows the presence (or not) of light cylinder emission and the relationship (or not) between the gamma-ray and radio profiles to be determined. The light-cylinder components have frequently very high polarization and typically flat position-angle traverses thus helping to explain the difficulties in determining the geometry of MSPs. In cases where the geometry can be determined the values broadly align with expectations. If our picture is correct, the beaming fraction of radio MSPs is higher than previously thought and a mechanism is required to produce coherent radio emission far from the stellar surface. This has implications for our understanding of the populations of radio-loud and radio-quiet rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, and could relate to the timing stability of some of these sources.</description>

Abstract: The ${}^{\mathsf{12}}\mathsf{C}(\mathsf{p},\gamma)$ reaction cross section is currently under investigation in the low-background environment of the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA). It is being studied using different types of solid targets, and employing two complementary detection techniques: HPGe spectroscopy and activation counting. To reduce systematic uncertainties, targets have been accurately characterized and their degradation under the intense beam of the LUNA-400 accelerator monitored. We present the experimental techniques and the corresponding analyses used to extract the reaction cross section.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Fields in the Bones of the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars primarily form in galactic spiral arms within dense, filamentary molecular clouds. The largest and most elongated of these molecular clouds are referred to as ``bones," which are massive, velocity-coherent filaments (lengths ~20 to &gt;100 pc, widths ~1-2 pc) that run approximately parallel and in close proximity to the Galactic plane. While these bones have been generally well characterized, the importance and structure of their magnetic fields (B-fields) remain largely unconstrained. Through the SOFIA Legacy program FIELDMAPS, we mapped the B-fields of 10 bones in the Milky Way. We found that their B-fields are varied, with no single preferred alignment along the entire spine of the bones. At higher column densities, the spines of the bones are more likely to align perpendicularly to the B-fields, although this is not ubiquitous, and the alignment shows no strong correlation with the locations of identified young stellar objects. We estimated the B-field strengths across the bones and found them to be ~30-150 $\mu$G at pc scales. Despite the generally low virial parameters, the B-fields are strong compared to the local gravity, suggesting that B-fields play a significant role in resisting global collapse. Moreover, the B-fields may slow and guide gas flow during dissipation. Recent star formation within the bones may be due to high-density pockets at smaller scales, which could have formed before or simultaneously with the bones.</description>

      <title>Limits on the Axion-Photon Coupling from Chandrayaan-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) have gained immense attention in searches for beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics. Experiments searching for axions leverage their predicted couplings to Standard Model (SM) particles to look for observable signals. Though weak, these couplings allow axions to be produced abundantly in the interiors of stars such as the Sun. Once created, axions can escape the Sun and while passing through the solar atmosphere, oscillate into photons in the magnetic field producing x-rays. For the first time, we used data from the observation of soft x-rays from the quiet Sun during the 2019-20 solar minimum by the solar x-ray monitor (XSM), onboard India's Chandrayaan-2 lunar exploration mission, to constrain the coupling of axions to photons ($g_{a \gamma \gamma}$). Using the latest models of the solar atmosphere to calculate the magnetic field and plasma frequency, we constrain $g_{a \gamma \gamma} \lesssim (0.47\,-\,2.2) \times 10^{-10}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at 95% confidence level for axion masses $m_a \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-4}$eV.</description>

      <title>Mass loading of outflows from evolving Young Massive Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback from Young Massive Clusters (YMCs) is an important driver of galaxy evolution. In the first few Myr, mechanical feedback is dominated by collective effects of the massive stellar winds in the YMC. The mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities of these stars change by orders of magnitude over pre-SN timescales as the massive stars evolve, and mass-loss rates of Cool Supergiant (CSG) stars in particular are uncertain by a factor $\sim~20$ or more. In this work we perform a first study of the time evolution of average cluster wind velocity $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ as a function of stellar metallicity $Z$, assuming single star evolution. We also check the validity of assuming Wolf-Rayet stars dominate the feedback effects of a YMC, as often done when interpreting X-ray and $\gamma$-ray observations, and test how sensitive $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ is to current uncertainties in mass-loss rates. We use pySTARBURST99 to calculate integrated properties of YMCs for $Z$ in the range of $0.0004-0.02$, representing a range of environments from IZw18 to the Galactic Centre. We find that $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ drops off rapidly for sub-LMC $Z$, and we recommend a value of $500-1000\,~\textrm{km~s}^{-1}$ be used in this regime. We show accounting only for WR stars can overestimate $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ by $500-2000\,~\textrm{km~s}^{-1}$ at $Z \geq Z_\text{LMC}$. We also find that different RSG mass-loss assumptions can change the inferred $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ by $\sim1000\,~\textrm{km~s}^{-1}$, highlighting the need for improved observational constraints for RSGs in YMCs.</description>

Abstract: We present the first derivation of a stellar flare temperature profile from single-band photometry. Stellar flare DWF030225.574-545707.45129 was detected in 2015 by the Dark Energy Camera as part of the Deeper, Wider, Faster Programme. The brightness ($\Delta m_g = -6.12$) of this flare, combined with the high air mass ($1.45 \lesssim X \lesssim 1.75$) and blue filter (DES $g$, 398-548 nm) in which it was observed, provided ideal conditions to measure the zenith-ward apparent motion of the source due to differential chromatic refraction (DCR) and, from that, infer the effective temperature of the event. We model the flare's spectral energy distribution as a blackbody to produce the constraints on flare temperature and geometric properties derived from single-band photometry. We additionally demonstrate how simplistic assumptions on the flaring spectrum, as well as on the evolution of flare geometry, can result in solutions that overestimate effective temperature. Exploiting DCR enables studying chromatic phenomena with ground-based astrophysical surveys and stellar flares on M-dwarfs are a particularly enticing target for such studies due to their ubiquity across the sky, and the heightened color contrast between their red quiescent photospheres and the blue flare emission. Our novel method will enable similar temperature constraints for large sample of objects in upcoming photometric surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>Chroma+ model stellar surface intensities: Spherical formal solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We announce V. 2025-08-08 of the Chroma+ suite of stellar atmosphere and spectrum modelling codes for fast, approximate, effectively platform-independent stellar spectrum synthesis, written in a number of free well-supported programming languages. The Chroma+ suite now computes the emergent surface intensity and flux distributions and the hydrostatic pressure structure assuming a spherical atmosphere rather than local flatness by implementing the analytic formal solution of the 1D spherical radiative transfer equation of Chapman (1966} based on an integration factor. We present our adaptation and discretization of the solution and demonstrate the resulting impact of our sphericity treatment on a number of computed observables, including exo-planet transit light-curves. All codes are available from the OpenStars www site: www.ap.smu.ca/OpenStars.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Recoil and Suppression of Super Massive Black Hole Seeds in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of gravitational-wave (GW) recoil on the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe. Forming 10^9 Solar Mass SMBHs by z=6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli2007,Lousto2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Population III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by approximately 20-30% by z=6 and creates a population of off-nuclear (``wandering'') BHs amounting to a few percent of the total. Observable consequences include spatial offsets approximately 0.1'' and line-of-sight velocity shifts approximately 10^2-10^3 km\s in a few-percent of high-redshift quasars.
