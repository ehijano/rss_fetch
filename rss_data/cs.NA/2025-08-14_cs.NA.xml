      <title>A tensor-based dynamic mode decomposition based on the $\star_{\boldsymbol{M}}$-product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a data-driven method for estimating the dynamics of a discrete dynamical system. This paper proposes a tensor-based approach to DMD for applications in which the states can be viewed as tensors. Specifically, we use the $\star_{\boldsymbol{M}}$-product framework for tensor decompositions which we demonstrate offers excellent compression compared to matrix-based methods and can be implemented in a computationally efficient manner. We show how the proposed approach is connected to the traditional DMD and physics-informed DMD frameworks. We give a computational framework for computing the tensor-based DMD and detail the computational costs. We also give a randomized algorithm that enables efficient $\star_{\boldsymbol{M}}$-DMD computations in the streaming setting. The numerical results show that the proposed method achieves equal or better accuracy for the same storage compared to the standard DMD on these examples and is more efficient to compute.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Alternating Anderson Acceleration Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a generalized alternating Anderson acceleration method, a periodic scheme composed of $t$ fixed-point iteration steps, interleaved with $s$ steps of Anderson acceleration with window size $m$, to solve linear and nonlinear problems. This allows flexibility to use different combinations of fixed-point iteration and Anderson iteration. We present a convergence analysis of the proposed scheme for accelerating the Richardson iteration in the linear case, with a focus on specific parameter choices of interest. Specifically, we prove convergence of the proposed method under contractive fixed-point iteration and provide a sufficient condition for convergence when the Richardson iteration matrix is diagonalizable and noncontractive. To demonstrate the broader applicability of our proposed method, we use it to accelerate Jacobi iteration, Picard iteration, gradient descent, and the alternating direction method of multipliers in solving partial differential equations and nonlinear, nonsmooth optimization problems. The numerical results illustrate that the proposed scheme is more efficient than the existing windowed Anderson acceleration and alternating Anderson ($s=1$) in terms of iteration number and CPU time for careful choice of parameters $m, s, t$.</description>

      <title>SSBE-PINN: A Sobolev Boundary Scheme Boosting Stability and Accuracy in Elliptic/Parabolic PDE Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), yet they often fail to achieve accurate convergence in the H1 norm, especially in the presence of boundary approximation errors. In this work, we propose a novel method called Sobolev-Stable Boundary Enforcement (SSBE), which redefines the boundary loss using Sobolev norms to incorporate boundary regularity directly into the training process. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that SSBE ensures bounded H1 error via a stability guarantee and derive generalization bounds that characterize its robustness under finite-sample regimes. Extensive numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear PDEs, including Poisson, heat, and elliptic problems, show that SSBE consistently outperforms standard PINNs in terms of both relative L2 and H1 errors, even in high-dimensional settings. The proposed approach offers a principled and practical solution for improving gradient fidelity and overall solution accuracy in neural network based PDE solvers.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Lagrangian scheme on embedded manifolds using generalized local polynomial reproductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze rates of uniform convergence for a class of high-order semi-Lagrangian schemes for first-order, time-dependent partial differential equations on embedded submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^d$ (including advection equations on surfaces) by extending the error analysis of Falcone and Ferretti. A central requirement in our analysis is a remapping operator that achieves both high approximation orders and strong stability, a combination that is challenging to obtain and of independent interest. For this task, we propose a novel mesh-free remapping operator based on $\ell_1$ minimizing generalized polynomial reproduction, which uses only point values and requires no additional geometric information from the manifold (such as access to tangent spaces or curvature). Our framework also rigorously addresses the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations on manifolds via projection methods. We include numerical experiments that support the theoretical results and also suggest some new directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Product Of Exponentials (POE) Splines on Lie-Groups: Limitations, Extensions, and Application to SO(3) and SE(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods for constructing splines and Bezier curves on a Lie group G involve repeated products of exponentials deduced from local geodesics, w.r.t. a Riemannian metric, or rely on general polynomials. Moreover, each of these local curves is supposed to start at the identity of $G$. Both assumptions may not reflect the actual curve to be interpolated. This paper pursues a different approach to construct splines on $G$. Local curves are expressed as solutions of the Poisson equation on G. Therewith, the local interpolations satisfies the boundary conditions while respecting the geometry of $G$. A $k$th-order approximation of the solutions gives rise to a $k$th-order product of exponential (POE) spline. Algorithms for constructing 3rd- and 4th-order splines are derived from closed form expressions for the approximate solutions. Additionally, spline algorithms are introduced that allow prescribing a vector field the curve must follow at the interpolation points. It is shown that the established algorithms, where $k$th-order POE-splines are constructed by concatenating local curves starting at the identity, cannot exactly reconstruct a $k$th-order motion. To tackle this issue, the formulations are extended by allowing for local curves between arbitrary points, rather than curves emanating from the identity. This gives rise to a global $k$th-order spline with arbitrary initial conditions. Several examples are presented, in particular the shape reconstruction of slender rods modeled as geometrically non-linear Cosserat rods.</description>

      <title>On The Eventual Periodicity of Fractional Order Dispersive Wave Equations Using RBFs and Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research work, let us focus on the construction of numerical scheme based on radial basis functions finite difference (RBF-FD) method combined with the Laplace transform for the solution of fractional order dispersive wave equations. The numerical scheme is then applied to examine the eventual periodicity of the proposed model subject to the periodic boundary conditions. The implementation of proposed technique for high order fractional and integer type nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) is beneficial because this method is local in nature, therefore it yields and resulted in sparse differentiation matrices instead of full and dense matrices. Only small dimensions of linear systems of equations are to be solved for every center in the domain and hence this procedure is more reliable and efficient to solve large scale physical and engineering problems in complex domain. Laplace transform is utilized for obtaining the equivalent time-independent equation in Laplace space and also valuable to handle time-fractional derivatives in the Caputo sense. Application of Laplace transform avoids the time steeping procedure which commonly encounters the time instability issues. The solution to the transformed model is then obtained by computing the inversion of Laplace transform with an appropriate contour in a complex space, which is approximated by trapezoidal rule with high accuracy. Also since the Laplace transform operator is linear, it cannot be used to transform non-linear terms therefore let us use a linearization approach and an appropriate iterative scheme. The proposed approach is tasted for some nonlinear fractional order KdV and Burgers equations. The capacity, high order accuracy and efficiency of our approach are demonstrated using examples and results</description>

      <title>RBF-FD Method for Some Dispersive Wave Equations and Their Eventual Periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we approximate the solution and also discuss the periodic behavior termed as eventual periodicity of solutions of (IBVPs) for some dispersive wave equations on a bounded domain corresponding to periodic forcing. The constructed numerical scheme is based on radial kernels and local in nature like finite difference method. The temporal variable is executed through RK4 scheme. Due to the local nature and sparse differentiation matrices our numerical scheme efficiently recovers the solution. The results achieved are validated and examined with other methods accessible in the literature.</description>

      <title>CutVEM: Conforming virtual element method on embedded domains with shape-agnostic element agglomeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The virtual element method (VEM) is a stabilized Galerkin method that is robust and accurate on general polygonal meshes. This feature makes it an appealing candidate for simulations involving meshes with embedded interfaces and evolving geometries. However, the method can yield poorly conditioned stiffness matrices in such scenarios due to meshes having cut cells. We propose a novel element agglomeration algorithm for the virtual element method to address this issue. The agglomeration algorithm renders the VEM robust over planar polygonal meshes, particularly on finite element meshes cut by immersed geometries. The algorithm relies on the element stability ratio, which we define using the extreme eigenvalues of the element stiffness matrix. The resulting element agglomeration criterion is free from nebulous polygon quality metrics and is defined independently of polygon shapes. The algorithm proceeds iteratively and element-wise to maximize the minimum element stability ratio, even at the expense of degrading elements with better ratios. Crucially, element agglomeration alters the number of elements, not the degree of freedom count. The resulting method, which we label as CutVEM, retains node locations of cut elements unchanged, and yields discretizations that conform to embedded interfaces. This, in turn, facilitates straightforward imposition of boundary conditions and interfacial constraints. Through detailed numerical experiments that sample varied element-interface intersections, we demonstrate that CutVEM enjoys dramatically improved condition numbers of global stiffness matrices over the VEM. Furthermore, simulations of prototypical heat conduction problems with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on domains with immersed geometries show that element agglomeration does not noticeably degrade solution accuracy and that CutVEM retains the VEM's optimal convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Optimally Accurate Numerical Algorithms for Stochastic Turbulent Flow Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first propose a filter-based continuous Ensemble Eddy Viscosity (EEV) model for stochastic turbulent flow problems. We then propose a generic algorithm for a family of fully discrete, grad-div regularized, efficient ensemble parameterized schemes for this model. The linearized Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) EEV generic algorithm shares a common coefficient matrix for each realization per time-step, but with different right-hand-side vectors, which reduces the computational cost and memory requirements to the order of solving deterministic flow problems. Two family members of the proposed time-stepping algorithm are analyzed and proven to be stable. It is found that one is first-order and the other is second-order accurate in time for any stable finite element pairs. Avoiding the discrete inverse inequality, the optimal convergence of both schemes is proven rigorously for both 2D and 3D problems. For appropriately large grad-div parameters, both schemes are unconditionally stable and allow weakly divergence-free elements. Several numerical tests are given for high expected Reynolds number ($\textbf{E}[Re]$) problems. The convergence rates are verified using manufactured solutions with $\textbf{E}[Re]=10^{3},10^{4},\;\text{and}\; 10^{5}$. For various high $\textbf{E}[Re]$, the schemes are implemented on benchmark problems which includes: A 2D channel flow over a unit step problem, a non-intrusive Stochastic Collocation Method (SCM) is used to examine the performance of the schemes on a 2D Regularized Lid Driven Cavity (RLDC) problem, and a 3D RLDC problem, and found them perform well.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear filtering based on density approximation and deep BSDE prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approximate Bayesian filter based on backward stochastic differential equations is introduced. It uses a nonlinear Feynman--Kac representation of the filtering problem and the approximation of an unnormalized filtering density using the well-known deep BSDE method and neural networks. The method is trained offline, which means that it can be applied online with new observations. A mixed a priori-a posteriori error bound is proved under an elliptic condition. The theoretical convergence rate is confirmed in two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Isogeometric multi-patch shell analysis using the Geometry + Simulation Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) bridges Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) by employing splines as a common basis for geometry and analysis. One of the advantages of IGA is in the realm of thin shell analysis: due to the arbitrary continuity of the spline basis, Kirchhoff-Love shells can be modeled without the need to introduce unknowns for the mid-plane rotations, leading to a reduction in the number of unknowns. In this paper, we provide the background of an implementation of Isogeometric Kirchhoff--Love shells within the Geometry + Simulation Modules (G+Smo). This paper accompanies multiple previous publications and elaborates on the design of the software used in these papers, rather than the novelty of the methods presented therein. The presented implementation provides patch coupling via penalty methods and unstructured splines, goal-oriented error estimators, several algorithms for structural analysis and advanced algorithms for the modeling of wrinkling in hyperelastic membranes. These methods are all contained in three new modules in G+Smo: a module for Kirchhoff-Love shells, a module for structural analysis, and a module for unstructured spline constructions. As motivated in this paper, the modules are implemented to be compatible with future developments. For example, by providing base implementations of material laws, by using black-box functions for the structural analysis module, or by providing a standardized approach for the implementation of unstructured spline constructions. Overall, this paper demonstrates that the new modules contribute to a versatile ecosystem for the modeling of multi-patch shell problems through fast off-the-shelf solvers with a simple interface, designed to be extended in future research.</description>

      <title>The Hu-Zhang element for linear elasticity on curved domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the Hu-Zhang element for linear elasticity problems to curved domains, preserving strong symmetry and H(div)-conformity. The non-polynomial structure of the curved Hu-Zhang element makes it difficult to analyze the stability result, which is overcome by establishing a novel inf-sup condition. Optimal convergence rates are achieved for all variables except the stress $L^2$-error. This suboptimality originates from the fact that the divergence space of the curved Hu-Zhang element is not contained in the discrete displacement space, which is rectified by local $p$-enrichment in the Hu-Zhang space on curved boundary elements. Some numerical experiments validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Concepts for Composing Finite Element Function Space Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite Element discretizations of coupled multi-physics partial differential equation models require the handling of composed function spaces. In this paper we discuss software concepts and abstractions to handle the composition of function spaces, based on a representation of product spaces as trees of simpler bases. From this description, many different numberings of degrees of freedom by multi-indices can be derived in a natural way, allowing to adapt the function spaces to very different data layouts, so that it opens the possibility to directly use the finite element code with very different linear algebra codes, different data structures, and different algebraic solvers.
  A recurring example throughout the paper is the stationary Stokes equation with Taylor--Hood elements as these are naturally formulated as product spaces and highlight why different storage patterns are desirable.
  In the second half of the paper we discuss a particular realization of most of these concepts in the \dunemodule{dune-functions} module, as part of the DUNE ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Precision Performance Portability of FFT-Based GPU-Accelerated Algorithms for Block-Triangular Toeplitz Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hardware diversity displayed in leadership-class computing facilities, alongside the immense performance boosts exhibited by today's GPUs when computing in lower precision, provide a strong incentive for scientific HPC workflows to adopt mixed-precision algorithms and performance portability models. We present an on-the-fly framework using Hipify for performance portability and apply it to FFTMatvec-an HPC application that computes matrix-vector products with block-triangular Toeplitz matrices. Our approach enables FFTMatvec, initially a CUDA-only application, to run seamlessly on AMD GPUs with excellent observed performance. Performance optimizations for AMD GPUs are integrated directly into the open-source rocBLAS library, keeping the application code unchanged. We then present a dynamic mixed-precision framework for FFTMatvec; a Pareto front analysis determines the optimal mixed-precision configuration for a desired error tolerance. Results are shown for AMD Instinct MI250X, MI300X, and the newly launched MI355X GPUs. The performance-portable, mixed-precision FFTMatvec is scaled to 2,048 GPUs on the OLCF Frontier supercomputer.</description>

      <title>TOBACO: Topology Optimization via Band-limited Coordinate Networks for Compositionally Graded Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compositionally Graded Alloys (CGAs) offer unprecedented design flexibility by enabling spatial variations in composition; tailoring material properties to local loading conditions. This flexibility leads to components that are stronger, lighter, and more cost-effective than traditional monolithic counterparts. The fabrication of CGAs have become increasingly feasible owing to recent advancements in additive manufacturing (AM), particularly in multi-material printing and improved precision in material deposition. However, AM of CGAs requires imposition of manufacturing constraints; in particular limits on the maximum spatial gradation of composition.
  This paper introduces a topology optimization (TO) based framework for designing optimized CGA components with controlled compositional gradation. In particular, we represent the constrained composition distribution using a band-limited coordinate neural network. By regulating the network's bandwidth, we ensure implicit compliance with gradation limits, eliminating the need for explicit constraints. The proposed approach also benefits from the inherent advantages of TO using coordinate networks, including mesh independence, high-resolution design extraction, and end-to-end differentiability. The effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated through various elastic and thermo-elastic TO examples.</description>

      <title>New Lower Bounds for the Minimum Singular Value in Matrix Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of the matrix selection problem is to select a submatrix $A_{S}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times k}$ from $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$ such that its minimum singular value is maximized. In this paper, we employ the interlacing polynomial method to investigate this problem. This approach allows us to identify a submatrix $A_{S_0}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times k}$ and establish a lower bound for its minimum singular value. Specifically, unlike common interlacing polynomial approaches that estimate the smallest root of the expected characteristic polynomial via barrier functions, we leverage the direct relationship between roots and coefficients. This leads to a tighter lower bound when $k$ is close to $n$. For the case where $AA^{\top}=\mathbb{I}_n$ and $k=n$, our result improves the well-known result by Hong-Pan, which involves extracting a basis from a tight frame and establishing a lower bound for the minimum singular value of the basis matrix.</description>

      <title>Sum-of-Gaussians tensor neural networks for high-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an accurate, efficient, and low-memory sum-of-Gaussians tensor neural network (SOG-TNN) algorithm for solving the high-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation. The SOG-TNN utilizes a low-rank tensor product representation of the solution to overcome the curse of dimensionality associated with high-dimensional integration. To handle the Coulomb interaction, we introduce an SOG decomposition to approximate the interaction kernel such that it is dimensionally separable, leading to a tensor representation with rapid convergence. We further develop a range-splitting scheme that partitions the Gaussian terms into short-, long-, and mid-range components. They are treated with the asymptotic expansion, the low-rank Chebyshev expansion, and the model reduction with singular-value decomposition, respectively, significantly reducing the number of two-dimensional integrals in computing electron-electron interactions. The SOG decomposition well resolves the computational challenge due to the singularity of the Coulomb interaction, leading to an efficient algorithm for the high-dimensional problem under the TNN framework. Numerical results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the new method, revealing that the SOG-TNN is a promising way for tackling large and complex quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Temporal Super-Resolution of Energy Data using Generative Adversarial Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue, this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application scenario is improved by 13%.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework from Boltzmann Transport to Proton Treatment Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops a rigorous mathematical formulation of proton transport by integrating both deterministic and stochastic perspectives. The deterministic framework is based on the Boltzmann-Fokker-Planck equation, formulated as an operator equation in a suitable functional setting. The stochastic approach models proton evolution via a track-length parameterised diffusion process, whose infinitesimal generator provides an alternative description of transport.
  A key result is the duality between the stochastic and deterministic formulations, established through the adjoint relationship between the transport operator and the stochastic generator. We prove that the resolvent of the stochastic process corresponds to the Green's function of the deterministic equation, providing a natural link between fluence-based and particle-based transport descriptions. The theory is applied to dose computation, where we show that the classical relation: dose = (fluence * mass stopping power) arises consistently in both approaches.
  Building on this foundation, we formulate a hybrid optimisation framework for treatment planning, in which dose is computed using a stochastic model while optimisation proceeds via adjoint-based PDE methods. We prove existence and differentiability of the objective functional and derive the first-order optimality system. This framework bridges stochastic simulation with deterministic control theory and provides a foundation for future work in constrained, adaptive and uncertainty-aware optimisation in proton therapy.</description>

      <title>Computing large deviation rate functions of entropy production for diffusion processes by an interacting particle method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19223v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an interacting particle method (IPM) for computing the large deviation rate function of entropy production for diffusion processes, with emphasis on the vanishing-noise limit and high dimensions. The crucial ingredient to obtain the rate function is the computation of the principal eigenvalue $\lambda$ of elliptic, non-self-adjoint operators. We show that this principal eigenvalue can be approximated in terms of the spectral radius of a discretized evolution operator, which is obtained from an operator splitting scheme and an Euler--Maruyama scheme with a small time step size. We also show that this spectral radius can be accessed through a large number of iterations of this discretized semigroup, which is suitable for computation using the IPM. The IPM applies naturally to problems in unbounded domains and scales easily to high dimensions. We show numerical examples of dimensions up to 16, and the results show that our numerical approximation of $\lambda$ converges to the analytical vanishing-noise limit within visual tolerance with a fixed number of particles and a fixed time step size. It is numerically shown that the IPM can adapt to singular behaviors in the vanishing-noise limit. We also apply the IPM to explore situations with no explicit formulas of the vanishing-noise limit. Our paper appears to be the first one to obtain numerical results of principal eigenvalue problems for non-self-adjoint operators in such high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Mixed precision iterative refinement for least squares with linear equality constraints and generalized least squares problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent development on mixed precision techniques has largely enhanced the performance of various linear algebra solvers, one of which being the solver for the least squares problem $\min_{x}\lVert b-Ax\rVert_{2}$. By transforming least squares problems into augmented linear systems, mixed precision techniques are capable of refining the lower precision solution to the working precision. In this paper, we propose mixed precision iterative refinement algorithms for two variants of least squares problems -- the least squares problem with linear equality constraints (LSE) and the generalized least squares problem (GLS). Both classical and GMRES-based iterative refinement can be applied to augmented systems of these two problems to improve the accuracy of the solution. For reasonably well-conditioned problems, our algorithms reduce the execution time by a factor of 40% on average compared to the fixed precision ones from LAPACK on the x86-64 architecture.</description>

Abstract: We study the finite element approximation of problems involving the weighted $\Phi$-Laplacian, where $\Phi$ is an $N$-function and the weight belongs to the class $A_\Phi$. In particular, we consider a boundary value problem and an obstacle problem and derive error estimates in both cases. The analysis is based on the language of weighted Orlicz and weighted Orlicz--Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Galerkin discretization of conservative dynamical low-rank approximation schemes for the Vlasov-Poisson equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A numerical dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA) scheme for the solution of the Vlasov-Poisson equation is presented. Based on the formulation of the DLRA equations as Friedrichs' systems in a continuous setting, it combines recently proposed conservative DLRA methods with a discontinuous Galerkin discretization. The resulting scheme is shown to ensure mass and momentum conservation at the discrete level. In addition, a new formulation of the conservative integrator is proposed which facilitates a projector splitting integrator. Numerical experiments validate our approach in one- and two-dimensional simulations of Landau damping. As a demonstration of feasibility, it is also shown that the rank-adaptive unconventional integrator can be combined with mesh adaptivity.</description>

      <title>What metric to optimize for suppressing instability in a Vlasov-Poisson system?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stabilizing plasma dynamics is an important task in green energy generation via fusion. A common strategy is to introduce an external field to prevent the plasma distribution from becoming turbulent. However, finding such external fields efficiently remains an open question, even for simplified models such as the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) system. In this work, we present an integrated method where we first perform an analytical derivation of the VP system's dispersion relation to construct a high-quality initial guess for the stabilizing field. This analytically-derived field is then used to initialize a PDE-constrained optimization loop that refines the control to a local optimum. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that objective functions evaluated only at the target time-when stable plasma is desired-lead to highly non-convex optimization landscapes, making the global minimum difficult to locate. This behavior arises regardless of the choice of loss function (e.g., KL divergence or electric energy). In contrast, integrating the loss function over time yields a landscape with a convex basin near the global minimum, facilitating convergence. Furthermore, when using electric energy as the objective, the landscape outside this basin is dominated by flat, unphysical local minima, highlighting the critical importance of our analytical approach for generating an initial guess that lies within the global minimum's basin of attraction.</description>

      <title>Extending DD-$\alpha$AMG on heterogeneous machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multigrid solvers are the standard in modern scientific computing simulations. Domain Decomposition Aggregation-Based Algebraic Multigrid, also known as the DD-$\alpha$AMG solver, is a successful realization of an algebraic multigrid solver for lattice quantum chromodynamics. Its CPU implementation has made it possible to construct, for some particular discretizations, simulations otherwise computationally unfeasible, and furthermore it has motivated the development and improvement of other algebraic multigrid solvers in the area. From an existing version of DD-$\alpha$AMG already partially ported via CUDA to run some finest-level operations of the multigrid solver on Nvidia GPUs, we translate the CUDA code here by using HIP to run on the ORISE supercomputer. We moreover extend the smoothers available in DD-$\alpha$AMG, paying particular attention to Richardson smoothing, which in our numerical experiments has led to a multigrid solver faster than smoothing with GCR and only 10% slower compared to SAP smoothing. Then we port the odd-even-preconditioned versions of GMRES and Richardson via CUDA. Finally, we extend some computationally intensive coarse-grid operations via advanced vectorization.</description>

      <title>Fast Convergence for High-Order ODE Solvers in Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models generate samples by learning to reverse a noise-injection process that transforms data into noise. A key development is the reformulation of the reverse sampling process as a deterministic probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE), which allows for efficient sampling using high-order numerical solvers. Unlike traditional time integrator analysis, the accuracy of this sampling procedure depends not only on numerical integration errors but also on the approximation quality and regularity of the learned score function, as well as their interaction. In this work, we present a rigorous convergence analysis of deterministic samplers derived from probability flow ODEs for general forward processes with arbitrary variance schedules. Specifically, we develop and analyze $p$-th order (exponential) Runge-Kutta schemes, under the practical assumption that the first and second derivatives of the learned score function are bounded. We prove that the total variation distance between the generated and target distributions can be bounded as \begin{align*}
  O\bigl(d^{\frac{7}{4}}\varepsilon_{\text{score}}^{\frac{1}{2}} +d(dH_{\max})^p\bigr), \end{align*} where $\varepsilon^2_{\text{score}}$ denotes the $L^2$ error in the score function approximation, $d$ is the data dimension, and $H_{\max}$ represents the maximum solver step size. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets further confirm that the derivatives of the learned score function are bounded in practice.</description>
