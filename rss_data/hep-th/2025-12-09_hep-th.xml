      <title>Functional Renormalization Group flows as diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we suggest to identify the Functional Renormalization Group flow equations of two-point functions as Hamilton-Jacobi(-Bellman)-type partial differential equations. This reformulation and reinterpretation goes beyond recent developments that treat Renormalization Group flow equations as conservation laws in field space and also allows to systematically understand and handle the nonconservative contributions in flow equations numerically.
  We demonstrate this novel approach by first applying it to a simple fermion-boson system in zero spacetime dimensions - which itself presents as an interesting playground for method development. Afterwards, we show, how the gained insights can be transferred to more realistic systems: One is the bosonic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric model in three Euclidean dimensions within a truncation that involves the field-dependent effective potential and field-dependent wave-function renormalization. The other example is the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional Gross-Neveu model within a truncation that involves a field-dependent potential and a field-dependent fermion mass/Yukawa coupling at nonzero temperature, chemical potential, and finite fermion number.</description>

      <title>Temporal correlations and chaos from spacetime kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a finite-dimensional formulation of the recently introduced notion of ``timelike entanglement'', defined in terms of two-point functions between operators supported on different Cauchy slices. Using a local orthonormal operator basis, we recast this construction in terms of a generalized response tensor. Building on this, we introduce a generalized spacetime density kernel (GSDK) corresponding to higher-point correlation functions, including time-ordered as well as out-of-time-ordered correlators. We show that the Haar-averaged $(2N)$-point function yields the $(2N)$-th moment of the spectral form factor (SFF), evaluated at an $N$-enhanced effective temperature. The correlation functions of the GSDK operators also yield the SFF, with an effective $(1/N)$-reduction of the physical time-scales. The GSDK places both scrambling diagnostics and spectral statistics on a similar footing and clarifies how higher-point correlators and non-trivial time ordering capture fine-grained dynamical information of a quantum system.</description>

      <title>Supergravity realisations of $\lambda$-models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct solutions of type-II supergravity based on multiple copies and/or mixings of $\lambda$-deformed coset CFTs on $\mathrm{SO}(n+1)_k/\mathrm{SO}(n)_k$, with $n = 2, 3, 4$. The resulting ten-dimensional geometries contain undeformed $\mathrm{AdS}$ factors, thereby allowing a connection between $\lambda$-deformations and the AdS/CFT correspondence. Imposing reality conditions on the solutions further constrains the deformation parameter. In some cases these bounds exclude the undeformed ($\lambda = 0$) or non-Abelian T-dual ($\lambda \to 1$) limits. This work extends the results of 1911.12371 and 2411.11086.</description>

      <title>A model of composite gravity with Pauli-Villars regulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a model of composite gravity, in the form of a reparametrization invariant, non-polynomial, metric-independent action for scalar fields. Previously, the emergence of a composite massless spin 2 particle, the graviton, was demonstrated by analyzing a two-into-two scalar scattering amplitude. Working in the limit of a large number of physical scalars and using dimensional regularization, it was shown that the scattering amplitude had a pole corresponding to a graviton exchange, provided that a certain fine-tuning was implemented; the Planck mass was determined as a function of the dimensional regularization parameter and a mass scale. Here we demonstrate that the presence of the composite graviton is a robust feature of this model and not an artefact of the choice of regulator, by replacing dimensional regularization with Pauli-Villars fields. The presence of the massless graviton is conditioned by a similar fine-tuning as before. This is arguably a more physical regularization, since the Planck mass now depends on the specifics of the Pauli-Villars regulator fields, e.g. their mass as well as their multiplicity.</description>

      <title>Maximally Symmetric Boost-Invariant Solutions of the Boltzmann Equation in Foliated Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the relativistic kinetic theory of a boost-invariant conformal gas on a static, maximally symmetric background $dS_3\times \mathbb{R}$, considering all constant-curvature slicings of $dS_3$ - flat, spherical, or hyperbolic- and their associated symmetry groups. Using a symmetry-driven cotangent-bundle approach, we show that the isometry group of each slicing acts on phase space in such a way that only its Casimir invariants and the time-like coordinate unconstrained, so the distribution function depends solely on these quantities. This yields a unified boost-invariant exact solution of the Boltzmann equation valid for each constant-curvature foliation of \ds. Specializing this general solution to the flat and spherical foliations reproduces the Bjorken and Gubser flows, respectively, while its restriction to the hyperbolic foliation produces a genuinely new analytic solution (`Grozdanov flow'). Hydrodynamics and free streaming emerge naturally as limiting regimes of this novel exact solution. We further comment on several relevant aspects of the new boost-invariant solution on the hyperbolic slicing and on their interpretation once mapped back to Minkowski space.</description>

      <title>Holographic Entanglement Entropy in Janus deformed AdS$_3$ Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the time dependent entanglement entropy for boosted single intervals in interface conformal field theories (ICFT$_2$s) dual to Janus deformed AdS$_3$ geometries. For a Janus deformed Poincar\'e AdS$_3$ background, we obtain the entanglement entropy and a Janus induced correction using a replica technique for the equivalent dual field theory described on a conformally flat background on corresponding AdS$_2$ slices on the asymptotic boundary. The holographic entanglement entropy is then computed through certain embedding relations for the bulk Janus deformed AdS$_3$ geometry which exactly match with the field theory results. We further extend our analysis to investigate the entanglement entropy of corresponding intervals in ICFT$_2$s dual to bulk Janus deformed BTZ black hole and AdS$_3$ black string geometries obtaining consistent results from both the field theoretic and bulk computations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corrections to Randall-Sundrum Model from JT Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum corrections to the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model in the near-extremal black brane background with quantum corrections in the near-horizon. The near-horizon geometry is described by Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, and the quantum fluctuations are governed by the Schwarzian action. We introduce the Schwarzian modes into the RS metric, derive the quantum-corrected equation for the Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes via the Schwinger-Dyson equation, calculate the correction to the KK mass spectrum, and discuss the impact of quantum corrections on the Goldberger-Wise mechanism. Our work introduces both quantum corrections and temperature into the RS model, providing insights into cosmology and phase transitions within it.</description>

      <title>Beyond $2$-to-$2$: Geometrization of Entanglement Wedge Connectivity in Holographic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend recent discussions on generalization of the Connected Wedge Theorem about $2$-to-$2$ holographic scattering problem to $n$-to-$n$ scatterings ($n&gt;2$). In this broader setting, our theorem provides a weaker necessary condition for the connectedness of boundary entanglement wedges than previously identified. Besides, we prove a novel sufficient condition for this connectedness. We also present a analysis of the criteria ensuring a non-empty entanglement wedge intersection region $\mathcal{S}_E$. These results refine the holographic dictionary between geometric connectivity and quantum entanglement for general multi-particle scattering.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Conformal Theories in Momentum Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Carrollian conformal field theories involving scalar operators in the momentum representation. The momentum space Ward identities are explicitly solved to obtain the different branches of 2 and 3 point Carrollian conformal correlators in the momentum space. The different branches are characterized by different analytic structures in the Carrollian energies. For specific values of the conformal dimensions, the three-point functions in momentum space exhibit logarithmic behaviour. This has no analogue in position space and instead originates from singularities in the Fourier transform relating position and momentum space correlators. We also analyze the Carrollian limit of CFT 2 and 3 point functions of scalar operators in momentum space. By taking different scalings of CFT correlators with respect to the speed of light, we obtain different branches of the Carrollian conformal correlators in the momentum space.</description>

      <title>Statistics and asymptotics of subdivergence-free Feynman integrals in $\phi^4$ theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent algorithmic improvements have made it possible to evaluate subdivergence-free (=primitive=skeleton) Feynman integrals in $\phi^4$ theory numerically up to 18 loops. By now, all such integrals up to 13 loops and several hundred thousand at higher loop order have been computed. This data enables a statistical analysis of the typical behaviour of Feynman integrals at large loop order. We find that the average value grows exponentially, but the observed growth rate is accurately described by its leading asymptotics only upwards of 25 loops. This is in contrast with the $N$-dependence of the $ON(N)$-symmetric $\phi^4$ theory, which is close to its large-order asymptotics already around 10 loops.
  Secondly, the distribution of integrals has a largely continuous inner part but a few extreme outliers. This makes uniform random sampling inefficient. We find that the value of the integral is correlated with many features of the graph, which can be used for importance sampling. With a naive test implementation we obtained an approximately 1000-fold speedup compared with uniform sampling. This suggests that in future work, Feynman amplitudes at large loop order might be computed numerically with statistical methods, rather than through enumerating and evaluating every individual integral.</description>

      <title>$L_\infty$-algebraic extensions of non-Lorentzian kinematical Lie algebras, gravities, and brane couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Newtonian limit of Newton-Cartan gravity relies crucially on the Lie-algebraic central extension to the Galilean algebra, namely the Bargmann algebra. Lie-algebraic central extensions naturally generalise to $L_\infty$-algebraic central extensions, which in turn classify branes in superstring theory via the brane bouquet. This paper classifies all $L_\infty$-algebraic central extensions of all kinematical Lie algebras that do not depend on the spatial rotation generators as well as all iterated central extensions thereof (for codimensions $\le3$). The Bargmann central extension of the Galilean algebra then appears as merely one term in a sequence of $L_\infty$-algebraic central extensions in each degree; a similar situation obtains for the Newton-Hooke algebra and the static algebra, but not for the Carrollian algebra nor those kinematical Lie algebras that are not Wigner-\.In\"on\"u deformations of a simple algebra.
  The sequence of $L_\infty$-algebraic central extensions in each degree then corresponds to a tower of $p$-form fields. After imposing conventional constraints, the zero-form field provides absolute time, and the higher-form fields are certain wedge products of the field strengths of the one-form (Bargmann) gravitational field. These then provide natural $(p-1)$-brane couplings to the corresponding non-Lorentzian gravities, which are found to produce velocity-dependent gravitational effects in the presence of torsion. The $L_\infty$-algebraic cocycles also provide Wess-Zumino-Witten terms for the $(p-1)$-brane action, which require the introduction of doubled spatial coordinates that are reminiscent of double field theory, but which (in some cases at least, and given appropriate kinetic terms) do not result in doubled physics.</description>

      <title>The late-time attractor structure of dynamical black branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ringdown phase of a perturbed black hole is conventionally described by a linear superposition of quasinormal modes. However, as the AdS black brane approaches its final global equilibrium, this linear quasinormal mode description becomes inadequate, and nonlinear dynamics play a significant role in the late-stage evolution. We show that the interplay between nonlinear evolution and horizon dissipation in general relativity drives dynamical AdS black branes towards the final state along a unique path, independent of their initial perturbations. Through numerical simulations, we identify this late-time attractor and uncover the associated universal nonlinear behavior, characterized by a simple dimensionless relative amplitude in the dual hydrodynamic variables.</description>

      <title>Evaporation of Primordial Black Holes in a Thermal Universe: A Thermofield Dynamics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of a finite temperature environment on the Hawking radiation from black holes (BHs), with particular focus on Kerr BHs immersed in a cosmological thermal bath. The emitted particles from BHs interact with the thermal background and thermalize, leading to a modification in the Hawking radiation spectrum. By employing the methods of Thermofield Dynamics (TFD), a real time formalism of thermal quantum field theory, we derive the modified occupation numbers of the Hawking spectrum for asymptotically flat spacetimes like the Schwarzschild and the Kerr geometries. These corrections depend on the interplay between the BH temperature and the ambient bath temperature. We apply this formalism in the early universe reheating background scenario arising after inflation and demonstrate that the thermal correction to Hawking spectrum enhances the evaporation rate of primordial black holes (PBHs). As a result, the lifetime of PBH shortens compared to the zero temperature vacuum and leads to interesting cosmological consequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07337v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When fermions interact with a topological soliton, they localize on the soliton. In studies of such systems, solitons are often treated as fixed background fields, and the backreaction due to the fermion localization is usually neglected for simplicity. In this work, we investigate the backreaction of localized fermions on a $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^2$ Skyrmion. We find that the Skyrmion profile deforms in response, becoming more concentrated around the localized fermions. We also discuss the possibility that this backreaction may play a role analogous to that of the potential term.</description>

      <title>Probing the Singularity of Scalar-Haired Black Holes with Holographic Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that the "complexity=anything" observables allow more possibilities to probe the geometry behind the horizon of AdS black holes compared to the volume complexity. For uncharged black holes, these observables access the geometry all the way to the vicinity of the singularity, while for charged black holes, they only probe up to the inner horizon. Under appropriate conditions, the near-singularity geometry takes the universal form of a Kasner spacetime, characterized by the Kasner exponents. By introducing scalar hair, it is possible to continuously vary the Kasner exponents away from their vacuum values. In this work, we study the behavior of two different observables to determine whether they remain viable holographic duals of complexity in the presence of scalar hair. We also investigate how deeply these observables can probe the Kasner regime near the singularity. To this end, we consider two scalar potentials: an exponential potential, which admits analytic solutions, and a pure mass term, which requires numerical analysis.</description>

Abstract: I study a topological string construction of the holographic duality between Kodaira-Spencer gravity on the Calabi-Yau 7-fold $\mathcal{O}(-1)^4\to\mathbb{PT}$ in the presence of a stack of $N$ backreacted D5 branes wrapping twistor space, $\mathbb{PT}$. The theory on the stack of branes is the twistor uplift of self-dual $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theory. I show that turning on a bulk superpotential and twisting the brane theory by the dual supercharge reduces the duality to twisted holography which relates the B-model on AdS$_3\times S^3\cong SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ to the 2d chiral algebra subsector of $\mathcal{N}=4$. I do an analogous computation for the twistor uplift of self-dual $\mathcal{N}=2$ by working on the Calabi-Yau 7-fold $\mathcal{O}(-2,-2)\oplus \mathcal{O}(0,-1)^2\to\mathbb{CP}^1\times\mathbb{PT}$. I also connect twists of the twistor uplift of self-dual $\mathcal{N}=4$ with the matrix model found by supersymmetric localization on $S^4$ and the Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model construction.</description>

      <title>Hirota-tau and Heun-function framework for Dirac vacuum polarization and quantum stabilization of kinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a modified affine Toda model coupled to matter (ATM) which includes a scalar self-interacting potential and demonstrate that its first-order integro-differential structure, preserving a deformed Noether-topological current correspondence, provides a consistent framework for fermion-soliton interactions. In this formulation, the fermion-soliton energy is proportional to the soliton's topological charge. We show that fermionic back-reaction and the self-interacting scalar critically shape the fermion-kink energy, the in-gap bound-state spectrum, and the fermionic vacuum-polarization energy, yielding well-defined stability minima of the total energy as functions of the fermion and scalar masses and coupling parameters. A key result is that the Heun-equation formalism is necessary to construct nonzero-energy bound and scattering states: unlike the tau-function method, which captures only the zero mode, the Heun approach encodes the full scattering data through local solution matching conditions. These results refine the spectral analysis of deformed integrable models. The stability of soliton-fermion configurations has direct implications for topologically protected states in quantum information and condensed-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Notes on GLSMs for Supermanifolds and Their Mirrors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the A-twisted gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) whose geometric phases are complex K\"ahler supermanifolds. For abelian models without superpotentials we propose an explicit orbifold description of the non-geometric (Landau-Ginzburg) point, and give a systematic rule for the nontrivial R-charge assignments at that point. We then study topological super Landau-Ginzburg models, derive chiral ring relations and genus-$g$ correlation functions, and use these formulas to test a Hori-Vafa-type mirror proposal for supermanifolds.</description>

Abstract: We first review the application of Dirac's method to the dynamics of a classical particle constrained to a circle and its subsequent quantization. Then, we extend the analysis to a particle constrained to move on an ellipse. Particularly, we identify the corresponding Dirac brackets and determine the quantum operators associated with the fundamental dynamical variables.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping non-unitary CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we present an evolutionary algorithm-based approach to bootstrapping the spectrum of general conformal field theories (CFTs). Starting from a trial spectrum, we invert the crossing equations to extract the corresponding operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients. The statistical distribution of these coefficients, obtained by sampling over cross-ratios, provides a quantitative measure of how closely crossing symmetry is satisfied. We then define a reward function based on this statistic and employ a genetic algorithm to search for spectra that maximize the reward. A key advantage of our framework is that it does not rely on unitarity. We illustrate the method using Virasoro blocks with central charge $c&lt;1$, where the optimal solutions align with the known minimal models. More broadly, this approach - solving systems of nonlinear constraints by exploiting the statistical properties of associated linear variables - provides a general strategy for broad class of bootstrap problems.</description>

      <title>Grand Canonical vs Canonical Krylov Complexity in Double-Scaled Complex SYK Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the complex SYK model in the double-scaling limit. We obtain the transfer matrix for the grand canonical ensemble and symmetrize it. In the (n,Q)- basis of chord states, the grand canonical transfer matrix is block diagonal, where each block is the canonical transfer matrix for the respective charge sector. We therefore conclude that the Krylov complexity for the grand canonical ensemble is given by the sum of the complexities in the charge sectors weighted by a probability function that depends on the chemical potential. Finally, we compute the Krylov complexity analytically in the limit of early and late time in the charge sector and numerically for both canonical and grand canonical ensemble.</description>

Abstract: We propose dressing factors for massive excitations of the worldsheet S matrix of $AdS_3\times S^3\times S^3\times S^1$ supported by mixed Ramond--Ramond and Neveu-Schwarz--Neveu-Schwarz flux, in the "string" and "mirror" kinematics. Our proposal is compatible with crossing and unitarity, and it reproduces the available perturbative results for any ratio of the two three-spheres' radii.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons propagators in AdS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce parity-odd spin-1 harmonic functions in AdS$_3$ and study their properties. We demonstrate that such parity-odd harmonics are related to their parity-even counterparts through the action of a `Chern-Simons operator', which we present as a novelty in this paper. This relation leads to the construction of simultaneous eigen-functions of the Laplacian and the Chern-Simons operators. Subsequently, these harmonic functions are employed to construct propagators in pure abelian Chern-Simons theory as well as Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in a covariant gauge. We demonstrate the consistency of the Chern-Simons propagator with the expected two-point function of the boundary currents. Our results are built upon the embedding formalism, which we modify suitably to incorporate parity-odd structures. This formalism also readily helps us write down parity odd structures for the propagators of higher-spin fields. Finally, we construct a split representation for the parity-odd harmonic functions, which may be useful to compute Witten diagrams with loops. Our results are expected to be useful in perturbative studies of parity violating QFTs on AdS$_3$.</description>

      <title>Holography of quarter-BPS AdS bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the quarter-BPS sector of the AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$ duality, and provide a precise matching between specific CFT states and supergravity geometries beyond the linearized approximation. In the bulk, we focus on AdS bubbles, geometries that fit within a consistent truncation to a gauged five-dimensional supergravity. We show that the BPS equations can be decoupled, and we study the geometries perturbatively and numerically. Applying the holographic dictionary, we compute the expectation values of light chiral primaries in these backgrounds. This data allows us to determine the dual CFT state up to quadratic order in the fluctuations. The resulting state is expressed as a linear combination of half-BPS double-trace states, and of the lightest quarter-BPS state of the theory. Our analysis reveals that protected quarter-BPS operators, including their subleading $1/N$ corrections, can be fully reconstructed from supergravity alone. Finally, we perform consistency checks of the result.</description>

      <title>Loop Corrected Supercharges from Holomorphic Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the loop corrections to supercharges in supersymmetric quantum field theories using the holomorphic twist formalism. We begin by reviewing the relation between supercharge corrections and the "twice-generalized" Konishi anomaly, which corrects the semi-chiral ring. In the holomorphic twist, these corrections appear as BRST anomalies and are computed using the higher operations of an underlying $L_\infty$ conformal algebra. We then apply this formalism to obtain the complete one-loop corrections to the supercharge of four-dimensional Lagrangian supersymmetric gauge theories, including $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, where it admits a remarkably compact expression in terms of superfields.</description>

      <title>The Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov structure of lattice BFKL evolution and the twist-two anomalous dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a lattice regularization of the BFKL evolution, showing its bulk dynamics is governed by an abelian Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov equation. The Hamiltonian combines long-range hopping with virtual corrections encoded by harmonic numbers. An exact walk expansion renders Reggeisation manifest at finite system size. In the bulk continuum limit, evolution reduces to a connection on $\mathbb{P}^1\setminus\{0,1,\infty\}$: $\Omega(x) = -2\,dx/x - 4\,dx/(1-x)$, with solutions in $\{0,1\}$-alphabet harmonic polylogarithms. Projecting to the collinear sector via Brown's single-valued map organizes the twist-two anomalous dimension's small-$\omega$ expansion, generating polynomials in odd zeta values, matching the transcendentality structure of planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM and multi-Regge kinematics. The lattice thus isolates the algebraic core of BFKL evolution.</description>

Abstract: We examine a criterion for relativistic covariance of nonlinear quantum field theory recently proposed by GPT-5 and published in Physics Letters B. We show that this criterion inadvertently tests a different property -- locality of the Hamiltonian -- and is insensitive to whether the theory is nonlinear. We recall the correct criterion, identified by Gisin and Polchinski thirty-five years ago, and reformulate their result in field-theoretic language.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The acceleration-induced transparency (AIT) effect has been suggested recently to amply the transition probability of the two-level detctor and offers a potential avenue for the experimental detection of the Unruh effect. In this paper, we explore the influence of the AIT effect on quantum entanglement between two detectors accelerated in a thermal field background, since the thermal backgound field cannot be avoided completely in any experiments. Interestingly, we find that although the backgound thermal field generally degrade the entanglement between the detectors, the AIT effect can effectively protect it.</description>

      <title>HoloNet: Toward a Unified Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Framework of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose HoloNet, a neural-network framework that unifies lattice QCD(LQCD) thermodynamics and holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory within a data-to-holography pipeline. Instead of assuming specific functional forms, HoloNet learns the metric profile $A(z)$ and the gauge-dilaton coupling $f(\phi)$ directly from 2+1-flavor LQCD data at $\mu=0$. These learned functions are embedded into the EMD equations, enabling the model to reproduce the lattice equation of state and baryon number fluctuations with high fidelity. Once trained, HoloNet provides a fully data-driven holographic description of QCD that extends naturally to finite density, allowing us to map the phase diagram and estimate the location of the critical end point (CEP). The reconstructed potential $V(\phi)$ and coupling $f(\phi)$ agree quantitatively with those obtained from holographic renormalization, demonstrating that HoloNet can consistently bridge different holographic models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vacuum fluctuations in quantum field theory impose fundamental limitations on our ability to measure time in short scales. To investigate the impact of universal quantum field theory effects on observer-dependent time measurements, we introduce a clock model based on the vacuum decay probability of a finite-sized quantum system. Using this model, we study a microscopic twin paradox scenario and find that, in the smallest scales, time is not only dependent on the trajectory connecting two events, but also on how vacuum fluctuations interact with the microscopic details of the clocks.</description>

      <title>Hidden symmetries for tidal Love numbers: generalities and applications to analogue black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal Love numbers characterize the conservative, static response of compact objects to external tidal fields. Remarkably, these quantities vanish identically for asymptotically flat black holes in four-dimensional General Relativity. This behavior has been attributed to hidden symmetries -- both geometric and algebraic -- governing perturbations in these space-times. Interestingly, a similar vanishing of selected multipolar Love numbers arises in the context of supersonic acoustic flows. These systems share several key features with black holes in General Relativity, such as the presence of an effective acoustic horizon and a wave equation describing linear excitations. In this work, we explore a symmetry-based connection between the two frameworks and demonstrate that the ladder symmetries observed in acoustic black holes can be traced to structural properties of the underlying wave equation, mirroring those found in general relativistic black hole space-times.</description>

      <title>Pion and Kaon PDFs from Lattice QCD with Complementary Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a first-principles lattice-QCD calculation of the unpolarized quark PDF for the pion and the kaon. The lattice data rely on matrix elements calculated for boosted mesons coupled to non-local operators containing a Wilson line. The calculations on this lattice ensemble correspond to two degenerate light, a strange, and a charm quark ($N_f=2+1+1$), using maximally twisted mass fermions with a clover term. The lattice volume is $32^3\times 64$, with a lattice spacing of 0.0934 fm, and a pion mass of 260 MeV. Matrix elements are calculated for hadron boosts of $|P_3| = 0,~0.41,~0.83,~1.25,~1.66,$ and 2.07 GeV. To match lattice QCD results to their light-cone counterparts, we employ two complementary frameworks: the large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) and the short-distance factorization (SDF). Using these approaches in parallel, we also test the lattice data to identify methodology-driven systematics. Results are presented for the standard quark PDFs, as well as the valence sector. Beyond obtaining the PDFs, we also explore the possibility of extracting information on SU(3) flavor-symmetry-breaking effects. For LaMET, we also parametrize the momentum dependence to obtain the infinite-momentum PDFs.</description>

      <title>Apparent Phantom Crossing in Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent observations of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) indicated the possibility that the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ might change from $w&lt;-1$ to $w&gt;-1$ when the redshift $z\sim 0.5$, which is called the inverse phantom crossing. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of the phantom crossing, and we construct realistic models realizing the crossing in the framework of the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity and ghost-free $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity. We also investigate the scenario of the apparent phantom crossing, where dark matter energy density decreases more slowly than usually expected, which might explain the DESI observations. In the scenarios developed, the energy conditions are not violated by any component of the cosmic fluid. In the framework of the apparent phantom crossing, we also propose a new scenario, where the particle corresponding to the scalar field in the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity is dark matter. The mass of the particle might increase due to the coupling with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, which makes the decrease of the dark matter energy density slower. This last scenario may suggest that the inverse phantom crossing might be related to the transition from the decelerating expansion of the Universe to the accelerating expansion.</description>

      <title>Identified charged hadron production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 54.4 GeV with the STAR detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results on the production of $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $p$, and $\bar{p}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 54.4 GeV using the STAR detector at RHIC, at mid-rapidity ($|y| &lt;$ 0.1). Invariant yields of these particles as a function of transverse momentum are shown. We determine bulk properties such as integrated particle yields ($dN/dy$), mean transverse momentum ($\langle p_{T} \rangle$), particle ratios, which provide insight into the particle production mechanisms. Additionally, the kinetic freeze-out parameters ($T_\text{kin}$ and $\langle \beta_{T} \rangle$), which provide information about the dynamics of the system at the time of freeze-out, are obtained. The Bjorken energy density ($\epsilon_{BJ}$), which gives an estimate of the energy density in the central rapidity region of the collision zone at the formation time $\tau$, is calculated and presented as a function of multiplicity for various energies. The results are compared with those from the models such as A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) and Heavy Ion Jet INteraction Generator (HIJING) for further insights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the simplest example of the landscape of conformal field theories: one-dimensional CFTs with finite-dimensional state space. Following the definition of quantum field theory given by G. Segal, we formulate the condition under which a one-dimensional QFT (quantum mechanics) possesses conformal symmetry, and we give a complete classification of conformal Hamiltonians with finite rank. It turns out that correlation functions in such theories are polynomial functions of the underlying geometric data. Moreover, the one-dimensional conformal Ward identities determine their scaling behavior, so that the correlators of the conformal observables are, in fact, homogeneous polynomials.</description>

      <title>The Two-Sheeted Topology of Extended Kerr-Type Spacetimes and a Parity-of-Crossings Property for Ring-Traversing Geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the global structure of the extended Kerr spacetime and of a broader class of Kerr-type spacetimes possessing ring singularities. By working with the elementary analytic extension (the union of the interior and exterior regions glued across the disk), we show that excising the ring singularity yields a domain that can be realised as a branched double cover of an exterior Kerr region. The branch locus is the ring itself, and the associated deck transformation defines a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$-action that exchanges the two sheets ($r&gt;0$ and $r&lt;0$) of the spacetime.
  We give a covering-space characterisation of this double-sheeted structure and show that admissible geodesics which cross the ring singularity implement the non-trivial deck transformation. In particular, we prove a parity-of-crossings property: any admissible geodesic that traverses an even number of ring singularities returns to its original sheet, while an odd number of traversals terminates on the opposite sheet.
  Generalising to $N$ disjoint ring singularities, we prove that the fundamental group of the excised manifold is the free group $F_N$ generated by simple loops around each ring, and we classify the associated double covers. Identifying the physically distinguished cover where every ring induces a sheet exchange, we extend the parity-of-crossings theorem to the multi-ring setting. We then formally extend these results to the maximal analytic extension (the infinite Carter--Penrose chain), proving that the sheet-exchange mechanism applies globally to this infinite structure.
  Finally, applying the Novikov self-consistency principle to this topological framework, we demonstrate that the requirement of global consistency restricts admissible histories to discrete sectors labelled by ring-crossing parities.</description>

      <title>Boundary structure of gauge fields on asymptotically AdS spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study boundary structure of asymptotically AdS gravity and (gauge) fields defined on this background by employing the gauge PDE approach. The essential step of the construction is the incorporation of the boundary-defining function among the fields of the theory, which allows us to realise the asymptotic boundary as a space-time submanifold by employing the gauge PDE implementation of Penrose's concept of asymptotically-simple space. In so doing the gauge PDE describing the boundary structure is obtained by restricting to the boundary of spacetime and simultaneously restricting to the boundary of the field space by setting the boundary defining function to zero. To implement this step systematically we introduce a notion of $Q$-boundary which seems to be new. The main concrete result of this work is the construction of the efficient boundary calculus, which gives a recursive procedure to obtain the explicit form of the equations satisfied by the boundary fields and their gauge transformations for boundary dimension $d \geq 3$. These include obstruction equations (such as Bach equation or Yang-Mills equation for $d=4$) and generalised conservation equations in the subleading sector. In particular, we derive the explicit form of the higher conformal Yang-Mills equation for $d=8$. The approach is very general and, in principle, applies to generic (gauge) fields on the Einstein gravity background producing a conformally-invariant gauge theory on the boundary, which describes their boundary structure. It can be considered as an extension of the Fefferman-Graham construction that takes into account both the leading and the subleading sector of the bulk fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum Treatment of Black Hole Superradiance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating black holes can form dense boson clouds through superradiant instability, making Kerr black holes a powerful probe of ultralight massive bosons. Previous studies of black hole superradiance have often treated bosonic fields classically, leaving open questions about how particles are produced and how the clouds grow over time. In this work, we canonically quantize a massive scalar field around a Kerr black hole, providing a fully quantum description of black hole superradiance. We show that the evolution of the particle number in the cloud, as well as the energy and angular momentum of the scalar field, can be consistently explained within the standard framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Furthermore, we prove that the growth of the cloud occurs independently of the choice of initial state. We also explore several phenomena related to a massive scalar field in a rotating black hole spacetime, including Hawking radiation, adiabatic backreaction on the black hole spin, and the direction of level transitions in the presence of self-interactions of the field. Our analysis provides a consistent quantum-mechanical perspective that includes all these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Nucleon 3D intrinsic spin structure from the weak-neutral axial-vector form factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic 3D weak-neutral axial-vector four-current and spin distributions inside a nucleon (or a general spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hadron) including three weak-neutral axial-vector form factors are investigated for the first time. We clarify that the relativistic 3D axial charge distribution in the Breit frame is completely described by the induced pseudotensor form factor $G_T^Z(Q^2)$ rather than by the axial form factor $G_A^Z(Q^2)$. We demonstrate that $R_A \equiv \sqrt{ \frac{-6}{G_A^Z(0) }\frac{\text{d} G_A^Z(Q^2) }{\text{d} Q^2} \Big|_{Q^2=0} }$ can not be interpreted as the physically meaningful 3D root-mean-square axial radius of a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hadron. The genuine axial radius for any spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hadron in fact does not exist. We also show that the relativistic 3D weak-neutral spin radius $r_\text{spin} = \sqrt{\langle r_\text{spin}^2 \rangle}$, with $\langle r_\text{spin}^2 \rangle \equiv R_A^2 + \frac{ 1 }{ 4M^2 }\left[ 1 + \frac{ 2 G_P^Z(0) }{ G_A^Z(0) } \right]$ based on the relativistic and intrinsic 3D weak-neutral spin distribution in the Breit frame, is a physically meaningful radius that can be unambiguously defined for the nucleon, which provides an additional key motivation for the further determination of the induced pseudoscalar form factor $G_P^Z(Q^2)$. Numerically, we find that $R_A \approx 0.6510~\text{fm}$, $r_\text{spin} \approx 2.1054~\text{fm}$ and $\overline r_\text{spin} \equiv r_\text{spin}/3 \approx 0.7018~\text{fm}$. For future experimental measurements of $G_A^Z(Q^2)$ and $G_T^Z(Q^2)$, we also derive the full tree-level unpolarized differential cross sections for neutrino-proton and antineutrino-proton elastic scattering in the lab frame, in hoping to provide a complementary and new perspective to unveil the nucleon spin structure by using (anti)neutrino-based facilities.</description>

Abstract: With regard to the observed dark matter density profile in galaxies and clusters, the scalar dark matter scenario has been previously studied for potential detectability through gravitational wave observations at measurable signal-to-noise ratios. In the present study, we consider the case of dark matter described by a massive vector field, also referred to as the Proca field. The density profile in the vicinity of the black hole is explicitly constructed for a broad range of dark matter mass, $\mu\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-15}{\mathrm eV}$, which allows it to exhibit both particle and wave-like characteristics. While in the particle regime, the computation of the DM density distribution is analytically tractable, we find it convenient to compute the same numerically in the wave regime. Nevertheless, in the outer region, the surrounding dark matter is assumed to follow a broken power-law distribution, represented by a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with a central spike. For the purpose of investigating the detectability of the vector dark matter in the gravitational wave spectrum, we have modelled a stellar-mass black hole ($1M_{\odot}$) inspiralling into a Schwarzschild black hole of mass $10^4M_{\odot}$ within such a vector dark matter environment. With this setup, we analyzed the dephasing in the gravitational wave strain induced by vector dark matter and performed a Fisher forecast for upcoming LISA observations, with particular emphasis on the distinctive features in both the particle and wave regimes of the dark matter. Additionally, most of the important results have been compared with the scalar dark matter case.</description>

      <title>Genesis of Axion Dark Matter via Black Hole and Cosmic String Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global $U_{PQ}(1)$ Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry, proposed to resolve the strong CP problem, predicts the existence of the axion, a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson and a leading dark matter candidate. The spontaneous breaking of this symmetry generates global strings that decay predominantly via the emission of massive axions and gravitational waves. In this work, we investigate the decay of cosmic axion strings in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole and estimate the corresponding energy losses and decay timescales of the resulting string loops. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses as small as $10^{-16} M_\odot$, the total energy radiated by the contracting strings is found to be on the order of $10^{27} \, \mathrm{GeV}$, accounting for both axion and gravitational radiation. Our analysis shows that the presence of a central black hole considerably accelerates string loop decay, leading to significantly reduced lifetimes. These results constitute an initial exploration of whether axion radiation from PBH-cosmic string systems could provide a non-negligible contribution to the dark matter content of galactic halos. The study also identifies the decay time as a potentially valuable observational signature. Further detailed modeling will be necessary to assess the cosmological implications of this mechanism more precisely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study vacuum polarization due to strong fields, in the presence of an electron-positron plasma. For this purpose, we expand quantum kinetic equations using weak fields and slow temporal scales as expansion parameters. It is demonstrated that the evolution of the Dirac field can be described by classical-like distribution functions for electrons and positrons, which are weakly coupled through quantum interactions. Furthermore, we deduce that these coupling terms give rise to well-known expressions for vacuum polarization, in addition to quantum modifications proportional to the content of real particles. Depending on the initial plasma density, the dominant quantum corrections to classical evolution may arise from real particle couplings or from the vacuum polarization associated with virtual particles. The implications of our results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Revisiting PBH Accretion, Evaporation and Their Cosmological Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a unique probe of the early Universe. Their cosmological evolution is governed by the competition between mass accretion and Hawking evaporation. In this paper we look into the details impact of accretion. Most of the earlier analysis relied on non-relativistic accretion models. In this work, we reinvestigate this in a fully relativistic framework for Kerr PBHs in the radiation-dominated era. We derive relativistic accretion rate and compute spin-dependent efficiency $\lambda_{\text{Kerr}}(a_*)$. Using this result, we construct coupled evolution equations for the PBH mass and spin that include both relativistic accretion and spin-dependent evaporation. Our analysis shows that relativistic accretion significantly increases PBH masses and consequently suppresses their spins, causing all PBHs to become effectively Schwarzschild well before evaporation. These effects strengthen the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the initial PBH mass by a factor of $\sim 4$--$5$, reduce the mass required for survival to the present epoch to $\sim 2.7\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{g}$, and shift the viable particle like DM parameter space. Notably the early accretion induced spin-down effect further washes out the well known high-frequency, spin-induced feature in the high frequency stochastic gravitational-wave background, modifying predictions for future detectors.</description>

      <title>On the emergence of preferred structures in quantum theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the possibilities offered by Hilbert space fundamentalism, an attitude towards quantum physics according to which all physical structures (e.g. subsystems, locality, spacetime, preferred observables) should emerge from minimal quantum ingredients (typically a Hilbert space, Hamiltonian, and state). As a case study, we first mainly focus on the specific question of whether the Hamiltonian can uniquely determine a tensor product structure, a crucial challenge in the growing field of quantum mereology. The present paper reviews, clarifies, and critically examines two apparently conflicting theorems by Cotler et al. and Stoica. We resolve the tension, show how the former has been widely misinterpreted and why the latter is correct only in some weaker version. We then propose a correct mathematical way to address the general problem of preferred structures in quantum theory, relative to the characterization of emergent objects by unitary-invariant properties. Finally, we apply this formalism in the particular case we started with, and show that a Hamiltonian and a state are enough structure to uniquely select a preferred tensor product structure.</description>

      <title>Absence of charged pion condensation in a magnetic field with parallel rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07473v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the critical temperature of a relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate of charged bosons driven by rotation in a parallel magnetic field [Y. Liu and I. Zahed, Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 032001 (2018)]. For non-interacting bosons, the critical temperature can only be determined for a system with fixed angular momentum. We find that the critical temperature of the non-interacting system vanishes due to the fact that the system is quasi-one-dimensional, indicating that non-interacting bosons cannot undergo Bose-Einstein condensation. For interacting bosons, we investigate a system with quartic self-interaction. We show that the order parameter vanishes and the off-diagonal long-range order is absent at any nonzero temperature because of the quasi-one-dimensional feature, in accordance with the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg theorem.</description>

      <title>Uniform relativistic motion through a thermal bath as a thermodynamic resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a quantum system undergoing motion with uniform relativistic velocity through a thermal bath consisting of a massless scalar field is generically driven into a non-equilibrium steady-state (NESS) solely due to its motion, even in the absence of external driving or multiple baths. The relative motion between the system and the bath breaks detailed balance, preventing thermalization to a Gibbs state. We find that the resulting steady-states fall into two distinct classes: (i) NESSs with persistent probability currents, and (ii) current-free non-Gibbs steady states characterized by a frequency-dependent effective inverse temperature. We demonstrate, using a three-level system, that NESSs with probability current can function as noisy stochastic clock, while current-free non-Gibbs steady states possess non-zero non-equilibrium free energy, indicating their potential as a quantum battery for work extraction or storage.</description>

Abstract: A novel combinatorial formula is developed for for tensor product multiplicities in representation theory. We introduce a difference formula linking these multiplicities to restricted occupancy coefficients via a shifted operator. This method is extended to derive branching rules for subalgebras and is conjecturally applied to A-type Lie superalgebras.</description>

      <title>Boundary Criticality of Complex Conformal Field Theory: A Case Study in the Non-Hermitian 5-State Potts Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal fields with boundaries give rise to rich critical phenomena that can reveal information about the underlying conformality. While most existing studies focus on Hermitian systems, here we explore boundary critical phenomena in a non-Hermitian quantum 5-state Potts model which exhibits complex conformality in the bulk. We identify free, fixed and mixed conformal boundary conditions and observe the conformal tower structure of energy spectra, supporting the emergence of conformal boundary criticality. We also studied the duality relation between different conformal boundary conditions under the Kramers-Wannier transformation. These findings should facilitate a comprehensive understanding for complex CFTs and stimulate further exploration on the boundary critical phenomena within non-Hermitian strongly-correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of 3HDM symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries play a crucial role in shaping the structure and predictions of multi-Higgs-doublet models. In three-Higgs-doublet models considerable effort has been put into classifying possible symmetry groups and the conditions for their realisation, yet the completeness of existing classifications remains an open question. In this work, we revisit the problem of identifying realisable symmetries by re-examining conventional Higgs family and general CP transformations from an alternative perspective. Our analysis identifies certain limitations in previous approaches and introduces a clearer, more systematic framework for model builders. We expand our classification by investigating more generalised symmetry structures -- the recently identified GOOFy transformations, which act non-trivially on the Higgs doublets and their conjugates. Our analysis consolidates known results, uncovers previously overlooked structures, and expands the set of symmetries in three-Higgs-doublet models, offering both a clearer theoretical foundation and a practical reference for symmetry-based model building.</description>

      <title>Sunset integrals with up to three mass scales in chiral perturbation theory: a comparative study of the Mellin-Barnes representation technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sunset integrals are among the simplest of two-loop integrals that appear in perturbative quantum field theories and possess up to four distinct mass scales. By means of integration by parts identities, they can be written in terms of four distinct master integrals. In this article, we discuss the independent configurations of on-shell and off-shell sunset master integrals with one, two and three mass scales that arise in chiral perturbation theory. We derive Mellin-Barnes integral representations of these integrals and analytically solve them using various methods to obtain exact results in the form of single and double convergent series of the hypergeometric type, for the values of the mass parameters that allow us to do so. We then discuss how to analytically continue the results to other regions of the parameters and conclude by discussing a few applications in chiral perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Charge functions for high dimensional partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To construct a BPS algebra with representations furnished by n-dimensional partitions, the first step is to construct the eigenvalue of the Cartan operators acting on them. The generating function of the eigenvalues are called the charge function. It has an important property that for each partition, the poles of the function correspond to the projection of the boxes which can be added to or removed from the partition legally. The charge functions of lower dimensional partitions, i.e., Young diagrams for 2D, plane partitions for 3D and solid partitions for 4D, are already given in the literature. In this paper, we propose an expression of the charge function for arbitrary odd dimensional partitions and have it proved for 5D case. Some explicit numerical tests for 7D and 9D case are also conducted to confirm our formula.</description>

      <title>Novel thermodynamic inequality for charged and rotating AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new thermodynamic inequality for stationary and asymptotically Anti-de Sitter charged and rotating black holes, $ 4\pi J^2/(3MV)&lt;1 $. This inequality is derived through an analysis of the roots of the identity which holds among the thermodynamic variables to avoid a naked singularity. We have analyzed the Kerr-AdS black hole and the asymptotically AdS uncharged and rotating black strings and find strong supporting evidence for different horizon topologies. Using this inequality we verify the validity of reverse isoperimetric inequality in its conventional form ($ {\cal R}\geq 1 $) in the presence of rotation. By examining a wide range of black hole solutions, we confirm the validity of the proposed inequality. Assuming that reverse isoperimetric inequality continues to hold in higher dimensions, and employing the intermediate refined reverse isoperimetric inequalities introduced in [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.241401}{Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 131}, 241401}] as guiding principles, we extend the inequality to higher-dimensional spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: We study the strong-field limit of a theory involving a quantum scalar field coupled to a vector background, which can be either an electromagnetic field or a non-gauge field coupled through the first derivative term. Our approach consists in obtaining resummed expressions for the associated heat kernels, from which we derive the corresponding resummed effective actions. These results allow us to discuss the effect of pair creation. Finally, we conjecture that resummations for more general theories should be possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational lensing signatures of vorton configurations, considering the circular vorton, the Kibble-Turok vorton, and a newly proposed class that incorporates simultaneous excitations of the first, second, and third harmonic modes. Working within the weak-field and thin-lens approximations, we demonstrate that circular vortons produce a sharp lensing discontinuity that separates two regions with qualitatively distinct distortions. The corresponding Einstein ring co-exists alongside an almost undistorted source image. This effect is significantly amplified in the case of non-circular vortons, where asymmetries and higher-harmonic deformations amplify the discontinuity and lead to complex image structures. These distinctive lensing patterns offer potential discriminants between different vorton configurations, suggesting that future high-resolution surveys may provide a novel window into the microphysics of current-carrying cosmic strings.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the soft decomposition of tree-level gluon amplitudes with split-helicity configurations. First, we show how any split-helicity amplitude can be fully fixed from inverse soft limit using BCFW calculation. We show how the double and triple soft theorems can manifest beyond perturbative calculations through split-helicity decomposition. Next, we obtain a compact formula for the corresponding soft operator which is a simple combination of individual single soft operators. Then we generate the leading and sub-leading soft factors using soft momentum expansion, to compare with results derived from standard calculation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish direct evidence for the perturbative distinguishability between black hole microstates and thermal states using the AdS/CFT correspondence. In two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories, we obtain the subsystem fidelity and quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence, both of which provide rigorous lower and upper bounds for subsystem trace distance. This result demonstrates that perturbative quantum gravity corrections break semiclassical indistinguishability, thereby supporting the recovery of information even from a small amount of the Hawking radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the solvability of a given quantum mechanical system is generally challenging. We discuss that the numerical bootstrap method can help us to solve this question in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. We show that the bootstrap method can derive exact energy eigenvalues in systems with shape invariance, which is a sufficient condition for solvability and which many solvable systems satisfy. The information of the annihilation operators is also obtained naturally, and thus the bootstrap method tells us why the system is solvable. We numerically demonstrate this explicitly for shape invariant potentials: harmonic oscillators, Morse potentials, Rosen-Morse potentials and hyperbolic Scarf potentials. Therefore, the numerical bootstrap method can determine the solvability of a given unknown system if it satisfies shape invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Duality symmetries have been extensively investigated in various contexts, playing a crucial role in understanding quantum field theory and condensed matter theory. In this paper, we extend this framework by studying $N$-ality symmetries, which are a generalization of duality symmetries and are mathematically described by $\mathbb{Z}_N$-graded fusion categories. In particular, we focus on an $N$-ality symmetry obtained by gauging a non-anomalous subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry with a type III anomaly. We determine the corresponding fusion rules via two complementary approaches: a direct calculation and a representation-theoretic method. As an application, we study the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases associated with the $N$-ality symmetry. We classify all such SPT phases using the SymTFT framework and explicitly construct lattice Hamiltonians for some of them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate dynamical symmetry breaking in a class of chiral gauge theories containing the Georgi-Glashow model. These theories feature a gauge sector and two fermion species that transform in the two-index antisymmetric and antifundamental representations with different multiplicities. Using the effective action formalism and the functional renormalization group, we derive the flow of four-fermion interactions that encode their resonant structure and information about bound-state formation. Generalizing the theories to multiple generations, we make contact with the loss of asymptotic freedom and dissect the boundary of a conjectured conformal window. Our results show that, while most of the theory space displays a dominant color-breaking condensate, there exists a strongly coupled regime where the lowest-laying mechanisms fail and more intricate dynamics are expected to arise. This analysis provides a first step toward the infrared behavior of chiral gauge theories with functional methods.</description>

      <title>Extrapolating the massive fields to future timelike infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that future timelike infinity ($i^+$) in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime is conformal to the unit three-dimensional hyperboloid ($H^3$). We asymptotically expand massive fields with spin $0,1,2$ near $i^+$ and extrapolate them onto this hyperboloid. These fields oscillate with a frequency equal to their mass and exhibit a universal asymptotic decay $\tau^{-3/2}$. The fundamental fields are free and encode the outgoing scattering data. They are local operators defined on the boundary $H^3$ with which we construct the Poincar\'e charges. The Poincar\'e algebra can be extended to $\text{MDiff}(H^3)\ltimes C^{\infty}(H^3)$ using smeared operators associated with energy and angular momentum densities. For spinning fields, a spin operator must be included to close the algebra. The extended algebra shares the same form as the five-dimensional intertwined Carrollian diffeomorphism and reduces to the BMS algebra at $i^+$ by restricting the choice of test functions and vectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been known for about thirty years that a scattering amplitude involving D0-branes and closed strings suffers from infrared divergences beyond tree level. These divergences arise because the conventional world-sheet approach cannot account for the difference between the D0-brane's momentum before and after scattering. We show that, by using string field theory, the divergence can be removed and the amplitude rendered finite and unambiguous. We illustrate this using the simplest possible example in bosonic string theory: a three-point function with one incoming and one outgoing D0-brane and an incoming or outgoing closed string tachyon.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, \cite{Cao:2025hio} demonstrated the $2$-split for form factor under specific kinematic constraints. This factorization is analogous to that observed in scattering amplitudes. A key consequence of this structure is the presence of hidden zeros, where the form factors vanish on specific kinematic loci. We first establish these zeros and a new zero for the form factors of the composite operators ${\cal O} =\frac{1}{2}\Tr((\partial \phi)^2) + \Tr(\phi^3)$ and ${\cal O} = \Tr(F^2)$, and then employ an inductive proof based on the BCFW recursion relation to prove the $2$-split factorization for any number of external particles.</description>

      <title>Statistics of Base Polytopes in F-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new statistical ensemble of toric bases for elliptic Calabi-Yaus used in F-theory models, by focusing on only the convex hull of the base, i.e., the base polytope. This physically motivated coarse-graining greatly simplifies the combinatorial complexity of the part of the 4D F-theory landscape with toric bases. We develop a Monte Carlo approach that randomly samples the base polytopes within fixed boxes, with proper statistical weights. We first apply the algorithm to the set of 2d base polytopes, generating an enlarged set of toric 2d bases that include certain types of codimension-two (4,6) points, and we validate our approach against exact numbers. We then explore the set of 3d base polytopes which fit in a set of ``maximal'' 3d boxes, and estimate the total number of inequivalent 3d base polytopes to be $\sim 10^{85}$--$10^{90}$. We provide statistical data such as the distribution of non-Higgsable gauge groups on these bases. Amusingly, a similar method can also be applied to generate reflexive polytopes in various dimensions. In both the reflexive and base polytope cases, the number of relevant polytopes obeys a Gaussian distribution as a function of the number of vertices, which can be understood in terms of other results on random polytopes in the math literature.</description>

      <title>Where Non-Invertible Symmetries End: Twist Defects for Electromagnetic Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study novel conformal twist defects in 4d Maxwell theory, around which electric and magnetic fields are exchanged. These are codimension-2 defects living at the end of topological defects for certain non-invertible global symmetries. We determine the operator spectrum of the twist defect by solving classical electromagnetic wave equations subject to a twisted boundary condition. Using techniques from defect CFT, we show that correlation functions of these defect operators factorize into two sectors: a universal generalized free-field sector, and a chiral current sector analogous to edge modes in Chern-Simons theory. In a similar setup, we also revisit the twist fields attached to non-invertible line defects in the 2d compact boson CFT. We discuss a defect 't Hooft anomaly involving a chiral $O(2)$ symmetry, highlighting its dynamical implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finite formulation of quantum field theory based on a system of differential equations reminiscent of the Callan-Symanzik equations is discussed. This system of equations was previously formulated in the bare language. We rederive it in a fully renormalized language. For the latter, within a simple $\phi^4$ toy model, it is shown that with a specific choice of renormalization conditions - namely, the on-shell scheme for the renormalized mass - this class of finite renormalization prescriptions is equivalent to the standard renormalization-group equation written in the Callan-Symanzik-Ovsyannikov form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of asymptotic $2$-to-$2$ scattering process in AdS/CFT, the Connected Wedge Theorem identifies the existence of $O(1/G_N)$ mutual information between suitable boundary subregions, referred to as decision regions, as a necessary but not sufficient condition for bulk-only scattering processes, i.e., nonempty bulk scattering region $S_0$. Recently, Liu and Leutheusser proposed an enlarged bulk scattering region $S_E$ and conjectured that the non-emptiness of $S_E$ fully characterizes the existence of $O(1/G_N)$ mutual information between decision regions. Here, we provide a geometrical or general relativity proof for a slightly modified version of their conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We apply the universal method developed in \cite{Jiang:2025jnk} to compute the entanglement entropy between two tangent balls in CFT$_D$. When taking the radius of one ball to infinity, it gives the entanglement entropy between a ball and its tangent half plane. In two-dimensional case, this configuration is equivalent to the entanglement in boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) between the negative half-axis and an interval ending on the boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study bulk locality constraints in quantum field theories in AdS$_2$. The known derivation of locality sum rules in AdS$_{d+1}$ does not apply for $d=1$ due to the different singularity structure of the conformal blocks and the inequivalence of operator orderings on the boundary. Assuming unitarity and a mild growth condition, we establish power-law bounds for correlators, derive dispersion relations and an expansion in terms of ``even'' and ``odd'' local blocks that converges in the entire AdS$_2$. These yield two novel families of symmetric and antisymmetric locality sum rules. We test these sum rules explicitly in the free scalar field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a higher-dimensional universe that is a product of Minkowski space and the non-orientable Klein Bottle. The topology explicitly breaks important symmetries, such as translational invariance and (5+1)-dimensional CP invariance. Somewhat surprisingly, the (3+1)-dimensional cp of the Minkowski space can also be broken by the Klein Bottle, both explicitly and in the presence of a brane. The topology enforces a background of fermion correlations that amounts to a condensate wall localized in the Klein Bottle. The wall acts as an order parameter for the broken symmetries. If a brane passes through the wall, brane fermions that couple to the condensate are produced as quantified by the Bogoliubov coefficients for a time-dependent mass. The scenario meets the conditions, including cp violation, to potentially generate the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe.</description>

      <title>Instability thresholds for de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes in holographic semiclassical gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stability of $d$-dimensional ($d=3,4,5$) de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes within the framework of semiclassical gravity sourced by a strongly coupled quantum field with a gravity dual. Our stability results are derived from a careful analysis of the $d$-dimensional Lichnerowicz equation with mass-squared $m^2$ and of semiclassical equations involving the dimensionless parameter $\gamma_d$. For $d=3$, we find that Minkowski spacetime is always unstable against perturbations, whereas de Sitter spacetime becomes stable when a dimensionless parameter $\gamma_3$ exceeds a critical value. In $d=4$, both de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes become unstable when the parameter $\gamma_4$ exceeds its critical value. In contrast, in $d=5$, de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes remain stable for almost all values of the parameter $\gamma_5$, except for a regime in which higher-curvature corrections become comparable to the Einstein tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore an unusual symmetry in a field theory on a specific (1+1)-dimensional curved spacetime, which has an interesting interpretation as an approximate asymptotic Weyl symmetry. Unlike the conventional Weyl symmetry, the boundary term under the variation plays a crucial role in understanding for its anomaly. After converting a two-dimensional field theory on curved spacetime to an inhomogeneous field theory, we obtain the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor. Then, we show the existence of an Unruh-like effect in the bubble wall expansion at the zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Shape dependence of entanglement negativity and mutual information in quantum Hall and critical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.12819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two entanglement measures in a large family of isotropic many-body states including incompressible quantum Hall liquids and quantum critical systems: the logarithmic negativity (LN), and mutual information (MI). For pure states, obtained for example from a bipartition at zero temperature, these provide distinct characterizations of the entanglement present between two spatial subregions, while for mixed states (such as at finite temperature) only the LN remains a good entanglement measure. Our focus is on regions that have corners, either adjacent or tip-touching. We first obtain general non-perturbative properties regarding the geometrical dependence of the LN and MI. A close similarity is observed with mutual charge fluctuations, where super-universal angle dependence holds allowing for explicit checks. For the MI, we make stronger statements due to strong subadditivity. We also give ramifications of our general analysis to conformal field theories (CFTs) in two spatial dimensions. We then explicitly verify these properties with integer quantum Hall states. To do so we develop two independent approaches to obtain the fermionic LN, which takes into account Fermi statistics: an overlap-matrix method, and a real-space lattice discretization. At finite temperature, we find a rapid decrease of the LN well inside the cyclotron gap at integer fillings. We further show that the LN decays faster compared to the MI at high temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01424v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General relativity (GR) admits two alternative formulations with the same dynamics attributing the gravitational phenomena to torsion or nonmetricity of the manifold's connection. They lead, respectively, to the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) and the symmetric teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (STEGR). In this work, we focus on STEGR and present its differences with the conventional, curvature-based GR. We exhibit the 3+1 decomposition of the STEGR Lagrangian in the coincident gauge and present the Hamiltonian, the Hamiltonian and momenta constraints, and Hamilton's equations. For a particular case of spherical symmetry, we explicitly show the differences in the Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian constraint between GR and STEGR. We finally discuss the implications that these differences, which represent genuine different features between the two formulations of gravity, might encompass to numerical relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11719v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of infinitely many new candidate non-Abelian self-correcting topological quantum memories in $D\geq 5+1$ spacetime dimensions without particle excitations using local commuting non-Pauli stabilizer lattice models and field theories of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ higher-form gauge fields with nontrivial topological action. We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules and non-Abelian braiding, including Borromean ring type braiding which is a signature of non-Abelian topological order, generalizing the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in (2+1)D. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in (5+1)D with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We prove the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probabilistic local cellular-automaton decoder. We also construct fault-tolerant non-Clifford CCZ logical gate using constant depth circuit from higher cup products in the 5D non-Abelian code. The use of higher-cup products and non-Pauli stabilizers allows us to get an $O(n^{2/5})$ distance overcoming the $O(n^{1/3})$ distance barrier in conventional topological stabilizer codes, including the 3D color code and the 6D self-correcting color code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11128v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest a finite-time geometric optimization framework to analyze thermal fluctuations and optimal processes in black holes. Our approach implement geodesics in thermodynamic space to define optimal pathways between equilibrium and non-equilibrium states. Since thermodynamic metrics need not be positive-definite, the method ensures a positive thermodynamic length by incorporating simple scale factor into the metric. We show that the scale factor is sensitive to phase transitions in entropy representation, addressing a key gap in Hessian thermodynamic geometry. Additionally, we link the scale factor to the sign of thermodynamic curvature, connecting it to the information geometry governing optimal processes. Our results indicate that optimal fluctuations can drive the evaporation of Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, which may significantly differ from Hawking radiation. We also explore optimal accretion-driven processes supported by an external inflow of energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic Gaussian thermal states form a fundamental class of states in quantum information science. This paper explores the information geometry of these states, focusing on characterizing the distance between two nearby states and the geometry induced by a parameterization in terms of their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices. In particular, for the family of bosonic Gaussian thermal states, we derive expressions for their Fisher-Bures, Kubo-Mori, and $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices with respect to their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices. An important application of our formulas consists of fundamental limits on how well one can estimate these parameters. We additionally establish formulas for the derivatives and the symmetric logarithmic derivatives of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. The former could have applications in gradient descent algorithms for quantum machine learning when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz, and the latter in formulating optimal strategies for single parameter estimation of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. Finally, the expressions for the aforementioned information matrices could have additional applications in natural gradient descent algorithms when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain wall (DW) networks may have formed in the early universe following the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry. Notably, several particle physics models predict the existence of current-carrying DWs, which can capture and store particles as zero modes on it. In this study, we demonstrate that gravitational waves (GWs) generated by current-carrying DWs with fermionic zeromodes exhibit a novel feature: an additional peak in the GW spectrum resembling mountains, arising from metastable topological remnants, which we term ``spherons.'' This distinct signature could be detectable in upcoming GW observatories such as LISA and ET. The results suggest that DW networks in beyond Standard Model scenarios could emit GW signals that are significantly stronger and with greater detectability than previously expected.</description>

Abstract: The unification of quantum theory and the general theory of relativity - describing gravity, is one of the most important challenges in science. Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence, and has been confirmed to great accuracy for large bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase, equal to the quantum phase of a free-falling object. To measure this phase, we realize a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave-packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. The observed relative-phase of the wave-packets confirms the predicted phase of a free-falling object, and shows that in our low energy regime, the equivalence principle may be applied to the quantum domain. Our observation constitutes a fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</description>

      <title>Axion forces in axion backgrounds</title>

Abstract: Axions can naturally be very light due to the protection of an (approximate) shift symmetry. Because of their pseudoscalar nature, the long-range force mediated by the axion at tree level is spin dependent, which cannot lead to observable effects between two unpolarized macroscopic objects. At the one-loop level, however, the exchange of two axions does mediate a spin-independent force. This force is coherently enhanced in the presence of an axion background. In this work, we study the two-axion exchange force in a generic axion background. We find that the breaking of the axion shift symmetry plays a crucial role in determining this force. The background-induced axion force $V_{\rm bkg}$ vanishes in the shift-symmetry restoration limit. The shift symmetry can be broken either explicitly by non-perturbative effects or effectively by the axion background. When the shift symmetry is broken, $V_{\rm bkg}$ scales as $1/r$ and could be further enhanced by a large occupation number of the background axions. We investigate possible experimental probes of this effect in two distinct scenarios: an axion dark matter background and a solar axion flux, using fifth-force searches and atomic spectroscopy experiments. In the axion dark matter case, we find that the background-induced axion force can place strong constraints on axion couplings and masses, comparable to existing astrophysical bounds.</description>

      <title>Event-shape dependence of symmetry plane correlations using the Gaussian estimator in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC using a multiphase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of symmetry plane correlations (SPCs) can be useful in characterizing the direction of the anisotropic emission of produced particles in the final state. The study of SPCs provides an independent method to understand the transport properties of the system formed in heavy-ion collisions. Similar to anisotropic flow coefficients, which are largely influenced by the initial spatial anisotropy, SPCs also depend upon the participant plane correlations measured using the participating nucleons of the collision overlap region. In this paper, SPCs have been studied in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV using the event generator AMPT. In addition to their behaviour with the changing centrality of the collision, their event shape dependence has also been studied for the first time, using the event shape classifier transverse spherocity. The Gaussian estimator has been used to evaluate the correlations, and these have been compared to the participant plane correlations defined in an analogous way to the symmetry plane correlations, and a qualitative match has been found between them. These event-shape differentiated symmetry plane correlations can be used to deduce the presence of higher-order anisotropies in the initial energy distribution, thus giving insight into the initial geometry of the colliding system, among other applications like model development and model testing using Bayesian analyses.</description>

      <title>Spacetime boundaries do not break diffeomorphism and gauge symmetries</title>

Abstract: In General Relativity and gauge field theory, one often encounters a claim, which may be called the boundary problem, according to which "boundaries break diffeomorphism and gauge symmetries". We argue that this statement has the same conceptual structure as the hole argument, and is thus likewise defused by the point-coincidence argument: We show that the boundary problem dissolves once it is understood that a physical region, thus its boundary, is relationally and invariantly defined. This insight can be technically implemented via the Dressing Field Method, a systematic tool to exhibit the gauge-invariant content of general-relativistic gauge field theories, whereby physical field-theoretical degrees of freedom co-define each other and define, coordinatize, the physical spacetime. We illustrate our claim with a simple application to the case of General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Dark Walker in the Early Universe: A Strongly Coupled Sector Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06454v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenology of the ``Dark Walker'' -- an $\text{SU}(3)$ theory with eight flavors of massless fundamental fermions in the dark sector. During inflation, its walking dynamics generate primordial non-Gaussianities through the exchange of unparticles, while accounting for the current dark matter relic abundance if we consider freeze-in of Dark Walker coupled to the Standard Model through the Higgs portal. This provides a simple yet predictive example linking strongly coupled inflationary dynamics to present-day dark matter.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric figure of merit and the deconfinement phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric phenomena are traditionally associated with the interconversion of thermal and electrical energy in many-body systems. In the context of high-temperature quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, thermoelectric responses can provide insight into the evolving microscopic dynamics and the redistribution of effective degrees of freedom across the phase transition region. In this work, for the first time, we present a phenomenological study of the thermoelectric figure of merit (\( ZT \)) in hot QCD matter, with a particular focus on its behavior across the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma phases. Using model-based calculations for the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity, we analyze the temperature dependence of \( ZT \) and identify characteristic features near the QCD phase transition temperature. Our results indicate that \( ZT \) exhibits nontrivial behavior near the transition region, reflecting the changing transport properties and active degrees of freedom in the medium. This phenomenological study of the thermoelectric figure of merit provides a complementary perspective to traditional transport studies and may provide critical insights for advancing the understanding of QCD matter through the transition region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we utilize the maximum entropy prescription to determine a quantum state of a small collision system at the kinetic freeze-out. We derive expressions for multiplicity-selected particle momentum spectra and correlation functions by applying a fixed particle number constraint to this state. The results of our analysis can be useful for interpreting the multiplicity dependence of the particle momentum spectra and correlations in high-multiplicity $pp$ collision events at a fixed LHC energy.</description>

      <title>A Conceptual Introduction To Signature Change Through a Natural Extension of Kaluza-Klein Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension of basic Kaluza-Klein theory in which the higher-dimensional Lorentzian manifold develops a Cauchy horizon rather than remaining globally hyperbolic as in the conventional framework. In this setting, the $U(1)$-generating Killing field, assumed to exist in Kaluza-Klein theory, undergoes a transition in its causal character, from spacelike in the globally hyperbolic region to timelike in an acausal extension through a horizon. This yields a (lower-dimensional) quotient manifold whose metric changes signature from Lorentzian to Riemannian. In this way, one observes a singular, signature changing transition emerging rather naturally from the projection of a globally smooth, even analytic, Lorentzian geometry ``up in the bundle''. This reveals a ``signature change without signature change'' scenario -- a phrasing inspired by John Wheeler -- and extends the usual Kaluza-Klein framework in a conceptually natural direction.</description>

      <title>Field Theoretic Approach to Interacting Two Body Tunneling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11656v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two body tunneling problems are hard to treat analytically due to the incompatibility between tunneling and perturbation theory. The lack of classical solutions of the Euclidean Lagrangian of continuous systems further thwarts semi-classical expansions. To develop an analytic theory which provides insight on interacting two-particle tunneling, we use new results to derive the Bethe-Salpeter equation of a tunneling field theory with Yukawa coupling. We show that in the one plus one dimensional case a closed form solution in the instantaneous positive-energy regime is permitted. We then compute the scattering amplitude by perturbing on interparticle interaction and recover the Lippmann-Schwinger equation to confirm physical consistency and relevancy.</description>

Abstract: Any given system of ordinary differential equations in $n$-dimensional configuration space can be obtained from a peculiar variational problem with one local symmetry. The obtained action functional leads to the Hamiltonian formulation in $(4n+2)$-dimensional phase space. As concrete examples, we discuss the cases of Lagrange-d'Alembert equations with nonlinear nonholonomic constraints, as well as the equations of motion with dissipative (frictional) forces.</description>

      <title>A Self Propelled Vortex Dipole Model on a Catenoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate vortex dipoles on surfaces of variable negative curvature, focusing on a catenoid of arbitrary throat radius as a concrete example. We construct the effective dynamical system including mutual and geometric self-interaction terms and show that the resulting Hamiltonian dynamics makes dipoles follow catenoid geodesics, in agreement with recent works, Gustafsson (J. Nonlinear Sci. 32, 62, 2022) and by Drivas, Glukhovskiy and Khesin (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, 14, 10880-10894). We utilize the symplectic structure to find a conserved momentum map J related to the U(1) symmetry along the azimuthal direction. We verify the conservation of both the Hamiltonian and this momentum for arbitrary throat radius. We then demonstrate direct and exchange scattering of classical vortices on the catenoid, and we contrast this with the collective rotational motion (with azimuthal drift) that arises for chiral pairs. Finally, we build a finite-dipole dynamical system on the catenoid and show that the self-propulsion terms emerge to leading order in the dipole size. This provides a concrete realization, on a curved minimal surface, of the intuitive statement that a finite dipole propels orthogonal to the dipole axis, with a speed modulated by curvature.</description>

      <title>Testing Quantum Gravity with Gravitational Waves from the ringdown of binary Black Holes coalescences: A New Frontier in Fundamental Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves emitted during the merging phase of compact binary coalescing objects has opened a new field of investigation in fundamental physics. It is now possible to test the predictions of General Relativity with unprecedented precision in the strong gravitational field regime. These initial observations therefore call for further research, as the detection of gravitational waves emitted by coalescing black holes may allow the investigation of the properties of spacetime near the event horizon, also providing valuable information on the structure of these objects. This also opens the possibility of testing predictions from quantum gravity models regarding the presumed quantized structure of black holes, related to the quantization of their surface and, consequently, their entropy. In the future, the considerable amount of data obtained by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration will be followed by observations from next-generation interferometers such as the Einstein Telescope or the Cosmic Explorer. It is therefore of great interest to explore the potential of gravitational wave observations for investigating aspects of quantum gravity, which we will address considering the special case of the ringdown emission following the coalescence of binary black hole systems.</description>

      <title>NLO heavy-quark contributions to DIS structure functions in the ACOT scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present next-to-leading-order (NLO) calculations of heavy-quark contributions to deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) structure functions $F_4$ and $F_5$ within the Aivazis--Collins--Olness--Tung (ACOT) scheme, implemented in the open source library \texttt{APFEL++} using \texttt{CT18NLO} parton distribution functions. These structure functions, suppressed by lepton mass effects in light-lepton processes, become significant in muon, tau-lepton and neutrino scattering at facilities such as SHiP, IceCube, and DUNE. Our results reveal NLO corrections up to 10\% relative to leading order, with pronounced heavy-quark effects at low Bjorken-$x$, impacting gluon and strange quark distributions. In the unpolarized case, $F_{4/5}^{\gamma Z}$ and $F_{4/5}^{\gamma}$ do not contribute to the cross section, while the $\gamma Z$ interference becomes accessible with longitudinally polarized lepton beams at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), offering enhanced sensitivity at low $Q^2$ due to reduced $Z$-boson propagator suppression. Analytical NLO expressions have also been derived for the polarized structure functions $g_1$, $g_4$, $g_5$, $g_6$, and $g_7$ in the ACOT framework. These developments enable precise theoretical predictions for upcoming experimental programs and global QCD analyses.</description>

      <title>Flavored QCD axion and Modular invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A four-dimensional effective model with $G_{\rm SM}\times SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) \times U(1)_X$ is proposed in string-derived supergravity framework, where $G_{\rm SM}$ is the Standard Model (SM) gauge group and $U(1)_X$ is gauged. We show $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$- and $U(1)_X$-mixed anomalies should vanish. Anomalies induced by K{\"a}hler transformations match those from gaugino chiral rotations. When SM fermions transform nontrivially under $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$, and with vanishing gaugino contributions, the anomaly-free conditions are powerful enough to determine the quark and lepton flavor structures, set scales for $U(1)_X$ breaking, and ensure the strong CP phase remains unmodified. While the Green-Schwarz coefficient $\delta^{\rm GS}_X$ is generically non-zero, vanishing $U(1)_X$ anomalies cause gauge boson decoupling and $\delta^{\rm GS}_X\rightarrow 0$, yielding a massless global $U(1)_X$ without a Nambu-Goldstone mode. We show that the modulus vacuum expectation value stabilizes near $\langle\tau\rangle \approx i$, where exact $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ ($T$-duality) is spontaneously broken, removing residual modular symmetry. The framework predicts seesaw-generated neutrino masses and flavored axion properties, with all Yukawa coefficients constrained to unit-magnitude complex numbers. Our model reproduces current quark and lepton data, predicts an axion mass $m_a\approx0.9\times10^{-2}$ eV and photon coupling $|g_{a\gamma\gamma}|\approx1.7\times10^{-13}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, and unlike the ordinary case, suppresses flavor-violating axion couplings to $s,d$ quarks and $\mu,e$ leptons to $\mathcal{O}(\lambda^4)$ (with $\lambda$ the Cabibbo angle). It also yields normal neutrino mass hierarchy consistent with oscillation data, $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay rate, and cosmological and astrophysical measurements.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we attempt to construct the topological theory of superfluid helium $4$ in the framework of the (rigid) $U(1)$ model in which the initial $U(1)$ group is destroyed with appearance of (topologically nontrivial) domains separated by domain walls treated as step voltages between domains (e.g. with neighboring topological numbers). This can explain the superfluid properties in a helium $4$ specimen as well as the appearance of topologically nontrivial vortices therein.</description>

      <title>Effects of New Forces on Scalar Dark Matter Solitons</title>

Abstract: New long range forces acting on ordinary matter are highly constrained. However it is possible such forces act on dark matter, as it is less constrained observationally. In this work, we consider dark matter to be made of light bosons, such as axions. We introduce a mediator that communicates a new force between dark matter particles, in addition to gravity. The mediator is taken to be light, but not massless, so that it can affect small scale galactic behavior, but not current cosmological behavior. As a concrete application of this idea, we analyze the effects on scalar dark matter solitons bound by gravitation, i.e., boson stars, which have been claimed to potentially provide cores of galaxies. We numerically determine the soliton's profiles in the presence of this new force. We also extend the analysis to multiple mediators. We show that this new force alters the relation between core density and core radius in a way that can provide improvement in fitting data to observed galactic cores, but for couplings of order the gravitational strength, the improvement is only modest.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of a static black hole in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02714</link>

Abstract: We investigate the axial electromagnetic quasinormal modes of a static, asymptotically Anti--de Sitter (AdS) black hole sourced by a nonlinear electrodynamics model of Pleba\'{n}ski type. Starting from the master equation governing axial perturbations, we impose ingoing boundary conditions at the event horizon and normalizable (Dirichlet) behavior at the AdS boundary. Following the approach of Jansen, we recast the radial equation into a linear generalized eigenvalue problem by using an ingoing Eddington--Finkelstein formulation, compactifying the radial domain, and regularizing the asymptotic coefficients. The resulting problem is solved using a Chebyshev--Lobatto pseudospectral discretization. We compute the fundamental quasinormal mode frequencies for both the purely electric ($Q_m=0$) and purely magnetic ($Q_e=0$) sectors, emphasizing the role of the nonlinearity parameter $\beta$ and the effective charge magnitude $Q$. Our results show that increasing either $\beta$ or $Q$ raises both the oscillation frequency $\omega_R$ and the damping rate $-\omega_I$, leading to faster but more rapidly decaying ringdown profiles. Nonlinear electrodynamics breaks the isospectrality between electric and magnetic configurations: magnetic modes are systematically less oscillatory and more weakly damped than their electric counterparts. For sufficiently large $\beta$ and small $Q_m$, the fundamental mode becomes purely imaginary ($\omega_R \approx 0$), in agreement with the absence of a trapping potential barrier in this regime. These findings reveal qualitative signatures of nonlinear electromagnetic effects on black hole perturbations and may have implications for high-field or high-charge astrophysical environments.</description>
