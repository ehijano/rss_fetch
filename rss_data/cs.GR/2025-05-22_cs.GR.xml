      <title>Dynamic Caustics by Ultrasonically Modulated Liquid Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for generating dynamic caustic patterns by utilising dual-optimised holographic fields with Phased Array Transducer (PAT). Building on previous research in static caustic optimisation and ultrasonic manipulation, this approach employs computational techniques to dynamically shape fluid surfaces, thereby creating controllable and real-time caustic images. The system employs a Digital Twin framework, which enables iterative feedback and refinement, thereby improving the accuracy and quality of the caustic patterns produced. This paper extends the foundational work in caustic generation by integrating liquid surfaces as refractive media. This concept has previously been explored in simulations but not fully realised in practical applications. The utilisation of ultrasound to directly manipulate these surfaces enables the generation of dynamic caustics with a high degree of flexibility. The Digital Twin approach further enhances this process by allowing for precise adjustments and optimisation based on real-time feedback. Experimental results demonstrate the technique's capacity to generate continuous animations and complex caustic patterns at high frequencies. Although there are limitations in contrast and resolution compared to solid-surface methods, this approach offers advantages in terms of real-time adaptability and scalability. This technique has the potential to be applied in a number of areas, including interactive displays, artistic installations and educational tools. This research builds upon the work of previous researchers in the fields of caustics optimisation, ultrasonic manipulation, and computational displays. Future research will concentrate on enhancing the resolution and intricacy of the generated patterns.</description>

      <title>From Reality to Virtual Worlds: The Role of Photogrammetry in Game Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photogrammetry is transforming digital content creation by enabling the rapid conversion of real-world objects into highly detailed 3D models. This paper evaluates the role of RealityCapture, a GPU-accelerated photogrammetry tool, in game development of Virtual Reality (VR). We assess its efficiency, reconstruction accuracy, and integration with Unreal Engine, comparing its advantages and limitations against traditional modeling workflows. Additionally, we examined user preferences between designed 3D assets and photogrammetry-generated models. The results revealed that while photogrammetry enhances realism and interactivity, users slightly preferred manually designed models for small, manipulable elements because of the level of detail. However, from a developer perspective, RealityCapture significantly reduces development time while maintaining geometric precision and photorealistic textures. Despite its reliance on high-performance hardware, its automation, scalability, and seamless integration with real-time rendering engines make it a valuable tool for game developers and VR creators. Future improvements in AI-driven optimization and cloud-based processing could enhance accessibility, broadening its applications in gaming, cultural heritage preservation, and simulation.</description>

      <title>AniSora: Exploring the Frontiers of Animation Video Generation in the Sora Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10255v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Animation has gained significant interest in the recent film and TV industry. Despite the success of advanced video generation models like Sora, Kling, and CogVideoX in generating natural videos, they lack the same effectiveness in handling animation videos. Evaluating animation video generation is also a great challenge due to its unique artist styles, violating the laws of physics and exaggerated motions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive system, AniSora, designed for animation video generation, which includes a data processing pipeline, a controllable generation model, and an evaluation benchmark. Supported by the data processing pipeline with over 10M high-quality data, the generation model incorporates a spatiotemporal mask module to facilitate key animation production functions such as image-to-video generation, frame interpolation, and localized image-guided animation. We also collect an evaluation benchmark of 948 various animation videos, with specifically developed metrics for animation video generation. Our entire project is publicly available on https://github.com/bilibili/Index-anisora/tree/main.</description>

      <title>Supervising 3D Talking Head Avatars with Analysis-by-Audio-Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to be widely applicable, speech-driven 3D head avatars must articulate their lips in accordance with speech, while also conveying the appropriate emotions with dynamically changing facial expressions. The key problem is that deterministic models produce high-quality lip-sync but without rich expressions, whereas stochastic models generate diverse expressions but with lower lip-sync quality. To get the best of both, we seek a stochastic model with accurate lip-sync. To that end, we develop a new approach based on the following observation: if a method generates realistic 3D lip motions, it should be possible to infer the spoken audio from the lip motion. The inferred speech should match the original input audio, and erroneous predictions create a novel supervision signal for training 3D talking head avatars with accurate lip-sync. To demonstrate this effect, we propose THUNDER (Talking Heads Under Neural Differentiable Elocution Reconstruction), a 3D talking head avatar framework that introduces a novel supervision mechanism via differentiable sound production. First, we train a novel mesh-to-speech model that regresses audio from facial animation. Then, we incorporate this model into a diffusion-based talking avatar framework. During training, the mesh-to-speech model takes the generated animation and produces a sound that is compared to the input speech, creating a differentiable analysis-by-audio-synthesis supervision loop. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that THUNDER significantly improves the quality of the lip-sync of talking head avatars while still allowing for generation of diverse, high-quality, expressive facial animations. The code and models will be available at https://thunder.is.tue.mpg.de/</description>
