      <title>Time dependence of neutrino quantum kinetics in a core-collapse supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of neutrino flavor conversion in the supernova core is still preliminary, despite its likely relevance to the neutrino-driven supernova mechanism. We present multi-angle and multi-energy numerical simulations of neutrino quantum kinetics within a spherically symmetric shell in the proximity of the region of neutrino decoupling. We rely on inputs from a one-dimensional core-collapse supernova model with a mass of $18.6\ M_\odot$ and find that, at early post-bounce times ($t_{\mathrm pb} \lesssim 0.5$ s), no crossing is present in the angular distribution of the electron neutrino lepton number and flavor conversion develops due to vacuum mixing. Angular crossings appear for $t_{\textrm{pb}} \gtrsim 0.5$ s and fast flavor conversion leads to flavor equipartition, with the spectral energy distribution of $\nu_{e}$ ($\bar{\nu}_{e}$) and $\nu_{x}$ ($\bar{\nu}_{x}$) becoming comparable. Notably, flavor equipartition is not a generic outcome of fast flavor conversion, but rather a consequence of the relatively similar properties of neutrinos of different flavors characterizing the late accretion phase. Artificially tweaking the collision term to introduce an electron lepton number angular crossing for $t_{\mathrm{pb}} \lesssim 0.05$ s, we observe that flavor equipartition is not achieved. While our findings are restricted to a specific supernova model, they suggest a rich phenomenology of flavor conversion in the supernova core as a function of the post-bounce time which needs to be further explored to assess its impact on the explosion mechanism.</description>

      <title>Properties of magnetic turbulence in GRB afterglows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model-independent way to characterise properties of the magnetic-field turbulence in the emitting regions of Gamma-Ray Burst afterglows. Our only assumption is that afterglows' synchrotron radiation is efficient. It turns out that the gyroradius of plasma particles must be smaller (with a good margin) than the correlation length of the magnetic-field fluctuations. Such turbulence is essentially non-linear and therefore must be produced by some kind of MHD instability, likely acting on top of kinetic Weibel instability. We also find that the emitting particles are loosely confined to local magnetic-field structures and diffusion allows them to sample the entire distribution of local magnetization values. This means that one-zone approach to modelling the afterglow spectra is still valid despite the non-linear nature of the magnetic turbulence. However, the non-linear turbulence may (and likely will) change the synchrotron spectrum of individual electrons.</description>

      <title>A quantitative explanation of the cyclotron-line variation in accreting magnetic neutron stars of super-critical luminosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic neutron stars (NSs) often exhibit a cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) in their X-ray spectra. Cyclotron lines are believed to form in the radiative shock in the accretion column. High-luminosity NSs show a smooth anti-correlation between the cyclotron-line centroid ($E_{CRSF}$) and X-ray luminosity ($L_X$). The observed $E_{CRSF}-L_X$ smooth anti-correlation has been in tension with the theoretically predicted one by the radiative shock model. Since there is no other candidate site for the cyclotron-line formation, we re-examine the predicted rate of change of the cyclotron-line energy with luminosity at the radiative shock, taking a closer look at the Physics involved. We developed a purely analytical model describing the overall dependence of the observed cyclotron energy centroid on the shock front's height, including the relativistic boosting effect due to the mildly relativistic motion of the accreting plasma upstream with respect to the shock's reference frame and the gravitational redshift. We find that the CRSF energy varies with a) the shock height due to the dipolar magnetic field, b) the Doppler boosting between the shock and bulk-motion frames, and c) the gravitational redshift. We show that the relativistic effects noticeably weaken the predicted $E_{CRSF}-L_X$ anti-correlation. We use our model to fit the data of the X-ray source V0332+53 and demonstrate that the model fits the data impressively well, alleviating the tension between observations and theory. The reported $E_{CRSF}-L_X$ weak anti-correlation in the supercritical accretion regime may be explained by the combination of the variation of the magnetic-field strength along the accretion column, the effect of Doppler boosting, and the gravitational redshift. Thus, the actual magnetic field on the NS surface may be a factor of $\sim 2$ larger than the naively inferred value from the observed CRSF.</description>

      <title>The influence of environmental effects on Type Ia Supernovae Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are used as reliable cosmic distance indicators and their standardization is necessary for a more accurate measurement of the cosmological parameters of the Universe. However, the Hubble diagram still shows some intrinsic dispersion, potentially influenced by the supernova's environment. In this study, we reproduce the Hubble diagram fit for the Pantheon supernova sample, and also investigate the possibility of introducing various standardization equations for supernovae exploded in early- and late-type galaxies. We analyze 330 Pantheon SNe Ia to study how host galaxy morphology affects their standardization. We find that SNe Ia hosted by early-type galaxies have different standardization parameters compared to those hosted by late-type galaxies. We conclude that correcting supernova luminosity for host galaxy morphology is essential to perform the precise cosmological analysis.</description>

      <title>The gravitational-wave emission from the explosion of a 15 solar mass star with rotation and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waveform predictions from 3D simulations of explosions of non-rotating massive stars with no magnetic fields have been extensively studied. However, the impact of magnetic fields and rotation on the core-collapse supernova gravitational-wave signal is not well understood beyond the core-bounce phase. Therefore, we perform four magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the explosion of a $15\,M_{\odot}$ star with the SFHx and SFHo equations of state. All of the models start with a weak magnetic field strength of $10^{8}$\,G, and two of the models are rapidly rotating. We discuss the impact of the rotation and magnetic fields on the gravitational-wave signals. We find that the weak pre-collapse fields do not have a significant impact on the gravitational-wave signal amplitude. With rapid rotation, the f/g-mode trajectory can change in shape, and the dominant emission band becomes broader. We include the low-frequency memory component of the gravitational-wave signal from both matter motions and neutrino emission anisotropy. We show that including the gravitational waves from anisotropic neutrino emission increases the supernova detection distances for the Einstein Telescope, and would also be detectable out to Mpc distances by a moon-based gravitational-wave detector.</description>

      <title>Cosmological simulations of the generation of cluster-scale radio emission from turbulent re-acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The recent discovery of so-called mega radio halos as a new class of diffuse, steep-spectrum radio sources in clusters of galaxies has raised questions about the origin and the evolution of cluster-wide radio emission. Aims. We investigate whether the formation mechanisms of radio halos and mega radio halos differ, or whether they can be produced by different modalities of the same (re)acceleration mechanism. Here we present results of a cosmological simulation of a disturbed galaxy cluster, with the aim to study the origin of mega radio halos. Methods. We analysed the evolution of cosmic-ray electrons, subject to gains and losses using a Fokker-Planck solver. In particular, we included the effects of Adiabatic Stochastic Acceleration (ASA) which is caused by the stochastic interaction of cosmic rays with diffusing magnetic field lines in super-Alfvenic turbulence. Moreover, we included shock acceleration and the seeding of cosmic-ray electrons by galaxies. Results. Our simulations generate cluster-scale radio sources during mergers, with properties that are in agreement with those observed for real radio halos. Furthermore, we find evidence of additional emission on larger scales. This emission resembles the radial distribution and the spectrum of a mega radio halo, but only when viewed close to the merger axis. Conclusions. In our simulation, the mechanism responsible for the formation of diffuse radio emission, both in the form of classical and mega radio halos, is cosmic-ray re-acceleration by turbulence. This turbulence is more solenoidal and more subsonic in the classical radio halo region, than in the mega radio halo region.</description>

      <title>On the Interacting/Active Lifetime of Supernova Fallback Disk around Isolated Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fallback disk model is widely accepted to explain long-period neutron stars (NSs) which can't be simulated by magnetic dipole radiation. However, no confirmed detection of disk was found from the newly discovered long period pulsars GLEAM-X 162759.5-523504.3, GPM J1839-10 and the known slowest isolated NSs 1E 161348-5055. This might be that the disks have either been in noninteracting/inactive state where its emission is too weak to be detected or have been disrupted. In this work, we conduct simulations to examine the lifetime of supernova fallback disks around isolated neutron stars. We assume that the disk's mass varies in a self-similar way and its interaction with the NS occurs only in interacting/active state. Our results reveal that nearly all the interacting lifetimes for the disk are shorter than 0.1 Myr while the existence lifetimes are considerably longer.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Spacetime and Properties of Accretion Flows and Jets Probed by Black Hole Explorer: Science Cases Proposed by BHEX Japan Team</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is a space VLBI mission concept, which can probe the black hole spacetime and the plasma properties including the magnetic fields of the accretion flows and relativistic jets. We propose science cases anticipated to be addressed by BHEX mainly via the imaging of the target objects, whose observational features appear in several microarcsecond scale. An appearance of a crescent-shaped shadow in a bright state of the M87 will be able to constrain the magnitude of the black hole spin. A possible appearance of the plasma injection region in the vicinity of the black hole results in the formation of the multiple ring structure and may enable us to understand the jet formation processes. In addition, The separation of linear and circular polarization fluxes and reversal of circular polarization will constrain the magnetic field structure and the thermal properties of the electrons, respectively. Other topics including the test of the gravitational theory are also being discussed.</description>

      <title>Exploring the archives: A search for novae in UVIT snapshots of M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive multi-wavelength studies of novae have been carried out in our galaxy and in M31 for decades. However, UV studies of extragalactic novae are limited, especially those in quiescence. For the first time, we present a UV catalog of novae in M31 using the archival AstroSat UVIT imaging data. We used two image subtraction techniques to retrieve objects located deep into the M31 central region. We have found 42 novae in total in the UVIT images, 15 of which have been detected in multiple filters in FUV and NUV. The novae detected at quiescence show signatures of accretion disk from their UV spectral energy distributions, whereas those in the outburst phase show signatures of pseudo-photosphere. A few novae were also detected in multiple epochs. Some show a near-constant FUV magnitude at quiescence, while others caught near the outburst reveal pre-eruption dips in their light curves. We conclude with a discussion on the significance of UV surveys in illuminating theoretical predictions for novae systems, including detecting the elusive early UV flash.</description>

      <title>The Black Hole Explorer: Photon Ring Science, Detection and Shape Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativity predicts that black hole images ought to display a bright, thin (and as-of-yet-unresolved) ring. This "photon ring" is produced by photons that explore the strong gravity of the black hole, flowing along trajectories that experience extreme light bending within a few Schwarzschild radii of the horizon before escaping. The shape of the photon ring is largely insensitive to the precise details of the emission from the astronomical source surrounding the black hole and therefore provides a direct probe of the Kerr geometry and its parameters. The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is a proposed space-based experiment targeting the supermassive black holes M87* and Sgr A* with radio-interferometric observations at frequencies of 100 GHz through 300 GHz and from an orbital distance of ~30,000 km. This design will enable measurements of the photon rings around both M87* and Sgr A*, confirming the Kerr nature of these sources and delivering sharp estimates of their masses and spins.</description>

      <title>The Japanese Vision for the Black Hole Explorer Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is a next-generation space very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) mission concept that will extend the ground-based millimeter/submillimeter arrays into space. The mission, closely aligned with the science priorities of the Japanese VLBI community, involves an active engagement of this community in the development of the mission, resulting in the formation of the Black Hole Explorer Japan Consortium. Here we present the current Japanese vision for the mission, ranging from scientific objectives to instrumentation. The Consortium anticipates a wide range of scientific investigations, from diverse black hole physics and astrophysics studied through the primary VLBI mode, to the molecular universe explored via a potential single-dish observation mode in the previously unexplored 50-70\,GHz band that would make BHEX the highest-sensitivity explorer ever of molecular oxygen. A potential major contribution for the onboard instrument involves supplying essential elements for its high-sensitivity dual-band receiving system, which includes a broadband 300\,GHz SIS mixer and a space-certified multi-stage 4.5K cryocooler akin to those used in the Hitomi and XRISM satellites by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Additionally, the Consortium explores enhancing and supporting BHEX operations through the use of millimeter/submillimeter facilities developed by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, coupled with a network of laser communication stations operated by the National Institute of Information and Communication Technology.</description>

      <title>Diffuse X-ray Explorer: a high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic sky surveyor on the China Space Station</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DIffuse X-ray Explorer (DIXE) is a proposed high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic sky surveyor on the China Space Station (CSS). DIXE will focus on studying hot baryons in the Milky Way. Galactic hot baryons like the X-ray emitting Milky Way halo and eROSITA bubbles are best observed in the sky survey mode with a large field of view. DIXE will take advantage of the orbital motion of the CSS to scan a large fraction of the sky. High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy, enabled by superconducting microcalorimeters based on the transition-edge sensor (TES) technology, will probe the physical properties (e.g., temperature, density, elemental abundances, kinematics) of the Galactic hot baryons. This will complement the high-resolution imaging data obtained with the eROSITA mission. Here we present the preliminary design of DIXE. The payload consists mainly of a detector assembly and a cryogenic cooling system. The key components of the detector assembly are a microcalorimeter array and frequency-domain multiplexing readout electronics. To provide a working temperature for the detector assembly, the cooling system consists of an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator and a mechanical cryocooler system.</description>

      <title>The Black Hole Explorer Cryocooling Instrument</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is a space-based very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) mission aimed at precision black hole measurements, detecting the photon ring around black holes, exploring spacetime, spin, and mass properties, and validating predictions of General Relativity. These objectives are achieved using cryogenic receivers with quantum-limited sensitivities across a broad frequency range. Dual-band receivers at 80-106 GHz and 240-320 GHz require operating temperatures of 20 K and 4.5 K, respectively. A cryocooling system with two cold stages will be employed: a 20 K stage handling a 125 mW heat load and a 4.5 K stage handling a 10 mW heat load.
  To design the cryocooling system, the mission leverages existing space industry technology at high Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), informed by missions such as Planck, JEM/SMILES, Hitomi, and XRISM, and advancements from the ACTDP/JWST program. Integrating the cryocooler with the receivers and broader instrument involves careful consideration of thermal challenges, including linking the cold ends of each cooling stage to minimize heat losses and ensuring adequate passive cooling for the cryocooler warm end heat rejection.
  Key challenges and trade-offs include sizing the mass and reducing power consumption while meeting the receiver cold temperature requirements, which impact the scientific objectives. This paper addresses efforts to balance the scientific requirements with the limitations of technical cryocooling capabilities within the framework of a small-class (SMEX) space mission, presenting an overview of cooling needs, initial design considerations, a survey of 4 K spaceflight cryocooler developments, and trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of slowly-spinning horizonless compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main predictions of general relativity is the existence of black holes featuring a horizon beyond which nothing can escape. Gravitational waves from the remnants of compact binary coalescences have the potential to probe new physics at the BH horizons. This prospect is of particular interest given several quantum-gravity models that predict the presence of horizonless compact objects. The membrane paradigm is a generic framework that allows one to parametrise the interior of compact objects in terms of the properties of a fictitious fluid located at the object's radius. It has been used to derive the quasinormal mode spectrum of static horizonless compact objects. Extending the membrane paradigm to rotating objects is crucial to constrain the properties of the spinning merger remnants. In this work, we extend the membrane paradigm to linear order in spin and use it to analyse the relationships between the quasi-normal modes, the reflectivity, and the membrane parameters. We find that the spin tends to increase the damping time of the fundamental mode for reflective ultracompact objects. We also find a breaking of isospectrality between axial and polar modes, and that the spin enhances the deviations from the black hole quasinormal mode spectrum as the compactness decreases. We thus show that spinning horizonless compact objects may be more easily differentiated than nonspinning ones in the prompt ringdown.</description>

      <title>Carbon Monoxide Cooling in Radiative Transfer Modeling of Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon monoxide (CO) emission has been observed in a number of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and is known to be an important coolant at late times. We have implemented a chemical reaction network in the radiative-transfer code CMFGEN to investigate the formation of CO and its impact on SN ejecta. We calculate two 1D SN models with and without CO: a BSG explosion model at one nebular epoch and a full time sequence (50 to 300 days) for a RSG explosion. In both models, CO forms at nebular times in the dense, inner regions at velocities $&lt;2000 \mathrm{km/s}$ where line emission from CO can dominate the cooling and reduce the local temperature by as much as a factor of two, weakening emission lines and causing the optical light curve to fade faster. That energy is instead emitted in CO bands, primarily the fundamental band at $\sim 4.5\mathrm{\mu m}$, which accounts for up to 20% of the total luminosity at late times. However, the non-monotonic nature of the CO cooling function can cause numerical difficulties and introduce multiple temperature solutions. This issue is compounded by the sensitivity of the CO abundance to a few reaction rates, many of which have large uncertainties or disparate values across literature sources. Our results also suggest that, in many SNe, CO level populations are far from their LTE values. Unfortunately, accurate collisional data, necessary to compute NLTE populations, are limited to a few transitions.</description>

Abstract: We present 3D fully kinetic shearing-box simulations of pair-plasma magnetorotational turbulence with unprecedented macro-to-microscopic scale separation. While retrieving the expected fluid behavior of the plasma at large scales, we observe a steepening of turbulent spectra at kinetic scales and substantial angular-momentum transport linked with kinetic processes. For the first time, we provide a definitive demonstration of nonthermal particle acceleration in kinetic magnetorotational turbulence agnostically of initial conditions, by means of a novel strategy exploiting synchrotron cooling.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional models of core-collapse supernova explosions assisted by heavy sterile neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae can be a copious source of sterile neutrinos, hypothetical particles that mix with active neutrinos. We develop two-dimensional stellar core-collapse models that incorporate the mixing between tau neutrinos and heavy sterile neutrinos -- those with the mass of 150--200 MeV -- to investigate signatures of sterile neutrinos in supernova observables. We find that the decay channel of a sterile neutrino into a pion and a tau neutrino can enhance the explosion energy and the synthesized nickel mass. Although the inclusion of sterile neutrinos considered in this study slightly reduce the neutrino and gravitational-wave signals, we find that they are still detectable for a Galactic event. Furthermore, we point out that if sterile neutrinos are as massive as ~200 MeV, they produce high-energy tau antineutrinos with energies of ~80 MeV, the detection of which can be a smoking signature of the sterile neutrinos and where Hyper-Kamiokande should play a pivotal role.</description>

      <title>A semi-analytical model for the propagation of a structured jet in a magnetized medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The merger of two magnetized compact objects, such as neutron stars, forms a compact object which may launch a relativistic and collimated jet. Numerical simulations of the process show that a dense and highly magnetized medium surrounds the system. This study presents a semi-analytical model that models the effects that a static magnetized medium with a tangled field produces in relativistic, collimated, and non-magnetized jets. The model is a first approximation that addresses the magnetic field present in the medium and is based on pressure equilibrium principles between the jet, cocoon, and external medium. A fraction of the ambient medium field is allowed to be entrained in the cocoon. We find that the jet and cocoon properties may be affected by high magnetic fields ($\gtrsim 10^{15}$~G) and mixing. The evolution of the system may vary up to $\sim10\%$ (compared to the non-magnetized case). Low-mixing may produce a slower-broader jet with a broader and more energetic cocoon would be produced. On the other hand, high-mixing could produce a faster-narrower jet with a narrow and less-energetic cocoon. Two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations are used to validate the model and to constrain the mixing parameter. Although the magnetic field and mixing have a limited effect, our semi-analytic model captures the general trend consistent with numerical results. For high magnetization, the results were found to be more consistent with the low mixing case in our semi-analytic model.</description>

      <title>Galaxy lens reconstruction based on strongly lensed gravitational waves: similarity transformation degeneracy and mass-sheet degeneracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) galaxy lens reconstruction is a crucial step for many GW lensing science applications. However, dark siren GW lensing (i.e. lensed GW without observed electromagnetic (EM) counterpart) suffers from similarity transformation degeneracy and mass-sheet degeneracy. We review these two degeneracies and discuss their implications on GW-based lens reconstruction and two well-known GW lensing science cases: the Hubble constant measurement and test for modified GW propagation. Building upon previous works, our conclusions are:1) GWs can only infer the scale-free lens mass model parameters, the dimensionless source position, the GW luminosity distance and the time delay scaling (a combination of Einstein radius, lens redshift, and cosmology).2) Lens reconstruction (of singular isothermal ellipsoid lens) with only two GW signals is unlikely to yield a complete lens model, while four (three) signals can measure all the above parameters accurately (with large uncertainties).3) The similarity transformation degeneracy causes the lens redshift/Einstein radius/cosmology to be degenerate in dark siren measurements. Breaking the degeneracy can be achieved by supplementing the GWs with EM observation of lens redshifts/Einstein radius (source redshift is not required).4) The mass-sheet degeneracy causes the GW luminosity distance to be entirely degenerate with a constant mass sheet.5) Contrary to expectation, the Hubble constant is degenerate with the mass-sheet even when supplemented with lens reconstruction/redshift/Einstein radius and can only be lifted with lens galaxy velocity dispersion measurement, while modified GW propagation test discussed in prior literature is unaffected by the degeneracy. These properties highlight the need for GW observations to be supplemented by EM observations, which could become accessible through a lens archival search or a rapid EM follow-up.</description>

      <title>Supernovae and superbursts by dark matter clumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmologies in which dark matter clumps strongly on small scales are unfavorable to terrestrial detectors that are as yet unexposed to the clumps. I show that sub-hectometer clumps could trigger thermonuclear runaways by scattering on nuclei in white dwarf cores (carbon and oxygen) and neutron star oceans (carbon), setting off Type Ia-like supernovae and x-ray superbursts respectively. I consider two scenarios: ``dark clusters" that are essentially microhalos, and ``long-range dark nuggets", essentially macroscopic composites, with long-range Yukawa baryonic interactions that source the energy for igniting explosions. I constrain dark clusters weighing between the Planck mass and asteroid masses, and long-range dark nuggets over a wider mass range spanning forty orders of magnitude. These limits greatly complement searches I had co-proposed in 2109.04582 for scattering interactions of dark clumps in neutron stars, cosmic rays, and pre-historic minerals.</description>

      <title>First constraint on the dissipative tidal deformability of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by neutron star binaries probe the physics of matter at supra nuclear densities. During the late inspiral, tidal deformations raised on each star by the gravitational field of its companion depend crucially on the star's internal properties. The misalignment of a star's tidal bulge with its companion's gravitational field encodes the strength of internal dissipative processes, which imprint onto the phase of the gravitational waves emitted. We here analyze GW data from the GW170817 (binary neutron star) event detected by LIGO and Virgo and find the first constraint on the dissipative tidal deformability of a neutron star. From this constraint, \emph{assuming} a temperature profile for each star in the binary, we obtain an order of magnitude bound on the averaged bulk ($\zeta$) and shear ($\eta$) viscosity of each star during the inspiral.: $\zeta \lesssim 10^{31} \mathrm{g}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\eta \lesssim 10^{28} \mathrm{g}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1} $. We forecast that these bounds could be improved by two orders of magnitude with third-generation detectors, like Cosmic Explorer, using inspiral data. These constraints already inform nuclear physics models and motivate further theoretical work to better understand the interplay between viscosity and temperature in the late inspiral of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>The role of the irreducible mass in repetitive Penrose energy extraction processes in a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of the irreducible mass ($M_{\rm irr}$) has led to the mass-energy ($M$) formula of a Kerr-Newman black hole (BH), in turn leading to an expression for its surface area $S=16\pi M_{\rm irr}^2$. This allowed as well the coeval identification of the reversible and irreversible transformations. The concepts of \textit{extracted} and \textit{extractable} energy soon followed. This new conceptual framework avoids inconsistencies recently evidenced in a repetitive Penrose process. We consider repetitive decays in the ergosphere of an initially extreme Kerr BH and show that these processes are highly irreversible. For each decay, including the BH capture of the particle falling into the horizon, the increase of the irreducible mass is much larger than the extracted energy. Correspondingly, the horizon radius increases. The energy extraction process saturates and stops when the horizon reaches the decay radius. Thus, reaching a final non-rotating Schwarzschild BH state by this accretion process is impossible. We have assessed such processes for three selected decay radii, $r= 1.2 M$, $1.5 M$, and $1.9 M$. The energy extracted until saturation is only $2.75\%$, $4.54\%$, and $2.45\%$ of the BH initial mass, while the extractable energy is reduced by $25\%$, $56\%$, and $92\%$. The BH rotational energy is mostly converted into irreducible mass, which increases to $75\%$, $83\%$, and $95\%$ of the initial BH mass. Therefore, evaluating the effect of the irreducible mass increase in the energy extraction processes in the Kerr BH ergosphere is now mandatory.</description>
