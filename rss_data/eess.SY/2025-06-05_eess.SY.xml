      <title>Online Detection and Mitigation of Robust Zero Dynamics Anomaly Behavior in MIMO Nonlinear Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to detect robust zero dynamics anomaly behavior and mitigate the impacts in general multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems. The proposed method guarantees the resiliency and stability of the closed-loop system without relying on an accurate dynamical model. The presented method operates in two stages. First, it measures the difference between the system input and that of the model as a residual signal to detect the anomaly behavior. After detecting the attack, a recovery signal is generated to restore the system to its nominal condition. In this stage, a neural network model is used to estimate the anomaly signal and recover the closed-loop system. The weights of the neural network model are updated online using adaptation rules without needing prior data for training. The accuracy and performance of the proposed methods are verified by simulating various scenarios on a fourtank system.</description>

      <title>Spatial Association Between Near-Misses and Accident Blackspots in Sydney, Australia: A Getis-Ord $G_i^*$ Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Road safety management teams utilize on historical accident logs to identify blackspots, which are inherently rare and sparse in space and time. Near-miss events captured through vehicle telematics and transmitted in real-time by connected vehicles reveal a unique potential of prevention due to their high frequency nature and driving engagement on the road. There is currently a lack of understanding of the high potential of near-miss data in real-time to proactively detect potential risky driving areas, in advance of a fatal collision. This paper aims to spatially identify clusters of reported accidents (A) versus high-severity near-misses (High-G) within an urban environment (Sydney, Australia) and showcase how the presence of near-misses can significantly lead to future crashes in identified risky hotspots. First, by utilizing a 400m grid framework, we identify significant crash hotspots using the Getis-Ord $G_i^*$ statistical approach. Second, we employ a Bivariate Local Moran's I (LISA) approach to assess and map the spatial concordance and discordance between official crash counts (A) and High-G counts from nearmiss data (High-G). Third, we classify areas based on their joint spatial patterns into: a) High-High (HH) as the most riskiest areas in both historical logs and nearmiss events, High-Low (HL) for high crash logs but low nearmiss records, c) Low-High (LH) for low past crash records but high nearmiss events, and d) Low-Low (LL) for safe areas. Finally, we run a feature importance ranking on all area patterns by using a contextual Point of Interest (POI) count features and we showcase which factors are the most critical to the occurrence of crash blackspots.</description>

      <title>Urban Visibility Hotspots: Quantifying Building Vertex Visibility from Connected Vehicle Trajectories using Spatial Indexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective placement of Out-of-Home advertising and street furniture requires accurate identification of locations offering maximum visual exposure to target audiences, particularly vehicular traffic. Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.</description>

      <title>Automated Traffic Incident Response Plans using Generative Artificial Intelligence: Part 1 -- Building the Incident Response Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic incidents remain a critical public safety concern worldwide, with Australia recording 1,300 road fatalities in 2024, which is the highest toll in 12 years. Similarly, the United States reports approximately 6 million crashes annually, raising significant challenges in terms of a fast reponse time and operational management. Traditional response protocols rely on human decision-making, which introduces potential inconsistencies and delays during critical moments when every minute impacts both safety outcomes and network performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Incident Response Benchmark that uses generative artificial intelligence to automatically generate response plans for incoming traffic incidents. Our approach aims to significantly reduce incident resolution times by suggesting context-appropriate actions such as variable message sign deployment, lane closures, and emergency resource allocation adapted to specific incident characteristics. First, the proposed methodology uses real-world incident reports from the Performance Measurement System (PeMS) as training and evaluation data. We extract historically implemented actions from these reports and compare them against AI-generated response plans that suggest specific actions, such as lane closures, variable message sign announcements, and/or dispatching appropriate emergency resources. Second, model evaluations reveal that advanced generative AI models like GPT-4o and Grok 2 achieve superior alignment with expert solutions, demonstrated by minimized Hamming distances (averaging 2.96-2.98) and low weighted differences (approximately 0.27-0.28). Conversely, while Gemini 1.5 Pro records the lowest count of missed actions, its extremely high number of unnecessary actions (1547 compared to 225 for GPT-4o) indicates an over-triggering strategy that reduces the overall plan efficiency.</description>

      <title>Occlusion-Aware Ground Target Tracking by a Dubins Vehicle Using Visibility Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of tracking a point of interest (POI) moving along a known trajectory on the ground with an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) modeled as a Dubins vehicle using a line-of-sight (LOS) sensor through an urban environment that may occlude the POI. A visibility volume (VV) encodes a time-varying, three-dimensional representation of the sensing constraints for a particular POI position. A constant-altitude, translating, and radially time-varying circular standoff orbit is then inscribed within the dynamically changing VV centered at the POI position. The time-varying VV is approximated by placing static VVs along the POI's trajectory using an adaptive metric that restricts the volume change of consecutive visibility volumes to below a specified rate. The time-varying circular standoff orbit is proven to be feasible for a Dubins vehicle and is approximated with a piecewise set of linearly interpolated circular orbits inside the static VVs. A steering controller is derived that drives the UAV to converge to the time-varying standoff orbit. Numerical simulations and a flight test illustrate the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>An iterative tangential interpolation framework for model reduction of MIMO systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider model reduction of large-scale MIMO systems using tangential interpolation in the frequency domain. Our scheme is related to the recently-developed Adaptive Antoulas--Anderson (AAA) algorithm, which is an iterative algorithm that uses concepts from the Loewner framework. Our algorithm uses low-rank interpolation and iteratively adds interpolation points based on several criteria including minimizing maximum errors. We show there is freedom in the interpolation point selection method, leading to multiple algorithms that have trade-offs between computational complexity and approximation performance. We prove that a weighted \(H_2\) norm of a representative error system is monotonically decreasing as interpolation points are added. Finally, we provide computational results and some comparisons with prior works, demonstrating performance on par with standard model reduction methods.</description>

      <title>On Loss-Minimal Radial Topologies in MV Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distribution system reconfiguration (DSR) means optimizing the topology of a distribution grid using switching actions. Switching actions are a degrees of freedom available to distribution system operators, e.g. to manage planned and unplanned outages. DSR is a NP-hard combinatorial problem. Finding good or even optimal solutions is computationally expensive. While transmission and high-voltage grids are generally operated in a meshed state, MV distribution systems are commonly operated as radial networks even though meshed operation would be supported. This improves resilience because faults can be isolated more easily keeping the rest of the system operational and minimizing impact on customers. We propose an AC DSR formulation and benchmark it against a common formulation from the literature. Our results indicate that additional acyclicity constraints can significantly improve solver performance.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Bidirectional Inverter Equivalent Circuit Model for Distribution Grid Steady-State Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a \textit{physics-based} steady-state equivalent circuit model of a two-stage bidirectional inverter. These inverters connect distributed energy resources (DERs), such as photovoltaic (PV) and battery systems, to distribution grids. Existing inverter models have technical gaps on three fronts: i) inadequate modeling of inverter losses, ii) use of mathematical abstractions for bidirectional flow of power, and iii) inability to integrate different control modes into nonlinear solvers without loss of generality. We propose a physics-first model that explicitly captures losses in passive circuit components based on circuit-level principles. We enable bidirectional power flow without binary or complementarity constraints by formulating loss terms as smooth, sign-aware expressions of current. We introduce and parameterize controlled current sources with twice-differentiable continuous functions to enable inverter control modes without loss of generality. We integrate DERs with the proposed inverter model at the load buses of distribution networks to perform power flow and optimization studies on real-world distribution networks with over 20,000 nodes. We demonstrate that the proposed model is more accurate, integrates seamlessly with various control modes without loss of generality, and scales robustly to large optimization problems.

      <title>Optimizing Software Defined Battery Systems for Transformer Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Residential electric vehicle charging causes large spikes in electricity demand that risk violating neighborhood transformer power limits. Battery energy storage systems reduce these transformer limit violations, but operating them individually is not cost-optimal. Instead of individual optimization, aggregating, or sharing, these batteries leads to cost-optimal performance, but homeowners must relinquish battery control. This paper leverages virtualization to propose battery sharing optimization schemes to reduce electricity costs, extend the lifetime of a residential transformer, and maintain homeowner control over the battery. A case study with simulated home loads, solar generation, and electric vehicle charging profiles demonstrates that joint, or shared, optimization reduces consumer bills by 56% and transformer aging by 48% compared to individual optimization. Hybrid and dynamic optimization schemes that provide owners with autonomy have similar transformer aging reduction but are slightly less cost-effective. These results suggest that controlling shared batteries with virtualization is an effective way to delay transformer upgrades in the face of growing residential electric vehicle charging penetration.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Optimal Control of DC Microgrids with Safety and Stability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A DC microgrid is a promising alternative to the traditional AC power grid, since it can efficiently integrate distributed and renewable energy resources. However, as an emerging framework, it lacks the rigorous theoretical guarantees of its AC counterpart. In particular, safe stabilization of the DC microgrid has been a non-trivial task in power electronics. To address that, we take a control theoretic perspective in designing the feedback controller with provable guarantees. We present a systematic way to construct Control Lyapunov Functions (CLF) to stabilize the microgrid, and, independently, Control Barrier Functions (CBF) to enforce its safe operation at all times. The safety-critical controller (SCC) proposed in this work integrates the two control objectives, with safety prioritized, into a quadratic program (QP) as linear constraints, which allows for its online deployment using off-the-shelf convex optimization solvers. The SCC is compared against a robust version of the conventional droop control through numerical experiments whose results indicate the SCC outperforms the droop controller in guaranteeing safety and retaining stability at the same time.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware Graph Neural Network-based State Estimation for PMU-Unobservable Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional optimization-based techniques for time-synchronized state estimation (SE) often suffer from high online computational burden, limited phasor measurement unit (PMU) coverage, and presence of non-Gaussian measurement noise. Although conventional learning-based models have been developed to overcome these challenges, they are negatively impacted by topology changes and real-time data loss. This paper proposes a novel deep geometric learning approach based on graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate the states of PMU-unobservable power systems. The proposed approach combines graph convolution and multi-head graph attention layers inside a customized end-to-end learning framework to handle topology changes and real-time data loss. An upper bound on SE error as a function of topology change is also derived. Experimental results for different test systems demonstrate superiority of the proposed customized GNN-SE (CGNN-SE) over traditional optimization-based techniques as well as conventional learning-based models in presence of topology changes, PMU failures, bad data, non-Gaussian measurement noise, and large system implementation.</description>

      <title>Fast Sampling for System Identification: Overcoming Noise, Offsets, and Closed-Loop Challenges with State Variable Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effects of setting the sampling frequency significantly higher than conventional guidelines in system identification. Although continuous-time identification methods resolve the numerical difficulties encountered in discrete-time approaches when employing fast sampling (e.g., the problems caused by all poles approaching unity), the potential benefits of using sampling frequencies that far exceed traditional rules like the "ten times the bandwidth" guideline remained largely unexplored. We show that using a state variable filter (SVF)-like least squares approach, the variance of the estimation error scales as $O(h)$ with the sampling interval $h$. Importantly, this scaling holds even with colored noise or noise correlations between variables. Thus, increasing the sampling frequency and applying the SVF method offers a novel solution for challenging problems such as closed-loop system identification and measurements with offsets. Theoretical findings are supported by numerical examples, including the closed-loop identification of unstable multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems.</description>

      <title>Discrete Element Parameter Calibration of Livestock Salt Based on Particle Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to obtain accurate contact parameters for the discrete element simulation of salt particles used in animal husbandry, the principle of particle contact scaling and dimensional analysis were used for particle scaling. Firstly, the Plackett Burman experiment was used to screen the parameters that significantly affect the angle of repose: salt salt rolling friction coefficient, salt salt recovery coefficient, and salt steel rolling friction coefficient. Considering the influence of other parameters, a combination of bench and simulation experiments was used to calibrate the contact parameters between salt particles and steel plates used in animal husbandry in EDEM. Finally, through the stacking test, steepest climbing test, and orthogonal rotation combination test, the salt salt rolling friction coefficient was obtained to be 0.23, the salt salt recovery coefficient was 0.544, and the salt steel rolling friction coefficient was 0.368, which were verified through bench tests. The experimental results show that the relative error between the actual value of the stacking angle and the simulation results is 0.6%. The results indicate that the calibrated contact parameters can be used for discrete element simulation of salt particles for animal husbandry, providing reference for the design of quantitative feeding screws and silos.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Linear Switched Systems with Long Input Delay via Average or Averaging Predictor Feedbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop delay-compensating feedback laws for linear switched systems with time-dependent switching. Because the future values of the switching signal, which are needed for constructing an exact predictor-feedback law, may be unavailable at current time, the key design challenge is how to construct a proper predictor state. We resolve this challenge constructing two alternative, average predictor-based feedback laws. The first is viewed as a predictor-feedback law for a particular average system, properly modified to provide exact state predictions over a horizon that depends on a minimum dwell time of the switching signal (when it is available). The second is, essentially, a modification of an average of predictor feedbacks, each one corresponding to the fixed-mode predictor-feedback law. We establish that under the control laws introduced, the closed-loop systems are (uniformly) exponentially stable, provided that the differences among system's matrices and among (nominal stabilizing) controller's gains are sufficiently small, with a size that is inversely proportional to the delay length. Since no restriction is imposed on the delay, such a limitation is inherent to the problem considered (in which the future switching signal values are unavailable), and thus, it cannot be removed. The stability proof relies on multiple Lyapunov functionals constructed via backstepping and derivation of solutions' estimates for quantifying the difference between average and exact predictor states. We present consistent numerical simulation results, which illustrate the necessity of employing the average predictor-based laws and demonstrate the performance improvement when the knowledge of a minimum dwell time is properly utilized for improving state prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>An Improved Finite Element Modeling Method for Triply Periodic Minimal Surface Structures Based on Element Size and Minimum Jacobian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structures, a type of lattice structure, have garnered significant attention due to their lightweight nature, controllability, and excellent mechanical properties. Voxel-based modeling is a widely used method for investigating the mechanical behavior of such lattice structures through finite element simulations. This study proposes a two-parameter voxel method that incorporates joint control of element size and minimum Jacobian (MJ). Numerical results indicate that the simulation outcomes tend to stabilize when the MJ reaches 0.3. The grid convergence index (GCI), based on Richardson extrapolation, is introduced to systematically assess the numerical convergence behavior of both voxel models and the proposed two-parameter voxel models. This provides a systematic and objective framework for evaluating discretization errors and mesh convergence in TPMS modeling. Compared with traditional voxel method, the proposed method exhibits superior mesh convergence, solution accuracy, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, the two-parameter voxel method also shows excellent applicability in the analysis of graded TPMS structures, exhibiting even better convergence behavior than in uniform structures.</description>

      <title>Video Quality Monitoring for Remote Autonomous Vehicle Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The delivery of high-quality, low-latency video streams is critical for remote autonomous vehicle control, where operators must intervene in real time. However, reliable video delivery over Fourth/Fifth-Generation (4G/5G) mobile networks is challenging due to signal variability, mobility-induced handovers, and transient congestion. In this paper, we present a comprehensive blueprint for an integrated video quality monitoring system, tailored to remote autonomous vehicle operation. Our proposed system includes subsystems for data collection onboard the vehicle, video capture and compression, data transmission to edge servers, real-time streaming data management, Artificial Intelligence (AI) model deployment and inference execution, and proactive decision-making based on predicted video quality. The AI models are trained on a hybrid dataset that combines field-trial measurements with synthetic stress segments and covers Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and encoder-only Transformer architectures. As a proof of concept, we benchmark 20 variants from these model classes together with feed-forward Deep Neural Network (DNN) and linear-regression baselines, reporting accuracy and inference latency. Finally, we study the trade-offs between onboard and edge-based inference. We further discuss the use of explainable AI techniques to enhance transparency and accountability during critical remote-control interventions. Our proactive approach to network adaptation and Quality of Experience (QoE) monitoring aims to enhance remote vehicle operation over next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Control of Vision-Aided Multi-UAV-tethered Netted System Capturing Non-Cooperative Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the number of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operating in low-altitude airspace continues to increase, non-cooperative targets pose growing challenges to low-altitude operations. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-UAV-tethered netted system as a non-lethal solution for capturing non-cooperative targets. To validate the proposed system, we develop mySim, a multibody dynamics-based UAV simulation environment that integrates high-precision physics modeling, vision-based motion tracking, and reinforcement learning-driven control strategies. In mySim, the spring-damper model is employed to simulate the dynamic behavior of the tethered net, while the dynamics of the entire system is modeled using multibody dynamics (MBD) to achieve accurate representations of system interactions. The motion of the UAVs and the target are estimated using VINS-MONO and DETR, and the system autonomously executes the capture strategy through MAPPO. Simulation results demonstrate that mySim accurately simulates dynamics and control of the system, successfully enabling the multi-UAV-tethered netted system to capture both non-propelled and maneuvering non-cooperative targets. By providing a high-precision simulation platform that integrates dynamics modeling with perception and learning-based control, mySim enables efficient testing and optimization of UAV-based control policies before real-world deployment. This approach offers significant advantages for simulating complex UAVs coordination tasks and has the potential to be applied to the design of other UAV-based systems.</description>

      <title>Improving Performance of Spike-based Deep Q-Learning using Ternary Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new ternary spiking neuron model to improve the representation capacity of binary spiking neurons in deep Q-learning. Although a ternary neuron model has recently been introduced to overcome the limited representation capacity offered by the binary spiking neurons, we show that its performance is worse than that of binary models in deep Q-learning tasks. We hypothesize gradient estimation bias during the training process as the underlying potential cause through mathematical and empirical analysis. We propose a novel ternary spiking neuron model to mitigate this issue by reducing the estimation bias. We use the proposed ternary spiking neuron as the fundamental computing unit in a deep spiking Q-learning network (DSQN) and evaluate the network's performance in seven Atari games from the Gym environment. Results show that the proposed ternary spiking neuron mitigates the drastic performance degradation of ternary neurons in Q-learning tasks and improves the network performance compared to the existing binary neurons, making DSQN a more practical solution for on-board autonomous decision-making tasks.</description>

      <title>CHIME: Conditional Hallucination and Integrated Multi-scale Enhancement for Time Series Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The denoising diffusion probabilistic model has become a mainstream generative model, achieving significant success in various computer vision tasks. Recently, there has been initial exploration of applying diffusion models to time series tasks. However, existing studies still face challenges in multi-scale feature alignment and generative capabilities across different entities and long-time scales. In this paper, we propose CHIME, a conditional hallucination and integrated multi-scale enhancement framework for time series diffusion models. By employing multi-scale decomposition and adaptive integration, CHIME captures the decomposed features of time series, achieving in-domain distribution alignment between generated and original samples. In addition, we introduce a feature hallucination module in the conditional denoising process, enabling the transfer of temporal features through the training of category-independent transformation layers. Experimental results on publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that CHIME achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits excellent generative generalization capabilities in few-shot scenarios.</description>

      <title>3D Holographic Flow Cytometry Measurements of Microalgae: Strategies for Angle Recovery in Complex Rotation Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Marine ecosystems are in the spotlight, because environmental changes are threatening biodiversity and ecological functions. In this context, microalgae play key ecological roles both in planktonic and benthic ecosystems. Consequently, they are considered indispensable targets for global monitoring programs. However, due to a high spatial and temporal variability and to difficulties of species identification (still relying on microscopy observations), the assessment of roles played by these components of marine ecosystems is demanding. In addition, technologies for a 3D assessment of their complex morphology are scarcely available. Here, we present a comprehensive workflow for retrieving 3D information on microalgae with diverse geometries through holographic microscopy operating in flow-cytometry mode. Depending on the rotation patterns of samples, a tailored approach is used to retrieve their rolling angles. We demonstrate the feasibility of measuring 3D data of various microalgae, contingent to the intrinsic optical properties of cells. Specifically, we show that for quasi-transparent and low-scattering microorganisms, the retrieved angles permit to achieve quantitative 3D tomographic Refractive Index (RI) mapping, providing a full characterization of the alga in terms of its inner structure and the outer shape. Moreover, even in the most challenging scenarios, where microalgae exhibit high light absorption or strong scattering, quantitative 3D shape reconstructions of diatoms and dinoflagellates can be at least achieved. Finally, we compare our direct 3D measurements with 2D inferences of 3D properties, obtained using a commercially available microscopy system. The ability to non-invasively obtain 3D information on microalgae marks a fundamental advancement in the field, unlocking a wealth of novel biological insights for characterizing aquatic ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Feedback stabilization of switched systems under arbitrary switching: A convex characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study stabilizability of discrete-time switched linear systems where the switching signal is considered as an arbitrary disturbance (and not a control variable). We characterize feedback stabilization via necessary and sufficient linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) conditions based on novel graph structures. We analyze both the cases in which the controller has (or has not) access to the current switching mode, the so-called mode-dependent and mode-independent settings, providing specular results. Moreover, our approach provides explicit piecewise-linear and memory-dependent linear controllers, highlighting the connections with existing stabilization approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is finally illustrated with the help of some numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Quasioptic, Calibrated, Full 2-port Measurements of Cryogenic Devices under Vacuum in the 220-330 GHz Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quasi-optical (QO) test bench was designed, simulated, and calibrated for characterizing S-parameters of devices in the 220-330 GHz (WR-3.4) frequency range, from room temperature down to 4.8 K. The devices were measured through vacuum windows via focused beam radiation. A de-embedding method employing line-reflect-match (LRM) calibration was established to account for the effects of optical components and vacuum windows. The setup provides all four S-parameters with the reference plane located inside the cryostat, and achieves a return loss of 30 dB with an empty holder. System validation was performed with measurements of cryogenically cooled devices, such as bare silicon wafers and stainless-steel frequency-selective surface (FSS) bandpass filters, and superconducting bandpass FSS fabricated in niobium. A permittivity reduction of Si based on 4-GHz resonance shift was observed concomitant with a drop in temperature from 296 K to 4.8 K. The stainless steel FSS measurements revealed a relatively temperature invariant center frequency and return loss level of 263 GHz and 35 dB on average, respectively. Finally, a center frequency of 257 GHz was measured with the superconducting filters, with return loss improved by 7 dB on average at 4.8 K. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported attempt to scale LRM calibration to 330 GHz and use it to de-embed the impact of optics and cryostat from cryogenically cooled device S-parameters.</description>

      <title>Object-centric 3D Motion Field for Robot Learning from Human Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning robot control policies from human videos is a promising direction for scaling up robot learning. However, how to extract action knowledge (or action representations) from videos for policy learning remains a key challenge. Existing action representations such as video frames, pixelflow, and pointcloud flow have inherent limitations such as modeling complexity or loss of information. In this paper, we propose to use object-centric 3D motion field to represent actions for robot learning from human videos, and present a novel framework for extracting this representation from videos for zero-shot control. We introduce two novel components in its implementation. First, a novel training pipeline for training a ''denoising'' 3D motion field estimator to extract fine object 3D motions from human videos with noisy depth robustly. Second, a dense object-centric 3D motion field prediction architecture that favors both cross-embodiment transfer and policy generalization to background. We evaluate the system in real world setups. Experiments show that our method reduces 3D motion estimation error by over 50% compared to the latest method, achieve 55% average success rate in diverse tasks where prior approaches fail~($\lesssim 10$\%), and can even acquire fine-grained manipulation skills like insertion.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transmission Switching: Improving Solver Performance Using Heuristics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.12331v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal transmission switching problem (OTSP) is an established problem of changing a power grid's topology to obtain an improved operation by controlling the switching status of transmission lines. This problem was proven to be NP-hard. Proposed solution techniques based on mixed-integer formulations can guarantee globally optimal solutions but are potentially intractable in realistic power grids. Heuristics methods cannot guarantee global optimality but can provide tractable solution approaches.
  This paper proposes solving the OTSP using exact formulations alongside parallel heuristics that generate good candidate solutions to speed up conventional branch-and-bound algorithms. The innovative aspect of this work is a new asynchronous parallel algorithmic architecture. A solver instance solving the full OTSP formulation is run in parallel to another process that asynchronously generates solutions to be injected into the full OTSP solution procedure during run time.
  Our method is tested on 14 instances of the pglib-opf library: The largest problem consisting of 13659 buses and 20467 branches. Our results show a good performance for large problem instances, with consistent improvements over off-the-shelf solver performance. We find that the method scales well with an increase in parallel processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.00368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a method for obtaining a continuous-time model of a target system in closed-loop from input-output data alone, in the case where no knowledge of the controllers nor excitation signals is available and I/O data may suffer from unknown offsets. The proposed method is based on a fixed-pole observer model, which is a reasonable continuous-time version corresponding to the innovation model in discrete-time and allows the identification of unstable target systems. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed method can be attributed to a convex optimization problem by fixing the observer poles. The method is within the framework of the stabilized output error method and shares usability advantages such as robustness to noise with complex dynamics and applicability to a wide class of models. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control design for general nonlinear robotic systems with guaranteed stability and/or safety in the presence of model uncertainties is a challenging problem. Recent efforts attempt to learn a controller and a certificate (e.g., a Lyapunov function or a contraction metric) jointly using neural networks (NNs), in which model uncertainties are generally ignored during the learning process. In this paper, for nonlinear systems subject to bounded disturbances, we present a framework for jointly learning a robust nonlinear controller and a contraction metric using a novel disturbance rejection objective that certifies a tube bound using NNs for user-specified variables (e.g. control inputs). The learned controller aims to minimize the effect of disturbances on the actual trajectories of state and/or input variables from their nominal counterparts while providing certificate tubes around nominal trajectories that are guaranteed to contain actual trajectories in the presence of disturbances. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework can generate tighter (smaller) tubes and a controller that is computationally efficient to implement.</description>

      <title>Distributed Framework Construction for Affine Formation Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In affine formation control problems, the construction of the framework with universal rigidity and affine localizability is a critical prerequisite, but it has not yet been well addressed, especially when additional agents join the formation or link/agent failures emerge. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the problem of constructing affine frameworks in three scenarios, including vertex addition, edge deletion and vertex deletion. Our approach starts from the original affine formation and uses geometric methods to locally adjust the structure of the weighted graph to describe the topology, so that the modified framework maintains the universal rigidity and affine localizability. Notably, the developed strategies only utilize local measurements and exhibit distributed characteristics, laying the foundation for applications in multi-agent systems. To demonstrate the compatibility with affine formation control proposals, we present a case study on affine formation tracking in a multi-UAV formation, demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithms in constructing eligible frameworks in aforementioned scenarios. Moreover, a comparative simulation is also conducted to highlight the low time complexity of our distributed algorithm relative to the centralized optimization-based method.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex Linear System Identification with Minimal State Representation</title>

Abstract: Low-order linear System IDentification (SysID) addresses the challenge of estimating the parameters of a linear dynamical system from finite samples of observations and control inputs with minimal state representation. Traditional approaches often utilize Hankel-rank minimization, which relies on convex relaxations that can require numerous, costly singular value decompositions (SVDs) to optimize. In this work, we propose two nonconvex reformulations to tackle low-order SysID (i) Burer-Monterio (BM) factorization of the Hankel matrix for efficient nuclear norm minimization, and (ii) optimizing directly over system parameters for real, diagonalizable systems with an atomic norm style decomposition. These reformulations circumvent the need for repeated heavy SVD computations, significantly improving computational efficiency. Moreover, we prove that optimizing directly over the system parameters yields lower statistical error rates, and lower sample complexities that do not scale linearly with trajectory length like in Hankel-nuclear norm minimization. Additionally, while our proposed formulations are nonconvex, we provide theoretical guarantees of achieving global optimality in polynomial time. Finally, we demonstrate algorithms that solve these nonconvex programs and validate our theoretical claims on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>React to Surprises: Stable-by-Design Neural Feedback Control and the Youla-REN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study parameterizations of stabilizing nonlinear policies for learning-based control. We propose a structure based on a nonlinear version of the Youla-Kucera parameterization combined with robust neural networks such as the recurrent equilibrium network (REN). The resulting parameterizations are unconstrained, and hence can be searched over with first-order optimization methods, while always ensuring closed-loop stability by construction. We study the combination of (a) nonlinear dynamics, (b) partial observation, and (c) incremental closed-loop stability requirements (contraction and Lipschitzness). We find that with any two of these three difficulties, a contracting and Lipschitz Youla parameter always leads to contracting and Lipschitz closed loops. However, if all three hold, then incremental stability can be lost with exogenous disturbances. Instead, a weaker condition is maintained, which we call d-tube contraction and Lipschitzness. We further obtain converse results showing that the proposed parameterization covers all contracting and Lipschitz closed loops for certain classes of nonlinear systems. Numerical experiments illustrate the utility of our parameterization when learning controllers with built-in stability certificates for: (i) "economic" rewards without stabilizing effects; (ii) short training horizons; and (iii) uncertain systems.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Distributed Mismatch Tracking Algorithm for Constraint-Coupled Resource Allocation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.07330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers privacy-concerned distributed constraint-coupled resource allocation problems over an undirected network, where each agent holds a private cost function and obtains the solution via only local communication. With privacy concerns, we mask the exchanged information with independent Laplace noise against a potential attacker with potential access to all network communications. We propose a differentially private distributed mismatch tracking algorithm (diff-DMAC) to achieve cost-optimal distribution of resources while preserving privacy. Adopting constant stepsizes, the linear convergence property of diff-DMAC in mean square is established under the standard assumptions of Lipschitz gradients and strong convexity. Moreover, it is theoretically proven that the proposed algorithm is {\epsilon}-differentially private.And we also show the trade-off between convergence accuracy and privacy level. Finally, a numerical example is provided for verification.</description>

      <title>Data-driven stabilization of switched and constrained linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the design of state feedback control laws for both the switching signal and the continuous input of an unknown switched linear system, given past noisy input-state trajectories measurements. Based on Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities, we derive data-dependent bilinear programs whose solution directly returns a provably stabilizing controller and ensures $\mathcal{H}_2$ or $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ performance. We further present relaxations that considerably reduce the computational cost, still without requiring stabilizability of any of the switching modes. Finally, we showcase the flexibility of our approach on the constrained stabilization problem for a perturbed linear system. We validate our theoretical findings numerically, demonstrating the favourable trade-off between conservatism and tractability achieved by the proposed relaxations.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Symmetries for Inertial Navigation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of inertial navigation system (INS) filter design through the lens of symmetry. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) and its variants have been the staple of INS filtering for 50 years. However, recent advances in inertial navigation systems have exploited matrix Lie group structure to design stochastic filters and state observers that have been shown to display superior performance compared to classical solutions. In this work, we explore various symmetries of inertial navigation system, including two novel symmetries that have not been considered in the prior literature, and provide a discussion of the relative strengths and weaknesses of these symmetries in the context of filter design. We show that all the modern variants of the EKF for inertial navigation can be interpreted as the recently proposed equivariant filter (EqF) design methodology applied to different choices of symmetry group for the INS problem. As a direct application of the symmetries presented, we address the filter design problem for a vehicle equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver, providing a comparative analysis of different modern filter solutions. We believe the collection of symmetries that we present here capture all the sensible choices of symmetry for this problem, and that the analysis provided is indicative of the relative real-world performance potential of the different algorithms for trajectories ensuring full state observability.</description>

      <title>Safe, Out-of-Distribution-Adaptive MPC with Conformalized Neural Network Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SODA-MPC, a Safe, Out-of-Distribution-Adaptive Model Predictive Control algorithm, which uses an ensemble of learned models for prediction, with a runtime monitor to flag unreliable out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions. When an OOD situation is detected, SODA-MPC triggers a safe fallback control strategy based on reachability, yielding a control framework that achieves the high performance of learning-based models while preserving the safety of reachability-based control. We demonstrate the method in the context of an autonomous vehicle, driving among dynamic pedestrians, where SODA-MPC uses a neural network ensemble for pedestrian prediction. We calibrate the OOD signal using conformal prediction to derive an OOD detector with probabilistic guarantees on the false-positive rate, given a user-specified confidence level. During in-distribution operation, the MPC controller avoids collisions with a pedestrian based on the trajectory predicted by the mean of the ensemble. When OOD conditions are detected, the MPC switches to a reachability-based controller to avoid collisions with the reachable set of the pedestrian assuming a maximum pedestrian speed, to guarantee safety under the worst-case actions of the pedestrian. We verify SODA-MPC in extensive autonomous driving simulations in a pedestrian-crossing scenario. Our model ensemble is trained and calibrated with real pedestrian data, showing that our OOD detector obtains the desired accuracy rate within a theoretically-predicted range. We empirically show improved safety and improved task completion compared with two state-of-the-art MPC methods that also use conformal prediction, but without OOD adaptation. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with the large-scale multi-agent predictor Trajectron++, using large-scale traffic data from the nuScenes dataset for training and calibration.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey of Agents for Computer Use: Foundations, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agents for computer use (ACUs) are an emerging class of systems capable of executing complex tasks on digital devices - such as desktops, mobile phones, and web platforms - given instructions in natural language. These agents can automate tasks by controlling software via low-level actions like mouse clicks and touchscreen gestures. However, despite rapid progress, ACUs are not yet mature for everyday use.
  In this survey, we investigate the state-of-the-art, trends, and research gaps in the development of practical ACUs. We provide a comprehensive review of the ACU landscape, introducing a unifying taxonomy spanning three dimensions: (I) the domain perspective, characterizing agent operating contexts; (II) the interaction perspective, describing observation modalities (e.g., screenshots, HTML) and action modalities (e.g., mouse, keyboard, code execution); and (III) the agent perspective, detailing how agents perceive, reason, and learn.
  We review 87 ACUs and 33 datasets across foundation model-based and classical approaches through this taxonomy. Our analysis identifies six major research gaps: insufficient generalization, inefficient learning, limited planning, low task complexity in benchmarks, non-standardized evaluation, and a disconnect between research and practical conditions.
  To address these gaps, we advocate for: (a) vision-based observations and low-level control to enhance generalization; (b) adaptive learning beyond static prompting; (c) effective planning and reasoning methods and models; (d) benchmarks that reflect real-world task complexity; (e) standardized evaluation based on task success; (f) aligning agent design with real-world deployment constraints.
  Together, our taxonomy and analysis establish a foundation for advancing ACU research toward general-purpose agents for robust and scalable computer use.</description>

      <title>CIVIL: Causal and Intuitive Visual Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today's robots learn new tasks by imitating human examples. However, this standard approach to visual imitation learning is fundamentally limited: the robot observes what the human does, but not why the human chooses those behaviors. Without understanding the features that factor into the human's decisions, robot learners often misinterpret the data and fail to perform the task when the environment changes. We therefore propose a shift in perspective: instead of asking human teachers just to show what actions the robot should take, we also enable humans to indicate task-relevant features using markers and language prompts. Our proposed algorithm, CIVIL, leverages this augmented data to filter the robot's visual observations and extract a feature representation that causally informs human actions. CIVIL then applies these causal features to train a transformer-based policy that emulates human behaviors without being confused by visual distractors. Our simulations, real-world experiments, and user study demonstrate that robots trained with CIVIL can learn from fewer human demonstrations and perform better than state-of-the-art baselines, especially in previously unseen scenarios.

      <title>Future-Oriented Navigation: Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance with One-Shot Energy-Based Multimodal Motion Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated approach for the safe and efficient control of mobile robots in dynamic and uncertain environments. The approach consists of two key steps: one-shot multimodal motion prediction to anticipate motions of dynamic obstacles and model predictive control to incorporate these predictions into the motion planning process. Motion prediction is driven by an energy-based neural network that generates high-resolution, multi-step predictions in a single operation. The prediction outcomes are further utilized to create geometric shapes formulated as mathematical constraints. Instead of treating each dynamic obstacle individually, predicted obstacles are grouped by proximity in an unsupervised way to improve performance and efficiency. The overall collision-free navigation is handled by model predictive control with a specific design for proactive dynamic obstacle avoidance. The proposed approach allows mobile robots to navigate effectively in dynamic environments. Its performance is accessed across various scenarios that represent typical warehouse settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other existing dynamic obstacle avoidance methods.</description>

      <title>Digital-physical testbed for ship autonomy studies in the Marine Cybernetics Laboratory basin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algorithms developed for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) are often challenging to test on actual vessels due to high operational costs and safety considerations. Simulations offer a cost-effective alternative and eliminate risks, but they may not accurately represent real-world dynamics for the given tasks. Utilizing small-scale model ships and robotic vessels in conjunction with a laboratory basin provides an accessible testing environment for the early stages of validation processes. However, designing and developing a model vessel for a single test can be costly and cumbersome, and researchers often lack access to such infrastructure. To address these challenges and enable streamlined testing, we have developed an in-house testbed that facilitates the development, testing, verification, and validation of MASS algorithms in a digital-physical laboratory. This infrastructure includes a set of small-scale model vessels, a simulation environment for each vessel, a comprehensive testbed environment, and a digital twin in Unity. With this, we aim to establish a full design and verification pipeline that starts with high-fidelity simulation models of each model vessel, to the model-scale testing in the laboratory basin, allowing possibilities for moving towards semi-fullscale validation with R/V milliAmpere1 and full-scale validation with R/V Gunnerus. In this work, we present our progress on the development of this testbed environment and its components, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling ship guidance, navigation, and control (GNC), including autonomy.</description>

      <title>Signed Angle Rigid Graphs for Network Localization and Formation Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph rigidity theory studies the capability of a graph embedded in the Euclidean space to constrain its global geometric shape via local constraints among nodes and edges, and has been widely exploited in network localization and formation control. In recent years, the traditional rigidity theory has been extended by considering new types of local constraints such as bearing, angle, ratio of distance, etc. Among them, the signed angle constraint has received extensive attention, since it is practically measurable and independent of the global coordinate frame. However, the relevant studies always consider special graph structures, which are sufficient but not necessary for signed angle rigidity. This paper presents a comprehensive combinatorial analysis in terms of graphs and angle index sets for signed angle rigidity. We show that Laman graphs equivalently characterize minimally signed angle rigid graphs. Moreover, we propose a method to construct the minimal set of signed angle constraints in a Laman graph to effectively ensure signed angle rigidity. These results are finally applied to distributed network localization and formation stabilization problems, respectively, where each agent only has access to signed angle measurements.</description>

      <title>Investigating Timing-Based Information Leakage in Data Flow-Driven Real-Time Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leaking information about the execution behavior of critical real-time tasks may lead to serious consequences, including violations of temporal constraints and even severe failures. We study information leakage for a special class of real-time tasks that have two execution modes, namely, typical execution (which invokes the majority of times) and critical execution (to tackle exceptional conditions). The data flow-driven applications inherit such a multimode execution model. In this paper, we investigate whether a low-priority "observer" task can infer the execution patterns of a high-priority "victim" task (especially the critical executions). We develop a new statistical analysis technique and show that by analyzing the response times of the low-priority task, it becomes possible to extract the execution behavior of the high-priority task. We test our approach against a random selection technique that arbitrarily classifies a job as critical. We find that correlating the observer's response times with the victim's jobs can result in higher precision in identifying critical invocations compared to a random guess. We conduct extensive evaluations with systemically generated workloads, including a case study using a UAV autopilot (ArduPilot) taskset parameters. We found that our inference algorithm can achieve relatively low false positive rates (less than 25%) with relatively low footprint (1 MB memory and 50 ms timing overhead on a Raspberry Pi 4 platform). We further demonstrate the feasibility of inference on two cyber-physical platforms: an off-the-shelf manufacturing robot and a custom-built surveillance system.</description>
