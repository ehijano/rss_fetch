      <title>Broadband Single-Shot THz Sampling Using Reflection Gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-shot electro-optic sampling (EOS) is a powerful method enabling the measurement of weak terahertz signals that would otherwise require prohibitively long acquisition times. This is generally achieved by encoding the EOS time delay into a spatial, angular, or frequency coordinate. In general, this technique operates well up to 3 THz but becomes more challenging for larger bandwidths, due to dispersion and imaging imperfections. Here, we demonstrate a reliable angular-encoding single shot EOS implementation that reaches frequencies beyond 6 THz. Diffraction simulations are used to design the experimental setup and adapt this technique to commercial reflection gratings, removing the need for custom-built echelon mirrors. Furthermore, we show that, contrary to earlier reports, group delay dispersion from angular dispersion does not reduce the bandwidth of single-shot EOS.</description>

      <title>Frequency stability of $2.5\times10^{-17}$ in a Si cavity with AlGaAs crystalline mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developments in ultrastable lasers have fueled remarkable advances in optical frequency metrology and quantum science. A key ingredient in further improving laser frequency stability is the use of low-noise mirror materials such as AlGaAs crystalline coatings. However, excess noise observed with these coatings limits the performance of cryogenic silicon cavities with AlGaAs mirrors to similar levels achieved with conventional dielectric coatings. With a new pair of crystalline coated mirrors in a 6-cm-long cryogenic silicon cavity operated at 17 K, we demonstrate a clear advantage of crystalline coatings over dielectric coatings. The achieved fractional frequency stability of $2.5 \times 10^{-17}$ at 10 s is four times better than expected for dielectric mirrors and corresponds to more than tenfold reduction in the coating mechanical loss factor. We also combine two silicon cavities to demonstrate optical frequency averaging for enhanced stability. In addition, we present a long-term frequency drift record of four cryogenic silicon cavities measured over several years. These results open up realistic prospects for cavity-stabilized lasers with $10^{-18}$ fractional stability, as well as an all-optical timescale with continuously operating optical local oscillators.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dial for High-Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a highly nonlinear optical process that typically requires an intense laser to trigger emissions at integer multiples of the driving field frequency. Since HHG is commonly used as a spectroscopic tool to probe material properties, it becomes impossible to extract information about a material without introducing distortions caused by the strong driving field. Recent advances in bright squeezed vacuum sources have allowed HHG to be driven by purely quantum fields alone. Our work focuses on controlling and tuning HHG emission using a weak classical driving field with energy 1000 times less than that used in conventional HHG experiments, perturbed by an even weaker quantum field, such as bright squeezed vacuum (BSV). Our technique opens new avenues for nonlinear spectroscopy of materials by minimizing issues such as laser-induced damage, distortions, and heating. Our results show that a BSV pulse, containing less than 0.5% of the driving laser energy, can serve as an optical dial for tuning nonlinear emission, electron dynamics, and ionization.</description>

      <title>Quantized topological transport mediated by the long-range couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain topological systems with time-varying Hamiltonian enable quantized and disorder-robust transport of excitations. Here, we introduce the modification of the celebrated Thouless pump when the on-site energies remain fixed, while the nearest and next-nearest neighbor couplings vary in time. We demonstrate quantized transport of excitations and propose an experimental implementation using an array of evanescently coupled optical waveguides.</description>

      <title>10-W Sub-100-fs Ultrafast Cr:ZnS/ZnSe MOPA System enabled by doping gradient engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a high-power mid-infrared femtosecond master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) system, employing Cr:ZnS and Cr:ZnSe polycrystals with fine-tuned doping profiles. Based on the soft-aperture Kerr-lens mode-locking in the soliton regime, the seed oscillator generates ~40-fs pulses with a repetition rate ~173 MHz with an average power close to 400 mW. The amplification process of the seed pulse train is investigated in depth in a single-pass configuration for both Cr:ZnS and Cr:ZnSe crystal rods. For further power scaling, a dual-stage MOPA system has been implemented, generating pulse trains with an average power up to 10.4 W, limited only by the pump source, with a re-compressed pulse duration of 78 fs using a dispersion compensator comprising chirped mirrors and sapphire plates. This work paves the way for further power scaling of mid-infrared Cr:ZnS/ZnSe ultrafast laser systems without moving parts for applications in material processing, remote sensing and medicine.</description>

      <title>The role of angular slit number and angular slit width on the OAM spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle sets the limit for simultaneous measurements of position and momentum, and its angular analogue is realized through angular diffraction. When a beam is spatially confined by angular slits, the uncertainty in its orbital angular momentum (OAM) increases, leading to the generation of OAM sidebands. Both the angular slit number and the angular slit width shapes the spatial confinement of the beam. In this study, we investigate this dependence of the OAM sidebands by obstructing a Gaussian beam with $N$ number of evenly spaced angular slits with angular separation $\Delta\theta_{sep}$. The power distribution among the OAM sidebands exhibits oscillatory behavior as a function of $\Delta\theta_{sep}$. We find that the number of oscillations over the full range $0 \leq \Delta\theta_{sep} \leq 2\pi/N$ is given by the ratio $\frac{|l|}{N}$. Furthermore, each OAM sideband acquires power only when $\frac{|l|}{N}$ takes an integer value, thereby demonstrating the role of the angular slit geometry to the structure of the OAM sidebands.</description>

      <title>Intersubband polariton -- LO phonon interaction in mid-infrared non-dispersive cavities: experimental demonstration of spontaneous scattering and perspectives towards polariton lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report experimental evidence of the interaction between intersubband polaritons and longitudinal optical phonons in non-dispersive mid-infrared cavities, under resonant optical injection. The light emission originating from spontaneous polariton-phonon scattering is observed at a frequency corresponding to an energy shift of one phonon below the pump frequency. Given the extremely low spontaneous scattering rate, we employ a custom-developed quantum mechanical model to numerically demonstrate the feasibility to stimulate such process using a pump-probe scheme. Based on this analysis, we identify a set of experimental conditions under which optical gain may be realized in a mid-infrared intersubband polaritonic system.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Beam Shaping Using a Wavelength-Adaptive Diffractive Neural Network for Laser-Assisted Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-based manufacturing has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional thermal and mechanical processing owing to its precision, versatility, and ability to work across diverse materials. In particular, tailoring the spatial intensity distribution of laser beams on the fly is pivotal for ensuring keyhole stability, minimizing defects, and enhancing processing quality. To address this need, we propose a multifunctional optical platform designed through a Diffractive Neural Network that provides wavelength adaptability for three industrially relevant wavelengths - 915 nm, 1064 nm, and 1550 nm - while dynamically generating distinct beam profiles at specified propagation planes. The proposed platform not only enables static beam shaping but also supports dynamic beam engineering, including programmable sequencing between profiles, which is highly desirable for optimal manufacturing solutions. With its multifunctionality and adaptability, the DNN-based architecture establishes a transformative pathway for next-generation laser manufacturing, aligning with the industrial revolution while unlocking opportunities in biomedical optics, free-space communications, and sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical transmission spectra of a series of micro-ring resonators (MRRs) are studied following the implantation of gold (Au) ions and subsequent thermal annealing, at temperatures between 500 {\deg}C and 700 {\deg}C. Whilst we find that this process leads to the ready formation of Au nanoparticles (NPs) on the MRR surface, the cavity optical properties; Q-factor and extinction ratio (ER) are severely degraded, for annealing between 500 {\deg}C and 600 {\deg}C, but recover again for annealing at 650 {\deg}C. For an equivalent (control) MRR, which received no Au implantation, thermal annealing alone was also found to degrade the cavity performance.</description>

      <title>Development of a High-Doppler Shift Optical Simulator to Test Femtosecond-Level Optical Time-Frequency Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed an optical simulator to test optical two-way time-frequency transfer (O-TWTFT) at the femtosecond level capable of simulating relative motion between two linked optical clock nodes up to Mach 1.8 with no moving parts. The technique is enabled by artificially Doppler shifting femtosecond pulses from auxiliary stabilized optical frequency combs. These pulses are exchanged between the nodes to simulate the Doppler shifts observed from a changing optical path length. We can continuously scan the simulated velocity from 14 to 620 m/s while simultaneously measuring velocity-dependent clock shifts at much higher velocities than has been previously recorded. This system provides an effective testbed that allows us to explore issues and solutions to enable femtosecond-level optical time transfer at high velocity.</description>

      <title>Quantum ground-state cooling of two librational modes of a nanorotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the motion of nanoscale objects at the quantum limit promises new tests of quantum mechanics and advanced sensors. Rotational motion is of particular interest, as it follows nonlinear dynamics in a compact, closed configuration space, which opens up a plethora of phenomena and applications beyond the possibilities of free or trapped linear motion. A prerequisite for such experiments is the capability to trap nanorotors and initialize them in a quantum ground state of libration. Here, we demonstrate the reliable, repetitive laser-induced loading of silica nanodimers and trimers into an optical tweezer. Coherent scattering in a high-finesse cavity allows us to cool two different librational modes to the quantum ground state with occupation numbers as low as $n_{\beta}=0.54\pm0.32$ and $n_{\alpha}=0.21\pm0.03$. By simultaneously cooling both degrees of freedom ($n_\beta=0.73\pm0.22$, $n_\alpha=1.02\pm0.08$) we align nanorotors to a space-fixed axis with precision better than 20$\,\mu$rad, close to the zero-point amplitude of librations.</description>

      <title>Broadband femtosecond lasers enable efficient two-photon excitation of the ultranarrow linewidth singlet 1s2s state in helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a broadband, femtosecond two-photon excitation scheme for efficient population transfer to the ultra-narrow linewidth $1s2s\ ^1S_0$ metastable state in helium. Using $120$ nm vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) femtosecond laser pulses, we theoretically demonstrate that a direct two-photon excitation process can achieve a population transfer efficiency of $25-30\%$, even when photoionization losses are included. The use of broadband pulses enables multiple excitation pathways to populate the excited state, in addition to compensating for significant AC Stark shifts occurring within the pulse duration. Furthermore, we introduce a two-color two-photon extreme ultraviolet-near infrared (XUV-IR) excitation scheme that will further reduce ionization losses and can achieve significantly higher transfer efficiencies of $\sim 70\%$. These results demonstrate that high excitation probability of ultra-narrow linewidth ($\sim 50$ Hz) excited states can be achieved with experimentally accessible femtosecond laser sources with a few THz bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Observation of topological Phenomena in a Weyl Exceptional Ring with Single Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared with Hermitian theory, non-Hermitian physics offers a fundamentally different mathematical framework, enabling the observation of topological phenomena that have no analogue in Hermitian systems. Among these, the exceptional point (EP) ring stands out as a quintessential topological feature unique to non-Hermitian systems. In this study, we employ single-photon interferometry to overcome the experimental challenge of precise phase control in quantum systems, thereby enabling a complete simulation of the non-Hermitian EP ring in three-dimensional parameter space without invoking any additional symmetry assumptions. By measuring the non-Hermitian dynamics in three-dimensional parameter space, we determine the system's eigenstates, which allows us to characterize the topological band structure of the system under different conditions. We describe the topological properties of the EP ring by extracting the Chern number and Berry phase for different parameter manifolds and observe the topological critical phenomena of the system. Our work paves the way for further exploration of topological non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Reducing Temperature Swing and Rectifying Radiative Heat Transfer for Passive Dynamic Space Thermal Control with Variable-Emittance Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic radiative thermal control is crucial for normal operation and energy saving of spacecraft that copes with changing thermal environment involving heat dissipation to cold deep space, external heating from the Sun and nearby planet, and internal heating from onboard electronics. Variable-emittance coatings, whose infrared emittance can be tuned passively by temperature or actively by external stimuli, could provide a viable solution. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate self-adaptive dynamic radiative heat transfer with variable-emittance coating based on thermochromic VO2 in space-like thermal environment with a coldfinger and a custom-made sample mount inside a vacuum cryostat. Black Actar and highly reflective tungsten mirror are used to calibrate the parasitic head load and heat flux sensor sensitivity, while multiple static-emittance samples made of silicon wafers with different doping levels are measured for validation of the experimental method and for direct comparison with the variable-emittance VO2 coating. With the coldfinger at 80 K to mimic external radiative scenarios in space, the tunable coating exhibits 6-fold enhancement in radiative thermal conductance upon VO2 phase transition for promoted heat dissipation, in addition to reduced temperature swing by almost 20degC compared to the static emitters. With the coldfinger at 25degC as internal radiative scenarios in space, similar 6-fold heat dissipation from the variable-emittance coating is also observed, while radiative heat transfer is much suppressed with a constant radiative thermal conductance when the coldfinger is hotter than the tunable coating at 25degC, leading to a thermal rectification factor of 1.8 experimentally achieved.</description>

      <title>Distributed Coherent Beamforming at 60 GHz Enabled by Optically-Established Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement and experimentally demonstrate a 60 GHz distributed system leveraging an optical time synchronization system that provides precise time and frequency alignment between independent elements of the distributed mesh. Utilizing such accurate coherence, we perform receive beamforming with interference rejection and transmit nulling. In these configurations, the system achieves a coherent gain over an incoherent network of N nodes, significantly improving the relevant signal power ratios. Our system demonstrates extended array phase coherence times, enabling advanced techniques. Results from over-the-air experiments demonstrate a 14.3 dB signal-to-interference-plus-noise improvement in interference-laden scenarios with a contributing 13.5 dB null towards interference in receive beamforming. In transmit nulling, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of 7.9 dB is measured towards an intended receiver while maintaining an SNR reduction of 8.9 dB at another receiver. These findings represent the use of distributed coherence in the V band without the use of GPS timing.</description>

      <title>Study of magnification and angular resolution of a single water droplet placed on a glass surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the magnification and angular resolution of a single water droplet positioned on a glass surface, functioning as an optical imaging system. Through theoretical analysis of the droplet's shape, magnification, and angular resolution, we derive predictions that are subsequently validated through experiments. Our study explores the impact of key parameters, including droplet size, the distance between the droplet and the object, and the contact angle, on the aforementioned optical characteristics. Our findings reveal that smaller droplets exhibit higher magnification at shorter object-to-droplet distances and demonstrate superior resolving capability (i.e., smaller angular resolution).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reducing electromagnetic scattering from an object has always been a task, inspiring efforts across disciplines such as materials science and electromagnetic theory. The pursuit of electromagnetic cloaking significantly advanced the field of metamaterials, yet achieving broadband, conformal cloaking for complex, non-trivial objects remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we introduce the concept of 'tailor-made metasurfaces' - machine-designed aperiodic structures optimized to suppress scattering from arbitrary objects by accounting for their layout, including resonant or large-scale features. Specifically, we demonstrated a wideband ~20% fractional bandwidth scattering suppression of more than 20-30 dB for various generic test objects, including randomly distributed wire meshes, spheres, and polygons. The demonstrated evolutionary optimization marks a leap forward in electromagnetic design, enabling the development of high-performance structures to meet complex technological demands.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic Cherenkov diffraction radiation from continuous coupling of an electron beam to a thin dielectric slab waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A scheme for generation of monochromatic Cherenkov radiation in a thin dielectric layer is proposed. The electrons travel in vacuum parallel to a dielectric, exciting a single synchronous electromagnetic waveguide mode. The proposed scheme is studied quantitatively for near-infrared radiation in silicon induced by a 100-keV electron beam, using time-domain and frequency-domain numerical simulations, with material absorption and dispersion taken into account. This method of radiation generation can be scaled from ultraviolet to terahertz radiation by changing the thickness of the dielectric layer and choosing a material with low loss at the desired wavelength. Comparison with conventional Cherenkov Radiation and Cherenkov Diffraction Radiation is also presented.</description>

      <title>Multi-laser stabilization with an atomic-disciplined photonic integrated resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precision atomic and quantum experiments rely on ultra-stable narrow linewidth lasers constructed using table-top ultra-low expansion reference cavities. These experiments often require multiple lasers, operating at different wavelengths, to perform key steps used in state preparation and measurement required in quantum sensing and computing. This is traditionally achieved by disciplining a cavity-stabilized laser to a key atomic transition and then transferring the transition linewidth and stability to other lasers using the same reference cavity in combination with bulk-optic frequency shifting such as acousto-optic modulators. Transitioning such capabilities to a low cost photonic-integrated platform will enable a wide range of portable, low power, scalable quantum experiments and applications. Yet, today's bulk optic approaches pose challenges related to lack of cavity tunability, large free spectral range, and limited photonic integration potential. Here, we address these challenges with demonstration of an agile photonic-integrated 780 nm ultra-high-Q tunable silicon nitride reference cavity that performs multiple critical experimental steps including laser linewidth narrowing, high resolution rubidium spectroscopy, dual-stage stabilization to a rubidium transition, and stability transfer to other lasers. We achieve up to 20 dB of frequency noise reduction at 10 kHz offset, precision spectroscopy over a 250 MHz range, and dual-stage locking to rubidium with an Allan deviation of $8.5 \times 10^{-12}$ at 1 s and up to 40 dB reduction at 100 Hz. We further demonstrate the transfer of this atomic stability to a second laser, via the rubidium-disciplined cavity, and demonstrate multi-wavelength Rydberg electrometry quantum sensing. These results pave the path for integrated, compact, and scalable solutions for quantum sensing, computing and other atomic and trapped ion applications.</description>

      <title>Detection of the laser induced damage using a He Ne laser reflective imaging technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser-induced damage is a serious challenge for optical components; therefore, determining the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) is a crucial step in the manufacturing process. In many cases, such as for space applications, it is also necessary to account for the vacuum environment. Since conventional damage detection methods face limitations under vacuum conditions, an alternative approach is required. This article introduces a He-Ne laser imaging system designed for in-situ damage detection within a LIDT station. The system enables fourfold magnification imaging of the test sample and its surroundings without placing imaging optics inside the vacuum chamber, thereby preserving the cleanliness of the chamber. The detection method can be applied to both transparent and opaque samples; in transparent optics, damage is observable from either side. To verify the system's functionality, two sample types were investigated: a silica wafer (non-transparent for He-Ne radiation) and a commonly used dielectric mirror for 1030 nm (transparent for He-Ne radiation). Particular attention was devoted to determining the minimum damage size that can be reliably recognized. The system successfully distinguished damage features as small as 35 ${\mu}$m.</description>

      <title>Topological Photon Transport in Programmable Photonic Processors via Discretized Evolution of Synthetic Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photons, unlike electrons, do not couple directly to magnetic fields, yet synthetic gauge fields can impart magnetic-like responses and enable topological transport. Discretized Floquet evolution provides a controlled route, where the time-ordered sequencing of non-commuting Hamiltonians imprints complex hopping phases and breaks time-reversal symmetry. However, stabilizing such driven dynamics and observing unambiguous topological signatures on a reconfigurable platform has remained challenging. Here we demonstrate synthetic gauge fields for light on a programmable photonic processor by implementing discretized Floquet drives that combine static and dynamic phases. This approach reveals hallmark features of topological transport: chiral circulation that reverses under drive inversion, flux-controlled interference with high visibility, and robust directional flow stabilized by maximizing the minimal Floquet quasi-energy gap. The dynamics are further characterized by a first-harmonic phase order parameter, whose per-period winding number quantifies angular drift and reverses sign with the drive order. These results establish discretized, gap-optimized Floquet evolution as a versatile and fully programmable framework for topological photonics, providing a compact route to engineer gauge fields, stabilize driven phases, and probe winding-number signatures of chiral transport.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Hyperpolarizability of Crystals with Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that higher-order electric susceptibilities in crystals can be enhanced and understood through nontrivial topological invariants and quantum geometry, using one-dimensional $\pi$-conjugated chains as representative model systems. First, we show that the crystalline-symmetry-protected topology of these chains imposes a lower bound on their quantum metric and hyperpolarizabilities. Second, we employ numerical simulations to reveal the tunability of nonlinear, quantum geometry-driven optical responses in various one-dimensional crystals in which band topology can be externally controlled. Third, we develop a semiclassical picture to deliver an intuitive understanding of these effects. Our findings offer a firm interpretation of otherwise elusive experimental observations of colossal hyperpolarizabilities and establish guidelines for designing topological materials of any dimensionality with enhanced nonlinear optical properties.</description>

      <title>Optical Interference Effect in Strong-field Electronic Coherence Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated strong-field-induced electronic coherences in argon and molecular nitrogen ions created by high-intensity, few-cycle infrared laser pulses. This is a step toward the long-sought goal of strong-field coherent control in molecular chemistry. We employed high-intensity, few-cycle infrared laser pulses in a pump-probe setup to investigate a recent prediction that electronic coherences in nitrogen molecules change the ion yields vs. pump-probe delay. [Yuen and Lin, Phys. Rev. A 109, L011101 (2024)]. The predicted coherence signals in molecular nitrogen could not be resolved above the optical interference of the pump and probe pulses; a simultaneous measurement clearly resolved the induced cation fine-structure coherence in strong-field-ionized argon. The results of our comparison with simulations suggest that optical interference effects manifest differently in each ionic species and must be carefully accounted for when interpreting experimental data. We found that nonsequential double ionization in the low-intensity region of the focal volume can reduce the visibility of coherence generated by two-pulse sequential ionization, and we quantify the importance of pulse shape and spectral characteristics for isolating the desired coherence signals.</description>

      <title>Ionization rate vs. laser intensity determined from ion count vs. peak intensity due to neutral gas exposure to an 800 nm ultrashort pulsed laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optical cycle-averaged ionization rate of Ar, O$_{2}$, and N$_{2}$ vs. local instantaneous laser intensity $I$ for linear polarized $800$ nm light is determined up to approx. $300$ TW/cm$^{2}$ by numerically inverting published time-of-flight ion spectrometer data. The published Ar$^{+}$ collection efficiency of the microchannel plate (MCP) at the end of the spectrometer and its $I_{0}$ scale are recalibrated by fitting it to its high $I_{0}$ solution. The relative collection efficiencies of the other species are determined by published MCP cathode data. Results for O$_2$ are consistent with a reevaluation of published data used to determine its cross section $\sigma_8$ in the multiphoton (low $I$) regime.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, justified by the separation of characteristic coupling, dephasing, and thermal relaxation rates. Simulations predict rapid decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. More broadly, fluorescent proteins emerge as tractable model systems for probing evolutionary pressures on chromoprotein photophysics and quantum dynamics. Cryogenic cooling may extend coherence time into the regime required for ultrafast gate operations, suggesting fluorescent protein dimers as a viable platform for bio-inspired qubits.</description>

      <title>No oscillating subradiant correlations in a strongly driven quantum emitter array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study time-dependent correlations in a strongly driven array of $N$ two-level atoms, coupled to photons in a waveguide. We focus on the spectrum $\{\lambda\}$ of the Liouvillian superoperator, which determines the correlation decay rates $-\Re \lambda$ and the frequencies $\Im\lambda$. Our main finding is the suppression of subradiant oscillating correlations between atomic states by a strong coherent drive of amplitude $\Omega$: $|\Re \lambda|\ge m\gamma/2$, where $\gamma$ is the single-atom spontaneous decay rate and $m=|\Im \lambda/(2\Omega)|$ is a nonzero integer for correlations oscillating in time $\propto \exp(\pm 2i m|\Omega| t)$. This limit is independent of the number of atoms $N$; it holds both for small arrays and in the macroscopic limit. We demonstrate the suppression of subradiance numerically and provide a rigorous proof based on the analytical decomposition of the Liouvillian using spectral theory of simplicial complexes and posets.</description>

      <title>Simple Vector Magnetometer Based on Ground State Hanle Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method for determining the azimuthal phase (angle) of a magnetic field by exploiting phase matching of laser beams in a ground-state Hanle effect (GHSE) configuration. This approach is based on the symmetry of the system's Hamiltonian and the existence of a phase-independent frame, allowing for direct determination of the field orientation. As a proof of concept, we performed preliminary experiments using the Fg=1 to Fe=0 transition of the D2 line in 87Rb, with three laser beams to demonstrate the phase (azimuthal) dependence of the observed Hanle resonance signals. While our current setup does not include active phase control, the key features predicted by our method were observed, validating its conceptual foundation. Additionally, we measured two components of the stray magnetic field in our laboratory as an illustration. This method leverages the Hanle effect's inherent sensitivity to both the magnitude and orientation of magnetic fields, as well as the underlying symmetry properties of the atomic system, and offers a pathway for precise, calibration-free determination of magnetic field orientation.</description>
