      <title>Enabling Low-Cost Secure Computing on Untrusted In-Memory Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern computing systems are limited in performance by the memory bandwidth available to processors, a problem known as the memory wall. Processing-in-Memory (PIM) promises to substantially improve this problem by moving processing closer to the data, improving effective data bandwidth, and leading to superior performance on memory-intensive workloads. However, integrating PIM modules within a secure computing system raises an interesting challenge: unencrypted data has to move off-chip to the PIM, exposing the data to attackers and breaking assumptions on Trusted Computing Bases (TCBs). To tackle this challenge, this paper leverages multi-party computation (MPC) techniques, specifically arithmetic secret sharing and Yao's garbled circuits, to outsource bandwidth-intensive computation securely to PIM. Additionally, we leverage precomputation optimization to prevent the CPU's portion of the MPC from becoming a bottleneck. We evaluate our approach using the UPMEM PIM system over various applications such as Deep Learning Recommendation Model inference and Logistic Regression. Our evaluations demonstrate up to a $14.66\times$ speedup compared to a secure CPU configuration while maintaining data confidentiality and integrity when outsourcing linear and/or nonlinear computation.</description>

      <title>Pandora's Box: Cross-Chain Arbitrages in the Realm of Blockchain Interoperability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over recent years, the blockchain ecosystem has grown significantly with the emergence of new Layer-1 (L1) and Layer-2 (L2) networks. These blockchains typically host Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes) for trading assets such as native currencies and stablecoins. While this diversity enriches the ecosystem, it also fragments liquidity, posing challenges for DEXes offering the same assets across multiple blockchains. This fragmentation leads to price discrepancies, creating opportunities like arbitrages for profit-seeking traders, which fall under the broader category of exploitative economic practices known as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). Although MEV extraction has been extensively studied within single domains (i.e., individual blockchains), cross-chain arbitrages, a form of cross-domain MEV, have received little attention due to their non-atomic nature, complicating both execution and detection.
  In this paper, we shed light on opaque cross-chain MEV activities by presenting the first systematic study of two non-atomic cross-chain arbitrage strategies: Sequence-Independent Arbitrage (SIA) and Sequence-Dependent Arbitrage (SDA). The former involves independent, opposite-direction trades across chains, while the latter relies on asset bridges. We analyze the effectiveness of these strategies across nine blockchains over a one-year period from September 2023 to August 2024, identifying 260,808 cross-chain arbitrages, 32.37% of which involve bridging solutions. These arbitrages generated a lower-bound profit of 9,496,115.28 USD from a total traded volume of 465,797,487.98 USD. Additionally, we examine the security implications of cross-chain arbitrages, uncovering centralization among arbitrageurs, network congestion caused by failed transactions, and growing private mempool adoption. Finally, we discuss sequencer incentives and propose a risk-optimized arbitrage strategy.</description>

      <title>Do We Really Need to Design New Byzantine-robust Aggregation Rules?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a global machine learning model through a server, without exchanging their private training data. However, the decentralized aspect of FL makes it susceptible to poisoning attacks, where malicious clients can manipulate the global model by sending altered local model updates. To counter these attacks, a variety of aggregation rules designed to be resilient to Byzantine failures have been introduced. Nonetheless, these methods can still be vulnerable to sophisticated attacks or depend on unrealistic assumptions about the server. In this paper, we demonstrate that there is no need to design new Byzantine-robust aggregation rules; instead, FL can be secured by enhancing the robustness of well-established aggregation rules. To this end, we present FoundationFL, a novel defense mechanism against poisoning attacks. FoundationFL involves the server generating synthetic updates after receiving local model updates from clients. It then applies existing Byzantine-robust foundational aggregation rules, such as Trimmed-mean or Median, to combine clients' model updates with the synthetic ones. We theoretically establish the convergence performance of FoundationFL under Byzantine settings. Comprehensive experiments across several real-world datasets validate the efficiency of our FoundationFL method.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning over Ring-All-Reduce Distributed Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has gained attention as a distributed learning paradigm for its data privacy benefits and accelerated convergence through parallel computation. Traditional FL relies on a server-client (SC) architecture, where a central server coordinates multiple clients to train a global model, but this approach faces scalability challenges due to server communication bottlenecks. To overcome this, the ring-all-reduce (RAR) architecture has been introduced, eliminating the central server and achieving bandwidth optimality. However, the tightly coupled nature of RAR's ring topology exposes it to unique Byzantine attack risks not present in SC-based FL. Despite its potential, designing Byzantine-robust RAR-based FL algorithms remains an open problem. To address this gap, we propose BRACE (Byzantine-robust ring-all-reduce), the first RAR-based FL algorithm to achieve both Byzantine robustness and communication efficiency. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of BRACE under Byzantine attacks, demonstrate its bandwidth efficiency, and validate its practical effectiveness through experiments. Our work offers a foundational understanding of Byzantine-robust RAR-based FL design.</description>

      <title>Poisoning Attacks and Defenses to Federated Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model with the assistance of a server. However, its distributed nature makes it susceptible to poisoning attacks, where malicious clients can compromise the global model by sending harmful local model updates to the server. To unlearn an accurate global model from a poisoned one after identifying malicious clients, federated unlearning has been introduced. Yet, current research on federated unlearning has primarily concentrated on its effectiveness and efficiency, overlooking the security challenges it presents. In this work, we bridge the gap via proposing BadUnlearn, the first poisoning attacks targeting federated unlearning. In BadUnlearn, malicious clients send specifically designed local model updates to the server during the unlearning process, aiming to ensure that the resulting unlearned model remains poisoned. To mitigate these threats, we propose UnlearnGuard, a robust federated unlearning framework that is provably robust against both existing poisoning attacks and our BadUnlearn. The core concept of UnlearnGuard is for the server to estimate the clients' local model updates during the unlearning process and employ a filtering strategy to verify the accuracy of these estimations. Theoretically, we prove that the model unlearned through UnlearnGuard closely resembles one obtained by train-from-scratch. Empirically, we show that BadUnlearn can effectively corrupt existing federated unlearning methods, while UnlearnGuard remains secure against poisoning attacks.</description>

      <title>Cute-Lock: Behavioral and Structural Multi-Key Logic Locking Using Time Base Keys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outsourcing of semiconductor manufacturing raises security risks, such as piracy and overproduction of hardware intellectual property. To overcome this challenge, logic locking has emerged to lock a given circuit using additional key bits. While single-key logic locking approaches have demonstrated serious vulnerability to a wide range of attacks, multi-key solutions, if carefully designed, can provide a reliable defense against not only oracle-guided logic attacks, but also removal and dataflow attacks. In this paper, using time base keys, we propose, implement and evaluate a family of secure multi-key logic locking algorithms called Cute-Lock that can be applied both in RTL-level behavioral and netlist-level structural representations of sequential circuits. Our extensive experimental results under a diverse range of attacks confirm that, compared to vulnerable state-of-the-art methods, employing the Cute-Lock family drives attacking attempts to a dead end without additional overhead.</description>

      <title>When Everyday Devices Become Weapons: A Closer Look at the Pager and Walkie-talkie Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery-powered technologies like pagers and walkie-talkies have long been integral to civilian and military operations. However, the potential for such everyday devices to be weaponized has largely been underestimated in the realm of cybersecurity. In September 2024, Lebanon experienced a series of unprecedented, coordinated explosions triggered through compromised pagers and walkie-talkies, creating a new category of attack in the domain of cyber-physical warfare. This attack not only disrupted critical communication networks but also resulted in injuries, loss of life, and exposed significant national security vulnerabilities, prompting governments and organizations worldwide to reevaluate their cybersecurity frameworks. This article provides an in-depth investigation into the infamous Pager and Walkie-Talkie attacks, analyzing both technical and non-technical dimensions. Furthermore, the study extends its scope to explore vulnerabilities in other battery-powered infrastructures, such as battery management systems, highlighting their potential exploitation. Existing prevention and detection techniques are reviewed, with an emphasis on their limitations and the challenges they face in addressing emerging threats. Finally, the article discusses emerging methodologies, particularly focusing on the role of physical inspection, as a critical component of future security measures. This research aims to provide actionable insights to bolster the resilience of cyber-physical systems in an increasingly interconnected world.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained 1-Day Vulnerability Detection in Binaries via Patch Code Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 1-day vulnerabilities in binaries have become a major threat to software security. Patch presence test is one of the effective ways to detect the vulnerability. However, existing patch presence test works do not perform well in practical scenarios due to the interference from the various compilers and optimizations, patch-similar code blocks, and irrelevant functions in stripped binaries. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named PLocator, which leverages stable values from both the patch code and its context, extracted from the control flow graph, to accurately locate the real patch code in the target function, offering a practical solution for real-world vulnerability detection scenarios.
  To evaluate the effectiveness of PLocator, we collected 73 CVEs and constructed two comprehensive datasets ($Dataset_{-irr}$ and $Dataset_{+irr}$), comprising 1,090 and 27,250 test cases at four compilation optimization levels and two compilers with three different experiments, i.e., Same, XO (cross-optimizations), and XC (cross-compilers). The results demonstrate that PLocator achieves an average TPR of 88.2% and FPR of 12.9% in a short amount of time, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches by 26.7% and 63.5%, respectively, indicating that PLocator is more practical for the 1-day vulnerability detection task.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Segmentation and Behavioral Profiling for Ransomware Detection Using Temporal-Correlation Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of cyber threats has outpaced traditional detection methodologies, necessitating innovative approaches capable of addressing the adaptive and complex behaviors of modern adversaries. A novel framework was introduced, leveraging Temporal-Correlation Graphs to model the intricate relationships and temporal patterns inherent in malicious operations. The approach dynamically captured behavioral anomalies, offering a robust mechanism for distinguishing between benign and malicious activities in real-time scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrated the framework's effectiveness across diverse ransomware families, with consistently high precision, recall, and overall detection accuracy. Comparative evaluations highlighted its better performance over traditional signature-based and heuristic methods, particularly in handling polymorphic and previously unseen ransomware variants. The architecture was designed with scalability and modularity in mind, ensuring compatibility with enterprise-scale environments while maintaining resource efficiency. Analysis of encryption speeds, anomaly patterns, and temporal correlations provided deeper insights into the operational strategies of ransomware, validating the framework's adaptability to evolving threats. The research contributes to advancing cybersecurity technologies by integrating dynamic graph analytics and machine learning for future innovations in threat detection. Results from this study underline the potential for transforming the way organizations detect and mitigate complex cyberattacks.</description>

      <title>Virus: Harmful Fine-tuning Attack for Large Language Models Bypassing Guardrail Moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research shows that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to harmful fine-tuning attacks -- models lose their safety alignment ability after fine-tuning on a few harmful samples. For risk mitigation, a guardrail is typically used to filter out harmful samples before fine-tuning. By designing a new red-teaming method, we in this paper show that purely relying on the moderation guardrail for data filtration is not reliable. Our proposed attack method, dubbed Virus, easily bypasses the guardrail moderation by slightly modifying the harmful data. Experimental results show that the harmful data optimized by Virus is not detectable by the guardrail with up to 100\% leakage ratio, and can simultaneously achieve superior attack performance. Finally, the key message we want to convey through this paper is that: \textbf{it is reckless to consider guardrail moderation as a clutch at straws towards harmful fine-tuning attack}, as it cannot solve the inherent safety issue of the pre-trained LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/git-disl/Virus</description>

      <title>How Much Do Code Language Models Remember? An Investigation on Data Extraction Attacks before and after Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code language models, while widely popular, are often trained on unsanitized source code gathered from across the Internet. Previous work revealed that pre-trained models can remember the content of their training data and regurgitate them through data extraction attacks. Due to the large size of current models, only a few entities have the resources for pre-training such models. However, fine-tuning requires fewer resources and is increasingly used by both small and large entities for its effectiveness on specialized data. Such small curated data for fine-tuning might contain sensitive information or proprietary assets. In this study, we attack both pre-trained and fine-tuned code language models to investigate the extent of data extractability. We first develop a custom benchmark to assess the vulnerability of both pre-training and fine-tuning samples to extraction attacks. Our findings reveal that 54.9% of extractable pre-training data could be retrieved from StarCoder2-15B, whereas this number decreased to 23.5% after fine-tuning. This indicates that fine-tuning reduces the extractability of pre-training data. However, compared to larger models, fine-tuning smaller models increases their vulnerability to data extraction attacks on fine-tuning data. Given the potential sensitivity of fine-tuning data, this can lead to more severe consequences. Lastly, we also manually analyzed 2000 extractable samples before and after fine-tuning. We also found that data carriers and licensing information are the most likely data categories to be memorized from pre-trained and fine-tuned models, while the latter is the most likely to be forgotten after fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Towards Supporting Penetration Testing Education with Large Language Models: an Evaluation and Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cybersecurity education is challenging and it is helpful for educators to understand Large Language Models' (LLMs') capabilities for supporting education. This study evaluates the effectiveness of LLMs in conducting a variety of penetration testing tasks. Fifteen representative tasks were selected to cover a comprehensive range of real-world scenarios. We evaluate the performance of 6 models (GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Llama 3.1 405B, Mixtral 8x7B and WhiteRabbitNeo) upon the Metasploitable v3 Ubuntu image and OWASP WebGOAT. Our findings suggest that GPT-4o mini currently offers the most consistent support making it a valuable tool for educational purposes. However, its use in conjonction with WhiteRabbitNeo should be considered, because of its innovative approach to tool and command recommendations. This study underscores the need for continued research into optimising LLMs for complex, domain-specific tasks in cybersecurity education.</description>

      <title>Understanding Trust in Authentication Methods for Icelandic Digital Public Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital public services have revolutionised citizen and private sector interactions with governments. Certain communities are strongly dependent on such digital services for ensuring the availability of public services due to geographical isolation or the presence of adverse geophysical and weather phenomena. However, strong and effective security is key to maintaining the integrity of public records and services yet also for ensuring trust in them. Trust is essential for user uptake, particularly given a global increase in data-protection concerns and a turbulent geopolitical security environment. In this paper, we examine the case of public trust in various forms of authentication for electronic identification in Iceland, which has high availability requirements for digital public services due to its unique and dynamic geophysical characteristics. Additionally, Iceland has historically low levels of institutional trust which may conflict with the requirement for an increased need for digital public services. Through surveying the Icelandic general public, we find that there is a high-level of trust in digital identification services across all demographics. We conclude with a discussion and future research challenges towards improving the effectiveness of authentication considering the diverse groups within Icelandic society, such as the rapidly increasing population of migrants and the large and dynamic population of tourists.</description>

      <title>BitMLx: Secure Cross-chain Smart Contracts For Bitcoin-style Cryptocurrencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A smart contract is an interactive program that governs funds in the realm of a single cryptocurrency. Yet, the many existing cryptocurrencies have spurred the design of cross-chain applications that require interactions with multiple cryptocurrencies simultaneously. Currently, cross-chain applications are implemented as use-case-specific cryptographic protocols that serve as overlay to synchronize smart contract executions in the different cryptocurrencies. Hence, their design requires substantial expertise, as well as a security analysis in complex cryptographic frameworks.
  In this work, we present BitMLx, the first domain-specific language for cross-chain smart contracts, enabling interactions with several users that hold funds across multiple Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies. We contribute a compiler to automatically translate a BitMLx contract into one contract per involved cryptocurrency and a user strategy that synchronizes the execution of these contracts. We prove that an honest user, who follows the prescribed strategy when interacting with the several contracts, ends up with at least as many funds as in the corresponding execution of the BitMLx contract. Last, but not least, we implement the BitMLx compiler and demonstrate its utility in the design of illustrative examples of cross-chain applications such as multi-chain donations or loans across different cryptocurrencies.</description>

      <title>Attacker Control and Bug Prioritization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As bug-finding methods improve, bug-fixing capabilities are exceeded, resulting in an accumulation of potential vulnerabilities. There is thus a need for efficient and precise bug prioritization based on exploitability. In this work, we explore the notion of control of an attacker over a vulnerability's parameters, which is an often overlooked factor of exploitability. We show that taint as well as straightforward qualitative and quantitative notions of control are not enough to effectively differentiate vulnerabilities. Instead, we propose to focus analysis on feasible value sets, which we call domains of control, in order to better take into account threat models and expert insight. Our new Shrink and Split algorithm efficiently extracts domains of control from path constraints obtained with symbolic execution and renders them in an easily processed, human-readable form. This in turn allows to automatically compute more complex control metrics, such as weighted Quantitative Control, which factors in the varying threat levels of different values. Experiments show that our method is both efficient and precise. In particular, it is the only one able to distinguish between vulnerabilities such as cve-2019-14192 and cve-2022-30552, while revealing a mistake in the human evaluation of cve-2022-30790. The high degree of automation of our tool also brings us closer to a fully-automated evaluation pipeline.</description>

      <title>Investigating Vulnerability Disclosures in Open-Source Software Using Bug Bounty Reports and Security Advisories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the world of open-source software (OSS), the number of known vulnerabilities has tremendously increased. The GitHub Advisory Database contains advisories for security risks in GitHub-hosted OSS projects. As of 09/25/2023, there are 197,609 unreviewed GitHub security advisories. Of those unreviewed, at least 63,852 are publicly documented vulnerabilities, potentially leaving many OSS projects vulnerable. Recently, bug bounty platforms have emerged to focus solely on providing bounties to help secure OSS. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on 3,798 reviewed GitHub security advisories and 4,033 disclosed OSS bug bounty reports, a perspective that is currently understudied, because they contain comprehensive information about security incidents, e.g., the nature of vulnerabilities, their impact, and how they were resolved. We are the first to determine the explicit process describing how OSS vulnerabilities propagate from security advisories and bug bounty reports, which are the main intermediaries between vulnerability reporters, OSS maintainers, and dependent projects, to vulnerable OSS projects and entries in global vulnerability databases and possibly back. This process uncovers how missing or delayed CVE assignments for OSS vulnerabilities result in projects, both in and out of OSS, not being notified of necessary security updates promptly and corresponding bottlenecks. Based on our findings, we provide suggestions, actionable items, and future research directions to help improve the security posture of OSS projects.</description>

      <title>Privacy Audit as Bits Transmission: (Im)possibilities for Audit by One Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auditing algorithms' privacy typically involves simulating a game-based protocol that guesses which of two adjacent datasets was the original input. Traditional approaches require thousands of such simulations, leading to significant computational overhead. Recent methods propose single-run auditing of the target algorithm to address this, substantially reducing computational cost. However, these methods' general applicability and tightness in producing empirical privacy guarantees remain uncertain.
  This work studies such problems in detail. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a unifying framework for privacy audits based on information-theoretic principles, modeling the audit as a bit transmission problem in a noisy channel. This formulation allows us to derive fundamental limits and develop an audit approach that yields tight privacy lower bounds for various DP protocols. Second, leveraging this framework, we demystify the method of privacy audit by one run, identifying the conditions under which single-run audits are feasible or infeasible. Our analysis provides general guidelines for conducting privacy audits and offers deeper insights into the privacy audit.
  Finally, through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach produces tighter privacy lower bounds on common differentially private mechanisms while requiring significantly fewer observations. We also provide a case study illustrating that our method successfully detects privacy violations in flawed implementations of private algorithms.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Log4Shell: Analyzing the Impact and Response to the Log4j Vulnerabil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realm of technology frequently confronts threats posed by adversaries exploiting loopholes in programs. Among these, the Log4Shell vulnerability in the Log4j library stands out due to its widespread impact. Log4j, a prevalent software library for log recording, is integrated into millions of devices worldwide. The Log4Shell vulnerability facilitates remote code execution with relative ease. Its combination with the extensive utilization of Log4j marks it as one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities discovered to date. The severity of this vulnerability, which quickly escalated into a media frenzy, prompted swift action within the industry, thereby mitigating potential extensive damage. This rapid response was crucial, as the consequences could have been significantly more severe if the vulnerability had been exploited by adversaries prior to its public disclosure.
  This paper details the discovery of the Log4Shell vulnerability and its potential for exploitation. It examines the vulnerability's impact on various stakeholders, including governments, the Apache Software Foundation (which manages the Log4j library), and companies affected by it. The paper also describes strategies for defending against Log4Shell in several scenarios. While numerous Log4j users acted promptly to safeguard their systems, the vulnerability remains a persistent threat until all vulnerable instances of the library are adequately protected.</description>

      <title>Atomic Transfer Graphs: Secure-by-design Protocols for Heterogeneous Blockchain Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heterogeneity of the blockchain landscape has motivated the design of blockchain protocols tailored to specific blockchains and applications that, hence, require custom security proofs. We observe that many blockchain protocols share common security and functionality goals, which can be captured by an atomic transfer graph (ATG) describing the structure of desired transfers. Based on this observation, we contribute a framework for generating secure-by-design protocols that realize these goals. The resulting protocols build upon Conditional Timelock Contracts (CTLCs), a novel minimal smart contract functionality that can be implemented in a large variety of cryptocurrencies with a restricted scripting language (e.g., Bitcoin), and payment channels. We show how ATGs, in addition to enabling novel applications, capture the security and functionality goals of existing applications, including many examples from payment channel networks and complex multi-party cross-currency swaps among Ethereum-style cryptocurrencies. Our framework is the first to provide generic and provably secure protocols for all these use cases while matching or improving the performance of existing use-case-specific protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) is an important enabling technology for data privacy in modern distributed applications. We develop a new type theory to automatically enforce correctness,confidentiality, and integrity properties of protocols written in the \emph{Prelude/Overture} language framework. Judgements in the type theory are predicated on SMT verifications in a theory of finite fields, which supports precise and efficient analysis. Our approach is automated, compositional, scalable, and generalizes to arbitrary prime fields for data and key sizes.</description>

      <title>A sketch of an AI control safety case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As LLM agents gain a greater capacity to cause harm, AI developers might increasingly rely on control measures such as monitoring to justify that they are safe. We sketch how developers could construct a "control safety case", which is a structured argument that models are incapable of subverting control measures in order to cause unacceptable outcomes. As a case study, we sketch an argument that a hypothetical LLM agent deployed internally at an AI company won't exfiltrate sensitive information. The sketch relies on evidence from a "control evaluation,"' where a red team deliberately designs models to exfiltrate data in a proxy for the deployment environment. The safety case then hinges on several claims: (1) the red team adequately elicits model capabilities to exfiltrate data, (2) control measures remain at least as effective in deployment, and (3) developers conservatively extrapolate model performance to predict the probability of data exfiltration in deployment. This safety case sketch is a step toward more concrete arguments that can be used to show that a dangerously capable LLM agent is safe to deploy.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning With Individualized Privacy Through Client Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With growing concerns about user data collection, individualized privacy has emerged as a promising solution to balance protection and utility by accounting for diverse user privacy preferences. Instead of enforcing a uniform level of anonymization for all users, this approach allows individuals to choose privacy settings that align with their comfort levels. Building on this idea, we propose an adapted method for enabling Individualized Differential Privacy (IDP) in Federated Learning (FL) by handling clients according to their personal privacy preferences. By extending the SAMPLE algorithm from centralized settings to FL, we calculate client-specific sampling rates based on their heterogeneous privacy budgets and integrate them into a modified IDP-FedAvg algorithm. We test this method under realistic privacy distributions and multiple datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves clear improvements over uniform DP baselines, reducing the trade-off between privacy and utility. Compared to the alternative SCALE method in related work, which assigns differing noise scales to clients, our method performs notably better. However, challenges remain for complex tasks with non-i.i.d. data, primarily stemming from the constraints of the decentralized setting.</description>

      <title>CAMP in the Odyssey: Provably Robust Reinforcement Learning with Certified Radius Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained widespread adoption in control and decision-making tasks due to its strong performance in dynamic environments. However, DRL agents are vulnerable to noisy observations and adversarial attacks, and concerns about the adversarial robustness of DRL systems have emerged. Recent efforts have focused on addressing these robustness issues by establishing rigorous theoretical guarantees for the returns achieved by DRL agents in adversarial settings. Among these approaches, policy smoothing has proven to be an effective and scalable method for certifying the robustness of DRL agents. Nevertheless, existing certifiably robust DRL relies on policies trained with simple Gaussian augmentations, resulting in a suboptimal trade-off between certified robustness and certified return. To address this issue, we introduce a novel paradigm dubbed \texttt{C}ertified-r\texttt{A}dius-\texttt{M}aximizing \texttt{P}olicy (\texttt{CAMP}) training. \texttt{CAMP} is designed to enhance DRL policies, achieving better utility without compromising provable robustness. By leveraging the insight that the global certified radius can be derived from local certified radii based on training-time statistics, \texttt{CAMP} formulates a surrogate loss related to the local certified radius and optimizes the policy guided by this surrogate loss. We also introduce \textit{policy imitation} as a novel technique to stabilize \texttt{CAMP} training. Experimental results demonstrate that \texttt{CAMP} significantly improves the robustness-return trade-off across various tasks. Based on the results, \texttt{CAMP} can achieve up to twice the certified expected return compared to that of baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/NeuralSec/camp-robust-rl.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the private information retrieval (PIR) problem for a multigraph-based replication system, where each set of $r$ files is stored on two of the servers according to an underlying $r$-multigraph. Our goal is to establish upper and lower bounds on the PIR capacity of the $r$-multigraph. Specifically, we first propose a construction for multigraph-based PIR systems that leverages the symmetry of the underlying graph-based PIR scheme, deriving a capacity lower bound for such multigraphs. Then, we establish a general upper bound using linear programming, expressed as a function of the underlying graph parameters. Our bounds are demonstrated to be tight for PIR systems on multipaths for even number of vertices.</description>

      <title>Improving Your Model Ranking on Chatbot Arena by Vote Rigging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chatbot Arena is a popular platform for evaluating LLMs by pairwise battles, where users vote for their preferred response from two randomly sampled anonymous models. While Chatbot Arena is widely regarded as a reliable LLM ranking leaderboard, we show that crowdsourced voting can be rigged to improve (or decrease) the ranking of a target model $m_{t}$. We first introduce a straightforward target-only rigging strategy that focuses on new battles involving $m_{t}$, identifying it via watermarking or a binary classifier, and exclusively voting for $m_{t}$ wins. However, this strategy is practically inefficient because there are over $190$ models on Chatbot Arena and on average only about $1\%$ of new battles will involve $m_{t}$. To overcome this, we propose omnipresent rigging strategies, exploiting the Elo rating mechanism of Chatbot Arena that any new vote on a battle can influence the ranking of the target model $m_{t}$, even if $m_{t}$ is not directly involved in the battle. We conduct experiments on around $1.7$ million historical votes from the Chatbot Arena Notebook, showing that omnipresent rigging strategies can improve model rankings by rigging only hundreds of new votes. While we have evaluated several defense mechanisms, our findings highlight the importance of continued efforts to prevent vote rigging. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Rigging-ChatbotArena.</description>

      <title>Gotta Detect 'Em All: Fake Base Station and Multi-Step Attack Detection in Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fake base stations (FBSes) pose a significant security threat by impersonating legitimate base stations (BSes). Though efforts have been made to defeat this threat, up to this day, the presence of FBSes and the multi-step attacks (MSAs) stemming from them can lead to unauthorized surveillance, interception of sensitive information, and disruption of network services. Therefore, detecting these malicious entities is crucial to ensure the security and reliability of cellular networks. Traditional detection methods often rely on additional hardware, rules, signal scanning, changing protocol specifications, or cryptographic mechanisms that have limitations and incur huge infrastructure costs. In this paper, we develop FBSDetector-an effective and efficient detection solution that can reliably detect FBSes and MSAs from layer-3 network traces using machine learning (ML) at the user equipment (UE) side. To develop FBSDetector, we create FBSAD and MSAD, the first-ever high-quality and large-scale datasets incorporating instances of FBSes and 21 MSAs. These datasets capture the network traces in different real-world cellular network scenarios (including mobility and different attacker capabilities) incorporating legitimate BSes and FBSes. Our novel ML framework, specifically designed to detect FBSes in a multi-level approach for packet classification using stateful LSTM with attention and trace level classification and MSAs using graph learning, can effectively detect FBSes with an accuracy of 96% and a false positive rate of 2.96%, and recognize MSAs with an accuracy of 86% and a false positive rate of 3.28%. We deploy FBSDetector as a real-world solution to protect end-users through a mobile app and validate it in real-world environments. Compared to the existing heuristic-based solutions that fail to detect FBSes, FBSDetector can detect FBSes in the wild in real-time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent initiatives known as Future Internet Architectures (FIAs) seek to redesign the Internet to improve performance, scalability, and security. However, some governments perceive Internet access as a threat to their political standing and engage in widespread network surveillance and censorship. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the design principles of prominent FIAs in terms of their packet structure, addressing and naming schemes, and routing protocols to foster discussion on how these new systems interact with censorship and surveillance apparatuses. Further, we assess the extent to which existing surveillance and censorship mechanisms can successfully target FIA users while discussing privacy enhancing technologies to counter these mechanisms. We conclude by providing guidelines for future research into novel FIA-based privacy-enhancing technologies, and recommendations to guide the evaluation of these technologies.</description>

Abstract: This paper examines the evolving landscape of machine learning (ML) and its profound impact across various sectors, with a special focus on the emerging field of Privacy-preserving Machine Learning (PPML). As ML applications become increasingly integral to industries like telecommunications, financial technology, and surveillance, they raise significant privacy concerns, necessitating the development of PPML strategies. The paper highlights the unique challenges in safeguarding privacy within ML frameworks, which stem from the diverse capabilities of potential adversaries, including their ability to infer sensitive information from model outputs or training data.
  We delve into the spectrum of threat models that characterize adversarial intentions, ranging from membership and attribute inference to data reconstruction. The paper emphasizes the importance of maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of training data, outlining current research efforts that focus on refining training data to minimize privacy-sensitive information and enhancing data processing techniques to uphold privacy.
  Through a comprehensive analysis of privacy leakage risks and countermeasures in both centralized and collaborative learning settings, this paper aims to provide a thorough understanding of effective strategies for protecting ML training data against privacy intrusions. It explores the balance between data privacy and model utility, shedding light on privacy-preserving techniques that leverage cryptographic methods, Differential Privacy, and Trusted Execution Environments. The discussion extends to the application of these techniques in sensitive domains, underscoring the critical role of PPML in ensuring the privacy and security of ML systems.</description>

Abstract: Merkle hash trees are the standard method to protect the integrity and freshness of stored data. However, hash trees introduce additional compute and I/O costs on the I/O critical path, and prior efforts have not fully characterized these costs. In this paper, we quantify performance overheads of storage-level hash trees in realistic settings. We then design an optimized tree structure called Dynamic Merkle Trees (DMTs) based on an analysis of root causes of overheads. DMTs exploit patterns in workloads to deliver up to a 2.2x throughput and latency improvement over the state of the art. Our novel approach provides a promising new direction to achieve integrity guarantees in storage efficiently and at scale.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Definition of Adversarial Robustness for post-hoc OOD Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15104v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is critical for safely deploying deep learning models in real-world scenarios. In recent years, many OOD detectors have been developed, and even the benchmarking has been standardized, i.e. OpenOOD. The number of post-hoc detectors is growing fast. They are showing an option to protect a pre-trained classifier against natural distribution shifts and claim to be ready for real-world scenarios. However, its effectiveness in dealing with adversarial examples (AdEx) has been neglected in most studies. In cases where an OOD detector includes AdEx in its experiments, the lack of uniform parameters for AdEx makes it difficult to accurately evaluate the performance of the OOD detector. This paper investigates the adversarial robustness of 16 post-hoc detectors against various evasion attacks. It also discusses a roadmap for adversarial defense in OOD detectors that would help adversarial robustness. We believe that level 1 (AdEx on a unified dataset) should be added to any OOD detector to see the limitations. The last level in the roadmap (defense against adaptive attacks) we added for integrity from an adversarial machine learning (AML) point of view, which we do not believe is the ultimate goal for OOD detectors.</description>

      <title>Prompt Obfuscation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: System prompts that include detailed instructions to describe the task performed by the underlying LLM can easily transform foundation models into tools and services with minimal overhead. Because of their crucial impact on the utility, they are often considered intellectual property, similar to the code of a software product. However, extracting system prompts is easily possible. As of today, there is no effective countermeasure to prevent the stealing of system prompts and all safeguarding efforts could be evaded. In this work, we propose an alternative to conventional system prompts. We introduce prompt obfuscation to prevent the extraction of the system prompt with only little overhead. The core idea is to find a representation of the original system prompt that leads to the same functionality, while the obfuscated system prompt does not contain any information that allows conclusions to be drawn about the original system prompt. We evaluate our approach by comparing our obfuscated prompt output with the output of the original prompt, using eight distinct metrics, to measure the lexical, character-level, and semantic similarity. We show that the obfuscated version is constantly on par with the original one. We further perform three different deobfuscation attacks with varying attacker knowledge--covering both black-box and white-box conditions--and show that in realistic attack scenarios an attacker is not able to extract meaningful information. Overall, we demonstrate that prompt obfuscation is an effective mechanism to safeguard the intellectual property of a system prompt while maintaining the same utility as the original prompt.</description>

      <title>Generated Data with Fake Privacy: Hidden Dangers of Fine-tuning Large Language Models on Generated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in various domain-specific tasks, with their performance often improving substantially after fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning with real-world data introduces privacy risks. To mitigate these risks, developers increasingly rely on synthetic data generation as an alternative to using real data, as data generated by traditional models is believed to be different from real-world data. However, with the advanced capabilities of LLMs, the distinction between real data and data generated by these models has become nearly indistinguishable. This convergence introduces similar privacy risks for generated data to those associated with real data. Our study investigates whether fine-tuning with LLM-generated data truly enhances privacy or introduces additional privacy risks by examining the structural characteristics of data generated by LLMs, focusing on two primary fine-tuning approaches: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with unstructured (plain-text) generated data and self-instruct tuning. In the scenario of SFT, the data is put into a particular instruction tuning format used by previous studies. We use Personal Information Identifier (PII) leakage and Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on the Pythia Model Suite and Open Pre-trained Transformer (OPT) to measure privacy risks. Notably, after fine-tuning with unstructured generated data, the rate of successful PII extractions for Pythia increased by over 20%, highlighting the potential privacy implications of such approaches. Furthermore, the ROC-AUC score of MIAs for Pythia-6.9b, the second biggest model of the suite, increases over 40% after self-instruct tuning. Our results indicate the potential privacy risks associated with fine-tuning LLMs using generated data, underscoring the need for careful consideration of privacy safeguards in such approaches.</description>

      <title>The 2020 United States Decennial Census Is More Private Than You (Might) Think</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The U.S. Decennial Census serves as the foundation for many high-profile policy decision-making processes, including federal funding allocation and redistricting. In 2020, the Census Bureau adopted differential privacy to protect the confidentiality of individual responses through a disclosure avoidance system that injects noise into census data tabulations. The Bureau subsequently posed an open question: Could stronger privacy guarantees be obtained for the 2020 U.S. Census compared to their published guarantees, or equivalently, had the privacy budgets been fully utilized?
  In this paper, we address this question affirmatively by demonstrating that the 2020 U.S. Census provides significantly stronger privacy protections than its nominal guarantees suggest at each of the eight geographical levels, from the national level down to the block level. This finding is enabled by our precise tracking of privacy losses using $f$-differential privacy, applied to the composition of private queries across these geographical levels. Our analysis reveals that the Census Bureau introduced unnecessarily high levels of noise to meet the specified privacy guarantees for the 2020 Census. Consequently, we show that noise variances could be reduced by $15.08\%$ to $24.82\%$ while maintaining nearly the same level of privacy protection for each geographical level, thereby improving the accuracy of privatized census statistics. We empirically demonstrate that reducing noise injection into census statistics mitigates distortion caused by privacy constraints in downstream applications of private census data, illustrated through a study examining the relationship between earnings and education.</description>

      <title>Misbinding Raw Public Keys to Identities in TLS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adoption of security protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) has significantly improved the state of traffic encryption and integrity protection on the Internet. Despite rigorous analysis, vulnerabilities continue to emerge, sometimes due to fundamental flaws in the protocol specification. This paper examines the security of TLS when using Raw Public Key (RPK) authentication. This mode has not been as extensively studied as X.509 certificates and Pre-Shared Keys (PSK). We develop a formal model of TLS RPK using applied pi calculus and the ProVerif verification tool, revealing that the RPK mode is susceptible to identity misbinding attacks. Our contributions include formal models of TLS RPK with several mechanisms for binding the endpoint identity to its public key, verification results, practical scenarios demonstrating the misbinding attack, and recommendations for mitigating such vulnerabilities. These findings highlight the need for improved security measures in TLS RPK.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models and Code Security: A Systematic Literature Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for automating various programming tasks, including security-related ones, such as detecting and fixing vulnerabilities. Despite their promising capabilities, when required to produce or modify pre-existing code, LLMs could introduce vulnerabilities unbeknown to the programmer. When analyzing code, they could miss clear vulnerabilities or signal nonexistent ones. In this Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we aim to investigate both the security benefits and potential drawbacks of using LLMs for a variety of code-related tasks. In particular, first we focus on the types of vulnerabilities that could be introduced by LLMs, when used for producing code. Second, we analyze the capabilities of LLMs to detect and fix vulnerabilities, in any given code, and how the prompting strategy of choice impacts their performance in these two tasks. Last, we provide an in-depth analysis on how data poisoning attacks on LLMs can impact performance in the aforementioned tasks.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Obfuscate Code? A Systematic Analysis of Large Language Models into Assembly Code Obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Malware authors often employ code obfuscations to make their malware harder to detect. Existing tools for generating obfuscated code often require access to the original source code (e.g., C++ or Java), and adding new obfuscations is a non-trivial, labor-intensive process. In this study, we ask the following question: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) potentially generate a new obfuscated assembly code? If so, this poses a risk to anti-virus engines and potentially increases the flexibility of attackers to create new obfuscation patterns. We answer this in the affirmative by developing the MetamorphASM benchmark comprising MetamorphASM Dataset (MAD) along with three code obfuscation techniques: dead code, register substitution, and control flow change. The MetamorphASM systematically evaluates the ability of LLMs to generate and analyze obfuscated code using MAD, which contains 328,200 obfuscated assembly code samples. We release this dataset and analyze the success rate of various LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5/4, GPT-4o-mini, Starcoder, CodeGemma, CodeLlama, CodeT5, and LLaMA 3.1) in generating obfuscated assembly code. The evaluation was performed using established information-theoretic metrics and manual human review to ensure correctness and provide the foundation for researchers to study and develop remediations to this risk.</description>

      <title>Quantum Token Obfuscation via Superposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum computing advances, traditional cryptographic security measures, including token obfuscation, face increasing vulnerability to quantum attacks. This paper presents a quantum-enhanced approach to token obfuscation that leverages quantum superposition and multi-basis verification to establish a resilient defense against such threats. In this method, tokens are encoded in superposition states, ensuring probabilistic concealment until measured, significantly increasing the computational difficulty of unauthorized reconstruction. A quantum decay protocol and a refresh mechanism are introduced to dynamically manage the token lifecycle, mitigating risks associated with prolonged token exposure and replay attacks. Experimental validation confirms the robustness of this approach, demonstrating an entropy quality score of 0.9996, a 0% success rate across five adversarial attack models, and an estimated false positive rate of 67%, highlighting the system's strict security constraints. These results validate the feasibility of quantum-based token obfuscation as a post-quantum cryptographic framework. By integrating dynamic token evolution, entropy-driven state transformations, and multi-basis verification, this approach provides a foundation for future quantum-secure authentication and access control mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Tight Sample Complexity Bounds for Parameter Estimation Under Quantum Differential Privacy for Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This short note provides tight upper and lower bounds for minimal number of samples (copies of quantum states) required to attain a prescribed accuracy (measured by error variance) for scalar parameters using unbiased estimators under quantum local differential privacy for qubits. In the small privacy budget $\epsilon$ regime, i.e., $\epsilon\ll 1$, the sample complexity scales as $\Theta(\epsilon^{-2})$. This bound matches that of classical parameter estimation under differential privacy. The lower bound loosens (converges to zero) in the large privacy budget regime, i.e., $\epsilon\gg 1$, but that case is not particularly interesting as tight bounds for parameter estimation in the noiseless case are widely known. That being said, extensions to systems with higher dimensions and tightening the bounds for the large privacy budget regime are interesting avenues for future research.</description>
