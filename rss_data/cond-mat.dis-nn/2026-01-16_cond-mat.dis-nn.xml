      <title>Emergent Nonperturbative Universal Floquet Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a robust, nonperturbative localization plateau emerges in periodically driven quasiperiodic lattices, independent of the static localization properties and drive protocol. Using exact Floquet dynamics, Floquet perturbation theory, and optimal-order van Vleck analysis, we identify a fine-tuned amplitude-to-frequency ratio where all Floquet states become localized despite dense resonances. The van Vleck expansion achieves superasymptotic accuracy up to an optimal orde; it ultimately breaks down due to resonant hybridization at a weak quasiperiodic potential, revealing that the observed localization is nonperturbative.</description>

      <title>Integral Variable Range Hopping for Modeling Electrical Transport in Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variable range hopping (VRH) model has been widely applied to describe electrical transport in disordered systems, providing theoretical formulas to fit temperature-dependent electric conductivity. These models rely on oversimplified assumptions that restrict their applicability and result in problematic fitting behaviors, yet their overusing situation is becoming increasingly serious. In this work we formulate an integral variable range hopping (IVRH) model, which replaces the empirical temperature power-law dependence in standard VRH theories with a physics-inspired integral formulation. The model builds upon the standard hopping probability $\omega(R)$ w.r.t. hopping distance $R$ and incorporates the density of accessible electronic states through an effective volume function $V(R)$, which reflects the influence of system geometry. The IVRH formulation inherently reproduces both the Mott behavior at low temperatures and the Arrhenius behavior at high temperatures, respectively, and enables a smooth transition between the two regimes. We apply the IVRH model to two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and multi-layered systems. Monte Carlo simulations validate the model's predictions and yield consistent values for the fitting parameters, with substantially reduced variances compared to fitting using the standard VRH model. Furthermore, the improved robustness of IVRH also extends to the transport measurements in monolayer MoS$_2$ system and monolayer WS$_2$ system, enabling more physically meaningful interpretation.IVRH model offers a more stable and physically sound framework for interpreting hopping transport in low-dimensional amorphous materials, providing deeper insights into the universal geometric scaling factors that govern charge transport in disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Computer Generation of Disordered Networks with Targeted Structural Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered spatial networks are model systems that describe structures and interactions across multiple length scales. Scattering and interference of waves in these networks can give rise to structural phase transitions, localization, diffusion, and band gaps. The study of these complex phenomena requires efficient numerical methods to computer-generate disordered networks with targeted structural properties. In the established Wooten-Weaire-Winer algorithm, a series of bond switch moves introduces disorder into an initial network. Conventional strain energies that govern this evolution are limited to 3D networks with coordination numbers of no more than four. We extend the algorithm to arbitrary coordination number statistics by introducing bond repulsion in the Keating strain energy. We tune the degree and type of disorder introduced into initially crystalline networks by varying the bond-bending force constant in the strain energy and the temperature profile. The effects of these variables are analyzed using a list of order metrics that capture both direct and reciprocal space. A feedforward neural network is trained to predict the structural characteristics from the algorithm inputs, enabling targeted network generation. As a case study, we statistically reproduce four disordered biophotonic networks exhibiting structural color. This work presents a versatile method for generating disordered networks with tailored structural properties. It will enable new insights into structure-property relations, such as photonic band gaps in disordered networks.</description>

      <title>The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of finite-rank normal perturbations of large rotationally invariant non-Hermitian matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite-rank normal deformations of rotationally invariant non-Hermitian random matrices. Extending the classical Baik-Ben Arous-P\'ech\'e (BBP) framework, we characterize the emergence and fluctuations of outlier eigenvalues in models of the form $\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{T}$, where $\mathbf{A}$ is a large rotationally invariant non-Hermitian random matrix and $\mathbf{T}$ is a finite-rank normal perturbation. We also describe the corresponding eigenvector behavior. Our results provide a unified framework encompassing both Hermitian and non-Hermitian settings, thereby generalizing several known cases.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning enabled characterization of individual ring resonators in integrated photonic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately determining the underlying physical parameters of individual elements in integrated photonics is increasingly difficult as device architectures become more complex. Inferring these parameters directly from spectral measurements of the system as a whole provides a practical alternative to traditional calibration, allowing characterization of photonic systems without relying on detailed device-specific models. Here, we introduce a supervised machine-learning strategy to learn the onsite losses and resonant frequency shifts of each individual ring in an array of coupled ring resonators from measured spectral power distributions of the whole array. The neural network infers these parameters with high accuracy across multiple experimental configurations. Our methodology provides a scalable and non-invasive method for extracting intrinsic parameters in coupled photonic platforms, paving the way for future development of automated calibration and control methods.</description>

      <title>Anomalous transport in quasiperiodic lattices: emergent exceptional points at band edges and log-periodic oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic systems host exotic transport regimes that are distinct from those found in periodic or disordered lattices. In this work, we study quantum transport in the Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper lattice in a two-terminal setup coupled to zero-temperature reservoirs, where the conductance is evaluated via the nonequilibrium Green's function method. In the extended phase, we uncover a universal subdiffusive transport when the bath chemical potential aligns with the band edges. Specifically, the typical conductance displays a scaling of $\mathcal{G}_{\text{typ}}\sim L^{-2}$ with system size $L$. We attribute this behavior to the emergence of an exceptional point (Jordan normal form) in the transfer matrix in the thermodynamic limit. In the localized phase, the conductance shows exponential decay governed by the Lyapunov exponent. Intriguingly, in the critical phase, we identify pronounced log-periodic oscillations of the conductance as a function of system size, arising from the discrete scale invariance inherent to the singular-continuous spectrum. We further extend our analysis to the generalized Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model and provide numerical evidence suggesting that the exact mobility edge resides within a finite spectral gap. This results in a counter-intuitive exponential suppression of conductance precisely at the mobility edge. Our work highlights the distinct transport behaviors in quasiperiodic systems and elucidates how they are rigorously dictated by the underlying local spectral structure.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Analysis of Gradient Flow for Extensive-Width Quadratic Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the high-dimensional training dynamics of a shallow neural network with quadratic activation in a teacher-student setup. We focus on the extensive-width regime, where the teacher and student network widths scale proportionally with the input dimension, and the sample size grows quadratically. This scaling aims to describe overparameterized neural networks in which feature learning still plays a central role. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive a dynamical characterization of the gradient flow, in the spirit of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Under l2-regularization, we analyze these equations at long times and characterize the performance and spectral properties of the resulting estimator. This result provides a quantitative understanding of the effect of overparameterization on learning and generalization, and reveals a double descent phenomenon in the presence of label noise, where generalization improves beyond interpolation. In the small regularization limit, we obtain an exact expression for the perfect recovery threshold as a function of the network widths, providing a precise characterization of how overparameterization influences recovery.</description>

      <title>Topologically switchable transport in a bundled cable of wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in the next generation of mesoscopic electronics require an understanding of topological phases in inhomogeneous media and the principles that govern them. Motivated by the nature of motifs available in printable conducting inks, we introduce and study quantum transport in a minimal model that describes a bundle of one-dimensional metallic wires that are randomly interconnected by semiconducting chains. Each of these interconnects is represented by a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, which can reside in either a trivial or a topological phase. Using a tight-binding approach, we show that such a system can transit from an insulating phase to a robust metallic phase as the interconnects undergo a transition from a trivial to a topological phase. In the latter, despite the random interconnectedness, the metal evades Anderson localization and exhibits a ballistic conductance that scales linearly with the number of wires. We show that this behavior originates from hopping renormalization in the wire network. The zero-energy modes of the topological interconnects act as effective random dimers, giving rise to an energy-dependent localization length that diverges as $\sim 1/E^2$. Our work establishes that random networks provide a yet-unexplored platform to host intriguing phases of topological quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Parametric RDT approach to computational gap of symmetric binary perceptron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study potential presence of statistical-computational gaps (SCG) in symmetric binary perceptrons (SBP) via a parametric utilization of \emph{fully lifted random duality theory} (fl-RDT) [96]. A structural change from decreasingly to arbitrarily ordered $c$-sequence (a key fl-RDT parametric component) is observed on the second lifting level and associated with \emph{satisfiability} ($\alpha_c$) -- \emph{algorithmic} ($\alpha_a$) constraints density threshold change thereby suggesting a potential existence of a nonzero computational gap $SCG=\alpha_c-\alpha_a$. The second level estimate is shown to match the theoretical $\alpha_c$ whereas the $r\rightarrow \infty$ level one is proposed to correspond to $\alpha_a$. For example, for the canonical SBP ($\kappa=1$ margin) we obtain $\alpha_c\approx 1.8159$ on the second and $\alpha_a\approx 1.6021$ (with converging tendency towards $\sim 1.59$ range) on the seventh level. Our propositions remarkably well concur with recent literature: (i) in [20] local entropy replica approach predicts $\alpha_{LE}\approx 1.58$ as the onset of clustering defragmentation (presumed driving force behind locally improving algorithms failures); (ii) in $\alpha\rightarrow 0$ regime we obtain on the third lifting level $\kappa\approx 1.2385\sqrt{\frac{\alpha_a}{-\log\left ( \alpha_a \right ) }}$ which qualitatively matches overlap gap property (OGP) based predictions of [43] and identically matches local entropy based predictions of [24]; (iii) $c$-sequence ordering change phenomenology mirrors the one observed in asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) in [98] and the negative Hopfield model in [100]; and (iv) as in [98,100], we here design a CLuP based algorithm whose practical performance closely matches proposed theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>On the origin of neural scaling laws: from random graphs to natural language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws have played a major role in the modern AI revolution, providing practitioners predictive power over how the model performance will improve with increasing data, compute, and number of model parameters. This has spurred an intense interest in the origin of neural scaling laws, with a common suggestion being that they arise from power law structure already present in the data. In this paper we study scaling laws for transformers trained to predict random walks (bigrams) on graphs with tunable complexity. We demonstrate that this simplified setting already gives rise to neural scaling laws even in the absence of power law structure in the data correlations. We further consider dialing down the complexity of natural language systematically, by training on sequences sampled from increasingly simplified generative language models, from 4,2,1-layer transformer language models down to language bigrams, revealing a monotonic evolution of the scaling exponents. Our results also include scaling laws obtained from training on random walks on random graphs drawn from Erd\"os-Renyi and scale-free Barab\'asi-Albert ensembles. Finally, we revisit conventional scaling laws for language modeling, demonstrating that several essential results can be reproduced using 2 layer transformers with context length of 50, provide a critical analysis of various fits used in prior literature, demonstrate an alternative method for obtaining compute optimal curves as compared with current practice in published literature, and provide preliminary evidence that maximal update parameterization may be more parameter efficient than standard parameterization.</description>

      <title>Localization with non-Hermitian off-diagonal disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13744v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss a non-Hermitian system described via a one-dimensional single-particle tight-binding model, where the non-Hermiticity is governed by random nearest-neighbour tunnellings, such that the left-to-right and right-to-left hopping strengths are unequal. A physical situation of completely real eigenspectrum arises owing to the Hamiltonian's tridiagonal matrix structure under a simple sign conservation of the product of the conjugate nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms. The off-diagonal disorder leads the non-Hermitian system to a delocalization-localization crossover in finite systems. The emergent nature of the crossover is recognized through a finite-size spectral analysis. The system enters into a localized phase for infinitesimal disorder strength in the thermodynamic limit. We perform a careful scaling analysis of localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy splitting and report the corresponding scaling exponents. Noticeably, in contrast to the diagonal disorder, the density of states (DOS) has a singularity at E=0 in the presence of the off-diagonal disorder and the corresponding wavefunction remains delocalized for any given disorder strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02734v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a hydrodynamic framework for describing monitored classical stochastic processes. We study the conditional ensembles for these monitored processes -- i.e., we compute spacetime correlation functions conditioned on a fixed, typical measurement record. In the presence of global symmetries we show that these conditional ensembles can undergo measurement-induced "sharpening" phase transitions as a function of the monitoring rate; moreover, even weak monitoring can give rise to novel critical phases, derived entirely from a classical perspective. We give a simple hydrodynamic derivation of the known "charge-fuzzy phase" for weakly monitored diffusive many-body quantum systems. We show that although the unmonitored symmetric and asymmetric exclusion processes are in different universality classes of transport, the fluctuations in their conditional ensembles flow to the same fixed point with emergent relativistic invariance under monitoring. On the other hand, weakly monitored systems with non-Abelian symmetries enter a novel strongly coupled fixed point with non-trivial dynamical exponent, which we characterize. Our formalism naturally accounts for monitoring general observables, such as currents or density gradients, and allows for a direct calculation of information-theoretic diagnostics of sharpening transitions, including the Shannon entropy of the measurement record.</description>

      <title>Exploiting emergent symmetries in disorder-averaged quantum dynamics</title>

Abstract: Symmetries are a key tool in understanding quantum systems, and, among many other things, can be exploited to increase the efficiency of numerical simulations of quantum dynamics. Disordered systems usually feature reduced symmetries and additionally require averaging over many realizations, making their numerical study computationally demanding. However, when studying quantities linear in the time-evolved state, i.e. expectation values of observables, one can apply the averaging procedure to the time evolution operator, resulting in an effective dynamical map, which restores symmetry at the level of superoperators. In this work, we develop schemes for efficiently constructing symmetric sectors of the disorder-averaged dynamical map using short-time and weak-disorder expansions. To benchmark the method, we apply it to an Ising model with random all-to-all interactions in the presence of a transverse field. After disorder averaging, this system becomes effectively permutation-invariant, and thus the size of the symmetric subspace scales polynomially in the number of spins allowing for the simulation of large systems.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the close relationship between Kolmogorov complexity and unsupervised machine learning, we explore quantum circuit complexity, an important concept in quantum computation and quantum information science, as a pivot to understand and to build interpretable and efficient unsupervised machine learning for topological order in quantum many-body systems. We argue that Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity represents an intrinsic topological distance between topological quantum many-body phases of matter, and as such plays a central role in interpretable manifold learning of topological order. To span a bridge from conceptual power to practical applicability, we present two theorems that connect Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity for the quantum path planning between two arbitrary quantum many-body states with quantum Fisher complexity (Bures distance) and entanglement generation, respectively. Leveraging these connections, fidelity-based and entanglement-based similarity measures or kernels, which are more practical for implementation, are formulated. Using the two proposed distance measures, unsupervised manifold learning of quantum phases of the bond-alternating XXZ spin chain, the ground state of Kitaev's toric code and random product states, is conducted, demonstrating their superior performance. Moreover, we find that the entanglement-based approach, which captures the long-range structure of quantum entanglement of topological orders, is more robust to local Haar random noises. Relations with classical shadow tomography and shadow kernel learning are also discussed, where the latter can be naturally understood from our approach. Our results establish connections between key concepts and tools of quantum circuit computation, quantum complexity, quantum metrology, and machine learning of topological quantum order.</description>
