      <title>Assessing wind energy's potential for Kentucky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a push by countries to diversify their energy mix considering various factors. In this regard, there have been several studies conducted to assess the potential for using sources such as wind and solar to generate supplemental energy to the already present energy generation setup. In this regard, this study explores the potential of wind for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. To perform this study, wind data was sourced for eight locations across Kentucky from the publicly accessible wind speed information present at Weatherunderground for the years 2020-2021. An analysis was performed concerning the seasonal, monthly and hourly variation in the wind speed so as to identify the expected times of sufficient wind energy generation. Moreover, a comparison of the collected data was performed with data from a home-based weather station and a deployed wind turbine as well to validate the variation pattern of the publicly sourced data. Finally, in order to investigate the variation patterns of wind and solar energy sources, a comparative analysis was also performed using data from a solar power generation plant in Kentucky. It was observed that a seasonal and monthly complemetarity was observed between the wind and solar. However, when considering daily patterns, the wind was found to follow solar generation with an offset. While further research is required, this analysis indicates that it is possible to deploy wind energy power generation projects in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The seasonal complementary behavior of wind and solar can be used along with battery storage in conjunction with natural gas to provide a diversified electricity generation portfolio.</description>

      <title>Environmental policies as a pull factor for tourists? Insights from Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tourism consumption has grown into a major economic factor for modern societies. However, the environmental impact of tourism has become a significant concern, leading to an increased focus on sustainable tourism policies. While governments and institutions have introduced frameworks to promote ecological transition in the tourism sector, the effectiveness of such policies remains unclear. This study provides a seminal attempt to examine the complex relationship between tourism demand and sustainable tourism policies. To do so, a gravity model framework has been adopted to examine incoming international tourism flows in Italian provinces in 2019. The findings reveal a positive association between tourism demand and sustainable labels. This study also suggests that eco-labels are appreciated by tourists and have a role in the destination decision-making process. It highlighted the need for continued research to identify effective sustainable tourism policies that can balance the economic benefits of tourism with environmental considerations</description>

      <title>Mean Field Game Approach to Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions in a Social Structure model of Epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of coherent and efficient policies to address infectious diseases and their consequences requires to model not only epidemics dynamics, but also individual behaviors, as the latter has a strong influence on the former. In our work, we provide a theoretical model for this problem, taking into account the social structure of a population. This model is based on a Mean Field Game version of a SIR compartmental model, in which individuals are grouped by their age class and interact together in different settings. This social heterogeneity allows to reproduce realistic situations while remaining usable in practice. In our game theoretical approach, individuals can choose to limit their contacts by making a trade-off between the risks incurred by infection and the cost of being confined. The aggregation of all these individual choices and optimizations forms a Nash equilibrium through a system of coupled equations that we derive and solve numerically. The global cost born by the population within this scenario is then compared to its societal optimum counterpart (i.e. the optimal cost from the society viewpoint), and we investigate how the gap between these two costs can be partially bridged within a constrained Nash equilibrium for which a governmental institution would impose lockdowns. Finally we consider the consequences of the finiteness of the population size $N$, or of a time $T$ at which an external event would end the epidemic, and show that the variation of these parameters could lead to first order phase transitions in the choice of optimal strategies. In this paper, all the strategies considered to mitigate epidemics correspond to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and we provide here a theoretical framework within which guidelines for public policies depending on the characteristics of an epidemic and on the cost of restrictions on the society could be assessed.</description>

      <title>A New World Framework: The Three Realms and Six Layers Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative framework for understanding the world, termed the "Three Realms and Six Layers Model". Based on the concept of scale, the world is divided into three realms, each encompassing six layers, with a ten-thousand-fold difference in scale between adjacent layers. This unique division reveals the variations in laws at different levels and the fundamental changes in laws when transitioning between realms. The model offers a new perspective for addressing interdisciplinary issues, especially in understanding the behavior of large-scale systems and their connection to microscopic phenomena. In summary, the "Three Realms and Six Layers Model" provides a novel tool for comprehending the diversity and complexity of the universe.</description>

      <title>Optimal design of ride-pooling as on-demand feeder services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The technology-enabled ride-pooling (RP) is designed as an on-demand feeder service to connect remote areas to transit terminals (or activity centers). We propose the so-called ``hold-dispatch'' operation strategy, which imposes a target number of shared rides (termed the ride-pooling size) for each vehicle to enhance RP's transportation efficiency. Analytical models are formulated at the planning level to estimate the costs of the RP operator and the patrons. Accordingly, the design problem is constructed to minimize the total system cost concerning the system layout (i.e., in terms of service zone partitioning), resource deployment (i.e., fleet size), and operational decision (i.e., ride-pooling size). The proposed models admit spatial heterogeneity arising from the non-uniformity of demand distributions and service locations, and can furnish heterogeneous designs. Closed-form formulas for the optimal zoning and fleet size are developed, which unveil fundamental insights regarding the impacts of key operating factors (e.g., demand density and distance to the terminal). Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate (i) the effectiveness of heterogeneous service designs and (ii) the advantage of the proposed RP service with hold-dispatch strategy over alternative designs studied in the literature, i.e., RP with a ``quick-dispatch'' strategy and flexible-route transit, in a wide range of operating scenarios. These findings can assist transportation network companies and transit agencies in successfully integrating RP and transit services.</description>

      <title>Offshore power and hydrogen networks for Europe's North Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European North Sea has a vast renewable energy potential and can be a powerhouse for Europe's energy transition. However, currently there is uncertainty about how much offshore wind energy can be integrated, whether offshore grids should be meshed and to what extent offshore hydrogen should play a role. To address these questions, we use the open-source energy system optimization model PyPSA-Eur to model a European carbon-neutral sector-coupled energy system in high spatial and temporal resolution. We let the model endogenously decide how much offshore wind is deployed and which infrastructure is used to integrate the offshore wind. We find that with point-to-point connections like we have today, 310 GW offshore wind can be integrated in the North Sea. However, if we allow meshed networks and hydrogen, we find that this can be raised to 420 GW with cost savings up to 15 billion euros per year. Furthermore, we only observe significant amounts of up to 75 GW of floating wind turbines in the North Sea if we have offshore hydrogen production. Generally, the model opts for offshore wind integration through a mix of both electricity and hydrogen infrastructure. However, the bulk of the offshore energy is transported as hydrogen, which is twice as much as the amount transported as electricity. Moreover, we find that the offshore power network is mainly used for offshore wind integration, with only a small portion used for inter-country transmission.</description>

      <title>Steering opinion dynamics through control of social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel control approach for opinion dynamics on evolving networks. The controls modify the strength of connections in the network, rather than influencing opinions directly, with the overall goal of steering the population towards a target opinion. This requires that the social network remains sufficiently connected, the population does not break into separate opinion clusters, and that the target opinion remains accessible. We present several approaches to addressing these challenges, considering questions of controllability, instantaneous control and optimal control. Each of these approaches provides a different view on the complex relationship between opinion and network dynamics and raises interesting questions for future research.</description>

      <title>Machine learning and economic forecasting: the role of international trade networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the effects of de-globalization trends on international trade networks and their role in improving forecasts for economic growth. Using section-level trade data from nearly 200 countries from 2010 to 2022, we identify significant shifts in the network topology driven by rising trade policy uncertainty. Our analysis highlights key global players through centrality rankings, with the United States, China, and Germany maintaining consistent dominance. Using a horse race of supervised regressors, we find that network topology descriptors evaluated from section-specific trade networks substantially enhance the quality of a country's GDP growth forecast. We also find that non-linear models, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, outperform traditional linear models used in the economics literature. Using SHAP values to interpret these non-linear model's predictions, we find that about half of most important features originate from the network descriptors, underscoring their vital role in refining forecasts. Moreover, this study emphasizes the significance of recent economic performance, population growth, and the primary sector's influence in shaping economic growth predictions, offering novel insights into the intricacies of economic growth forecasting.</description>

      <title>COVID-19 and income profile: How communities in the United States responded to mobility restrictions in the pandemic's early stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.02160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobility interventions in communities play a critical role in containing a pandemic at an early stage. The real-world practice of social distancing can enlighten policymakers and help them implement more efficient and effective control measures. A lack of such research using real-world observations initiates this article. We analyzed the social distancing performance of 66,149 census tracts from 3,142 counties in the United States with a specific focus on income profile. Six daily mobility metrics, including a social distancing index, stay-at-home percentage, miles traveled per person, trip rate, work trip rate, and non-work trip rate, were produced for each census tract using the location data from over 100 million anonymous devices on a monthly basis. Each mobility metric was further tabulated by three perspectives of social distancing performance: "best performance", "effort", and "consistency". We found that for all 18 indicators, high-income communities demonstrated better social distancing performance. Such disparities between communities of different income levels are presented in detail in this article. The comparisons across scenarios also raise other concerns for low-income communities, such as employment status, working conditions, and accessibility to basic needs. This article lays out a series of facts extracted from real-world data and offers compelling perspectives for future discussions.</description>
