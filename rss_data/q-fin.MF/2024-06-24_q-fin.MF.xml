      <title>Computing the SSR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The skew-stickiness-ratio (SSR), examined in detail by Bergomi in his book, is critically important to options traders, especially market makers. We present a model-free expression for the SSR in terms of the characteristic function. In the diffusion setting, it is well-known that the short-term limit of the SSR is 2; a corollary of our results is that this limit is $H+3/2$ where $H$ is the Hurst exponent of the volatility process. The general formula for the SSR simplifies and becomes particularly tractable in the affine forward variance case. We explain the qualitative behavior of the SSR with respect to the shape of the forward variance curve, and thus also path-dependence of the SSR.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Path-Dependent Volatility Models for Price-Storage Dynamics in Natural Gas Markets and Discrete-Time Swing Option Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the price-storage dynamics in natural gas markets. A novel stochastic path-dependent volatility model is introduced with path-dependence in both price volatility and storage increments. Model calibrations are conducted for both the price and storage dynamics. Further, we discuss the pricing problem of discrete-time swing options using the dynamic programming principle, and a deep learning-based method is proposed for numerical approximations. A numerical algorithm is provided, followed by a convergence analysis result for the deep-learning approach.</description>

      <title>An optimal investment strategy aimed at maximizing the expected utility across all intermediate capital levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates an optimal investment problem for an insurance company operating under the Cramer-Lundberg risk model, where investments are made in both a risky asset and a risk-free asset. In contrast to other literature that focuses on optimal investment and/or reinsurance strategies to maximize the expected utility of terminal wealth within a given time horizon, this work considers the expected value of utility accumulation across all intermediate capital levels of the insurer. By employing the Dynamic Programming Principle, we prove a verification theorem, in order to show that any solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation solves our optimization problem. Subject to some regularity conditions on the solution of the HJB equation, we establish the existence of the optimal investment strategy. Finally, to illustrate the applicability of the theoretical findings, we present numerical examples.</description>
