      <title>On the acceptance, commissioning, and quality assurance of electron FLASH units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background &amp; Purpose: FLASH or ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) radiation therapy (RT) has gained attention in recent years for its ability to spare normal tissues relative to conventional dose rate (CDR) RT in various preclinical trials. However, clinical implementation of this promising treatment option has been limited because of the lack of availability of accelerators capable of delivering UHDR RT. We established a framework for the acceptance, commissioning, and periodic quality assurance (QA) of electron FLASH units and present an example of commissioning.
  Methods: A protocol for acceptance, commissioning, and QA of UHDR linear accelerators was established by combining and adapting standards and professional recommendations for standard linear accelerators based on the experience with UHDR at four clinical centers that use different UHDR devices. Non-standard dosimetric beam parameters considered included pulse width, pulse repetition frequency, dose per pulse, and instantaneous dose rate, together with recommendations on how to acquire these measurements.
  Results: The 6 and 9 MeV beams of an UHDR electron device were commissioned by using this developed protocol. Measurements were acquired with a combination of ion chambers, beam current transformers (BCTs), and dose rate independent passive dosimeters. The unit was calibrated according to the concept of redundant dosimetry using a reference setup.
  Conclusions: This study provides detailed recommendations for the acceptance testing, commissioning, and routine QA of low-energy electron UHDR linear accelerators. The proposed framework is not limited to any specific unit, making it applicable to all existing eFLASH units in the market. Through practical insights and theoretical discourse, this document establishes a benchmark for the commissioning of UHDR devices for clinical use.</description>

      <title>Self-sensing with hollow cylindrical transducers for histotripsy enhanced aspiration mechanical thrombectomy applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address existing challenges with intravascular mechanical thrombectomy devices, a novel ultrasound-enhanced aspiration approach is being developed to mechanically degrade clots using cavitation. This method employs standing waves within a mm-scale hollow cylindrical transducer to generate high pressures sufficient to perform histotripsy on clots situated within the transducer lumen and generate substantial lesions. The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of self-sensing cavitation detection by analyzing voltage signals across the transducer during treatment pulses. External ultrasound imaging of the transducer lumen validated cavitation detection. Impedance was also altered by the presence of clot material within the lumen. Experiments varying the driving voltage in water-filled lumens demonstrated changes in the relative amplitudes of the envelopes of the pulse body and ringdown portions of the voltage signals above the cavitation threshold, as well as changes in the spectral domain. In particular both broadband and ultraharmonic signals showed an increase in amplitude above the cavitation threshold. Similar temporal and spectral voltage signal changes in the presence of cavitation were also observed when treating clots within the lumen. This work demonstrates a highly sensitive method for detecting cavitation within the lumen, enabling monitoring with readily acquired signals without additional sensors in the catheter configuration. These findings hold significant potential for improving the efficacy of ultrasound-enhanced aspiration thrombectomy procedures.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Resonance Image Processing Transformer for General Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate a deep learning model for general accelerated MRI reconstruction.
  Materials and Methods: This retrospective study built a magnetic resonance image processing transformer (MR-IPT) which includes multi-head-tails and a single shared window transformer main body. Three mutations of MR-IPT with different transformer structures were implemented to guide the design of our MR-IPT model. Pre-trained on the MRI set of RadImageNet including 672675 images with multiple anatomy categories, the model was further migrated and evaluated on fastMRI knee dataset with 25012 images for downstream reconstruction tasks. We performed comparison studies with three CNN-based conventional networks in zero- and few-shot learning scenarios. Transfer learning process was conducted on both MR-IPT and CNN networks to further validate the generalizability of MR-IPT. To study the model performance stability, we evaluated our model with various downstream dataset sizes ranging from 10 to 2500 images.
  Result: The MR-IPT model provided superior performance in multiple downstream tasks compared to conventional CNN networks. MR-IPT achieved a PSNR/SSIM of 26.521/0.6102 (4-fold) and 24.861/0.4996 (8-fold) in 10-epoch learning, surpassing UNet128 at 25.056/0.5832 (4-fold) and 22.984/0.4637 (8-fold). With the same large-scale pre-training, MR-IPT provided a 5% performance boost compared to UNet128 in zero-shot learning in 8-fold and 3% in 4-fold.
  Conclusion: MR-IPT framework benefits from its transformer-based structure and large-scale pre-training and can serve as a solid backbone in other downstream tasks with zero- and few-shot learning.</description>

      <title>Differential geometry, a possible avenue for thermal ablation in oncology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a model for hyperthermia therapies based on heat diffusion in a biological tissue containing a topological defect. Biological tissues behave like active liquid crystals with the presence of topological defects which are likely to anchor tumors during the metastatic phase of cancer evolution and the therapy challenge is to destroy the cancer cells without damaging surrounding healthy tissues. The defect creates an effective non-Euclidean geometry for low-energy excitations, modifying the bio-heat equation. Applications to protocols of thermal ablation for various biological tissues (liver, prostate, and skin) is analyzed and discussed.</description>

      <title>CPT-Interp: Continuous sPatial and Temporal Motion Modeling for 4D Medical Image Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion information from 4D medical imaging offers critical insights into dynamic changes in patient anatomy for clinical assessments and radiotherapy planning and, thereby, enhances the capabilities of 3D image analysis. However, inherent physical and technical constraints of imaging hardware often necessitate a compromise between temporal resolution and image quality. Frame interpolation emerges as a pivotal solution to this challenge. Previous methods often suffer from discretion when they estimate the intermediate motion and execute the forward warping. In this study, we draw inspiration from fluid mechanics to propose a novel approach for continuously modeling patient anatomic motion using implicit neural representation. It ensures both spatial and temporal continuity, effectively bridging Eulerian and Lagrangian specifications together to naturally facilitate continuous frame interpolation. Our experiments across multiple datasets underscore the method's superior accuracy and speed. Furthermore, as a case-specific optimization (training-free) approach, it circumvents the need for extensive datasets and addresses model generalization issues.</description>

      <title>A review of active matter reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past years, the amount of research on active matter has grown extremely rapidly, a fact that is reflected in particular by the existence of more than 600 review articles on this topic. Moreover, the field has become very diverse, ranging from theoretical studies of the statistical mechanics of active particles to applied work on medical applications of microrobots and from biological systems to artificial swimmers. This makes it very difficult to get an overview over the field as a whole. Here, we provide such an overview in the form of a metareview article that surveys the existing review articles on active matter. Thereby, this article provides an introduction to the various subdisciplines of active matter science and constitutes a useful starting point for finding literature about a specific topic.</description>
