      <title>Efficient 3D Bayesian Full Waveform Inversion and Analysis of Prior Hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially 3-dimensional seismic full waveform inversion (3D FWI) is a highly nonlinear and computationally demanding inverse problem that constructs 3D subsurface seismic velocity structures using seismic waveform data. To characterise non-uniqueness in the solutions we demonstrate Bayesian 3D FWI using an efficient method called physically structured variational inference applied to 3D acoustic Bayesian FWI. The results provide reasonable posterior uncertainty estimates, at a computational cost that is only an order of magnitude greater than that of standard, deterministic FWI. Furthermore, we deploy variational prior replacement to calculate Bayesian solutions corresponding to different classes of prior information at low additional cost, and analyse those prior hypotheses by constructing Bayesian L-curves. This reveals the sensitivity of the inversion process to different prior assumptions. Thus we show that fully probabilistic 3D FWI can be performed at a cost that may be practical in small FWI problems, and can be used to test different prior hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Self-Updating Vehicle Monitoring Framework Employing Distributed Acoustic Sensing towards Real-World Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent emergence of Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology has facilitated the effective capture of traffic-induced seismic data. The traffic-induced seismic wave is a prominent contributor to urban vibrations and contain crucial information to advance urban exploration and governance. However, identifying vehicular movements within massive noisy data poses a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a real-time semi-supervised vehicle monitoring framework tailored to urban settings. It requires only a small fraction of manual labels for initial training and exploits unlabeled data for model improvement. Additionally, the framework can autonomously adapt to newly collected unlabeled data. Before DAS data undergo object detection as two-dimensional images to preserve spatial information, we leveraged comprehensive one-dimensional signal preprocessing to mitigate noise. Furthermore, we propose a novel prior loss that incorporates the shapes of vehicular traces to track a single vehicle with varying speeds. To evaluate our model, we conducted experiments with seismic data from the Stanford 2 DAS Array. The results showed that our model outperformed the baseline model Efficient Teacher and its supervised counterpart, YOLO (You Only Look Once), in both accuracy and robustness. With only 35 labeled images, our model surpassed YOLO's mAP 0.5:0.95 criterion by 18% and showed a 7% increase over Efficient Teacher. We conducted comparative experiments with multiple update strategies for self-updating and identified an optimal approach. This approach surpasses the performance of non-overfitting training conducted with all data in a single pass.</description>

      <title>A Convolutional Neural Network-based Ensemble Post-processing with Data Augmentation for Tropical Cyclone Precipitation Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy precipitation from tropical cyclones (TCs) may result in disasters, such as floods and landslides, leading to substantial economic damage and loss of life. Prediction of TC precipitation based on ensemble post-processing procedures using machine learning (ML) approaches has received considerable attention for its flexibility in modeling and its computational power in managing complex models. However, when applying ML techniques to TC precipitation for a specific area, the available observation data are typically insufficient for comprehensive training, validation, and testing of the ML model, primarily due to the rapid movement of TCs. We propose to use the convolutional neural network (CNN) as a deep ML model to leverage the spatial information of precipitation. The proposed model has three distinct features that differentiate it from traditional CNNs applied in meteorology. First, it utilizes data augmentation to alleviate challenges posed by the small sample size. Second, it contains geographical and dynamic variables to account for area-specific features and the relative distance between the study area and the moving TC. Third, it applies unequal weights to accommodate the temporal structure in the training data when calculating the objective function. The proposed CNN-all model is then illustrated with the TC Soudelor's impact on Taiwan. Soudelor was the strongest TC of the 2015 Pacific typhoon season. The results show that the inclusion of augmented data and dynamic variables improves the prediction of heavy precipitation. The proposed CNN-all outperforms traditional CNN models, based on the continuous probability skill score (CRPSS), probability plots, and reliability diagram. The proposed model has the potential to be utilized in a wide range of meteorological studies.</description>

      <title>On the mechanism of thermal self-regulation of trees: a kind of homeothermic observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What is certain is that surface temperatures around the globe vary considerably, regardless of the time scales or underlying causes. Since 1850, we have observed an average increase in global surface temperature anomalies of 1.2$^{\circ}$ and a median increase of 0.7$^{\circ}$: this overall difference masks significant regional differences. Nearly 60\% of the world's population now lives in urban areas, where vegetation cover has been significantly reduced, despite the paradoxical fact that vegetation plays an important role in regulating the thermal environment (\textit{eg} through the shading provided by tree canopies). Continuous electrical and thermal measurements of trees in a Parisian grove (France) show and quantify that canopies are not the only protectors against heat waves; we must also consider the role of tree trunks. It is clear that these trunks probably regulate themselves, possibly by modulating the uptake of groundwater, whose geothermal stability is well established at a depth of just one meter. This quantitative observation should not be overlooked in the urban planning of our cities.</description>

      <title>The Arpu Kuilpu Meteorite: In-depth characterization of an H5 chondrite delivered from a Jupiter Family Comet orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the Nullarbor Plain in South Australia, the Desert Fireball Network detected a fireball on the night of 1 June 2019 (7:30 pm local time), and six weeks later recovered a single meteorite (42 g) named Arpu Kuilpu. This meteorite was then distributed to a consortium of collaborating institutions to be measured and analyzed by a number of methodologies including: SEM-EDS, EPMA, ICP-MS, gamma-ray spectrometry, ideal gas pycnometry, magnetic susceptibility measurement, {\mu}CT, optical microscopy, and accelerator and noble gas mass spectrometry techniques. These analyses revealed that Arpu Kuilpu is an unbrecciated H5 ordinary chondrite, with minimal weathering (W0-1) and minimal shock (S2). The olivine and pyroxene mineral compositions (in mol%) are Fa: 19.2 +- 0.2, and Fs: 16.8 +- 0.2, further supporting the H5 type and class. The measured oxygen isotopes are also consistent with an H chondrite ({\delta}17O = 2.904 +- 0.177; {\delta}18O = 4.163 +- 0.336; {\Delta}17O = 0.740 +- 0.002). Ideal gas pycnometry measured bulk and grain densities of 3.66 +- 0.02 and 3.77 +- 0.02 g cm-3, respectively, yielding a porosity of 3.0 % +- 0.7. The magnetic susceptibility of this meteorite is log X = 5.16 +- 0.08. The most recent impact-related heating event experienced by Arpu Kuilpu was measured by 40Ar/39Ar chronology to be 4467 +- 16 Ma, while the cosmic ray exposure age is estimated to be between 6-8 Ma. The noble gas isotopes, radionuclides, and fireball observations all indicate that Arpu Kuilpu's meteoroid was quite small (maximum radius of 10 cm, though more likely between 1-5 cm). Although this meteorite is a rather ordinary ordinary chondrite, its prior orbit resembled that of a Jupiter Family Comet (JFC) further lending support to the assertion that many cm- to m-sized objects on JFC orbits are asteroidal rather than cometary in origin.</description>

      <title>On the effect of the luni-solar gravitational attraction on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit old electrical measurements conducted on a poplar tree in 2003 (Gibert et al. 2006), which showed the presence of a diurnal electrical signal, attributed to an electrokinetic phenomenon correlated with sap flow, even in winter. We reanalyze these data using the singular spectrum analysis method and demonstrate that the electrical signal measured at various locations (roots, trunk, and branches) on the poplar tree can be decomposed to over 80\% into a sum of 7 pseudo-periods, all linked to luni-solar tides. The precision of the extracted periods exceeds that of models. To validate these old measurements, we have reproduced the 2003 protocol since 2018 at the Jardin des Plantes in Paris, on 3 oak trees and 3 hornbeams. The electrical signals today exhibit the same characteristics as those of 2003. Tidal forces could be a driving force of sap flow in trees.</description>

      <title>A foundation model enpowered by a multi-modal prompt engine for universal seismic geobody interpretation across surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seismic geobody interpretation is crucial for structural geology studies and various engineering applications. Existing deep learning methods show promise but lack support for multi-modal inputs and struggle to generalize to different geobody types or surveys. We introduce a promptable foundation model for interpreting any geobodies across seismic surveys. This model integrates a pre-trained vision foundation model (VFM) with a sophisticated multi-modal prompt engine. The VFM, pre-trained on massive natural images and fine-tuned on seismic data, provides robust feature extraction for cross-survey generalization. The prompt engine incorporates multi-modal prior information to iteratively refine geobody delineation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the model's superior accuracy, scalability from 2D to 3D, and generalizability to various geobody types, including those unseen during training. To our knowledge, this is the first highly scalable and versatile multi-modal foundation model capable of interpreting any geobodies across surveys while supporting real-time interactions. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for geoscientific data interpretation, with broad potential for transfer to other tasks.</description>

      <title>Variational Prior Replacement in Bayesian Inference and Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many scientific investigations require that the values of a set of model parameters are estimated using recorded data. In Bayesian inference, information from both observed data and prior knowledge is combined to update model parameters probabilistically by calculating the posterior probability distribution function. Prior information is often described by a prior probability distribution. Situations arise in which we wish to change prior information during the course of a scientific project. However, estimating the solution to any single Bayesian inference problem is often computationally costly, as it typically requires many model samples to be drawn, and the data set that would have been recorded if each sample was true must be simulated. Recalculating the Bayesian inference solution every time prior information changes can therefore be extremely expensive. We develop a mathematical formulation that allows the prior information that is embedded within a solution, to be changed using variational methods, without recalculating the original Bayesian inference. In this method, existing prior information is removed from a previously obtained posterior distribution and is replaced by new prior information. We therefore call the methodology variational prior replacement (VPR). We demonstrate VPR using a 2D seismic full waveform inversion example, in which VPR provides similar posterior solutions to those obtained by solving independent inference problems using different prior distributions. The former can be completed within minutes on a laptop computer, whereas the latter requires days of computations using high-performance computing resources. We demonstrate the value of the method by comparing the posterior solutions obtained using three different types of prior information: uniform, smoothing and geological prior distributions.</description>

      <title>Latent diffusion models for parameterization and data assimilation of facies-based geomodels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geological parameterization entails the representation of a geomodel using a small set of latent variables and a mapping from these variables to grid-block properties such as porosity and permeability. Parameterization is useful for data assimilation (history matching), as it maintains geological realism while reducing the number of variables to be determined. Diffusion models are a new class of generative deep-learning procedures that have been shown to outperform previous methods, such as generative adversarial networks, for image generation tasks. Diffusion models are trained to "denoise", which enables them to generate new geological realizations from input fields characterized by random noise. Latent diffusion models, which are the specific variant considered in this study, provide dimension reduction through use of a low-dimensional latent variable. The model developed in this work includes a variational autoencoder for dimension reduction and a U-net for the denoising process. Our application involves conditional 2D three-facies (channel-levee-mud) systems. The latent diffusion model is shown to provide realizations that are visually consistent with samples from geomodeling software. Quantitative metrics involving spatial and flow-response statistics are evaluated, and general agreement between the diffusion-generated models and reference realizations is observed. Stability tests are performed to assess the smoothness of the parameterization method. The latent diffusion model is then used for ensemble-based data assimilation. Two synthetic "true" models are considered. Significant uncertainty reduction, posterior P$_{10}$-P$_{90}$ forecasts that generally bracket observed data, and consistent posterior geomodels, are achieved in both cases.</description>
