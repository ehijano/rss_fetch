      <title>More on the indivisibility of $\mathbb{Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the complexity of the computational task ``Given a colouring $c : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbf{k}$, find a monochromatic $S \subseteq \mathbb{Q}$ such that $(S,&lt;) \cong (\mathbb{Q},&lt;)$''. The framework is Weihrauch reducibility. Our results answer some open questions recently raised by Gill, and by Dzhafarov, Solomon and Valenti.</description>

      <title>On the Compatibility of Constructive Predicative Mathematics with Weyl's Classical Predicativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that most foundations for Bishop's constructive mathematics are incompatible with a classical predicative development of analysis as put forward by Weyl in his $\textit{Das Kontinuum}$. Here, we first recall how this incompatibility arises from the possibility, present in most constructive foundations, to define sets by quantifying over (the exponentiation of) functional relations. This possibility is not allowed in modern formulations of Weyl's logical system. Then, we argue how a possible way out is offered by foundations, such as the Minimalist Foundation, where exponentiation is limited to a primitive notion of function defined by $\lambda$-terms as in dependent type theory. The price to pay is to renounce the so-called rule of unique choice identifying functional relations with $\lambda$-terms, and to number-theoretic choice principles, characteristic of foundations aimed to formalize Bishop's constructive analysis. This restriction calls for a point-free constructive development of topology as advocated by P. Martin-L\"of and G. Sambin with the introduction of Formal Topology. Hence, we conclude that the Minimalist Foundation promises to be a natural crossroads between Bishop's constructivism and Weyl's classical predicativity provided that a point-free reformulation of classical analysis is viable.</description>

      <title>Integration on the Surreals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14331v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conway's real closed field $\mathbf{No}$ of surreal numbers is a sweeping generalization of the real numbers and the ordinals to which a number of elementary functions such as log and exponentiation have been shown to extend. The problems of identifying significant classes of functions that can be so extended and of defining integration for them have proven to be formidable. In this paper we address this and related unresolved issues by showing that extensions to $\mathbf{No}$, and thereby integrals, exist for most functions arising in practical applications. In particular, we show they exist for a large subclass of the \emph{resurgent functions}, a subclass that contains the functions that at $\infty$ are semi-algebraic, semi-analytic, analytic, meromorphic, and Borel summable as well as solutions to nonresonant linear and nonlinear meromorphic systems of ODEs or of difference equations. By suitable changes of variables we deal with arbitrarily located singular points. We further establish a sufficient condition for the theory to carry over to ordered exponential subfields of $\mathbf{No}$ more generally and illustrate the result with structures familiar from the surreal literature. The extensions of functions and integrals that concern us are constructive in nature, which permits us to work in NBG less the Axiom of Choice (for both sets and proper classes). Following the completion of the positive portion of the paper, it is shown that the existence of such constructive extensions and integrals of substantially more general types of functions (e.g. smooth functions) is obstructed by considerations from the foundations of mathematics.</description>

      <title>Concerning Keisler Measures over ultraproducts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As consequence of the VC theorem, any pseudo-finite measure over an NIP ultraproduct is generically stable. We demonstrate a converse of this theorem and prove that any finitely approximable measure over an ultraproduct is itself pseudo-finite (even without the NIP assumption). We also analyze the connection between the Morley product and the pseudo-finite product. In particular, we show that if $\mu$ is definable and both $\mu$ and $\nu$ are pseudo-finite, then the Morley product of $\mu$ and $\nu$ agrees with the pseudo-finite product of $\mu$ and $\nu$. Using this observation, we construct generically stable idempotent measures on pseudo-finite NIP groups.</description>

      <title>Computability in infinite Galois theory and algorithmically random algebraic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of algorithmic randomness for algebraic fields. We prove the existence of a continuum of algebraic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ that are random according to our definition. We show that there are noncomputable algebraic fields which are not random. We also partially characterize the index set, relative to an oracle, of the set of random algebraic fields computable relative to that oracle.
  In order to carry out this investigation of randomness for fields, we develop computability in the context of infinite Galois theory (where the relevant Galois groups are uncountable), including definitions of computable and computably enumerable Galois groups and computability of Haar measure on the Galois groups.</description>

      <title>On Ramsey degrees, compactness and approximability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the consequences of the Compactness Principle in structural Ramsey theory is that the small Ramsey degrees cannot exceed the corresponding big Ramsey degrees, thereby justifying the choice of adjectives. However, it is unclear what happens in the realm of dual Ramsey degrees due to the lack of the compactness argument that applies to that setting. In this paper we present a framework within which both "direct" and dual Ramsey statements can be stated and reasoned about in a uniform fashion. We introduce the notion of approximability which yields a general compactness argument powerful enough to prove statements about both "direct" and dual Ramsey phenomena. We conclude the paper with an application of the new strategies by generalizing Voigt's $\star$-version of the Infinite Ramsey Theorem to a large class of relational structures and deriving a Ramsey statement for "loose colorings" of enumerated Fra\"{\i}ss\'{e} limits.</description>

      <title>Topoi with enough points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Deligne's original argument showing that locally coherent topoi have enough points, clarified using collage diagrams. We show that our refinement of Deligne's technique can be adapted to recover every existing result of this kind, including the most recent results about $\kappa$-coherent $\kappa$-topoi. Our presentation allows us to relax the cardinality assumptions typically imposed on the sites involved. We show that a larger class of locally finitely presentable toposes have enough points and that a closed subtopos of a topos with enough points has enough points.</description>
