      <title>Segmentation-Free Outcome Prediction in Head and Neck Cancer: Deep Learning-based Feature Extraction from Multi-Angle Maximum Intensity Projections (MA-MIPs) of PET Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an innovative, simple, effective segmentation-free approach for outcome prediction in head \&amp; neck cancer (HNC) patients. By harnessing deep learning-based feature extraction techniques and multi-angle maximum intensity projections (MA-MIPs) applied to Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) volumes, our proposed method eliminates the need for manual segmentations of regions-of-interest (ROIs) such as primary tumors and involved lymph nodes. Instead, a state-of-the-art object detection model is trained to perform automatic cropping of the head and neck region on the PET volumes. A pre-trained deep convolutional neural network backbone is then utilized to extract deep features from MA-MIPs obtained from 72 multi-angel axial rotations of the cropped PET volumes. These deep features extracted from multiple projection views of the PET volumes are then aggregated and fused, and employed to perform recurrence-free survival analysis on a cohort of 489 HNC patients. The proposed approach outperforms the best performing method on the target dataset for the task of recurrence-free survival analysis. By circumventing the manual delineation of the malignancies on the FDG PET-CT images, our approach eliminates the dependency on subjective interpretations and highly enhances the reproducibility of the proposed survival analysis method.</description>

      <title>A Classification-Based Adaptive Segmentation Pipeline: Feasibility Study Using Polycystic Liver Disease and Metastases from Colorectal Cancer CT Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated segmentation tools often encounter accuracy and adaptability issues when applied to images of different pathology. The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of building a workflow to efficiently route images to specifically trained segmentation models. By implementing a deep learning classifier to automatically classify the images and route them to appropriate segmentation models, we hope that our workflow can segment the images with different pathology accurately. The data we used in this study are 350 CT images from patients affected by polycystic liver disease and 350 CT images from patients presenting with liver metastases from colorectal cancer. All images had the liver manually segmented by trained imaging analysts. Our proposed adaptive segmentation workflow achieved a statistically significant improvement for the task of total liver segmentation compared to the generic single segmentation model (non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test, n=100, p-value &lt;&lt; 0.001). This approach is applicable in a wide range of scenarios and should prove useful in clinical implementations of segmentation pipelines.</description>

      <title>Fluid-structure interaction simulations for the prediction of fractional flow reserve in pediatric patients with anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer simulations of blood flow in patients with anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery (AAOCA) have the promise to provide insight into this complex disease. They provide an in-silico experimental platform to explore possible mechanisms of myocardial ischemia, a potentially deadly complication for patients with this defect. This paper focuses on the question of model calibration for fluid-structure interaction models of pediatric AAOCA patients. Imaging and cardiac catheterization data provide partial information for model construction and calibration. However, parameters for downstream boundary conditions needed for these models are difficult to estimate. Further, important model predictions, like fractional flow reserve (FFR), are sensitive to these parameters. We describe an approach to calibrate downstream boundary condition parameters to clinical measurements of resting FFR. The calibrated models are then used to predict FFR at stress, an invasively measured quantity that can be used in the clinical evaluation of these patients. We find reasonable agreement between the model predicted and clinically measured FFR at stress, indicating the credibility of this modeling framework for predicting hemodynamics of pediatric AAOCA patients. This approach could lead to important clinical applications since it may serve as a tool for risk stratifying children with AAOCA.</description>

      <title>Report on the AAPM Grand Challenge on deep generative modeling for learning medical image statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The findings of the 2023 AAPM Grand Challenge on Deep Generative Modeling for Learning Medical Image Statistics are reported in this Special Report. The goal of this challenge was to promote the development of deep generative models (DGMs) for medical imaging and to emphasize the need for their domain-relevant assessment via the analysis of relevant image statistics. As part of this Grand Challenge, a training dataset was developed based on 3D anthropomorphic breast phantoms from the VICTRE virtual imaging toolbox. A two-stage evaluation procedure consisting of a preliminary check for memorization and image quality (based on the Frechet Inception distance (FID)), and a second stage evaluating the reproducibility of image statistics corresponding to domain-relevant radiomic features was developed. A summary measure was employed to rank the submissions. Additional analyses of submissions was performed to assess DGM performance specific to individual feature families, and to identify various artifacts. 58 submissions from 12 unique users were received for this Challenge. The top-ranked submission employed a conditional latent diffusion model, whereas the joint runners-up employed a generative adversarial network, followed by another network for image superresolution. We observed that the overall ranking of the top 9 submissions according to our evaluation method (i) did not match the FID-based ranking, and (ii) differed with respect to individual feature families. Another important finding from our additional analyses was that different DGMs demonstrated similar kinds of artifacts. This Grand Challenge highlighted the need for domain-specific evaluation to further DGM design as well as deployment. It also demonstrated that the specification of a DGM may differ depending on its intended use.</description>

      <title>The superiorization method with restarted perturbations for split minimization problems with an application to radiotherapy treatment planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the split minimization problem that consists of two constrained minimization problems in two separate spaces that are connected via a linear operator that maps one space into the other. To handle the data of such a problem we develop a superiorization approach that can reach a feasible point with reduced (not necessarily minimal) objective function values. The superiorization methodology is based on interlacing the iterative steps of two separate and independent iterative processes by perturbing the iterates of one process according to the steps dictated by the other process. We include in our developed method two novel elements. The first one is the permission to restart the perturbations in the superiorized algorithm which results in a significant acceleration and increases the computational efficiency. The second element is the ability to independently superiorize subvectors. This caters to the needs of real-world applications, as demonstrated here for a problem in intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning.</description>

      <title>Misspecification of Multiple Scattering in Scalar Wave Fields and its Impact in Ultrasound Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the localization of targets in the presence of multiple scattering. We focus on the often omitted scenario in which measurement data is affected by multiple scattering, and a simpler model is employed in the estimation. We study the impact of such model mismatch by means of the Misspecified Cram\'er-Rao Bound (MCRB). In numerical simulations inspired by tomographic inspection in ultrasound nondestructive testing, the MCRB is shown to correctly describe the estimation variance of localization parameters under misspecification of the wave propagation model. We provide extensive discussion on the utility of the MCRB in the practical task of verifying whether a chosen misspecified model is suitable for localization based on the properties of the maximum likelihood estimator and the nuanced distinction between bias and parameter space differences. Finally, we highlight that careful interpretation is needed whenever employing the classical CRB in the presence of mismatch through numerical examples based on the Born approximation and other simplified propagation models stemming from it.</description>
