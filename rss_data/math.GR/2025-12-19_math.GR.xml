      <title>On the finiteness properties of fixed subgroups of automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Sigma-invariants to study homotopical and homological finiteness properties of fixed subgroups of automorphisms of a group $G$ in terms of its center $Z(G)$ and the induced automorphisms on its associated quotient $G/Z(G)$. Specializing to the case where the center is a direct factor of the group, we answer a question made by Lei, Ma and Zhang.</description>

      <title>Linear dimension of group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two fundamental ways to represent a group are as permutations and as matrices. In this paper, we study linear representations of groups that intertwine with a permutation representation. Recently, D'Alconzo and Di Scala investigated how small the matrices in such a linear representation can be. The minimal dimension of such a representation is the \emph{linear dimension of the group action} and this has applications in cryptography and cryptosystems.
  We develop the idea of linear dimension from an algebraic point of view by using the theory of permutation modules. We give structural results about representations of minimal dimension and investigate the implications of faithfulness, transitivity and primitivity on the linear dimension. Furthermore, we compute the linear dimension of several classes of finite primitive permutation groups. We also study wreath products, allowing us to determine the linear dimension of imprimitive group actions. Finally, we give the linear dimension of almost simple finite $2$-transitive groups, some of which may be used for further applications in cryptography. Our results also open up many new questions about linear representations of group actions.</description>

      <title>Block-transitive designs with a poset of imprimitive partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study block designs which admit an automorphism group that is transitive on blocks and points, and leaves invariant every partition in a given finite poset of partitions of the point set. The full stabiliser $G$ of all the partitions in the poset is a generalised wreath product. We use the theory of generalised wreath products to give necessary and sufficient conditions, in terms of the `array' of a point-subset $B$, for the set of $G$-images of $B$ to form the block-set of a $G$-block-transitive $2$-design. This generalises previous results for the special cases where the poset is a chain or an anti-chain. We also give explicit infinite families of examples of $2$-designs for each poset involving three proper partitions, and for the famous $N$-poset with four partitions. (Posets with two proper partitions have been treated previously.) This suggests the problem of finding explicit examples for other posets.</description>

      <title>Residual Finiteness Growth in Nilpotent Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The residual finiteness growth $\text{RF}_G: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ of a finitely generated group $G$ is a function that gives the smallest value of the index $[G:N]$ with $N$ a normal subgroup not containing a non-trivial element $g$, in function of the word norm of that element $g$. It has been studied for several classes of finitely generated groups, including free groups, linear groups and virtually abelian groups. In this paper, we focus on $\text{RF}_G$ for the class of nilpotent groups, leading to three different results.
  First, we demonstrate that this function does not change when taking finite index subgroups within this class, so it forms a commensurability invariant. Next, we introduce a similar function on nilpotent Lie rings and show that every group corresponds to a nilpotent Lie ring with an equivalent residual finiteness growth. Finally, we define a new residual finiteness growth function by restricting to normal subgroups $N$ such that $G^p \subset N \subset G$ for some prime number $p$. After computing this new function for all finitely generated nilpotent groups, we show that it is equal to the earlier upper bound for $\text{RF}_G$ established in the literature and which was conjectured to be exact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the algebraic counterpart of the topological results $H^1(S^1, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ and $H^1(S^2, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \{0\}$. We also see that a non-trivial element of the algebraic cohomotopy groups of certain rings associated with some known topological spaces provides examples of non-free stably free module of rank two over those rings.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Triple Product Property for Finite Groups with Abelian Normal Subgroups of Prime Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three non-empty subsets $S,T,U$ of a finite group $G$ are said to satisfy the triple product property (TPP) if, for elements $s,s' \in S$, $t,t' \in T$, $u,u' \in U$, the equation $s's^{-1}t't^{-1}u'u^{-1}=1$ holds if and only if $s = s'$, $t = t'$, $u = u'$. In this case $(S,T,U)$ is called a TPP triple of $G$ and $|S||T||U|$ is called the size of the triple. The triple product ratio of $G$ can be defined as the quantity $\rho(G) := \frac{\beta(G)}{|G|}$, where $\beta(G)$ is the largest size of a TPP triple of $G$, and a special case of this, the subgroup triple product ratio, is the quantity $\rho_0(G) := \frac{\beta_0(G)}{|G|}$, where $\beta_0(G)$ is the largest size of a TPP triple of $G$ composed only of subgroups. There is a conjecture that $\rho(G) \leq \frac{4}{3}$ if $G$ contains a cyclic subgroup of index $2$. This note proves a version of this conjecture for subgroups by showing that $\rho_0(G) \leq \frac{p^2}{2p-1}$ if $G$ is any group which contains an abelian normal subgroup of prime index $p$.</description>

      <title>From affine algebraic racks to Leibniz algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce analogues of algebraic groups called algebraic racks, which are pointed rack objects in the category of schemes over a ground field. Addressing a problem of Loday, we construct a functor assigning a canonical Leibniz algebra to every affine algebraic rack. This functor recovers the Lie algebras of affine algebraic groups (via conjugation quandles) and the Leibniz algebras of algebraic Lie racks, and it is compatible with closed subracks and left ideals. We also compare properties of affine algebraic racks, commutative corack algebras, and their Leibniz algebras.</description>

      <title>Extriangulated structures from stability conditions and application to braid representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the notion of Bridgeland stability condition and its associated metric to endow triangulated categories with extriangulated structures and study their extriangulated Grothendieck groups. This study is motivated by Khovanov-Seidel's categorification of the Burau representation, from which can be extracted the Lawrence-Krammer-Bigelow representation, providing a relation between these two faithful representations of the braid groups.</description>

      <title>On the space of subgroups of Baumslag-Solitar groups II: High transitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue our study of the perfect kernel of the space of transitive actions of Baumslag-Solitar groups by investigating high transitivity. We show that actions of finite phenotype are never highly transitive, except when the phenotype is 1, in which case high transitivity is actually generic. In infinite phenotype, high transitivity is generic, except when |m|=|n| where it is empty. We also reinforce the dynamical properties of the action by conjugation on the perfect kernel that we had established in our first paper, replacing topological transitivity by high topological transitivity.</description>

      <title>Strongly Doubly Reversible Pairs in Quaternionic Unitary Group of Signature $(n,1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\PSp(n,1)$ denote the isometry group of the quaternionic hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$. A pair $(g_1,g_2)$ $\PSp(n,1)$ is \emph{strongly doubly reversible} if $(g_1,g_2)$ and $(g_1^{-1},g_2^{-1})$ are simultaneously conjugate in $\PSp(n,1)$ by an involution. Equivalently, there exist involutions $i_1,i_2,i_3 \in \PSp(n,1)$ such that $g_1 = i_1 i_2$, $g_2 = i_1 i_3$.
  We prove that the set of such pairs has Haar measure zero in $\PSp(n,1) \times \PSp(n,1)$. The same result also holds for $\PSp(n) \times \PSp(n)$ for $n\geq 2$. In the special case $n=1$, we show that every pair of elements in $\PSp(1)$ is strongly doubly reversible. Applying this result, we give a shorter proof of a theorem of Basmajian and Maskit showing that every pair of elements in ${\rm SO}(4)$ is strongly doubly reversible.
  Furthermore, we derive the necessary conditions for a pair of hyperbolic elements in $\PSp(1,1)$ to be strongly doubly reversible and provide a quantitative characterization of such pairs.</description>

Abstract: Thanks to the work of Karin Erdmann, we know a great deal about the representation theory of blocks of finite groups with tame representation type. Our purpose here is to examine the $p$-completed classifying spaces of these blocks and their loop spaces.

      <title>Free dilations of families of $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups and applications to evolution families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16314v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Commuting families of contractions or contractive $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups on Hilbert spaces often fail to admit power dilations resp, simultaneous unitary dilations which are themselves commutative (see [45, 13, 15]). In the \emph{non-commutative} setting, Sz.-Nagy [60] and Bo\.{z}ejko [5] provided means to dilate arbitrary families of contractions. The present work extends these discrete-time results to families $\{T_{i}\}_{i \in I}$ of contractive $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups. We refer to these dilations as continuous-time \emph{free unitary dilations} and present three distinct approaches to obtain them: 1) An explicit derivation applicable to semigroups that arise as interpolations; 2) A full proof with an explicit construction, via the theory of co-generators \`{a} la S{\l}oci\'{n}ski [54, 55]; and 3) A second full proof based on the abstract structure of semigroups, which admits a natural reformulation to semigroups defined over topological free products of $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ and leads to various residuality results. In 2) a IInd free dilation theorem for topologised index sets is developed via a reformulation of the Trotter--Kato theorem for co-generators. As an application of this we demonstrate how evolution families can be reduced to continuously monitored processes subject to temporal change, \'{a} la the quantum Zeno effect [22, 23, 24, 30, 37].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17197v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Finite Group Modular Representation Theory, the basic objects are the indecomposable and simple modules. This paper offers a new classification of these objects that refines the Green Theory Classification of indecomposable and simple modules. The sets of isomorphism tyes of these modules is decomposed into disjoint, non-empty subsets such that any two elements in any subset share Green Theory Invariants. We also prove a new formula for the number of isomorphism types of absolutely simple modules of finite groups in prime characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main drawback of using generative AI models for advanced mathematics is that these models are not primarily logical reasoning engines. However, Large Language Models, and their refinements, can pick up on patterns in higher mathematics that are difficult for humans to see. By putting the design of generative AI models to their advantage, mathematicians may use them as powerful interactive assistants that can carry out laborious tasks, generate and debug code, check examples, formulate conjectures and more. We discuss how generative AI models can be used to advance mathematics research. We also discuss their integration with neuro-symbolic solvers, Computer Algebra Systems and formal proof assistants such as Lean.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the number of ends of the mapping class group of a stable avenue surface. We prove that the mapping class group is one-ended whenever the stable avenue surface has at least one end of discrete type. Our method is to show that the associated translatable curve graph, which is quasi-isometric to the mapping class group, is one-ended.</description>
