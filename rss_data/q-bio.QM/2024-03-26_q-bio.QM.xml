      <title>Response of Different Tomato Accessions to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accessions are prospective sources of genetic variability, as well as valuable genetic resources to deal with present and future crop breeding difficulties. The assessment of population structure and genetic diversity of tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.) that have been distributed in Iraqi Kurdistan region critical in breeding programs for the production of high-yielding cultivars as well as widening the genetic base of tomato. Using fruit quality indices and molecular markers, a panel of 64 tomato accessions taken from six provinces of Iraqi Kurdistan Region, were analyzed for genetic diversity and population structure. In the analysis of variance, the fruit phenotypic data revealed a high level of significant variability among tomato accessions. The most important characteristics for explaining fruit morphological variability, according to principal component analysis (PCA), were fruit weight, fruit size, fruit diameter, total soluble solids, and moisture content. Seven clades with different fruit characteristics were revealed in the cluster analysis. Genetic diversity and relationships among accessions were analyzed using thirteen inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR), twenty-six start codon-targeted (SCoT) polymorphisms, and fifteen conserved DNA-derived polymorphisms (CDDP). The ISSR, SCoT, and CDDP markers generated 121, 294, and 170 polymorphic bands, respectively, showing a high prevalence of polymorphism. The average polymorphism information content (PIC) values for ISSR, SCoT, and CDDP were 0.81, 0.84, and 0.84, respectively. The accessions were divided into two groups based on the cluster and STRUCTURE analysis results. The Mantel test revealed that three sets of markers had positive and significant relationships.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Generalization of Cancer Clinical Trial Eligibility Classifiers Across Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical trials are pivotal in medical research, and NLP can enhance their success, with application in recruitment. This study aims to evaluate the generalizability of eligibility classification across a broad spectrum of clinical trials. Starting with phase 3 cancer trials, annotated with seven eligibility exclusions, then to determine how well models can generalize to non-cancer and non-phase 3 trials. To assess this, we have compiled eligibility criteria data for five types of trials: (1) additional phase 3 cancer trials, (2) phase 1 and 2 cancer trials, (3) heart disease trials, (4) type 2 diabetes trials, and (5) observational trials for any disease, comprising 2,490 annotated eligibility criteria across seven exclusion types. Our results show that models trained on the extensive cancer dataset can effectively handle criteria commonly found in non-cancer trials, such as autoimmune diseases. However, they struggle with criteria disproportionately prevalent in cancer trials, like prior malignancy. We also experiment with few-shot learning, demonstrating that a limited number of disease-specific examples can partially overcome this performance gap. We are releasing this new dataset of annotated eligibility statements to promote the development of cross-disease generalization in clinical trial classification.</description>

      <title>Grad-CAMO: Learning Interpretable Single-Cell Morphological Profiles from 3D Cell Painting Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their black-box nature, deep learning models are extensively used in image-based drug discovery to extract feature vectors from single cells in microscopy images. To better understand how these networks perform representation learning, we employ visual explainability techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM). Our analyses reveal several mechanisms by which supervised models cheat, exploiting biologically irrelevant pixels when extracting morphological features from images, such as noise in the background. This raises doubts regarding the fidelity of learned single-cell representations and their relevance when investigating downstream biological questions. To address this misalignment between researcher expectations and machine behavior, we introduce Grad-CAMO, a novel single-cell interpretability score for supervised feature extractors. Grad-CAMO measures the proportion of a model's attention that is concentrated on the cell of interest versus the background. This metric can be assessed per-cell or averaged across a validation set, offering a tool to audit individual features vectors or guide the improved design of deep learning architectures. Importantly, Grad-CAMO seamlessly integrates into existing workflows, requiring no dataset or model modifications, and is compatible with both 2D and 3D Cell Painting data. Additional results are available at https://github.com/eigenvivek/Grad-CAMO.</description>

      <title>Assessing the similarity of real matrices with arbitrary shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing the similarity of matrices is valuable for analyzing the extent to which data sets exhibit common features in tasks such as data clustering, dimensionality reduction, pattern recognition, group comparison, and graph analysis. Methods proposed for comparing vectors, such as cosine similarity, can be readily generalized to matrices. However, this approach usually neglects the inherent two-dimensional structure of matrices. Here, we propose singular angle similarity (SAS), a measure for evaluating the structural similarity between two arbitrary, real matrices of the same shape based on singular value decomposition. After introducing the measure, we compare SAS with standard measures for matrix comparison and show that only SAS captures the two-dimensional structure of matrices. Further, we characterize the behavior of SAS in the presence of noise and as a function of matrix dimensionality. Finally, we apply SAS to two use cases: square non-symmetric matrices of probabilistic network connectivity, and non-square matrices representing neural brain activity. For synthetic data of network connectivity, SAS matches intuitive expectations and allows for a robust assessment of similarities and differences. For experimental data of brain activity, SAS captures differences in the structure of high-dimensional responses to different stimuli. We conclude that SAS is a suitable measure for quantifying the shared structure of matrices with arbitrary shape.</description>

      <title>RetroBridge: Modeling Retrosynthesis with Markov Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning is a fundamental challenge in chemistry which aims at designing reaction pathways from commercially available starting materials to a target molecule. Each step in multi-step retrosynthesis planning requires accurate prediction of possible precursor molecules given the target molecule and confidence estimates to guide heuristic search algorithms. We model single-step retrosynthesis planning as a distribution learning problem in a discrete state space. First, we introduce the Markov Bridge Model, a generative framework aimed to approximate the dependency between two intractable discrete distributions accessible via a finite sample of coupled data points. Our framework is based on the concept of a Markov bridge, a Markov process pinned at its endpoints. Unlike diffusion-based methods, our Markov Bridge Model does not need a tractable noise distribution as a sampling proxy and directly operates on the input product molecules as samples from the intractable prior distribution. We then address the retrosynthesis planning problem with our novel framework and introduce RetroBridge, a template-free retrosynthesis modeling approach that achieves state-of-the-art results on standard evaluation benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Improving Opioid Use Disorder Risk Modelling through Behavioral and Genetic Feature Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Opioids are an effective analgesic for acute and chronic pain, but also carry a considerable risk of addiction leading to millions of opioid use disorder (OUD) cases and tens of thousands of premature deaths in the United States yearly. Estimating OUD risk prior to prescription could improve the efficacy of treatment regimens, monitoring programs, and intervention strategies, but risk estimation is typically based on self-reported data or questionnaires. We develop an experimental design and computational methods that combine genetic variants associated with OUD with behavioral features extracted from GPS and Wi-Fi spatiotemporal coordinates to assess OUD risk. Since both OUD mobility and genetic data do not exist for the same cohort, we develop algorithms to (1) generate mobility features from empirical distributions and (2) synthesize mobility and genetic samples assuming an expected level of disease co-occurrence. We show that integrating genetic and mobility modalities improves risk modelling using classification accuracy, area under the precision-recall and receiver operator characteristic curves, and $F_1$ score. Interpreting the fitted models suggests that mobility features have more influence on OUD risk, although the genetic contribution was significant, particularly in linear models. While there exist concerns with respect to privacy, security, bias, and generalizability that must be evaluated in clinical trials before being implemented in practice, our framework provides preliminary evidence that behavioral and genetic features may improve OUD risk estimation to assist with personalized clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>CESPED: a new benchmark for supervised particle pose estimation in Cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryo-EM is a powerful tool for understanding macromolecular structures, yet current methods for structure reconstruction are slow and computationally demanding. To accelerate research on pose estimation, we present CESPED, a new dataset specifically designed for Supervised Pose Estimation in Cryo-EM. Alongside CESPED, we provide a PyTorch package to simplify Cryo-EM data handling and model evaluation. We evaluated the performance of a baseline model, Image2Sphere, on CESPED, which showed promising results but also highlighted the need for further improvements. Additionally, we illustrate the potential of deep learning-based pose estimators to generalise across different samples, suggesting a promising path toward more efficient processing strategies. CESPED is available at https://github.com/oxpig/cesped.</description>

      <title>Clonal dynamics of surface-driven growing tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-organization of cells into complex tissues relies on a tight coordination of cell behavior. Identifying the cellular processes driving tissue growth is key to understanding the emergence of tissue forms and devising targeted therapies for aberrant growth, such as in cancer. Inferring the mode of tissue growth, whether it is driven by cells on the surface or cells in the bulk, is possible in cell culture experiments, but difficult in most tissues in living organisms (in vivo). Genetic tracing experiments, where a subset of cells is labeled with inheritable markers have become important experimental tools to study cell fate in vivo. Here, we show that the mode of tissue growth is reflected in the size distribution of the progeny of marked cells. To this end, we derive the clone-size distributions using analytical calculations in the limit of negligible cell migration and cell death, and we test our predictions with an agent-based stochastic sampling technique. We show that for surface-driven growth the clone-size distribution takes a characteristic power-law form with an exponent determined by fluctuations of the tissue surface. Our results show how the mode of tissue growth can be inferred from genetic tracing experiments.</description>

      <title>NaNa and MiGu: Semantic Data Augmentation Techniques to Enhance Protein Classification in Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein classification tasks are essential in drug discovery. Real-world protein structures are dynamic, which will determine the properties of proteins. However, the existing machine learning methods, like ProNet (Wang et al., 2022a), only access limited conformational characteristics and protein side-chain features, leading to impractical protein structure and inaccuracy of protein classes in their predictions. In this paper, we propose novel semantic data augmentation methods, Novel Augmentation of New Node Attributes (NaNa), and Molecular Interactions and Geometric Upgrading (MiGu) to incorporate backbone chemical and side-chain biophysical information into protein classification tasks and a co-embedding residual learning framework. Specifically, we leverage molecular biophysical, secondary structure, chemical bonds, and ionic features of proteins to facilitate protein classification tasks. Furthermore, our semantic augmentation methods and the co-embedding residual learning framework can improve the performance of GIN (Xu et al., 2019) on EC and Fold datasets (Bairoch, 2000; Andreeva et al., 2007) by 16.41% and 11.33% respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/r08b46009/Code_for_MIGU_NANA/tree/main.</description>

      <title>Node-Aligned Graph-to-Graph (NAG2G): Elevating Template-Free Deep Learning Approaches in Single-Step Retrosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-step retrosynthesis (SSR) in organic chemistry is increasingly benefiting from deep learning (DL) techniques in computer-aided synthesis design. While template-free DL models are flexible and promising for retrosynthesis prediction, they often ignore vital 2D molecular information and struggle with atom alignment for node generation, resulting in lower performance compared to the template-based and semi-template-based methods. To address these issues, we introduce Node-Aligned Graph-to-Graph (NAG2G), a transformer-based template-free DL model. NAG2G combines 2D molecular graphs and 3D conformations to retain comprehensive molecular details and incorporates product-reactant atom mapping through node alignment which determines the order of the node-by-node graph outputs process in an auto-regressive manner. Through rigorous benchmarking and detailed case studies, we have demonstrated that NAG2G stands out with its remarkable predictive accuracy on the expansive datasets of USPTO-50k and USPTO-FULL. Moreover, the model's practical utility is underscored by its successful prediction of synthesis pathways for multiple drug candidate molecules. This not only proves NAG2G's robustness but also its potential to revolutionize the prediction of complex chemical synthesis processes for future synthetic route design tasks.</description>

      <title>Shallow learning enables real-time inference of molecular composition from spectroscopy of brain tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16735v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical imaging modalities such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) represent a promising alternative for low-cost, non-invasive, and fast monitoring of functional and structural properties of living tissue. Particularly, the possibility of extracting the molecular composition of the tissue from the optical spectra in real-time deems the spectroscopy techniques as a unique diagnostic tool. However, due to a lack of paired optical and molecular profiling studies, building a mapping between a spectral signature and a corresponding set of molecular concentrations is still an unsolved problem. Furthermore, no established methods exist to streamline the inference of the biochemical composition from the optical spectrum for real-time applications such as surgical monitoring. In this paper, we analyse a technique for fast and accurate inference of changes in the molecular composition of brain tissue. We base our method on the Beer-Lambert law to analytically connect the spectra with concentrations and use a deep-learning approach to significantly speed up the concentration inference compared to traditional optimization methods. We test our approach on real data obtained from the broadband NIRS- and HSI-based optical monitoring of brain tissue. The results demonstrate that the proposed method enables real-time molecular composition inference while maintaining the accuracy of traditional linear and non-linear optimization solvers.</description>
