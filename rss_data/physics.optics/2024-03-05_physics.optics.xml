      <title>Eight-shot measurement of spatially non-stationary complex coherence function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial coherence plays an important role in several real-world applications ranging from imaging to communication. As a result, its accurate characterization and measurement are extremely crucial for its optimal application. However, efficient measurement of an arbitrary complex spatial coherence function is still very challenging. In this letter, we propose an efficient, noise-insensitive interferometric technique that combines wavefront shearing and inversion for measuring the complex cross-spectral density function of the class of fields, in which the cross-spectral density function depends either on the difference of the spatial coordinates, or the squares of spatial coordinates, or both. This class of fields are most commonly encountered, and we experimentally demonstrate high-fidelity measurement of many stationary and non-stationary fields.</description>

      <title>Versatile Optical Frequency Division with Kerr-induced Synchronization at Tunable Microcomb Synthetic Dispersive Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) provides a new key tool for the control and stabilization of the repetition rate of a cavity soliton frequency comb. It enables direct external control of a given comb tooth of a dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) thanks to its capture by an injected reference laser. Efficient KIS requires its coupling energy to be sufficiently large, and hence both the comb tooth and intracavity reference power must be optimized, which can be achieved through higher-order dispersion that enables phase-matched dispersive waves (DWs), where comb teeth are on resonance. However, such a design is highly restrictive, preventing arbitrary use of reference wavelengths away from the DW(s). In particular, for large spectral separations from the main pump the cavity dispersion yields large detuning between comb teeth and their respective cavity resonances, thereby decreasing the coupling energy and rendering KIS to be highly inefficient or practically impossible. Here, we demonstrate an alternative KIS method where efficient synchronization can be tailored at arbitrary modes as needed. Using a multi-color DKS created from multi-pumping a microresonator, a synthetic DW at the second-color wavepacket can be selectively created where otherwise dispersion is far too large for KIS to be experimentally feasible. Since a unique group velocity for both colors exists thanks to cross-phase modulation, the repetition rate disciplining of the secondary color wavepacket through its KIS automatically translates into the DKS microcomb control. We first investigate this color-KIS phenomenon theoretically, and then experimentally demonstrate its control and tuning of the soliton microcomb repetition rate. As a consequence, we demonstrate optical frequency division that is uncoupled from the main pump that generates the DKS.</description>

      <title>Direct Radiation Pressure Measurements for Lightsail Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrathin lightsails propelled by laser radiation pressure to relativistic speeds are currently the most promising route for flyby-based exoplanet exploration. However, there has been a notable lack of experimental characterization of key parameters essential for lightsail propulsion. Therefore, a model platform for optomechanical characterization of lightsail prototypes made from realistic materials is needed. We propose an approach for simultaneous measurement of optical forces and driving powers, which capitalizes on the multiphysics dynamics induced by the driving laser beam. By modelling the lightsail with a 50-nm thick silicon nitride membrane suspended by compliant micromechanical springs, we quantify force from off-resonantly driven displacement and power from heating-induced mechanical mode softening. This approach allows us to calibrate the measured forces to the driving powers by operating the device as a mechanical bolometer. We report radiation pressure forces of 80 fN using a collimated pump beam of 100 W/cm2 and noise-robust common-path interferometry. As lightsails will inevitably experience non-normal forces, we quantify the effects of incidence angle and spot size on the optical force and explain the nonintuitive trend by edge scattering. Our results provide a framework for comprehensive lightsail characterization and laboratory optomechanical manipulation of macroscopic objects by radiation pressure forces.</description>

      <title>Exact closed forms for the transmittance of electromagnetic waves in one-dimensional anisotropic periodic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain closed expressions for the transfer matrix and the transmittance of electromagnetic waves propagating in finite 1D anisotropic periodic stratified media with an arbitrary number of cells. By invoking the Cayley-Hamilton theorem on the transfer matrix for the electromagnetic field in a periodic stratified media formed by N cells, we obtain a fourth-degree recursive relation for the matrix coefficients that defines the so-called Tetranacci Polynomials. In the symmetric case, corresponding to a unit-cell transfer matrix with a characteristic polynomial where the coefficients of the linear and cubic terms are equal, closed expressions for the solutions to the recursive relation, known as symmetric Tetranacci Polynomials, have recently been derived, allowing us to write the transfer matrix and transmittance in a closed form. We show as sufficient conditions that the $4\times4$ differential propagation matrix of each layer in the binary unit cell, $\Delta$, a) has eigenvalues of the form $\pm p_1$, $\pm p_2$, with $p_1\ne p_2$, and b) its off-diagonal $2\times2$ block matrices possess the same symmetric structure in both layers. Otherwise, the recursive relations are still solvable for any $4\times4$-matrix and provide an algorithm to compute the N-th power of the transfer matrix without carrying out explicitly the matrix multiplication of N matrices. We obtain analytical expressions for the dispersion relation and transmittance, in closed form, for two finite periodic systems: the first one consists of two birefringent uniaxial media with their optical axis perpendicular to the z-axis, and the second consists of two isotropic media subject to an external magnetic field oriented along the z-axis and exhibiting the Faraday effect. Our formalism applies also to lossy media, magnetic anisotropy or optical activity.</description>

      <title>Energy deposition in air by moderately focused femtosecond laser filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filamentation of high-power femtosecond laser pulses in air is accompanied by a fairly strong release of optical energy into the propagation medium due to laser-induced ionization of air molecules and production of an underdense plasma of charged species. We present the results of our laboratory experiments and numerical simulations aimed to the estimation of energy deposition amount by laser filament upon propagation in air depending on the conditions of spatial focusing, pulse energy, and radiation wavelength. For the first time to our knowledge, our study reveals a more than 50% decrease in the filament energy deposited in air in the range of moderate numerical aperture values, approximately from 0.003 to 0.007, at the carrier wavelengths of 740 nm and 470 nm. We attribute such a considerable reduction in the laser pulse energy release for femtosecond plasma to the competing effects of Kerr self-focusing and geometric divergence of focused laser pulse.</description>

      <title>Probing macroscopic temperature changes with non-radiative processes in hyperbolic meta-antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilayered metal-dielectric nanostructures display both strong plasmonic behavior and hyperbolic optical dispersion. The latter is responsible for the appearance of two separated radiative and non-radiative channels in the extinction spectrum of these structures. This unique property can open a wealth of opportunities towards the development of multifunctional systems that simultaneously can behave as optimal scatterers and absorbers at different wavelengths, an important feature to achieve multiscale control light-matter interactions in different spectral regions for different types of applications, such as optical computing or detection of thermal radiation. Nevertheless, the temperature dependence of the optical properties of these multilayered systems has never been investigated. In this work we study how radiative and non-radiative processes in hyperbolic meta-antennas can probe temperature changes of the surrounding medium. We show that, while radiative processes are essentially not affected by a change in the external temperature, the non-radiative ones are strongly affected by a temperature variation. By combining experiments and temperature dependent effective medium theory, we find that this behavior is connected to enhanced damping effects due to electron-phonon scattering. Contrary to standard plasmonic systems, a red-shift of the non-radiative mode occurs for small variations of the environment temperature. Our study shows that to probe temperature changes it is essential to exploit non-radiative processes in systems supporting plasmonic excitations, which can be used as very sensitive thermometers via linear absorption spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Dynamic control of polarization conversion based on borophene nanostructures in optical communication bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarized light has various potential applications in the communication bands, including optical communication, polarization imaging, quantum emission, and quantum communication. However, optimizing polarization control requires continuous improvements in areas such as dynamic tunability, materials, and efficiency. In this work, we propose a borophene-based structure capable of converting linearly polarized light into arbitrarily polarized light through the coherent excitation of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) in optical communication band. Furthermore, a double-layer borophene structure can be achieved by placing a second borophene array at the top of the first one with a 90{\deg} relative rotation of their crystalline plane. The rotation direction of the polarization state of the reflected light can be switched by independently controlling the carrier concentration of the two-layer borophene. Finally, a dipole source is used to realize the emission of polarized light, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the emission rate in free space, and the polarization state can be dynamically controlled by manipulating the carrier concentration. Our study is simple and compact, with potential applications in the fields of polarizers, polarization detectors, and quantum emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A standardized phase retrieval algorithm is presented and applied to an industry-grade high-energy ultrashort pulsed laser to uncover its spatial phase distribution. We describe in detail how to modify the well-known algorithm in order to characterize particularly strong light sources from intensity measurements only. With complete information about the optical field of the unknown light source at hand, virtual back propagation can reveal weak points in the light path such as apertures or damaged components.</description>

      <title>Polarization-dependent effects in vibrational absorption spectra of 2D finite-size adsorbate islands on dielectric substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last years, Infrared Reflection-Absorption Spectroscopy (IRRAS) became a standard technique to study vibrational excitations of molecules. These investigations are strongly motivated by perspective applications in monitoring chemical processes. For a better understanding of the adsorption mechanism of molecules on dielectrics, the polarization-dependence of an interaction of infrared light with adsorbates at dielectric surfaces is commonly used. Thus, the peak positions in absorption spectra could be different for s- and p-polarized light. This shift between the peak positions depends on both the molecule itself and the dielectric substrate. While the origin of this shift is well understood for infinite two-dimensional adsorbate layers, finite-size samples, which consist of 2D islands of a small number of molecules, have never been considered. Here, we present a study on polarization-dependent finite-size effects in the optical response of such islands on dielectric substrates. The study uses a multi-scale modeling approach that connects quantum chemistry calculations to Maxwell scattering simulations. We distinguish the optical response of a single molecule, a finite number of molecules, and a two-dimensional adsorbate layer. We analyze CO and CO$_2$ molecules deposited on CeO$_2$ and Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates. The evolution of the shift between the polarization-dependent absorbance peaks is firstly studied for a single molecule, which it does not exhibit for at all, and for finite molecular islands, which it increases with increasing island size for, as well as for an infinite two-dimensional adsorbate layer. In the latter case, the agreement between the obtained results and the experimental IRRAS data and more traditional three/four-layer-model theoretical studies supports the predictive power of the multi-scale approach.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Freeform Reflector Design with a Microfacet Surface Roughness Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript will unify inverse freeform reflector design and surface light scattering to design freeform reflectors with a scattering surface. We use microfacets, which are small, tilted mirrors superimposed on a smooth surface. We form a simple model of surface roughness and light scattering based on the orientations of the microfacets. Using a least-squares solver to compute the smooth reflector as a starting point, we can subsequently alter the surface using an optimization procedure to account for the scattering. After optimization, the resulting reflector surface produces the desired scattered light distribution. We verify the resulting reflector using raytracing.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking reconstructive spectrometer with multi-resonant cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen the rapid development of miniaturized reconstructive spectrometers (RSs), yet they still confront a range of technical challenges, such as bandwidth/resolution ratio, sensing speed, and/or power efficiency. Reported RS designs often suffer from insufficient decorrelation between sampling channels, which results in limited compressive sampling efficiency, in essence, due to inadequate engineering of sampling responses. This in turn leads to poor spectral-pixel-to-channel ratios (SPCRs), typically restricted at single digits. So far, there lacks a general guideline for manipulating RS sampling responses for the effectiveness of spectral information acquisition. In this study, we shed light on a fundamental parameter from the compressive sensing theory - the average mutual correlation coefficient v - and provide insight into how it serves as a critical benchmark in RS design with regards to the SPCR and reconstruction accuracy. To this end, we propose a novel RS design with multi-resonant cavities, consisting of a series of partial reflective interfaces. Such multi-cavity configuration offers an expansive parameter space, facilitating the superlative optimization of sampling matrices with minimized v. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, a single-shot, dual-band RS is implemented on a SiN platform, tailored for capturing signature spectral shapes across different wavelength regions, with customized photonic crystal nanobeam mirrors. Experimentally, the device demonstrates an overall operation bandwidth of 270 nm and a &lt;0.5 nm resolution with only 15 sampling channels per band, leading to a record high SPCR of 18.0. Moreover, the proposed multi-cavity design can be readily adapted to various photonic platforms. For instance, we showcase that by employing multi-layer coatings, an ultra-broadband RS can be optimized to exhibit a 700 nm bandwidth with an SPCR of over 100.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical bistability and oscillating phases exist in a Sagnac interferometer and a single ring resonator made of $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinear medium where the refractive indices are modulated by the light intensity due to the Kerr nonlinearity. An array of coupled nonlinear ring resonators behave similarly but with more complexity due to the presence of the additional couplings.Here, we theoretically demonstrate the bifurcation of topological edge modes which leads to optical bistability in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice with the Kerr nonlinearity. Additionally, we demonstrate periodic and chaotic switching behaviors in an oscillating phase resulting from the coupling between the topological edge mode and bulk modes with different chiralities, i.e., clockwise and counter-clockwise circulations.</description>

      <title>Resonant wavelengths of whispering gallery modes with a variable refractive index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we compute the resonant wavelength of whispering gallery modes for bulk-fused silica microspheres including chromatic dispersion. This is done following two methods: by solving the exact characteristic equation and, on the other hand, by solving the nonlinear equations that result for a variable refractive index in the asymptotic approximations. Similar results with both methods are obtained with differences below $1\%$ . Nevertheless, important differences are found with respect to the resonant wavelengths computed with a constant index and with a variable index. We compute the free spectral range and the quality factor, and make a comparison between the variable index and the constant index cases. The differences are of significant relevance for the free spectral range, while for the quality factor, the constant case is insensitive to the chromatic dispersion. Our work could be useful as a pathway for designing microspheres for different applications.</description>

      <title>Shaping an evanescent focus of light for high spatial resolution optogenetic activations in live cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confining light illumination in the three dimensions of space is a challenge for various applications. Among these, optogenetic methods developed for live experiments in cell biology would benefit from such a localized illumination as it would improve the spatial resolution of diffusive photosensitive proteins leading to spatially constrained biological responses in specific subcellular organelles. Here, we describe a method to create and move a focused evanescent spot across the field of view of a high numerical aperture microscope objective, using a digital micro-mirror device (DMD). We show that, after correcting the optical aberrations, light is confined within a spot of sub-micron lateral size and $\sim$100~nm axial depth, resulting in a volume of illumination drastically smaller than the one generated by a standard propagative focus. This evanescent focus is sufficient to induce a more intense and localized recruitment compared to a propagative focus on the optogenetic system CRY2-CIBN, improving the resolution of its pattern of activation.</description>

      <title>Silicon Photonic Microresonator-Based High-Resolution Line-by-Line Pulse Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical pulse shaping stands as a formidable technique in ultrafast optics, radio-frequency photonics, and quantum communications. While existing systems rely on bulk optics or integrated platforms with planar waveguide sections for spatial dispersion, they face limitations in achieving finer (few- or sub-GHz) spectrum control. These methods either demand considerable space or suffer from pronounced phase errors and optical losses when assembled to achieve fine resolution. Addressing these challenges, we present a foundry-fabricated six-channel silicon photonic shaper using microresonator filter banks with inline phase control and high spectral resolution. Leveraging existing comb-based spectroscopic techniques, we devise a novel system to mitigate thermal crosstalk and enable the versatile use of our on-chip shaper. Our results demonstrate the shaper's ability to phase-compensate six comb lines at tunable channel spacings of 3, 4, and 5 GHz. Specifically, at a 3 GHz channel spacing, we showcase the generation of arbitrary waveforms in the time domain. This scalable design and control scheme holds promise in meeting future demands for high-precision spectral shaping capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Energy efficiency of electronic digital processors is primarily limited by the energy consumption of electronic communication and interconnects. The industry is almost unanimously pushing towards replacing both long-haul, as well as local chip interconnects, using optics to drastically increase efficiency. In this paper, we explore what comes after the successful migration to optical interconnects, as with this inefficiency solved, the main source of energy consumption will be electronic digital computing, memory and electro-optical conversion. Our approach attempts to address all these issues by introducing efficient all-optical digital computing and memory, which in turn eliminates the need for electro-optical conversions. Here, we demonstrate for the first time a scheme to enable general purpose digital data processing in an integrated form and present our photonic integrated circuit (PIC) implementation. For this demonstration we implemented a URISC architecture capable of running any classical piece of software all-optically and present a comprehensive architectural framework for all-optical computing to go beyond.</description>

      <title>Skew-Gaussian model of small-photon-number coherent Ising machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Gaussian quantum theory of bosonic modes has been widely used to describe quantum optical systems, including coherent Ising machines (CIMs) that consist of $\chi^{(2)}$ degenerate optical parametric oscillators (DOPOs) as nonlinear elements. However, Gaussian models have been thought to be invalid in the extremely strong-gain-saturation limit. Here, we develop an extended Gaussian model including two third-order fluctuation products, $\langle \delta \hat{X}^3\rangle$ and $\langle \delta \hat{X}\delta \hat{P}^2\rangle$, which we call self-skewness and cross-skewness, respectively. This new model which we call skew-Gaussian model more precisely replicates the success probability predicted by the quantum master equation (QME), relative to Gaussian models. We also discuss the impact of skew variables on the performance of CIMs.</description>

      <title>Microwave-to-optics conversion using magnetostatic modes and a tunable optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing, quantum communication and quantum networks rely on hybrid quantum systems operating in different frequency ranges. For instance, the superconducting qubits work in the gigahertz range, while the optical photons used in communication are in the range of hundreds of terahertz. Due to the large frequency mismatch, achieving the direct coupling and information exchange between different information carriers is generally difficult. Accordingly, a quantum interface is demanded, which serves as a bridge to establish information linkage between different quantum systems operating at distinct frequencies. Recently, the magnon mode in ferromagnetic spin systems has received significant attention. While the inherent weak optomagnonic coupling strength restricts the microwave-to-optical photon conversion efficiency using magnons, the versatility of the magnon modes, together with their readily achievable strong coupling with other quantum systems, endow them with many distinct advantages. Here, we realize the magnon-based microwave-light interface by adopting an optical cavity with adjustable free spectrum range and different kinds of magnetostatic modes in two microwave cavity configurations. By optimizing the parameters, an internal conversion efficiency of 1.28 x 10^-7 is achieved. We analyze the impact of various parameters on the microwave-to-optics conversion. The study provides useful guidance and insights to further enhancing the microwave-to-optics conversion efficiency using magnons.</description>

      <title>Phase retrieval beyond the homogeneous object assumption for X-ray in-line holographic imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray near field holography has proven to be a powerful 2D and 3D imaging technique with applications ranging from biomedical research to material sciences. To reconstruct meaningful and quantitative images from the measurement intensities, however, it relies on computational phase retrieval which in many cases assumes the phase-shift and attenuation coefficient of the sample to be proportional. Here, we demonstrate an efficient phase retrieval algorithm that does not rely on this homogeneous-object assumption and is a generalization of the well-established contrast-transfer-function (CTF) approach. We then investigate its stability and present an experimental study comparing the proposed algorithm with established methods. The algorithm shows superior reconstruction quality compared to the established CTF-based method at similar computational cost. Our analysis provides a deeper fundamental understanding of the homogeneous object assumption and the proposed algorithm will help improve the image quality for near-field holography in biomedical applications</description>

Abstract: On-chip optical isolators, functioning as unidirectional gates for light, play a crucial role in maintaining signal integrity, preventing laser destabilization, and fortifying the overall performance of optical systems. In this paper, we propose a five-layered heterostructure consisting of a magneto-optic material sandwiched between parallel dielectric slab waveguides. Under TMOKE configuration, the coupled optical modes undergo an electromagnetic profile transformation that can be harnessed to confine the input mode in one waveguide during forward propagation and in the other during backward propagation. Together with radiative subwavelength gratings, such a system can provide a 20dB isolation ratio with negligible insertion losses.</description>

Abstract: We report a mathematical error and a misinterpretation in arXiv:2103.03263v4 [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)] that has led to a debate about the nature of the transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM) of spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs). The transverse OAM of STOVs evaluated theoretically in that Letter is actually only the intrinsic contribution, while the operators used to evaluate the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions are not Hermitian operators as they may lead to complex-valued expectation values.</description>

      <title>Metasurface spectrometers beyond resolution-sensitivity constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical spectroscopy plays an essential role across scientific research and industry for non-contact materials analysis1-3, increasingly through in-situ or portable platforms4-6. However, when considering low-light-level applications, conventional spectrometer designs necessitate a compromise between their resolution and sensitivity7,8, especially as device and detector dimensions are scaled down. Here, we report on a miniaturizable spectrometer platform where light throughput onto the detector is instead enhanced as the resolution is increased. This planar, CMOS-compatible platform is based around metasurface encoders designed to exhibit photonic bound states in the continuum9, where operational range can be altered or extended simply through adjusting geometric parameters. This system can enhance photon collection efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude versus conventional designs; we demonstrate this sensitivity advantage through ultra-low-intensity fluorescent and astrophotonic spectroscopy. This work represents a step forward for the practical utility of spectrometers, affording a route to integrated, chip-based devices that maintain high resolution and SNR without requiring prohibitively long integration times.</description>

      <title>Extracting double-quantum coherence in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy under pump-probe geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) can be implemented with different geometries, e.g., BOXCARS, collinear and pump-probe geometries. The pump-probe geometry has its advantage of overlapping only two beams and reducing phase cycling steps. However, its applications are typically limited to observe the dynamics with single-quantum coherence and population, leaving the challenge to measure the dynamics of the double-quantum (2Q) coherence, which reflects the many-body interactions. We propose an experimental technique in 2DES under pump-probe geometry with a designed pulse sequence and the signal processing method to extract 2Q coherence. In the designed pulse sequence with the probe pulse arriving earlier than pump pulses, our measured signal includes the 2Q signal as well as the zero-quantum (0Q) signal. With phase cycling and the data processing using causality enforcement, we extract the 2Q signal. The proposal is demonstrated with the rubidium atoms. And we observe the collective resonances of two-body dipole-dipole interactions of both $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ lines.</description>

      <title>Identifying gap-closings in open non-Hermitian systems by Biorthogonal Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate gap-closings in one- and two-dimensional tight-binding models with two bands, containing non-Hermitian hopping terms, and open boundary conditions (OBCs) imposed along one direction. We compare the bulk OBC spectra with the periodic boundary condition (PBC) spectra, pointing out that they do not coincide, which is an intrinsic characteristic of non-Hermitian systems. The non-Hermiticity, thus, results in the failure of the familiar notions of bulk-boundary correspondence found for Hermitian systems. This necessitates the search for topological invariants which can characterize gap-closings in open non-Hermitian systems correctly and unambiguously. We elucidate the behaviour of two possible candidates applicable for one-dimensional slices -- (1) the sum of winding numbers for the two bands defined on a generalized Brillouin zone and (2) the biorthogonal polarization (BP). While the former shows jumps/discontinuities for some of the non-Hermitian systems studied here, at points when an edge mode enters the bulk states and becomes delocalized, it does not maintain quantized values in a given topological phase. On the contrary, BP shows jumps at phase transitions, and takes the quantized value of one or zero, which corresponds to whether an actual edge mode exists or whether that mode is delocalized and absorbed within the bulk (not being an edge mode anymore).</description>

      <title>5.0 $\mu$m emitting Interband Cascade Lasers with Superlattice and Bulk AlGaAsSb Claddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comparison between interband cascade lasers (ICLs) with a 6-stage active region emitting at 5 $\mu$m with AlSb/InAs superlattice claddings and bulk Al_0.85 Ga_0.15 As_0.07 Sb_0.93 claddings. Utilizing bulk AlGaAsSb claddings with its lower refractive index compared to the mostly used AlSb/InAs superlattice claddings, the mode-confinement in the active region increases by 14.4% resulting in an improvement of the lasing threshold current density. For broad area laser and under pulsed excitation, the ICL with AlGaAsSb claddings shows a lower threshold current density of J_th=396 A/cm$^2$ compared to J_th=521 A/cm$^2$ for the reference ICL with superlattice claddings. Additionally, a higher characteristic temperature was obtained for the ICL with bulk claddings. A measured pulsed operation is observed up to 65 C.</description>
