      <title>Floating Anchor Diffusion Model for Multi-motif Scaffolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motif scaffolding seeks to design scaffold structures for constructing proteins with functions derived from the desired motif, which is crucial for the design of vaccines and enzymes. Previous works approach the problem by inpainting or conditional generation. Both of them can only scaffold motifs with fixed positions, and the conditional generation cannot guarantee the presence of motifs. However, prior knowledge of the relative motif positions in a protein is not readily available, and constructing a protein with multiple functions in one protein is more general and significant because of the synergies between functions. We propose a Floating Anchor Diffusion (FADiff) model. FADiff allows motifs to float rigidly and independently in the process of diffusion, which guarantees the presence of motifs and automates the motif position design. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of FADiff with high success rates and designable novel scaffolds. To the best of our knowledge, FADiff is the first work to tackle the challenge of scaffolding multiple motifs without relying on the expertise of relative motif positions in the protein. Code is available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/FADiff.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistency Training for Density-Functional-Theory Hamiltonian Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the mean-field Hamiltonian matrix in density functional theory is a fundamental formulation to leverage machine learning for solving molecular science problems. Yet, its applicability is limited by insufficient labeled data for training. In this work, we highlight that Hamiltonian prediction possesses a self-consistency principle, based on which we propose self-consistency training, an exact training method that does not require labeled data. It distinguishes the task from predicting other molecular properties by the following benefits: (1) it enables the model to be trained on a large amount of unlabeled data, hence addresses the data scarcity challenge and enhances generalization; (2) it is more efficient than running DFT to generate labels for supervised training, since it amortizes DFT calculation over a set of queries. We empirically demonstrate the better generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution scenarios, and the better efficiency over DFT labeling. These benefits push forward the applicability of Hamiltonian prediction to an ever-larger scale.</description>
