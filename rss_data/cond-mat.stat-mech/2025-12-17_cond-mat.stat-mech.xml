      <title>Conservation laws and chaos propagation in a non-reciprocal classical magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a nonreciprocal generalization [EPL 60, 418 (2002)] of the classical Heisenberg spin chain, in which the exchange coupling is nonsymmetric, and show that it displays a ballistic spreading of chaos as measured by the decorrelator. We show that the interactions are reciprocal in terms of transformed variables, with conserved quantities that can be identified as magnetization and energy, with a Poisson-bracket algebra and Hamiltonian dynamics. For strictly antisymmetric couplings in the original model the conserved quantities diffuse, the decorrelator spreads symmetrically, and a simple hydrodynamic theory emerges. The general case in which the interaction has symmetric and antisymmetric parts presents complexities in the limit of large scales. Ballistic propagation of chaos survives the inclusion of interactions beyond nearest neighbours, but the conservation laws in general do not.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group for spectral collapse in random matrices with power-law variance profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a renormalization group (RG) approach to compare and collapse eigenvalue densities of random matrix models of complex systems across different system sizes. The approach is to fix a natural spectral scale by letting the model normalization run with size, turning raw spectra into comparable, collapsed density curves. We demonstrate this approach on generalizations of two classic random matrix ensembles--Wigner and Wishart--modified to have power-law variance profiles. We use random matrix theory methods to derive self-consistent fixed-point equations for the resolvent to compute their eigenvalue densities, we define an RG scheme based on matrix decimation, and compute the Beta function controlling the RG flow as a function of the variance profile power-law exponent. The running normalization leads to spectral collapse which we confirm in simulations and solutions of the fixed-point equations. We expect this RG approach to carry over to other ensembles, providing a method for data analysis of a broad range of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis, Laning, and Negative Drag in Binary Systems with Opposite and Perpendicular Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a binary system of particles with repulsive interactions that move in opposite or perpendicular directions to each other under an applied external drive. For opposite driving, at higher drives a phase-separated laned state forms that has strong hysteresis in the velocity-force curve and the fraction of topological defects as the drive is cycled up and down from zero. The amount of hysteresis depends on the drive value at which the drive changes from increasing to decreasing. For perpendicular driving, we find a jammed state that transitions into a disordered state or a tilted lane state, both of which also show strong hysteresis effects. Additionally, a negative drag effect can appear in which one species moves in the direction opposite to the other species due to a tilting of the lanes by the perpendicular drive. When a constant drive is applied along one direction while the drive in the perpendicular direction is increased, we observe a series of drops and jumps in the velocity as the system forms locked and tilted laned states. For weakly interacting particles, the jammed system can show co-tilted stripe-forming states.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Non-Markovian History Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Markovian stochastic processes are ubiquitous in biology. Nevertheless, we lack a general framework for quantifying historical dependencies. In this Letter, we propose an information-theoretic approach to decompose history dependence in systems with non-Markovian dynamics, quantifying the information encoded in dependencies of each order. In minimal models of non-Markovian dynamics, we show that this framework correctly captures the underlying historical dependencies, even when autocorrelations do not. In prolonged recordings of fly behavior, we find that the scaling of non-Markovian dependencies is invariant across timescales from fractions of a second to minutes. Despite this invariance, the overall amount of non-Markovian information is non-monotonic, suggesting a unique timescale on which historical dependencies are strongest.</description>

      <title>Tractable Model for Tunable Non-Markovian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Markovian dynamics are ubiquitous across physics, biology, and engineering. Yet our understanding of non-Markovian processes significantly lags that of simpler Markovian processes, due largely to a lack of tractable models. In this article, we present a minimal model of non-Markovian dynamics in which the current state copies past states with arbitrary history dependence. We show that many properties of this process can be studied analytically, providing insight into the relationships between history dependence, autocorrelations, and information-theoretic metrics like entropy and dynamical information. Strikingly, we find that autocorrelations can fail, even qualitatively, to capture the underlying dependencies. Ultimately, this model serves as a tractable sandbox for exploring non-Markovian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Age-structured hydrodynamics of ensembles of anomalously diffusing particles with renewal resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an age-structured hydrodynamic (HD) theory which describes the collective behavior of $N\gg 1$ anomalously diffusing particles under stochastic renewal resetting. The theory treats the age of a particle -- the time since its last reset -- as an explicit dynamical variable and allows for resetting rules which introduce global inter-particle correlations. The anomalous diffusion is modeled by the scaled Brownian motion (sBm): a Gaussian process with independent increments, characterized by a power-law time dependence of the diffusion coefficient, $D(t)\sim t^{2H-1}$, where $H&gt;0$. We apply this theory to three different resetting protocols: independent resetting to the origin (model~A), resetting to the origin of the particle farthest from it (model~B), and a scaled-diffusion extension of the ``Brownian bees" model of Berestycki et al, Ann. Probab. \textbf{50}, 2133 (2022). In all these models non-equilibrium steady states are reached at long times, and we determine the steady-state densities. For model A the (normalized to unity) steady-state density coincides with the steady-state probability density of a single particle undergoing sBM with resetting to the origin. For model B, and for the scaled Brownian bees, the HD steady-state densities are markedly different: in particular, they have compact supports for all $H&gt;0$. The age-structured HD formalism can be extended to other anomalous diffusion processes with renewal resetting protocols which introduce global inter-particle correlations.</description>

      <title>50 years of Yukhnovskii's critical point theory: its place in the constant flow of theoretical physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Half a century ago, Ihor Yukhnovskii elaborated a method of studying the critical point of the three-dimensional Ising model based on a layer-by-layer integration in the space of collective variables. His method was an alternative to that based on the $\varepsilon$-expansion for which K. G. Wilson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1982. However, Yukhnovskii's technique, which yielded similar results, provided even deeper insight into the nature of this phenomenon. At that time, we, professor's students, saw only this aspect of his theory. Later, I realized that the mentioned Yukhnovskii's work naturally fits into a more general context of the turbulent development of quantum field theory and statistical physics in the last quarter of the twentieth century. The aim of the present article is to look at the main aspects and the impact of Yukhnovskii's theory from this perspective.</description>

      <title>Impact of Information on Quantum Heat Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging field of quantum thermodynamics is beginning to reveal the intriguing role that information can play in quantum thermal engines. Information enters as a resource when considering feedback-controlled thermal machines. While both a general theory of quantum feedback control as well as specific examples of quantum feedback-controlled engines have been presented, still lacking is a general framework for such machines. Here, we present a framework for a generic, two-stroke quantum heat engine interacting with $N$ thermal baths and Maxwell's demon. The demon performs projective measurements on the engine working substance, the outcome of which is recorded in a classical memory, embedded in its own thermal bath. To perform feedback control, the demon enacts unitary operations on the working substance, conditioned on the recorded outcome. By considering the compound machine-memory as a hybrid (classical-quantum) standard thermal machine interacting with $N+1$ thermal baths, our framework puts the working substance and memory on equal footing, thereby enabling a comprehensible resolution to Maxwell's paradox. We illustrate the application of our framework with a two-qubit engine. A remarkable observation is that more information does not necessarily result in better thermodynamic performance: sometimes knowing less is better.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian Density Matrices from Time-like Entanglement and Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extensively explore the connections between time-like entanglement and non-hermitian density matrices in quantum many-body systems. We classify setups where we encounter non-hermitian density matrices into two types: one is due to causal influences under unitary evolutions, and the other is due to non-unitary evolutions in non-hermitian systems. We provide various examples of these setups including interacting harmonic oscillators, two dimensional conformal field theories and holographic dualities. In them, we compute the time-like entanglement entropy and imagitivity, which measures how much density matrices are non-hermitian. In both two classes, typical holographic examples are given by traversable AdS wormholes. We explain how causal influences in a wormhole dual to a pair of non-hermitian quantum systems is possible even without interactions between them. We argue that to realize a traversable wormhole we need not only ordinary quantum entanglement but also time-like entanglement.</description>

      <title>Universal Statistics of Measurement-Induced Entanglement in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistics of measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) after partial measurement on a class of one-dimensional quantum critical states described by Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids at low energies. Using a replica trick to average over measurement outcomes in the charge basis and tools from conformal field theory (CFT), we derive closed-form expressions for the cumulants of MIE. We show that exact Born-averaging over microscopic measurement outcomes becomes equivalent at low energy to averaging over conformal boundary conditions weighted by their corresponding partition functions. Our results yield distinctive critical behavior across all cumulants in the regime where the unmeasured parts of the system are maximally separated. We also obtain the full distribution of the post-measurement entanglement entropy, finding that it is generically bimodal and exhibits fat-tails. We corroborate our analytical predictions by numerical calculations and find good agreement between them.</description>

      <title>Dropout Neural Network Training Viewed from a Percolation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the existence and effect of percolation in training deep Neural Networks (NNs) with dropout. Dropout methods are regularisation techniques for training NNs, first introduced by G. Hinton et al. (2012). These methods temporarily remove connections in the NN, randomly at each stage of training, and update the remaining subnetwork with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The process of removing connections from a network at random is similar to percolation, a paradigm model of statistical physics.
  If dropout were to remove enough connections such that there is no path between the input and output of the NN, then the NN could not make predictions informed by the data. We study new percolation models that mimic dropout in NNs and characterise the relationship between network topology and this path problem. The theory shows the existence of a percolative effect in dropout. We also show that this percolative effect can cause a breakdown when training NNs without biases with dropout; and we argue heuristically that this breakdown extends to NNs with biases.</description>

      <title>Neuromodulation-inspired gated associative memory networks:extended memory retrieval and emergent multistability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical autoassociative memory models have been central to understanding emergent computations in recurrent neural circuits across diverse biological contexts. However, they typically neglect neuromodulatory agents that are known to strongly shape memory capacity and stability. Here we introduce a minimal, biophysically motivated associative memory network where neuropeptide-like signals are modeled by a self-adaptive, activity-dependent gating mechanism. Using many-body simulations and dynamical mean-field theory, we show that such gating fundamentally reorganizes the attractor structure: the network bypasses the classical spin-glass transition, maintaining robust, high-overlap retrieval far beyond the standard critical capacity, without shrinking basins of attraction. Mechanistically, the gate stabilizes transient ghost remnants of stored patterns even far above the Hopfield limit, converting them into multistable attractors. These results demonstrate that neuromodulation-like gating alone can dramatically enhance associative memory capacity, eliminate the sharp Hopfield-style catastrophic breakdown, and reshape the memory landscape, providing a simple, general route to richer memory dynamics and computational capabilities in neuromodulated circuits and neuromorphic architectures.</description>

      <title>Capturing reduced-order quantum many-body dynamics out of equilibrium via neural ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems exhibit rapid correlation buildup that underlies many emerging phenomena. Exact wave-function methods to describe this scale exponentially with particle number; simpler mean-field approaches neglect essential two-particle correlations. The time-dependent two-particle reduced density matrix (TD2RDM) formalism offers a middle ground by propagating the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM) and closing the BBGKY hierarchy with a reconstruction of the three-particle cumulant. But the validity and existence of time-local reconstruction functionals ignoring memory effects remain unclear across different dynamical regimes. We show that a neural ODE model trained on exact 2RDM data (no dimensionality reduction) can reproduce its dynamics without any explicit three-particle information -- but only in parameter regions where the Pearson correlation between the two- and three-particle cumulants is large. In the anti-correlated or uncorrelated regime, the neural ODE fails, indicating that no simple time-local functional of the instantaneous two-particle cumulant can capture the evolution. The magnitude of the time-averaged three-particle-correlation buildup appears to be the primary predictor of success: For a moderate correlation buildup, both neural ODE predictions and existing TD2RDM reconstructions are accurate, whereas stronger values lead to systematic breakdowns. These findings pinpoint the need for memory-dependent kernels in the three-particle cumulant reconstruction for the latter regime. Our results place the neural ODE as a model-agnostic diagnostic tool that maps the regime of applicability of cumulant expansion methods and guides the development of non-local closure schemes. More broadly, the ability to learn high-dimensional RDM dynamics from limited data opens a pathway to fast, data-driven simulation of correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Electrified EHL line contact with dielectric breakdown of lubricant -- a numerical model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of the electric vehicles with drive systems with higher voltages, power outputs, frequencies, and speeds, mitigating electrically induced bearing damage (EIBD) in electric motors has become critical. In this study, a novel numerical model characterizing discharge-induced current density and voltage drop at the elastohydrodynamic lubrication line contact interface is presented. The current density and voltage drop constitute a linear complimentarily problem, which is efficiently solved using the conjugate gradient method. This paper sheds light on electrical characteristics at the inaccessible lubrication interface during discharge, highlighting the significance of roughness radius of curvature on current density. This numerical model lays the groundwork for future research on mitigating or even permanently solving EIBD problems in electric motor bearings.</description>

      <title>Improved diffusive approximation of Markov jump processes close to equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusive approximations of Markov jump processes often fail to accurately capture large fluctuations. This is confounding, as the rare events triggered by these large fluctuations, such as the failure of electronic memories, are often the object of interest. In this paper we present an improved diffusive approximation, extending a method previously limited to equilibrium systems. Using new tools from stochastic thermodynamics, we prove its validity to linear order in departures from equilibrium and demonstrate its superior accuracy over the Kramers-Moyal expansion in predicting both steady-state and transient properties, including the error rate of a non-equilibrium electronic memory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a macroscopic theory of capillary condensation in slits formed by parallel walls of unequal length. Using the concept of an edge contact angle, we identify four distinct condensation states and derive Kelvin-like relations for their onset. The resulting phase diagrams, expressed in terms of wall geometry and contact angle, reveal two central organizing features: a geometric separatrix that divides distinct condensation regimes, and the wedge-filling threshold at $\theta=\pi/4$, which separates a rich four-state scenario from a simpler two-state one. These results demonstrate how geometry dictates the onset and suppression of condensation in confined systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate complete wetting and drying at sinusoidally corrugated solid walls, focusing on the effects of wall geometry and interaction range. Two distinct interaction models are considered: one incorporating only short-ranged (SR) forces (applied to drying), and another including long-ranged (LR) van der Waals interactions (applied to wetting). The SR model is analyzed within the framework of nonlocal Hamiltonian theory by Parry et al., while the LR model is treated using a sharp-kink approximation. In both cases, we derive scaling relations that describe the dependence of the adsorbed layer's width and morphology on the wall's geometric parameters as the system approaches two-phase coexistence. We identify distinct scaling regimes determined by the degree of wall corrugation and highlight the contrasting effects of SR and LR interactions. Theoretical predictions are corroborated by numerical results from classical density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Interactions between droplets in immiscible liquid suspensions and the influence of surfactants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general method for determining the effective interaction potential between two or more droplets suspended within a fluid phase. Our approach is based on classical density functional theory. Here, we apply the method to determine the interaction potential between oil droplets suspended in water and also consider the influence of adding a third species, alcohol. This ternary mixture is that found in the ouzo beverage. The ouzo system exhibits spontaneous emulsification when the neat spirit is mixed with water. The oil emulsion that forms has been observed to be surprisingly long-lived. Here we show that the alcohol in the system does indeed play a role in making the droplets more stable, by decreasing the oil-water interfacial tension and therefore also the strength of the attractive interactions between droplets. Within our theory, the surfactant nature of the alcohol can be enhanced without changing the bulk fluid thermodynamics. In fact, our theory can be used to model surfactant mixtures. In this model, the effective interaction between pairs of oil droplets can become repulsive, with a free-energy barrier to droplets merging, thus making them stable.</description>

      <title>Reading Qubits with Sequential Weak Measurements: Limits of Information Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information processing and computation requires high accuracy qubit configuration readout. In many practical schemes, the initial qubit configuration has to be inferred from readout that is a time-dependent weak measurement record. However, a combination of the measurement scheme and intrinsic dynamics can end up scrambling the initial state and lose information irretrievably. Here, we study the information physics of quantum trajectories based on weak measurements in order to address the optimal achievable performance in qubit configuration readout for two realistic models of single qubit readout: (i) Model I is informationally complete, but without intrinsic dynamics; (ii) Model II is informationally incomplete weak measurements with intrinsic dynamics. We first use mutual information to characterize how much intrinsic information about the initial state is encoded in the measurement record. Using a fixed discrete time-step formulation, we compute the mutual information while varying the measurement strength, duration of measurement record, and the relative strength of intrinsic dynamics in our measurement schemes. We also exploit the emergence of continuum scaling and the Stochastic Master Equation in the weak measurement limit. We develop an asymptotic expansion in the measurement efficiency parameter to calculate mutual information, which captures qualitative and quantitative features of the numerical data. The bounds on information extraction are manifested as plateaux in mutual information, our analysis obtains these bounds and also optimal duration of measurement required to saturate them. Our results should be useful both for quantum device operation and optimization and also, possibly, for improving the performance of recent machine learning approaches for qubit and multiqubit configuration readout in current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) experiment regimes.</description>

      <title>The Basins of Attraction of Soft Sphere Packings Are Not Fractal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy landscape picture is a central tool to study many-body systems. In particular, the energy landscapes of glass-forming liquids, jammed packings, constraint satisfaction problems, or neural networks contain a plethora of minima corresponding to competing states. Due to their complexity, these landscapes resist analytical treatment and must be studied numerically. We focus on jammed soft spheres, a paradigmatic model of glasses and granulars, to expose the limitations of standard numerical methods in resolving the true structure of energy landscapes. We show that CVODE is the ODE solver with the best time-for-error trade-off, outperforming commonly used steepest-descent solvers by several orders of magnitude. Using this numerical approach, we provide unequivocal evidence that optimizers widely used in computational studies destroy all semblance of the true landscape geometry, even in moderately low dimensions. Employing a range of geometric indicators, both low- and high-dimensional, we show that earlier claims on the fractality of basins of attraction of minima originated from the use of inadequate mapping strategies. In reality, the basins of attraction of soft sphere packings are smooth structures with well-defined length scales, a result that likely extends to a much broader family of problems.</description>

      <title>Counting observables in stochastic excursions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding fluctuations of observables across stochastic trajectories is essential for various fields of research, from quantum thermal machines to biological motors. We introduce a framework to analyze the statistics of counting observables in sub-trajectories$-$dubbed as stochastic excursions$-$of processes out of equilibrium. Given a partition of the state space into two sets $A$ and $B$, an excursion is defined as the segment of the trajectory that starts with a transition from $A$ to $B$ and ends upon the first return from $B$ to $A$. Our approach offers analytical expressions for the full distribution of counting observables (such as currents, heat, work, entropy production, and dynamical activity) and the excursion duration, capturing their correlations and finite-time fluctuations. As our main result, we uncover a nontrivial fundamental relation between fluctuations of counting observables at the single-excursion level and the steady state noise obtained from full counting statistics, offering a tool to inspect noise sources. We also show the existence of a fluctuation theorem and a thermodynamic uncertainty relation at the level of individual excursions. We discuss examples from distinct fields in which the excursion framework naturally addresses relevant questions, and explore in more detail how analyzing excursions yields additional insights into the operation of the three-qubit absorption refrigerator.</description>

      <title>A framework for fluctuating times and counting observables in stochastic excursions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many natural systems exhibit dynamics characterized by alternating phases or recurring sets of states. Describing the fluctuations of such systems over stochastic trajectories is necessary across diverse fields, from biological motors to quantum thermal machines. In an accompanying Letter, we introduced the notion of stochastic excursions$-$a framework to analyze out of equilibrium processes via sub-trajectories. Through counting observables, this framework captures finite-time fluctuations and trajectory-level behavior, which provides insights into thermodynamical trade-offs between thermodynamic quantities of interest, such as entropy production and dynamical activity. In this work, we enhance this formalism by providing a suite of technical results on how to efficiently compute excursion-related quantities. Our analytical results provide explicit formulas for general moments of counting variables and excursion duration, as well as their covariance and conditional moments. We show that excursion statistics recover full counting statistics results, and uncover a relation between fluctuations of counting observables at single-excursion level and the steady state diffusion coefficient (noise). We also discuss a fluctuation theorem for individual excursions and show that it implies a modified thermodynamic uncertainty relation at the excursion level. In addition, we explore how analyzing excursions and using the results developed here can yield insights into three problems of interest: the three-qubit absorption refrigerator, cellular sensing, and birth-and-death processes.</description>

      <title>Emergent Viscous Hydrodynamics From a Single Quantum Particle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an explicit example of how spatial decoherence can lead to hydrodynamic behavior in the late-time, long-wavelength regime of open quantum systems. We focus on the case of a single non-relativistic quantum particle linearly coupled to a thermal bath of noninteracting harmonic oscillators at temperature $T$, a la Caldeira and Leggett. Taking advantage of decoherence in the position representation, we expand the reduced density matrix in powers of the off-diagonal spatial components, so that high-order terms are suppressed at late times. Truncating the resulting power series at second order leads to a set of dissipative transient hydrodynamic equations similar to the non-relativistic limit of equations widely used in simulations of the quark-gluon plasma formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Transport coefficients are directly determined by the damping constant $\gamma$, which quantifies the influence of the environment. The asymptotic limit of our hydrodynamic equations reduces to the celebrated Navier-Stokes equations for a compressible fluid in the presence of a drag force. Our results shed new light on the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in open quantum systems where a system with few degrees of freedom is coupled to a large thermal environment.</description>

      <title>Flocking with random non-reciprocal interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flocking is ubiquitous in nature and emerges due to short- or long-range alignment interactions among self-propelled agents. Two unfriendly species that antialign or even interact nonreciprocally show more complex collective phenomena, ranging from parallel and antiparallel flocking over run-and-chase behavior to chiral phases. Whether flocking or any of these collective phenomena can survive in the presence of a large number of species with random nonreciprocal interactions remained elusive so far. As a first step here, the extreme case of a Vicsek-like model with fully random nonreciprocal interactions between the individual particles is considered. For infinite-range interaction, as soon as the alignment bias is of the same order as the random interactions, the ordered flocking phase occurs, but deep within this phase, the random nonreciprocal interactions can still support global chiral and oscillating states in which the collective movement direction rotates or oscillates slowly. For short-range interactions, moreover, even without alignment bias self-organized cliques emerge, in which medium-size clusters of particles that have predominantly aligning interactions meet accidentally and stay together for macroscopic times. These results may serve as a starting point for the study of multispecies flocking models with nonrandom but complex nonreciprocal interspecies interactions.</description>

Abstract: Driving a quantum system out of equilibrium while preserving its subtle quantum mechanical correlations on large scales presents a major challenge, both fundamentally and for technological applications. At its core, this challenge is pinpointed by the question of how quantum effects can persist at asymptotic scales, analogous to quantum critical points in equilibrium. In this work, we construct such a scenario using fermions as building blocks. These fermions undergo an absorbing-to-absorbing state transition between two topologically distinct and quantum-correlated dark states. Starting from a microscopic, interacting Lindbladian, we derive an effective Lindblad-Keldysh field theory in which critical fermions couple to a bosonic bath with hydrodynamic fluctuations associated with particle number conservation. A key feature of this field theory is an emergent symmetry that protects the purity of the fermions' state even in the presence of the thermal bath. We quantitatively characterise the critical point using a leading-order expansion around the upper critical dimension, thereby establishing the first non-equilibrium universality class of fermions. The symmetry protection mechanism, which exhibits parallels to the problem of directed percolation, suggests a pathway toward a broader class of robust, universal quantum phenomena in fermionic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations of coordinated self-organisation (SO) of stress and structure in granular systems provide insight into the fundamental principle underlying this phenomenon. It is first argued here that SO emerges when a minute subset of configurations are significantly more stable than the rest and therefore survive the noise in the system much longer to be observed. This principle goes deeper than recently proposed energy considerations. Guided by this principle, a statistical mechanics model is formulated then for SO in these systems and its extension to three dimensions is outlined. The principle holds beyond granular systems and the model is extended next to describe emergence of SO in more general systems. The application of the model is illustrated for the specific example of laning. Parallels of the modelling approach to traditional statistical mechanics provide useful insight that should assist in modelling SO in other out-of-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20338v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stochastic dynamics of point defects in a two-dimensional hexagonal colloidal crystal. Using a stochastic dynamical framework (evolution mechanics), we first extract the position-dependent drift vector and diffusion matrix from experimental trajectories, revealing dynamics that go beyond simple diffusion with constant coefficients. We then reconstruct a stochastic potential landscape by applying a periodic constraint and an equilibrium approximation within this framework. The energy differences between local minima in this landscape agree in order of magnitude with prior experimental estimates. Furthermore, analysis of the fit residuals under the equilibrium approximation provides evidence of nonequilibrium dynamics in di-vacancies. This work demonstrates how time-series analysis combined with this theoretical framework can uncover effective energy landscapes and assess detailed-balance violation in defect motion, providing a general approach for studying complex dynamics in confined systems.</description>

In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Anyon-Otto thermal machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a four-stroke quantum thermal machine based on the 1D anyon Hubbard model, which is capable of extracting the excess energy arising from anyon exclusion statistics at low temperature into finite work. Defining a hybrid anyon-Otto (HAO) cycle, we find that the low-temperature work, in the absence of any interactions, is maximized in the pseudo-fermionic limit, where the anyons most closely resemble free fermions. However, when weak interactions are introduced, the work output is no longer maximized at the bosonic or pseudo-fermionic extremes but instead peaks at intermediate statistical angles. This clearly demonstrates that interactions and anyonic statistics conspire non-trivially to enhance performance, with interacting anyons offering greater quantum thermodynamic advantage than either bosons or pseudo-fermions, in this regime. Furthermore, we also outline an experimental protocol to realize the HAO cycle using ultracold atoms in an optical lattice.</description>

      <title>Universal Supercritical Behavior in Global Monopole-Charged AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically investigate the Widom line and universal supercritical crossover for charged AdS black holes threaded by a global monopole. We compute thermodynamic variables in both the extended and canonical ensembles. We derive the scaled variance $\Omega$ using the Gibbs free energy and locate the Widom line as the extrema of this. Using mean-field expansion of the equation of state near criticality, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Widom line and the two branching crossover lines $L^\pm$. We show that the monopole parameter shifts the critical parameters but does not change the mean-field universal scaling: the leading linear term and the nonanalytic correction remain universal in both ensembles. We also verify this with numerical computation and show the Widom line and the two branching crossover lines $L^\pm$.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal pairing glue of electrons in the steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of mechanisms for enhancing superconductivity has been a central topic in condensed matter physics due to the combination of fundamental and technological interests. One promising route is to exploit non-equilibrium effects in the steady state. Efforts in this direction have so far focused on enhancing the pairing mechanism known from thermal equilibrium through modified distributions for the electrons or the bosons mediating the electron-electron interaction. In this work, we identify an additional pairing mechanism that is active only outside thermal equilibrium. By generalizing Eliashberg theory to non-equilibrium steady states using the Keldysh formalism, we derive a set of Eliashberg equations that capture the effect of this genuinely non-thermal pairing glue even in the weak-coupling regime. We discuss two examples where this mechanism has a major impact. First, in a temperature-bias setup, we find that superconductivity is enhanced when the boson mediator is colder than the electrons. Second, we find that an incoherent drive of the boson mediator at energies much greater than the temperature pushes the system far from thermal equilibrium but leaves the critical coupling essentially unchanged, owing to a competition between electron heating and the enhancement of pairing by the non-thermal glue.</description>
