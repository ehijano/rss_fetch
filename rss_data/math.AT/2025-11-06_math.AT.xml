      <title>Simplicial Homology Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This expository article presents a self-contained introduction to simplicial homology for finite simplicial complexes, emphasizing concrete computation and geometric intuition. Beginning with orientations of simplices and the construction of free abelian chain groups, the boundary operators are defined via the alternating-sum formula and shown to satisfy the chain-complex identity that the boundary of a boundary vanishes. Cycles and boundaries are then developed as kernels and images of the boundary maps, leading to homology groups that capture connected components, independent loops, and higher-dimensional voids. Throughout, detailed low-dimensional examples and step-by-step matrix calculations illustrate how to form boundary matrices, compute kernels and images, and identify generators and relations in \(H_p\). The presentation highlights universal properties of chain groups, clarifies sign conventions and induced orientations, and demonstrates the invariance of homology under combinatorial refinements, thereby connecting geometric features of spaces to computable algebraic invariants.</description>

      <title>Every group retraction can be realized as a topological retraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a group retraction $r: G \rightarrow H $, we construct a finite topological space $ X_r $ of height 1, together with a topological retraction $\overline{r}: X_r \rightarrow X_r $, such that the group of automorphisms $ \mathrm{Aut}(X_r) $ (or the group of self-homotopy equivalences $ \mathcal{E}(X_r) $) of $X_r$ is isomorphic to $ G $, and $ \mathrm{Aut}(\overline{r}(X_r)) $ (or $\mathcal{E}(\overline{r}(X_r)) $) is isomorphic to $ H$. Moreover, there is a natural map $\overline{r}' : \mathrm{Aut}(X_r) \rightarrow \mathrm{Aut}(\overline{r}(X_r)) $ that coincides with the original group retraction $ r $. As a direct consequence of this construction, we show that height 1 is the minimal height required to realize any finite group as the group of automorphisms (or the group of self-homotopy equivalences) of a finite topological space, except in the case where $ G $ is a symmetric group. In that unique case, the group can be realized by a finite topological space of height 0.</description>

      <title>Parallel computation of interval bases for persistence module decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.11884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A persistence module $M$, with coefficients in a field $\mathbb{F}$, is a finite-dimensional linear representation of an equioriented quiver of type $A_n$ or, equivalently, a graded module over the ring of polynomials $\mathbb{F}[x]$. It is well-known that $M$ can be written as the direct sum of indecomposable representations or as the direct sum of cyclic submodules generated by homogeneous elements. An interval basis for $M$ is a set of homogeneous elements of $M$ such that the sum of the cyclic submodules of $M$ generated by them is direct and equal to $M$. We introduce a novel algorithm to compute an interval basis for $M$. Based on a flag of kernels of the structure maps, our algorithm is suitable for parallel or distributed computation and does not rely on a presentation of $M$. This algorithm outperforms the approach via the presentation matrix and Smith Normal Form. We specialize our parallel approach to persistent homology modules, and we close by applying the proposed algorithm to tracking harmonics via Hodge decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the particular profinite completion used by Boavida-Horel-Robertson in their study of the Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller group fits in the framework of profinite completion as a left Quillen functor. More precisely, we construct a model category of profinite up-to-homotopy operads based on dendroidal objects in Quick's model category of profinite spaces and show that the construction of Boavida-Horel-Robertson extends to a left Quillen functor into this model category. We also characterize the underlying $\infty$-category of this model category and obtain a Dwyer-Kan style characterization of the weak equivalences between such profinite up-to-homotopy operads. Since this model category of profinite up-to-homotopy operads is Quillen equivalent to the one considered in our earlier paper "Profinite $\infty$-operads", we obtain analogous results in that setting.</description>

      <title>Reflexive homology and involutive Hochschild homology as equivariant Loday constructions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20082v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For associative rings with anti-involution several homology theories exists, for instance reflexive homology as studied by Graves and involutive Hochschild homology defined by Fern\`andez-Val\`encia and Giansiracusa. We prove that the corresponding homology groups can be identified with the homotopy groups of an equivariant Loday construction of the one-point compactification of the sign-representation evaluated at the trivial orbit, if we assume that $2$ is invertible and if the underlying abelian group of the ring is flat. We also show a relative version where we consider an associative $k$-algebra with an anti-involution where $k$ is an arbitrary ground ring.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Hausdorff Distance for Directed Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gromov-Hausdorff distance measures the similarity between two metric spaces by isometrically embedding them into an ambient metric space. We introduce an analogue of this distance for metric spaces endowed with directed structures. The directed Gromov-Hausdorff distance measures the distance between two extended metric spaces, where the new metric, defined on the same underlying space, is induced by the length of zigzag paths. This distance is then computed by isometrically embedding the directed metric spaces into an ambient directed space equipped with the zigzag distance. Analogously to the classical Gromov-Hausdorff distance, we also propose alternative formulations based on the distortion of d-maps and d-correspondences. However, unlike the classical case, these directed distances are not equivalent.</description>

      <title>New aspects of quantum topological data analysis: Betti number estimation, and testing and tracking of homology and cohomology classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new quantum algorithms for estimating homological invariants, specifically Betti and persistent Betti numbers, of a simplicial complex given through structured classical data. Our approach efficiently constructs block-encodings of (persistent) Laplacians, enabling estimation via stochastic rank methods with complexity polylogarithmic in the number of simplices across both sparse and dense regimes.
  Unlike prior spectral algorithms that suffer when Betti numbers are small, we introduce homology tracking and property testing techniques achieving exponential speedups under natural sparsity and structure assumptions. We also formulate homology triviality and equivalence testing as property testing problems, giving nearly linear-time quantum algorithms when the boundary rank is large. A cohomological formulation further yields rank-independent testing and polylog-time manipulation of $r$-cocycles via block-encoded projections. These results open a new direction in quantum topological data analysis and demonstrate provable quantum advantages in computing topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Flat connections at infinity on knot surgery manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\rm SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory on a closed 3-manifold is one of the most interesting, yet tractable examples of a QFT. On one hand, its non-perturbative structure is not yet fully understood; on the other, the mathematical structure turns out to be very rich. In this work we explore the new phenomenon of flat connections at infinity on various knot surgery manifolds. Such flat connections can be understood as asymptotic ends in the non-compact moduli space of flat $\rm SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ connections. We focus on the examples of $\pm 1/r$-surgeries on torus, twist and some double twist knot complements in $S^3$. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that flat connections at infinity are abundant even for simple low-crossing knot surgeries. We therefore believe that their presence would shed light on the resurgent nature of the path integral.</description>

      <title>Comparison of motives with rational coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17194v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of rational motives admits several models, including those of Morel, Beilinson, Ayoub, and Voevodsky. An open question has been the equivalence of Voevodsky's Nisnevich-based $\mathrm{DM}(S, \mathbb{Q})$ with the others, which was only known over excellent and geometrically unibranch base schemes.
  In this paper, we prove that modules over rational motivic Eilenberg Maclane spectrum $\mathbf{H}\mathbb{Q}$ is equivalent to Morel/Beilinson/Ayoub's rational motives over any Noetherian semi-normal base scheme $S$.
  Our main technical result is a stable motivic equivalence between the free $\mathbb{Q}$-linear spectrum $\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb{S}]$ and the motivic rational Eilenberg MacLane spectrum $\mathbf{H}\mathbb{Q}$. This equivalence is established by reducing the problem to an unstable comparison, where we apply our rational $\mathbb{A}^1$-Dold-Thom theorem, which depends on rational motivic Whitehead theorem that we develop.
  As a byproduct, we partially confirm that rational variant of Voevodsky's conjecture that the formation of $\mathbf{H}\mathbb{Q}$ is stable under base change between any Noetherian semi-normal schemes.</description>
