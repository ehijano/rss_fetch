      <title>Gain-Loss-Induced Bipolar Non-Hermitian Skin Effect With Purely Imaginary Eigenenergies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices characterized by $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric gain and loss, where the real-gap transforms into an imaginary-gap with increasing strength of gain/loss. The energy spectrum, under open boundary conditions, consists of real eigenenergies in the presence of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, and the corresponding eigenstates are bulk modes. As the gain/loss is increased, $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaks, leading to an increase in the proportion of imaginary eigenenergies and the appearance of bipolar Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Notably, the NHSE depending on the sign of their imaginary energy components. For Im$(E_{OBC})&gt;(&lt;)0$, the eigenstates localize at the right (left) boundary. These findings not only affirm the validity of our theoretical framework but also showcase the capability of engineered circuit systems to replicate intricate non-Hermitian phenomena. Our study unveils the unique characteristics of gain/loss-induced bipolar NHSE, shedding light on the exotic properties of non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Photonic Crystal Surface Emitting Lasers is a Sequence Modeling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic Crystal Surface Emitting Lasers (PCSEL)'s inverse design demands expert knowledge in physics, materials science, and quantum mechanics which is prohibitively labor-intensive. Advanced AI technologies, especially reinforcement learning (RL), have emerged as a powerful tool to augment and accelerate this inverse design process. By modeling the inverse design of PCSEL as a sequential decision-making problem, RL approaches can construct a satisfactory PCSEL structure from scratch. However, the data inefficiency resulting from online interactions with precise and expensive simulation environments impedes the broader applicability of RL approaches. Recently, sequential models, especially the Transformer architecture, have exhibited compelling performance in sequential decision-making problems due to their simplicity and scalability to large language models. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework named PCSEL Inverse Design Transformer (PiT) that abstracts the inverse design of PCSEL as a sequence modeling problem. The central part of our PiT is a Transformer-based structure that leverages the past trajectories and current states to predict the current actions. Compared with the traditional RL approaches, PiT can output the optimal actions and achieve target PCSEL designs by leveraging offline data and conditioning on the desired return. Results demonstrate that PiT achieves superior performance and data efficiency compared to baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: C.V. Raman (1888 - 1970) was a creative scientist, enthusiastic teacher and a science celebrity in India. In all these roles, he communicated science effectively. In this essay, I ask how and why did he communicate science. I take a few examples from his research writings and show his ability to explain science lucidly. By looking into his thoughts on teaching and those of his students, I explore Raman, the teacher. Finally, I discuss a few aspects of his methods to communicate science to the public. I emphasize his exposition and reveal a dichotomy.</description>

      <title>Closely piling up of multiple adhesive fronts in adhesive friction due to re-attachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand why the adhesive frictional force was in linear proportion to the real contact area in experiments, we investigate the adhesive friction generated by sliding elastic solids adhered to a rigid surface via multiple adhesive springs. Our results indicate that the shear-off force of the interface increases with the energetically guided re-attachment rate of adhesive springs, reaching saturation at high re-attachment rates. Remarkably, this shear-off force can surpass the predictions made by the fracture theory. By plotting the adhesive forces along the interface, we observe substantial high adhesive forces distributed throughout the interface, based on which we identify multiple adhesive fronts closely piling up along the interface. These regions can exhibit similar force profiles, and their number appears to increase with the size of the interface, leading to a linear increase in the calculated shear-off force with the size of the interface. We then suggest that multiple adhesive fronts closely pile up to back up each other in adhesive friction due to re-attachments, which may provide profound insights into understanding the observed phenomena associated with adhesive friction along an interface.</description>

      <title>Designing Leidenfrost drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Leidenfrost drops exhibit erratic bubble bursts to release vapor accumulated beneath the liquid, becoming amorphous and unstable. Here we report an original and remarkably simple method to stabilize and design a Leidenfrost puddle. When a thin hydrophilic layer with a suitable design is placed over the liquid, the puddle adopts the layer shape due to adhesive forces and becomes stable. We show a wide variety of designs obtained using this method. Moreover, we determine the required layer dimensions to stabilize puddles, the wetting and floating conditions, and a model for the evaporation rate of the designed drops. Finally, potential applications are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Experimental set-up for thermal measurements at the nanoscale using an SThM probe with niobium nitride thermometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) has become an important measurement tool for characterizing the thermal properties of materials at the nanometer scale. This technique requires a SThM probe that combines an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) probe and a very sensitive resistive thermometry; the thermometer being located at the apex of the probe tip allows the mapping of temperature or thermal properties of nanostructured materials with very high spatial resolution. The high interest of the SThM technique in the field of thermal nanoscience currently suffers from a low temperature sensitivity despite its high spatial resolution. To address this challenge, we developed a high vacuum-based AFM system hosting a highly sensitive niobium nitride (NbN) SThM probe to demonstrate its unique performance. As a proof of concept, we utilized this custom-built system to carry out thermal measurements using the 3$\omega$ method. By measuring the $V_{3\omega}$ voltage on the NbN resistive thermometer in vacuum conditions we were able to determine the SThM probe's thermal conductance and thermal time constant. The performance of the probe is demonstrated by doing thermal measurements in-contact with a sapphire sample.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization of a Graphene-On-Silicon Nitride Integrated Waveguide Dual-Mode Electro-Absorption Modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design, simulation and optimization of a graphene-on-silicon nitride (GOSiN) integrated waveguide dual-mode electro-absorption modulator operating with a speed between 21-84 GHz and an energy consumption below 6 pJ/bit. This device individually modulates the TE$_0$ and TE$_1$ modes in a one-arm dual-mode waveguide with modulation depths up to 678 dB/cm and 284 dB/cm, respectively. It has promising applications in Multimode Division Multiplexing (MDM) systems, where single-mode modulation induces high losses and costs. We have started from the design of GOSiN TE$_0$ and TE$_1$ passive low-loss mode filters. Then, applying a gate voltage to graphene, we have combined both filters and shown that the light absorption can be modulated to obtain four logical values in transmission: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) and (1,1). Our proposed devices can potentially boost the development of efficient MDM systems for ultra-fast on-chip interconnections.</description>

      <title>Efficient Light Propagation Algorithm using Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms can potentially overcome the boundary of computationally hard problems. One of the cornerstones in modern optics is the beam propagation algorithm, facilitating the calculation of how waves with a particular dispersion relation propagate in time and space. This algorithm solves the wave propagation equation by Fourier transformation, multiplication with a transfer function, and subsequent back transformation. This transfer function is determined from the respective dispersion relation, which can often be expanded as a polynomial. In the case of paraxial wave propagation in free space or picosecond pulse propagation, this expansion can be truncated after the quadratic term. The classical solution to the wave propagation requires $\mathcal{O}(N log N)$ computation steps, where $N$ is the number of points into which the wave function is discretized. Here, we show that the propagation can be performed as a quantum algorithm with $\mathcal{O}((log{}N)^2)$ single-controlled phase gates, indicating exponentially reduced computational complexity. We herein demonstrate this quantum beam propagation method (QBPM) and perform such propagation in both one- and two-dimensional systems for the double-slit experiment and Gaussian beam propagation. We highlight the importance of the selection of suitable observables to retain the quantum advantage in the face of the statistical nature of the quantum measurement process, which leads to sampling errors that do not exist in classical solutions.</description>

      <title>Unveiling microstructural damage for leakage current degradation in SiC Schottky diode after heavy ions irradiation under 200 V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-event burnout and single-event leakage current (SELC) in SiC power devices induced by heavy ions severely limit their space application, and the underlying mechanism is still unclear. One fundamental problem is lack of high-resolution characterization of radiation damage in the irradiated SiC power devices, which is a crucial indicator of the related mechanism. In this letter, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the radiation damage in the 1437.6 MeV 181Ta-irradiated SiC junction barrier Schottky diode under 200 V. The amorphous radiation damage with about 52 nm in diameter and 121 nm in length at the Schottky metal (Ti)-semiconductor (SiC) interface was observed. More importantly, in the damage site the atomic mixing of Ti, Si, and C was identified by electron energy loss spectroscopy and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM. It indicates that the melting of the Ti-SiC interface induced by localized Joule heating is responsible for the amorphization and the formation of titanium silicide, titanium carbide, or ternary phases. These modifications at nanoscale in turn cause the localized degradation of the Schottky contact, resulting in the permanent increase in leakage current. This experimental study provides very valuable clues to thorough understanding of the SELC mechanism in SiC diode.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Radiative Transfer Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation transfer equation is widely used for simulating such as heat transfer in engineering, diffuse optical tomography in healthcare, and radiation hydrodynamics in astrophysics. By combining the lattice Boltzmann method, we propose a quantum algorithm for radiative transfer. This algorithm encompasses all the essential physical processes of radiative transfer: absorption, scattering, and emission. Although a sufficient number of measurements are required to precisely estimate the quantum state, and the initial encoding of the quantum state remains a challenging problem, our quantum algorithm exponentially accelerates radiative transfer calculations compared to classical algorithms. In order to verify the quantum algorithm, we perform quantum circuit simulation using IBM Qiskit Aer and find good agreement between our numerical result and the exact solution. The algorithm opens new application of fault-tolerant quantum computers for plasma engineering, telecommunications, nuclear fusion technology, healthcare and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Investigation of low band gap silicon alloy thin film solar cell for improving short and long wavelength response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of a solar cell can provide various information that can be useful to maximize its power conversion efficiency (PCE). In that respect we carried out a set of numerical simulation using AFORS-HET simulation program. Separately, in order to get a better understanding, the optical absorption in individual layers devices were analyzed. Current-voltage characteristic curve of a reference cell (Cell-A) was used as the starting device. The PCE of the reference device was $8.85\%$ with short circuit current density $J_{sc}$ of 15.43 mA/cm$^{2}$ and fill factor (FF) of $68.3\%$. However, it was noticed that the reference cell had high parasitic optical absorption at the window layer and the device structure was also not optimized. After suitable optimization the PCE of this device (Cell-B2) improves to $11.59\%$ ($J_{sc}$ and FF of 13.0 mA/cm$^{2}$ and $87\%$ respectively). The results show that the effective optical absorption in the active layer can be improved significantly by optimizing the device structure. The short wavelength response can be improved by reducing the parasitic optical absorption by the doped window layer, while its long wavelength response improves by raising effective absorption length of the active layer. Furthermore, its optimum thickness, for the highest possible PCE, is found to be dependent upon the material properties, more importantly on its defect density.</description>
