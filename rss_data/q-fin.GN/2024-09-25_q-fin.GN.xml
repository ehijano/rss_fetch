      <title>The Credibility Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the large success of Transformers in Large Language Models, these architectures are increasingly applied to tabular data. This is achieved by embedding tabular data into low-dimensional Euclidean spaces resulting in similar structures as time-series data. We introduce a novel credibility mechanism to this Transformer architecture. This credibility mechanism is based on a special token that should be seen as an encoder that consists of a credibility weighted average of prior information and observation based information. We demonstrate that this novel credibility mechanism is very beneficial to stabilize training, and our Credibility Transformer leads to predictive models that are superior to state-of-the-art deep learning models.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of diversity on corporate boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diversity in leadership positions, including corporate boards, is an important aspect of equality. It is important because it is the key to better decision-making and innovation, and above all, it paves the way for future generations to participate and shape our society. Many studies emphasize the importance of the visibility of role models and the effect that connectivity has on the success of minorities in leadership. However, the connectivity of firms, the dynamics of the adoption of minorities into leadership positions, and the long-term effects in terms of group dynamics and visibility are not well understood. Here, we present a model that shows how these effects work together in a dynamic model that is calibrated with empirical data of firm and board networks. We show that homophily -- the appointment of minorities is influenced by the presence of minorities in a board and its neighboring entities -- is an important effect shaping the trajectory towards equality. We further show how perception biases and feedback related to the visibility of minority members influence the dynamic. We find that reaching equality can be sped up or slowed down depending on the distribution of minorities in central firms. These insights bear significant implications for policy-making geared towards fostering equality and diversity within corporate boards.</description>
