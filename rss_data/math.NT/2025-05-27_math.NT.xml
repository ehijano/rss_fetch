      <title>Small Tamagawa numbers of elliptic curves with isogenies or torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article with study Tamagawa numbers of elliptic curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ that have isogenies or torsion points. More precisely, our aim is either to bound the set of primes primes that can divide their Tamagawa numbers or, when such a bound is not possible, to find infinite subfamilies whose Tamagawa numbers are as small as possible. Finally, we also investigate Tamagawa numbers of specializations of elliptic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Values of generalized Liouville power series at algebraic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every positive integer $m$ LeVeque (1953) defined the $U_m$-numbers as the transcendental numbers that admit very good approximation by algebraic numbers of degree $m$, but not by those of smaller degree. In these terms, Mahler's $U$-numbers are the transcendental numbers which are $U_m$ for some $m$. In 1965 Mahler showed that (properly defined) lacunary power series with integers coefficients take $U$-values at algebraic numbers, unless the value is algebraic for an obvious reason. However, his argument does not specify to which $U_m$ the value belongs.
  In this article, we introduce the notion of generalized Liouville series, and give a necessary and sufficient condition for their values to be $U_m$. As an application, we show that a generalized Liouville series takes a $U_m$-value at a simple algebraic integer of degree $m$, unless the value is algebraic for an obvious reason. (An algebraic number $\alpha$ is called simple if the number field $\mathbb Q(\alpha)$ does not have a proper subfield other than $\mathbb Q$.)</description>

      <title>Cofinality of Galois Cohomology within Purely Quadratic Graded Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number. For a field $F$ containing a root of unity of order $p$, let $H^\bullet(F)=H^\bullet(F,\mathbb{F}_p)$ be the mod-$p$ Galois cohomology graded $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra of $F$. By the Norm Residue Theorem, $H^\bullet(F)$ is a purely quadratic graded-commutative algebra, and is therefore determined by the cup product $\cup\colon H^1(F)\times H^1(F)\to H^2(F)$. We prove that the class of all Galois cohomology algebras $H^\bullet(F)$ is cofinal in the class of all purely quadratic graded-commutative $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebras $A_\bullet$, in the following sense: For every $A_\bullet$ there exists $F$ such that the bilinear map $A_1\times A_1\to A_2$, which determines $A_\bullet$, embeds in the cup product bilinear map $\cup\colon H^1(F)\times H^1(F)\to H^2(F)$. We further provide examples of $\mathbb{F}_p$-bilinear maps which are not realizable by fields $F$ in this way.
  These are related to recent results by Snopce-Zalesskii and Blumer-Quadrelli-Weigel on the Galois theory of pro-$p$ right-angled Artin groups, as well as to a conjecture by Marshall on the possible axiomatization of quadratic form theory of fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\alpha_1,\alpha_2$ be non-zero algebraic numbers such that $\frac{\log \alpha_2}{\log\alpha_1}\notin\mathbb{Q}$ and let $\beta$ be a quadratic irrational number. In this article, we prove that the values of two relatively prime polynomials $P(x,y,z)$ and $Q(x,y,z)$ with integer coefficients are not too small at the point $\left(\frac{\log\alpha_2}{\log \alpha_1},\alpha_1^\beta, \alpha_2^\beta \right)$. We also establish a measure of algebraic independence of those numbers among $\frac{\log\alpha_2}{\log \alpha_1}$, $\alpha^\beta_1$ and $\alpha^\beta_2$ which are algebraically independent.</description>

      <title>Compression and complexity for sumset sizes in additive number theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of sums of finite sets of integers has mostly concentrated on sets with small sumsets (Freiman's theorem and related work) and on sets with large sumsets (Sidon sets and $B_h$-sets). This paper considers the sets ${\mathcal R}_{\mathbf Z}(h,k)$ and ${\mathcal R}_{{\mathbf Z}^n}(h,k)$ of all sizes of $h$-fold sums of sets of $k$ integers or of $k$ lattice points, and the geometric and computational complexity of the sets ${\mathcal R}_{\mathbf Z}(h,k)$ and ${\mathcal R}_{{\mathbf Z}^n}(h,k)$.</description>

      <title>Computing transcendence and linear relations of 1-periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A 1-period is a complex number given by the integral of a univariate algebraic function, where all data involved -- the integrand and the domain of integration -- are defined over algebraic numbers. We give an algorithm that, given a finite collection of 1-periods, computes the space of all linear relations among them with algebraic coefficients. In particular, the algorithm decides whether a given 1-period is transcendental, and whether two 1-periods are equal. This resolves, in the case of 1-periods, a problem posed by Kontsevich and Zagier, asking for an algorithm to decide equality of periods. The algorithm builds on the work of Huber and W\"ustholz, who showed that all linear relations among 1-periods arise from 1-motives; we make this perspective effective by reducing the problem to divisor arithmetic on curves and providing the theoretical foundations for a practical and fully explicit algorithm. To illustrate the broader applicability of our methods, we also give an algorithmic classification of autonomous first-order (non-linear) differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We highlight a certain compactness of Sidon sets and $B_2[g]$-sets and provide several applications. Notably, we prove the existence of such sets that maximize certain functions. In particular, we show the existence of a Sidon set whose reciprocal sum is equal to the distinct distance constant, which answers a question from Guy and Zhang. We also improve the best known upper bound for this constant.</description>

Abstract: We derive a relative version of the local monodromy theorem for ordinary differential equations on an annulus over a mixed-characteristic nonarchimedean field, and give several applications in $p$-adic cohomology and $p$-adic Hodge theory. These include a simplified proof of the semistable reduction theorem for overconvergent $F$-isocrystals, a relative version of Berger's theorem that de Rham representations are potentially semistable, and a multivariate version of the local monodromy theorem in the style of Drinfeld's lemma on fundamental groups.</description>

      <title>S-unit equations in modules and linear-exponential Diophantine equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a positive integer, and $\mathcal{M}$ be a finitely presented module over the Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}_{/T}[X_1^{\pm}, \ldots, X_N^{\pm}]$. We consider S-unit equations over $\mathcal{M}$: these are equations of the form $x_1 m_1 + \cdots + x_K m_K = m_0$, where the variables $x_1, \ldots, x_K$ range over the set of monomials (with coefficient 1) of $\mathbb{Z}_{/T}[X_1^{\pm}, \ldots, X_N^{\pm}]$. When $T$ is a power of a prime number $p$, we show that the solution set of an S-unit equation over $\mathcal{M}$ is effectively $p$-normal in the sense of Derksen and Masser (2015), generalizing their result on S-unit equations in fields of prime characteristic. When $T$ is an arbitrary positive integer, we show that deciding whether an S-unit equation over $\mathcal{M}$ admits a solution is Turing equivalent to solving a system of linear-exponential Diophantine equations, whose base contains the prime divisors of $T$. Combined with a recent result of Karimov, Luca, Nieuwveld, Ouaknine and Worrell (2025), this yields decidability when $T$ has at most two distinct prime divisors. This also shows that proving either decidability or undecidability in the case of arbitrary $T$ would entail major breakthroughs in number theory.
  We mention some potential applications of our results, such as deciding Submonoid Membership in wreath products of the form $\mathbb{Z}_{/p^a q^b} \wr \mathbb{Z}^d$, as well as progressing towards solving the Skolem problem in rings whose additive group is torsion. More connections in these directions will be explored in follow up papers.</description>

      <title>Sperner systems with restricted differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of subsets of $[n]$ and $L$ be a subset of $[n]$. We say $\mathcal{F}$ is an $L$-differencing Sperner system if $|A\setminus B|\in L$ for any distinct $A,B\in\mathcal{F}$. Let $p$ be a prime and $q$ be a power of $p$. Frankl first studied $p$-modular $L$-differencing Sperner systems and showed an upper bound of the form $\sum_{i=0}^{|L|}\binom{n}{i}$. In this paper, we obtain new upper bounds on $q$-modular $L$-differencing Sperner systems using elementary $p$-adic analysis and polynomial method, extending and improving existing results substantially. Moreover, our techniques can be used to derive new upper bounds on subsets of the hypercube with restricted Hamming distances. One highlight of the paper is the first analogue of the celebrated Snevily's theorem in the $q$-modular setting, which results in several new upper bounds on $q$-modular $L$-avoiding $L$-intersecting systems. In particular, we improve a result of Felszeghy, Heged\H{u}s, and R\'{o}nyai, and give a partial answer to a question posed by Babai, Frankl, Kutin, and \v{S}tefankovi\v{c}.</description>

      <title>An average case efficient algorithm for solving two-variable linear Diophantine equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14052v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit two algorithms to solve two-variable linear Diophantine equations. We write the iterative version of one of them. For another, we analyze the number of recursive calls. We find that the number of recursive calls is a periodic function. We derive the period of this function and various upper bounds on this function. We find that for a fixed value of $a$, $b$ and $a$ varying $c$, such that equation $ax+by = c$ (where $a &gt; b$) is solvable, we can find the solution in $O\left(\frac{\log b}{gcd(a,b)}\right)$ average number of recursions. We computationally evaluate and verify this bound. We compare this bound and another bound with the average number of recursive calls in Extended Euclid's algorithm on random $512$-bit inputs. We propose an iterative version of the algorithm. Our algorithm performs better in terms of the average number of iterations against the two existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>On parameters of Hecke algebras for $p$-adic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a non-archimedean local field with residue characteristic $p$ and $G$ be a connected reductive group defined over $F$. In earlier joint works with Jeffrey D. Adler, Jessica Fintzen, and Manish Mishra, we proved that the Hecke algebras attached to types constructed by Kim and Yu are isomorphic to the Hecke algebras attached to depth-zero types. Note that if $G$ splits over a tamely ramified extension of $F$ and $p$ does not divide the order of the absolute Weyl group of $G$, such Hecke algebras cover the Hecke algebras attached to arbitrary Bernstein blocks. We also proved that for a depth-zero type $(K, \rho)$, the corresponding Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}(G(F), (K, \rho))$ has an explicit description as a semi-direct product of an affine Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}(W(\rho_M)_{\mathrm{aff}}, q)$ with a twisted group algebra $\mathbb{C}[\Omega(\rho_{M}), \mu]$, generalizing prior work of Morris.
  In this paper, we show that the affine Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}(W(\rho_M)_{\mathrm{aff}}, q)$ appearing in the description of the Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}(G(F), (K, \rho))$ attached to a depth-zero type $(K, \rho)$ is isomorphic to the one attached to a unipotent type for a connected reductive group splitting over an unramified extension of $F$. This makes it possible to calculate the parameters of the affine Hecke algebras for depth-zero types and types constructed by Kim and Yu explicitly. In particular, we prove a version of Lusztig's conjecture that the parameters of the Hecke algebra attached to an arbitrary Bernstein block agree with those of a unipotent Bernstein block under the assumption that $G$ splits over a tamely ramified extension of $F$ and $p$ does not divide the order of the absolute Weyl group of $G$.</description>
