      <title>Unveiling tortured phrases in Humanities and Social Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A small amount of unscrupulous people, concerned by their career prospects, resort to paper mill services to publish articles in renowned journals and conference proceedings. These include patchworks of synonymized contents using paraphrasing tools, featuring tortured phrases, increasingly polluting the scientific literature. The Problematic Paper Screener (PPS) has been developed to allow articles (re)assessment on PubPeer. Since most of the known tortured phrases are found in publications in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), we extend this work by exploring their presence in the humanities and social sciences (HSS). To do so, we used the PPS to look for tortured abbreviations, generated from the two social science thesauri ELSST and THESOZ. We also used two case studies to find new tortured abbreviations, by screening the Hindawi EDRI journal and the GESIS SSOAR repository. We found a total of 32 multidisciplinary problematic documents, related to Education, Psychology, and Economics. We also generated 121 new fingerprints to be added to the PPS. These articles and future screening have to be investigated by social scientists, as most of it is currently done by STEM domain experts.</description>

      <title>From Data Creator to Data Reuser: Distance Matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sharing research data is necessary, but not sufficient, for data reuse. Open science policies focus more heavily on data sharing than on reuse, yet both are complex, labor-intensive, expensive, and require infrastructure investments by multiple stakeholders. The value of data reuse lies in relationships between creators and reusers. By addressing knowledge exchange, rather than mere transactions between stakeholders, investments in data management and knowledge infrastructures can be made more wisely. Drawing upon empirical studies of data sharing and reuse, we develop the metaphor of distance between data creator and data reuser, identifying six dimensions of distance that influence the ability to transfer knowledge effectively: domain, methods, collaboration, curation, purposes, and time and temporality. We explore how social and socio-technical aspects of these dimensions may decrease -- or increase -- distances to be traversed between creators and reusers. Our theoretical framing of the distance between data creators and prospective reusers leads to recommendations to four categories of stakeholders on how to make data sharing and reuse more effective: data creators, data reusers, data archivists, and funding agencies. 'It takes a village' to share research data -- and a village to reuse data. Our aim is to provoke new research questions, new research, and new investments in effective and efficient circulation of research data; and to identify criteria for investments at each stage of data and research life cycles.</description>

      <title>Extending and Applying Automated HERMES Software Publication Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research software is an important output of research and must be published according to the FAIR Principles for Research Software. This can be achieved by publishing software with metadata under a persistent identifier. HERMES is a tool that leverages continuous integration to automate the publication of software with rich metadata. In this work, we describe the HERMES workflow itself, and how to extend it to meet the needs of specific research software metadata or infrastructure. We introduce the HERMES plugin architecture and provide the example of creating a new HERMES plugin that harvests metadata from a metadata source in source code repositories. We show how to use HERMES as an end user, both via the command line interface, and as a step in a continuous integration pipeline. Finally, we report three informal case studies whose results provide a preliminary evaluation of the feasibility and applicability of HERMES workflows, and the extensibility of the hermes software package.</description>
