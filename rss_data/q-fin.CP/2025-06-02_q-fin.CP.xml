      <title>Path-dependent option pricing with two-dimensional PDE using MPDATA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss a simple yet robust PDE method for evaluating path-dependent Asian-style options using the non-oscillatory forward-in-time second-order MPDATA finite-difference scheme. The valuation methodology involves casting the Black-Merton-Scholes equation as a transport problem by first transforming it into a homogeneous advection-diffusion PDE via variable substitution, and then expressing the diffusion term as an advective flux using the pseudo-velocity technique. As a result, all terms of the Black-Merton-Sholes equation are consistently represented using a single high-order numerical scheme for the advection operator. We detail the additional steps required to solve the two-dimensional valuation problem compared to MPDATA valuations of vanilla instruments documented in a prior study. Using test cases employing fixed-strike instruments, we validate the solutions against Monte Carlo valuations, as well as against an approximate analytical solution in which geometric instead of arithmetic averaging is used. The analysis highlights the critical importance of the MPDATA corrective steps that improve the solution over the underlying first-order "upwind" step. The introduced valuation scheme is robust: conservative, non-oscillatory, and positive-definite; yet lucid: explicit in time, engendering intuitive stability-condition interpretation and inflow/outflow boundary-condition heuristics. MPDATA is particularly well suited for two-dimensional problems as it is not a dimensionally split scheme. The documented valuation workflow also constitutes a useful two-dimensional case for testing advection schemes featuring both Monte Carlo solutions and analytic bounds. An implementation of the introduced valuation workflow, based on the PyMPDATA package and the Numba Just-In-Time compiler for Python, is provided as free and open source software.</description>

      <title>A Causation-Based Framework for Pricing and Cost Allocation of Energy, Reserves, and Transmission in Modern Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing vulnerability of power systems has heightened the need for operating reserves to manage contingencies such as generator outages, line failures, and sudden load variations. Unlike energy costs, driven by consumer demand, operating reserve costs arise from addressing the most critical credible contingencies - prompting the question: how should these costs be allocated through efficient pricing mechanisms? As an alternative to previously reported schemes, this paper presents a new causation-based pricing framework for electricity markets based on contingency-constrained energy and reserve scheduling models. Major salient features include a novel security charge mechanism along with the explicit definition of prices for up-spinning reserves, down-spinning reserves, and transmission services. These features ensure more comprehensive and efficient cost-reflective market operations. Moreover, the proposed nodal pricing scheme yields revenue adequacy and neutrality while promoting reliability incentives for generators based on the cost-causation principle. An additional salient aspect of the proposed framework is the economic incentive for transmission assets, which are remunerated based on their use to deliver energy and reserves across all contingency states. Numerical results from two case studies illustrate the performance of the proposed pricing scheme.</description>

      <title>A Consolidated Volatility Prediction with Back Propagation Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07223v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a unique approach with AI algorithms to predict emerging stock markets volatility. Traditionally, stock volatility is derived from historical volatility,Monte Carlo simulation and implied volatility as well. In this paper, the writer designs a consolidated model with back-propagation neural network and genetic algorithm to predict future volatility of emerging stock markets and found that the results are quite accurate with low errors.</description>
