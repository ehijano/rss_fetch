      <title>The Solar eruptioN Integral Field Spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar eruptioN Integral Field Spectrograph (SNIFS) is a solar-gazing spectrograph scheduled to fly in the summer of 2025 on a NASA sounding rocket. Its goal is to view the solar chromosphere and transition region at a high cadence (1s) both spatially (0.5") and spectrally (33 m{\AA}) viewing wavelengths around Lyman Alpha (1216 {\AA}), Si iii (1206 {\AA}) and O v (1218 {\AA}) to observe spicules, nanoflares, and possibly a solar flare. This time cadence will provide yet-unobserved detail about fast-changing features of the Sun. The instrument is comprised of a Gregorian-style reflecting telescope combined with a spectrograph via a specialized mirrorlet array that focuses the light from each spatial location in the image so that it may be spectrally dispersed without overlap from neighboring locations. This paper discusses the driving science, detailed instrument and subsystem design, and pre-integration testing of the SNIFS instrument.</description>

      <title>An impulsive geomagnetic effect from an early-impulsive flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geomagnetic "solar flare effect" (SFE) results from excess ionization in the Earth's ionosphere, famously first detected at the time of the Carrington flare in 1859. This indirect detection of a flare constituted one of the first cases of "multimessenger astronomy," whereby solar ionizing radiation stimulates ionospheric currents. Well-observed SFEs have few-minute time scales and perturbations of &gt;10 nT, with the greatest events reaching above 100 nT. In previously reported cases the SFE time profiles tend to resemble those of solar soft X-ray emission, which ionizes the D-region; there is also a less-well-studied contribution from Lyman-alpha. We report here a specific case, from flare SOL2024-03-10 (M7.4), in which an impulsive SFE deviated from this pattern. This flare contained an "early impulsive" component of exceptionally hard radiation, extending up to gamma-ray energies above 1 MeV, distinctly before the bulk of the flare soft X-ray emission. We can characterize the spectral distribution of this early-impulsive component in detail, thanks to the modern extensive wavelength coverage. A more typical gradual SFE occurred during the flare's main phase. We suggest that events of this type warrant exploration of the solar physics in the "impulse response" limit of very short time scales.</description>

      <title>Seasonal variation of Saturn's Lyman-$\alpha$ brightness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine Saturn's non-auroral (dayglow) emissions at Lyman-$\alpha$ observed by the {Cassini/UVIS} instrument from 2004 until 2016, to constrain meridional and seasonal trends in the upper atmosphere. We separate viewing geometry effects from trends driven by atmospheric properties, by applying a multi-variate regression to the observed emissions. The Lyman-$\alpha$ dayglow brightnesses depend on the incident solar flux, solar incidence angle, emission angle, and observed latitude. The emissions across latitudes and seasons show a strong dependence with solar incidence angle, typical of resonantly scattered solar flux and consistent with no significant internal source. We observe a bulge in Ly-$\alpha$ brightness that shifts with the summer season from the southern to the northern hemisphere. We estimate atomic hydrogen optical depths above the methane homopause level for dayside disk observations (2004-2016) by comparing observed Lyman-$\alpha$ emissions to a radiative transfer model. We model emissions from resonantly scattered solar flux and a smaller but significant contribution by scattered photons from the interplanetary hydrogen (IPH) background. During northern summer, inferred hydrogen optical depths steeply decrease with latitude towards the winter hemisphere from a northern hemisphere bulge, as predicted by a 2D seasonal photochemical model. The southern hemisphere mirrors this trend during its summer. However, inferred optical depths show substantially more temporal variation between 2004 and 2016 than predicted by the photochemical model.</description>

      <title>How coronal mass ejections are influenced by the morphology and toroidal flux of their source magnetic flux ropes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) stand as intense eruptions of magnetized plasma from the Sun, playing a pivotal role in driving significant changes of the heliospheric environment. Deducing the properties of CMEs from their progenitors in solar source regions is crucial for space weather forecasting. Deducing the properties of CMEs from their progenitors in solar source regions is crucial for space weather forecasting. The primary objective of this paper is to establish a connection between CMEs and their progenitors in solar source regions, enabling us to infer the magnetic structures of CMEs before their full development. To this end, we create a dataset comprising a magnetic flux rope series with varying projection shapes, sizes and toroidal fluxes, using the Regularized Biot-Savart Laws (RBSL). Thereafter, we simulate the propagation of these flux ropes from the solar surface to a distance of 25$R_{\odot}$ with our global coronal MHD model which is named COCONUT. Our parametric survey reveals significant impacts of source flux ropes on the consequent CMEs. We find that the projection shape can influence the magnetic structures of CMEs at 20$R_{\odot}$, albeit with minimal impacts on the propagation speed. However, these impacts diminish as source flux ropes become fat. In terms of toroidal flux, our simulation results demonstrate a pronounced correlation with the propagation speed of CMEs, as well as the successfulness in erupting. This work builds the bridge between the CMEs in the outer corona and their progenitors in solar source regions. Our parametric survey suggests that the projection shape, cross-section radius and toroidal flux of source flux ropes are crucial parameters in predicting magnetic structures and propagation speed of CMEs, providing valuable insights for space weather prediction.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of energetic particles scattered in the solar wind: numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propagate relativistic test particles in the field of a steady three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the solar wind. We use the MPI-AMRVAC code for the wind simulations and integrate the relativistic guiding center equations using a new third-order accurate predictor-corrector time integration scheme. Turbulence induced scattering of the particles' trajectory in velocity space is mimicked by a constant magnetic field aligned mean free path $\lambda_\parallel$. We comment the particular case of $81\:{\rm keV}$ electrons injected in the solar wind at 0.139 AU heliocentric distance and $24^{\circ}$ of magnetic latitude. For $\lambda_\parallel =0.5\:{\rm AU}$, the simulated velocity pitch angle distributions are in good qualitative agreement with in situ measurements at 1 AU. More generally, for $\lambda_\parallel$ in the range 0.5 to 3\:AU, a velocity drift associated energy loss rate of the order of $10\%$ per day is observed. The energy loss is attributable to the magnetic curvature and gradient induced poleward drifts of the electrons, against the dominant component of the electric field.</description>
