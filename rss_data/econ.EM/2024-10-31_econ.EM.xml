      <title>Fractional Moments by the Moment-Generating Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for obtaining a wide variety of moments of a random variable with a well-defined moment-generating function (MGF). We derive new expressions for fractional moments and fractional absolute moments, both central and non-central moments. The new moment expressions are relatively simple integrals that involve the MGF, but do not require its derivatives. We label the new method CMGF because it uses a complex extension of the MGF and can be used to obtain complex moments. We illustrate the new method with three applications where the MGF is available in closed-form, while the corresponding densities and the derivatives of the MGF are either unavailable or very difficult to obtain.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Debiasing with Conditional Moment Restrictions: An Application to LATE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models with Conditional Moment Restrictions (CMRs) are popular in economics. These models involve finite and infinite dimensional parameters. The infinite dimensional components include conditional expectations, conditional choice probabilities, or policy functions, which might be flexibly estimated using Machine Learning tools. This paper presents a characterization of locally debiased moments for regular models defined by general semiparametric CMRs with possibly different conditioning variables. These moments are appealing as they are known to be less affected by first-step bias. Additionally, we study their existence and relevance. Such results apply to a broad class of smooth functionals of finite and infinite dimensional parameters that do not necessarily appear in the CMRs. As a leading application of our theory, we characterize debiased machine learning for settings of treatment effects with endogeneity, giving necessary and sufficient conditions. We present a large class of relevant debiased moments in this context. We then propose the Compliance Machine Learning Estimator (CML), based on a practically convenient orthogonal relevant moment. We show that the resulting estimand can be written as a convex combination of conditional local average treatment effects (LATE). Altogether, CML enjoys three appealing properties in the LATE framework: (1) local robustness to first-stage estimation, (2) an estimand that can be identified under a minimal relevance condition, and (3) a meaningful causal interpretation. Our numerical experimentation shows satisfactory relative performance of such an estimator. Finally, we revisit the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, analyzed by Finkelstein et al. (2012). We find that the use of machine learning and CML suggest larger positive effects on health care utilization than previously determined.</description>

      <title>Estimation and Inference in Dyadic Network Formation Models with Nontransferable Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies estimation and inference in a dyadic network formation model with observed covariates, unobserved heterogeneity, and nontransferable utilities. With the presence of the high dimensional fixed effects, the maximum likelihood estimator is numerically difficult to compute and suffers from the incidental parameter bias. We propose an easy-to-compute one-step estimator for the homophily parameter of interest, which is further refined to achieve $\sqrt{N}$-consistency via split-network jackknife and efficiency by the bootstrap aggregating (bagging) technique. We establish consistency for the estimator of the fixed effects and prove asymptotic normality for the unconditional average partial effects. Simulation studies show that our method works well with finite samples, and an empirical application using the risk-sharing data from Nyakatoke highlights the importance of employing proper statistical inferential procedures.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of bootstrap for matching estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a landmark paper, Abadie and Imbens (2008) showed that the naive bootstrap is inconsistent when applied to nearest neighbor matching estimators of the average treatment effect with a fixed number of matches. Since then, this finding has inspired numerous efforts to address the inconsistency issue, typically by employing alternative bootstrap methods. In contrast, this paper shows that the naive bootstrap is provably consistent for the original matching estimator, provided that the number of matches, $M$, diverges. The bootstrap inconsistency identified by Abadie and Imbens (2008) thus arises solely from the use of a fixed $M$.</description>

      <title>Identifying Dynamic Discrete Choice Models with Hyperbolic Discounting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10721v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study identification of dynamic discrete choice models with hyperbolic discounting. We show that the standard discount factor, present bias factor, and instantaneous utility functions for the sophisticated agent are point-identified from observed conditional choice probabilities and transition probabilities in a finite horizon model. The main idea to achieve identification is to exploit variation in the observed conditional choice probabilities over time. We present the estimation method and demonstrate a good performance of the estimator by simulation.</description>

      <title>Using Total Margin of Error to Account for Non-Sampling Error in Election Polls: The Case of Nonresponse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The potential impact of non-sampling errors on election polls is well known, but measurement has focused on the margin of sampling error. Survey statisticians have long recommended measurement of total survey error by mean square error (MSE), which jointly measures sampling and non-sampling errors. We think it reasonable to use the square root of maximum MSE to measure the total margin of error (TME). Measurement of TME should encompass both sampling error and all forms of non-sampling error. We suggest that measurement of TME should be a standard feature in the reporting of polls. To provide a clear illustration, and because we believe the exceedingly low response rates commonly obtained by election polls to be a particularly worrisome source of potential error, we demonstrate how to measure the potential impact of nonresponse using the concept of TME. We first show how to measure TME when a pollster lacks any knowledge of the candidate preferences of nonrespondents. We then extend the analysis to settings where the pollster has partial knowledge that bounds the preferences of non-respondents. In each setting, we derive a simple poll estimate that approximately minimizes TME, a midpoint estimate, and compare it to a conventional poll estimate.</description>

      <title>Quasi-randomization tests for network interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network interference amounts to the treatment status of one unit affecting the potential outcome of other units in the population. Testing for spillover effects in this setting makes the null hypothesis non-sharp. An interesting approach to tackling the non-sharp nature of the null hypothesis in this setup is constructing conditional randomization tests such that the null is sharp on the restricted population. Such approaches can pose computational challenges as finding these appropriate sub-populations based on experimental design can involve solving an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we view the network amongst the population as a random variable instead of being fixed. We propose a new approach that builds a conditional quasi-randomization test. We build the (non-sharp) null distribution of no spillover effects using random graph null models. We show that our method is exactly valid in finite samples under mild assumptions. Our method displays enhanced power over other methods, substantially improving cluster randomized trials. We illustrate our methodology to test for interference in a weather insurance adoption experiment run in rural China.</description>
