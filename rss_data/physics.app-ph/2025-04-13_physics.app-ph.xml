      <title>A Simple Method for More Precise Pulse-Height Fitting in Sparsely Sampled Data Using Pulse-Shape-Archetype Information, Especially Suited to Ultra-Short-Laser Pulsetrains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel pulse-reconstruction method well suited to sparsely sampled repetitive data, such as commonly arise from trains of ultrashort laser-pulses. Typically waveforms in such traces are fully instrument-limited by the detecting systems, for instance, the combination of detector and oscilloscope, and only the energy of each waveform is sought. The method applies whenever shape of the waveform is the same for every pulse and can be well-characterized, with only amplitude and relative peak-timing changing. Under such conditions this information, known in advance, can be used as a basis - an archetype - for very accurate pulse fitting. Our characterizations show that the method very accurately extracts pulse heights and relative pulse timing, even when sampling routinely misses the pulse peak, and entirely misses the rising or falling edge. We show this method to be adaptable in different detection systems, showing significant improvement in accuracy of measurement, in this class of problem.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Luminous Transmission and Solar Modulation in Thermochromic VO2 Aerogel-Like Films via Remote Plasma Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is a thermochromic material that undergoes a phase transition from a monoclinic semiconducting state to a rutile metallic state at 68 degrees C, a temperature close to room temperature. This property makes VO2 particularly valuable in applications such as optical and electrical switches, data storage, neuromorphic computing, and remarkably dynamic smart windows for solar radiation control. VO2 typically needs to be synthesized for these applications as nanostructured thin films. Over the past few decades, significant efforts have been made to control the thermochromic properties of VO2 through crystal structure tuning, doping, and the development of VO2 nanocomposites. Additionally, introducing nano- and mesoporosity has been shown to enhance the optical properties of thermochromic VO2 films. This study presents a methodology for producing highly porous, aerogel-like V2O5 films, which can be thermally processed to form aerogel-like VO2 films. This process is based on sequential plasma polymerization and plasma etching to produce aerogel-like V2O5 films that are annealed to yield ultraporous nanocrystalline VO2 films. The sacrificial vanadium-containing plasma polymers are obtained by remote plasma-assisted vacuum deposition (RPAVD) using vanadyl porphyrin as a precursor and Ar as plasma gas. The aerogel-like VO2 films show exceptional thermochromic performance with luminous transmittances higher than 54%, solar modulation up to 18.8%, and IR modulation up to 35.5%. The presented plasma methodology is versatile, allowing both the synthesis of VO2 plasmonic structures to enhance the thermochromic response and the encapsulation of films to improve their stability in air dramatically. Additionally, this solvent-free synthetic method is fully compatible with doping procedures, scalable, and holds great potential for designing and optimizing smart window coatings.</description>

      <title>Analytical design of acoustic metasurface cells incorporating meander-line and Helmholtz resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient acoustic metasurfaces have shown strong potential for manipulation of acoustic waves across the audible and ultrasonic frequency ranges. The key challenge in designing acoustic metasurfaces is to create a series of sub-wavelength unit cells that match the desired phase response. The most commonly used geometry is a series of Helmholtz resonators, side-coupled to a narrow channel. Despite the existence of a closed-form solution for 3 side-coupled resonators, most reported designs instead make use of 4 or more resonators, which require opaque, optimization-based design approaches. We show that the limiting factor in designs based on side-coupled resonators is the requirement to use elements with a positive imaginary part of impedance, which implies a Helmholtz resonator operating above its fundamental resonance - contradicting the requirement for sub-wavelength volume. We show that by replacing some of the Helmholtz resonators with meander-line elements, the required impedance values can readily be realized within a sub-wavelength volume. The metasurface design approach is demonstrated for a lens operating at 3 kHz and verified numerically. Furthermore, incorporating meander-line elements leads to improved broadband focusing performance, even when no explicit dispersion engineering is included in the design. As this design includes narrow channels, we include the effects of thermo-viscous losses in our modeling, and confirm that our design still gives superior performance to the reference design using only Helmholtz resonators. Our design is expected to lead to more optimal performance of acoustic metasurface designs, and the ability to make use of a closed-form design formula is expected to facilitate the analysis of fundamental performance bounds and enable more explicit achromatic design processes.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Reasoning Enabled by Spin-Orbit Torque Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian networks play an increasingly important role in data mining, inference, and reasoning with the rapid development of artificial intelligence. In this paper, we present proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating the use of spin-orbit torque magnetic tunnel junctions (SOT-MTJs) in Bayesian network reasoning. Not only can the target probability distribution function (PDF) of a Bayesian network be precisely formulated by a conditional probability table as usual but also quantitatively parameterized by a probabilistic forward propagating neuron network. Moreover, the parameters of the network can also approach the optimum through a simple point-by point training algorithm, by leveraging which we do not need to memorize all historical data nor statistically summarize conditional probabilities behind them, significantly improving storage efficiency and economizing data pretreatment. Furthermore, we developed a simple medical diagnostic system using the SOT-MTJ as a random number generator and sampler, showcasing the application of SOT-MTJ-based Bayesian reasoning. This SOT-MTJ-based Bayesian reasoning shows great promise in the field of artificial probabilistic neural network, broadening the scope of spintronic device applications and providing an efficient and low-storage solution for complex reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>A proposal of a concept for a balanced internal combustion engine configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internal combustion engines (ICEs) inherently suffer from imbalances due to the reciprocating motion of their components, leading to vibrations, wear, and mechanical inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose a novel engine configuration based on four interconnected hypocycloidal straight-line mechanisms, designed to eliminate both translational force imbalances and torque fluctuations. We present the mechanical concept as a physics problem, followed by theoretical calculations showing that the proposed system results in zero net force and torque due to its symmetric design. An experimental prototype was constructed using CAD modeling and manufactured from acrylic. Measurements performed with an accelerometer confirm the theoretical predictions: the engine remains stable during operation, and imbalances arise only when the piston synchrony is disrupted. Our results demonstrate that such a configuration offers a mechanically balanced alternative to conventional ICE layouts, with potential applications in vibration-free piston based engine designs.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the dynamics of conductive filaments in MoS${_2}$ based memristors by operando transmission electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced operando transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques enable the observation of nanoscale phenomena in electrical devices during operation. They can be used to study the switching mechanisms in two-dimensional (2D) materials-based memristive devices, which is crucial to tailor their operating regimes and improve reliability and variability. Here, we investigate lateral memristive devices composed of 2D layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS${_2}$) with palladium (Pd) and silver (Ag) electrodes. We visualized the formation and migration of Ag conductive filaments (CFs) between the two electrodes under external bias voltage and their complete dissolution upon reversing the bias voltage polarity. The CFs exhibited a wide range of sizes, ranging from several {\AA}ngstr\"oms to tens of nanometers, and followed diverse pathways: along the MoS${_2}$ surfaces, within the van der Waals gap between MoS${_2}$ layers, and through the spacing between MoS${_2}$ bundles. Notably, the Ag electrode functioned as a reservoir for the CFs, as evidenced by the shrinking and growing of the Ag electrode upon switching. Our method enabled correlating the current-voltage responses with real-time TEM imaging, offering insights into failed and anomalous switching behavior, and providing clarity on the cycle-to-cycle variabilities. Our findings provide solid evidence for the electrochemical metallization mechanism, elucidate the formation dynamics of CFs, and reveal key parameters influencing the switching performance. Our approach can be extended to investigate similar memristive devices.</description>

      <title>Two-media laser threshold magnetometry: A magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a promising platform for high-precision magnetometry. In contrast to the use of spontaneous emission in a number of NV-magnetometers, laser threshold magnetometry (LTM) exploits stimulated emission of NV centers by placing an NV-doped diamond inside an optical cavity. The NV laser system is predicted to reach a high magnetic contrast and strong coherent signal strength, leading to an improved magnetic field sensitivity combined with a high linearity. Here, we consider a two-media setup where the cavity additionally includes a vertical external cavity surface emitting laser. This optically active material compensates cavity losses at 750 nm while still allowing for magnetic-field-dependent effects from the NV-diamond. We demonstrate a magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold and investigate the effects of pump laser induced absorption of the diamond. The experimental data is supported by an analytical simulation based on a rate model. Furthermore, we derive a generalized formula to compute the magnetic field sensitivity in the regime of high contrast yielding 33.79(23) pT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ for the present setup. Simulations with an optimized diamond suggest that values down to 4.9 fT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ are possible.</description>

      <title>Ising machine by dimensional collapse of nonlinear polarization oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines show promise as ultrafast hardware for optimizations encoded in Ising Hamiltonians but fall short in terms of success rate and performance scaling. Here, we propose a novel Ising machine that exploits the three-dimensional nature of nonlinear polarization oscillators to counteract these limitations. Based on the evolution of the optical polarization in third-order nonlinear media, the high-dimensional machine reaches the Ising ground state by the mechanism of dimensional collapse: the dynamics on the Poincar\'e sphere undergoes a self-induced collapse into polarization fixed points mapping Ising spins. The photonic setup consists of polarization-modulated pulses in a $\chi^{(3)}$ crystal subject to iterative feedback. We numerically demonstrate that its high-dimensional operation leads to an enhanced success probability on benchmark graphs and an exponential improvement in performance scaling with respect to coherent Ising machines. The proposed polarization Ising machine paves the way for a new class of Ising solvers with enhanced computing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Materials Discovery in Combinatorial and High-throughput Synthesis and Processing: A New Frontier for SPM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For over three decades, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has been a key method for exploring material structures and functionalities at nanometer and often atomic scales in ambient, liquid, and vacuum environments. Historically, SPM applications have predominantly been downstream, with images and spectra serving as a qualitative source of data on the microstructure and properties of materials, and in rare cases of fundamental physical knowledge. However, the fast-growing developments in accelerated material synthesis via self-driving labs and established applications such as combinatorial spread libraries are poised to change this paradigm. Rapid synthesis demands matching capabilities to probe structure and functionalities of materials on small scales and with high throughput. SPM inherently meets these criteria, offering a rich and diverse array of data from a single measurement. Here, we overview SPM methods applicable to these emerging applications and emphasize their quantitativeness, focusing on piezoresponse force microscopy, electrochemical strain microscopy, conductive, and surface photovoltage measurements. We discuss the challenges and opportunities ahead, asserting that SPM will play a crucial role in closing the loop from material prediction and synthesis to characterization.</description>

      <title>Optimal multipole center for subwavelength acoustic scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multipole expansion is a powerful framework for analyzing how subwavelength-size objects scatter waves in optics or acoustics. The calculation of multipole moments traditionally uses the scatterer's center of mass as the reference point. The theoretical foundation of this heuristic convention remains an open question. Here, we challenge this convention by demonstrating that a different, optimal multipole center can yield superior results. The optimal center is crucial -- it allows us to accurately express the scattering response while retaining a minimum number of multipole moments. Our analytical technique for finding the optimal multipole centers of individual scatterers, both in isolation and within finite arrays, is validated through numerical simulations. Our findings reveal that such an optimized positioning significantly reduces quadrupole contributions, enabling more accurate monopole-dipole approximations in acoustic calculations. Our approach also improves the computational efficiency of the T-matrix method, offering practical benefits for metamaterial design and analysis.</description>
