      <title>The Type I Superluminous Supernova Catalog I: Light Curve Properties, Models, and Catalog Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the most comprehensive catalog to date of Type I Superluminous Supernovae (SLSNe), a class of stripped envelope supernovae (SNe) characterized by exceptionally high luminosities. We have compiled a sample of 262 SLSNe reported through 2022 December 31. We verified the spectroscopic classification of each SLSN and collated an exhaustive data set of UV, optical and IR photometry from both publicly available data and our own FLEET observational follow-up program, totaling over 30,000 photometric detections. Using these data we derive observational parameters such as the peak absolute magnitudes, rise and decline timescales, as well as bolometric luminosities, temperature and photospheric radius evolution for all SLSNe. Additionally, we model all light curves using a hybrid model that includes contributions from both a magnetar central engine and the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni. We explore correlations among various physical and observational parameters, and recover the previously found relation between ejecta mass and magnetar spin, as well as the overall progenitor pre-explosion mass distribution with a peak at $\approx 6.5$ M$_\odot$. We find no significant redshift dependence for any parameter, and no evidence for distinct sub-types of SLSNe. We find that $&lt; 3$\% of SLSNe are best fit with a significant contribution from radioactive decay $\gtrsim 50$\%, representing a set of relatively dim and slowly declining SNe. We provide several analytical tools designed to simulate typical SLSN light curves across a broad range of wavelengths and phases, enabling accurate K-corrections, bolometric scaling calculations, and inclusion of SLSNe in survey simulations or future comparison works. The complete catalog, including all of the photometry, models, and derived parameters, is made available as an open-source resource on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Fragmention in Gravitationally-Unstable Collapsar Disks and Sub-Solar Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although stable neutron stars (NS) can in principle exist down to masses Mns ~ 0.1Msun, standard models of stellar core-collapse predict a robust lower limit Mns &gt;~ 1.2Msun, roughly commensurate with the Chandrasekhar mass Mch of the progenitor's iron core (electron fraction Ye ~ 0.5). However, this limit may be circumvented in sufficiently dense neutron-rich environments (Ye &lt;&lt; 0.5) for which Mch ~ Ye^2 is reduced to &lt; Msun. Such physical conditions could arise in the black hole accretion disks formed from the collapse of rapidly-rotating stars (``collapsars''), as a result of gravitational instabilities and cooling-induced fragmentation, similar to models for planet formation in protostellar disks. We confirm that the conditions to form sub-solar mass NS (ssNS) may be marginally satisfied in the outer regions of massive neutrino-cooled collapsar disks. If the disk fragments into multiple ssNS, their subsequent coalescence offers a channel for precipitating sub-solar mass LIGO/Virgo gravitational-wave mergers that does not implicate primordial black holes. The model makes several additional predictions: (1) ~Hz frequency Doppler modulation of the ssNS-merger gravitational wave signals due to the binary's orbital motion in the disk; (2) at least one additional gravitational wave event (coincident within &lt;~ hours), from the coalescence of the ssNS-merger remnant(s) with the central black hole; (3) an associated gamma-ray burst and supernova counterpart, the latter boosted in energy and enriched with r-process elements from the NS merger(s) embedded within the exploding stellar envelope (``kilonovae inside a supernova'').</description>

      <title>General relativistic viscous accretion flow around a gravitational wave inspired black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physical properties of accretion flows around Konoplya-Zhidenko (KZ) black hole, proposed by deforming Kerr spacetime to address the inaccuracies in the observation of gravitational waves resulting from a binary black hole merger. The dynamical equations describing the general relativistic viscous accreting flow are solved self-consistently to find the transonic accretion solutions in terms of global constants, such as energy ($E$), angular momentum ($\mathcal{L}$), viscosity parameter ($\alpha$), spin ($a_{k}$), and deformation parameter ($\eta_0$). We obtain five distinct types of accretion solutions (O, A, $\text{A}^{\prime}$, W, and I-types) and observe that those solutions are not unique but rather continue to exist for wide range of parameter spaces in the $\mathcal{L}-E$ plane. Furthermore, we find that the viscous accretion flows can harbor shock waves when relativistic shock conditions are satisfied. Consequently, the shock-induced global accretion solutions are obtained and the effect of $\eta_0$ on shock properties, such as shock radius ($r_{\rm sh}$) and change in electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$) across the shock front are investigated. Moreover, we calculate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of accretion flow using the relativistic thermal bremsstrahlung emission coefficient and study the modification of SEDs due to the increase of $\eta_0$ for both shock-induced and shock-free solutions. In addition, it has been noticed that the observable quantities, like quasi-periodic oscillation frequency ($\nu_{\rm QPO}$) and bolometric disc luminosity ($L$), are strongly depend on $\eta_0$. Finally, we phenomenologically show that the KZ black hole is consistent with the observed high-frequency QPOs, commonly observed in black hole binaries and black hole candidates.</description>

      <title>Probing outbursts of the transient neutron star low mass X-ray binary Aql X-1 with NICER: a study of spectral evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray observations of neutron star (NS) low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are useful to probe physical processes close to the NS and to constrain source parameters. Aql X-1 is a transient NS LMXB which frequently undergoes outbursts provides an excellent opportunity to study source properties and accretion mechanism in strong gravity regime over a wide range of accretion rates. In this work, we systematically investigate the spectral evolution of Aql X-1 using NICER observations during the source outbursts in 2019 and 2020. The NICER observations cover the complete transition of the source from its canonical hard state to soft state and back. The spectra extracted from most observations can be explained by a partially Comptonised accretion disc. We find that the system can be described by an accretion disk with an inner temperature of $\approx0.7$ keV and a Comptonising medium of thermal electrons at $\approx2$ keV, while the photon index is strongly degenerate with the covering fraction of the medium. We also find evidence of Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence emission in the spectra indicating reprocessing of the Comptonised photons. We observe an absorption column density higher than the Galactic column density for most of the observations indicating a significant local absorption. But for some of the observations in 2020 outburst, the local absorption is negligible.</description>

      <title>Exploring the nature of the jetted hybrid AGNs: PKS 2004-447, 3C 286 and PKS 0440-00 through the SED modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the connection of three jetted $\gamma-$loud AGNs classes: Compact Steep-Spectrum Sources (CSS), Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1), and Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasars, through the modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED). We selected two sources identified as CSS/NLS1 hybrids, PKS 2004-440 and 3C 286. Additionally, we included the source PKS 0440-00, initially classified as an FSRQ in the first Fermi-LAT catalog, but recently reclassified as an NLS1. We present the results of their broadband SED modeling using a one-zone leptonic synchrotron-self Compton (SSC)+external Compton (EC) model. By exploring the parameter space and investigating the disk-jet connection in these sources, we analyze their classification in a model-dependent way. Our findings reveal that modeling PKS 2004-447 at relatively large angles, as expected for CSS, results in an SSC-dominated inverse Compton emission. In contrast, at low observing angles, the inverse Compton emission is dominated by external photon fields. Both scenarios result in a jet with a low radiative power. For 3C 286 we found that using a one-zone model limits the jet viewing angle to $\sim7^{\circ}$, mainly due to its impact on the $\gamma$-ray emission. Our model results show a magnetically dominated jet, consistent with $\gamma$-CSS sources. Our results suggest that PKS 0440-00, can be classified as a powerful $\gamma-$NLS1, characterized by high accretion power and a jet dominated by bulk motion, similar to FSRQs.</description>

      <title>Inferring the iron K emissivity profiles of accretion discs irradiated by extended coronae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most promising methods to measure the spin of an accreting black hole is fitting the broad iron K$\alpha$ line in the X-ray spectrum. The line profile also depends on the geometry of the hard X-ray emitting corona. To put constraints on the black hole spin and corona geometry, it is essential to understand how do they affect the iron K$\alpha$ line emissivity profile. In this work, we present calculations of the illumination and the iron K$\alpha$ emissivity profiles performed with the Monte-Carlo GR radiative transfer code Monk. We focus on distinction between the illumination and emissivity profiles, which is in most previous studies neglected. We show that especially for the case of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs), the difference is very large. For active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the emissivity profile has a more similar shape as the illumination profile, but it is notably steeper in the innermost region within a few gravitational radii. We find out that the different behavior between AGN and black hole X-ray binary discs is due to the different energy spectra of the illuminating radiation. This suggests that the emissivity profile of the iron K$\alpha$ line cannot be determined by black hole spin and corona geometry alone and the energy spectrum of the illuminating radiation has to be taken into account. We also examined the effect of including the self-irradiation, and find it to be more important than the corona emission in BHXRBs.</description>

      <title>The minimum neutron star mass in neutrino-driven supernova explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova theory has struggled to explain the lightest known neutron star candidate with an accurate mass determination, the $1.174\mathrm{M}_\odot$ companion in the eccentric compact binary system J0453+1559. To improve the theoretical lower limit for neutron star birth masses, we perform 3D supernova simulations for five stellar models close to the minimum mass for iron core collapse. We obtain a record-low neutron star mass of $1.192\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a substantial kick of $\mathord{\sim} 100\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Given residual uncertainties in stellar evolution, a neutron star origin for the $1.174\mathrm{M}_\odot$ object remains plausible.</description>

      <title>X-ray spectral and timing evolution during the 2018 outburst of MAXI J1820+070</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We made use high-cadence observations from the $Insight$-HXMT and $NICER$ to scrutinize the spectral and timing evolution during the 2018 outburst of the black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) MAXI J1820+070. It's hardness-intensity diagram (HID) displays a ''q''-like track including all the spectral states, along a unique loop in the hard state. The tracks observed in the HID is anticipated in the evolution of the components responsible for Compton and reflection emission. This is substantiated by the relationship between the X-ray luminosity $L_\mathrm{X}$ and photon index $\Gamma$, as well as the relationship between X-ray luminosity $L_\mathrm{X}$ and the ratio of Compton to disk luminosities $L_\mathrm{C}/L_\mathrm{D}$. Both of these relationships exhibit a pattern reminiscent of HID. During the hard state, the hardness (also $\Gamma$) is determined by either reflection component ($R_{f}&gt;1$ ) or Compton component ($R_{f}&lt;1$) depending on the value reflection fraction $R_{f}$. So the distinctive evolution of $R_{f}$ leads to the unique loop in the HID (also in the $L_\mathrm{X}$--$\Gamma$ plane) of hard state. Additionally, we found a negative correlation between frequency of the type-C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) ($\nu_{\mathrm{C,QPO}}$) and the optical depth of the Compton emission ($\tau$), and a positive correlation between $\nu_{\mathrm{C,QPO}}$ and $\Gamma$. These correlations strongly suggest a coupling between the QPO properties and the underlying process responsible for Comptonization.</description>

      <title>A Fourth-Order Finite Volume Scheme for Resistive Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a finite-volume, genuinely 4th-order accurate numerical method for solving the equations of resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (Res-RMHD) in Cartesian coordinates. In our formulation, the magnetic field is evolved in time in terms of face-average values via the constrained-transport method while the remaining variables (density, momentum, energy and electric fields) are advanced as cell volume-averages. Spatial accuracy employs 5th-order accurate WENO-Z reconstruction from point values (as described in a companion paper) to obtain left and right states at zone interfaces. Explicit flux evaluation is carried out by solving a Riemann problem at cell interfaces, using the Maxwell-Harten-Lax-van Leer with contact wave resolution (MHLLC). Time stepping is based on the implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta (RK) methods, of which we consider both the 3rd-order strong stability preserving SSP3(4,3,3) and a recent 4th-order additive RK scheme, to cope with the stiffness introduced by the source term in Ampere's law. Numerical benchmarks are presented in order to assess the accuracy and robustness of our implementation.</description>

      <title>Constraints of the maximum mass of quark stars based on post-merger evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We semi-analytically investigate the post-merger evolution of the binary quark star merger. The effective-one-body method is employed to estimate the energy and angular momentum dissipation due to gravitational waves in the inspiral phase. Three major mechanisms of energy and angular momentum dissipation are considered in the post-merger phase: mass outflows, neutrinos, and gravitational waves. The proportion of each mechanism could be determined by baryon number, energy and angular momentum conservation laws as well as the equilibrium model for rotating quark stars. Applying this analysis to the GW170817 event suggests two important conclusions: 1) a remnant quark star whose mass is smaller than the maximum mass of a uniformly rotating quark star can collapse before its rotational energy is dissipated via electromagnetic radiation (i.e., $\sim 100\,\mathrm{s}$) as the angular momentum left in the remnant quark star might not be large enough to sustain the additional self-gravity of the supramassive quark star due to the angular momentum dissipation of mass outflows, neutrinos and gravitational waves; 2) considering a general quark star equation of state model, a constraint on the maximum mass of cold and non-rotating quark stars is found as $M_{\mathrm{TOV}}\lesssim2.35^{+0.07}_{-0.17}\,M_{\odot}$, assuming a delayed collapse occurred before a large fraction of the total rotational energy ($\color{blue} \gtrsim 10^{53}\,$erg) of the merger remnant was deposited into the merger environment for the GW170817 event. These constraints could be improved with future merger events, once there are more evidences on its post-merger evolution channel or information on the amount of post-merger gravitational wave and neutrino emissions inferred from the multi-messenger observations.</description>

      <title>Modeling X-Ray Multi-Reflection in Super-Eddington Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recently discovered that a few super-Eddington sources undergoing black hole super-Eddington accretion exhibit X-ray reflection signatures. In such new systems, one expects that the coronal X-ray emissions are mainly reflected by optically thick super-Eddington winds instead of thin disks. In this paper, we conduct a series of general relativistic ray-tracing and Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations to model the X-ray reflection signatures, especially the characteristic Fe K$\alpha$ line, produced from super-Eddington accretion flows. In particular, we allow the photons emitted by a lamppost corona to be reflected multiple times in a cone-like funnel surrounded by fast winds. We find that the Fe K$\alpha$ line profile most sensitively depends on the wind kinematics, while its exact shape also depends on the funnel open angle and corona height. Furthermore, very interestingly, we find that the Fe K$\alpha$ line can have a prominent double-peak profile in certain parameter spaces even with a face-on orientation. Moreover, we compare the Fe K$\alpha$ line profiles produced from super-Eddington and thin disks and show that such lines can provide important insights into the understanding of black hole systems undergoing super-Eddington accretion.</description>

      <title>Detecting Gravitational Wave Anisotropies from Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations have recently found evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB) permeating our galaxy. The origin of this background is still unknown. Indeed, while the gravitational wave emission from inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB) is the primary candidate for its origin, several cosmological sources have also been proposed. One distinctive feature of SMBHB-generated backgrounds is the presence of GWB anisotropies stemming from the binaries distribution in the local Universe. However, none of the anisotropy searches performed to date reported a detection. In this work, we show that the lack of anisotropy detection is not currently in tension with a SMBHB origin of the background. We accomplish this by calculating the anisotropy detection probability of present and future PTAs. We find that a PTA with the noise characteristics of the NANOGrav 15-year data set had only a $~2\%-11\%$ probability of detecting SMBHB-generated anisotropies, depending on the properties of the SMBHB population. However, we estimate that for the IPTA DR3 data set these probabilities will increase to $~4\%-28\%$, putting more pressure on the SMBHB interpretation in case of a null detection. We also identify SMBHB populations that are more likely to produce detectable levels of anisotropies. This information could be used together with the spectral properties of the GWB to characterize the SMBHB population.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Astrophysical Priors on Parameter Inference for GW230529</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of prior selection on the inferred mass and spin parameters of the neutron star-black hole merger GW230529\_181500. Specifically, we explore models motivated by astrophysical considerations, including massive binary and pulsar evolution. We examine mass and spin distributions of neutron stars constrained by radio pulsar observations, alongside black hole spin observations from previous gravitational wave detections. We show that the inferred mass distribution highly depends upon the spin prior. Specifically, under the most restrictive, binary stellar evolution models, we obtain narrower distributions of masses with a black hole mass of $4.1^{+0.2}_{-0.3} \,M_\odot$ and neutron star mass of $1.3^{+0.1}_{-0.1} \,M_\odot$ where, somewhat surprisingly, it is the prior on component spins which has the greatest impact on the inferred mass distributions. Re-weighting using neutron star mass and spin priors from observations of radio pulsars, with black hole spins from observations of gravitational waves, yields the black hole and the neutron star masses to be $3.8^{+0.5}_{-0.6} \,M_\odot$ and $1.4^{+0.2}_{-0.1} \,M_\odot$ respectively. The sequence of compact object formation -- whether the neutron star or the black hole formed first -- cannot be determined at the observed signal-to-noise ratio.

      <title>Elevated $p_{\rm astro}$: increased significances with multi-messenger coincidences</title>

Abstract: Coincident multi-messenger observation of cosmic sources can offer numerous benefits. One significant advantage is enhancing the detection significance of separate detectors by correlating their data and assuming a joint emission. We have formulated an approach for updating the Bayesian posterior probability of an astrophysical origin, namely $p_{\rm astro}$, relying on multi-messenger coincidences. We demonstrated this with candidate coincident gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos. Applying our method to the public data of candidate coincident high-energy neutrinos with subthreshold gravitational-wave triggers, we found that in the case of highly energetic neutrino coincidences, $p_{\rm astro}$ can increase from approximately $\sim 0.1$ to $\sim 0.9$. This marked improvement makes subthreshold detections much more confident.</description>

      <title>New Wolf-Rayet wind yields and nucleosynthesis of Helium stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong metallicity-dependent winds dominate the evolution of core He-burning, classical Wolf-Rayet (cWR) stars, which eject both H and He-fusion products such as 14N, 12C, 16O, 19F, 22Ne and 23Na during their evolution. The chemical enrichment from cWRs can be significant. cWR stars are also key sources for neutron production relevant for the weak s-process. We calculate stellar models of cWRs at solar metallicity for a range of initial Helium star masses (12-50M), adopting the recent hydrodynamical wind rates from Sander &amp; Vink (2020). Stellar wind yields are provided for the entire post-main sequence evolution until core O-exhaustion. While literature has previously considered cWRs as a viable source of the radioisotope 26Al, we confirm that negligible 26Al is ejected by cWRs since it has decayed to 26Mg or proton-captured to 27Al. However, in Paper I, Higgins et al. (2023) we showed that very massive stars eject substantial quantities of 26Al, among other elements including N, Ne, and Na, already from the zero-age-main-sequence. Here, we examine the production of 19F and find that even with lower mass-loss rates than previous studies, our cWR models still eject substantial amounts of 19F. We provide central neutron densities (Nn) of a 30M cWR compared with a 32M post-VMS WR and confirm that during core He-burning, cWRs produce a significant number of neutrons for the weak s-process via the 22Ne(alpha,n)25Mg reaction. Finally, we compare our cWR models with observed [Ne/He], [C/He] and [O/He] ratios of Galactic WC and WO stars.</description>

      <title>Dynamical transition to spontaneous scalarization in neutron stars: the massive scalar field scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze numerically the dynamical transition to spontaneous scalarization in neutron stars in the framework of a scalar-tensor theory of gravity where the scalar field is free but massive, and it is coupled non minimally to gravity in the Jordan frame. We show that the quasi-static configuration of the star that settles after the transition can avoid the observational constraints imposed on the amount of scalarization by several observations in binary systems due to the presence of the mass term, which suppresses the range of the scalar field. We also study the impact of the scalar field mass on the total mass of the star relative to the massless scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the development of Brans-Dicke gravity, it has become well-known that a conformal transformation of the metric can reformulate this theory, transferring the coupling of the scalar field from the Ricci scalar to the matter sector. Specifically, in this new frame, known as the Einstein frame, Brans-Dicke gravity is reformulated as General Relativity supplemented by an additional scalar field. In 1959, Hans Adolf Buchdahl utilized an elegant technique to derive a set of solutions for the vacuum field equations within this gravitational framework. In this paper, we extend Buchdahl's method to incorporate the cosmological constant and to the scalar-tensor cases beyond the Brans-Dicke archetypal theory, thereby, with a conformal transformation of the metric, obtaining solutions for a version of Brans-Dicke theory that includes a quadratic potential. More specifically, we obtain synchronous solutions in the following contexts: in scalar-tensor gravity with massless scalar fields, Brans-Dicke theory with a quadratic potential, where we obtain specific synchronous metrics to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, the Nariai solution, and a hyperbolically foliated solution.</description>

      <title>Investigating tidal heating in neutron stars via gravitational Raman scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scattering amplitude formalism to study the tidal heating effects of nonspinning neutron stars incorporating both worldline effective field theory and relativistic stellar perturbation theory. In neutron stars, tidal heating arises from fluid viscosity due to various scattering processes in the interior. It also serves as a channel for the exchange of energy and angular momentum between the neutron star and its environment. In the interior of the neutron star, we first derive two master perturbation equations that capture fluid perturbations accurate to linear order in frequency. Remarkably, these equations receive no contribution from bulk viscosity due to a peculiar adiabatic incompressibility which arises in stellar fluid for non-barotropic perturbations. In the exterior, the metric perturbations reduce to the Regge-Wheeler (RW) equation which we solve using the analytical Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) method. We compute the amplitude for gravitational waves scattering off a neutron star, also known as gravitational Raman scattering. From the amplitude, we obtain expressions for the electric quadrupolar static Love number and the leading dissipation number to all orders in compactness. We then compute the leading dissipation number for various realistic equation-of-state(s) and estimate the change in the number of gravitational wave cycles due to tidal heating during inspiral in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) band.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we have studied the effect of three-nucleon interaction on the neutron stars structure. In our calculations, we have considered the neutron star matter as a beta-stable nuclear matter. We have put the results concerning the TBF effect in perspective against two-body results and other calculations of three-nucleon interactions, using the Urbana v14 potential and the parabolic approximation of the nuclear-matter energy for approximating the problem of asymmetric nuclear matter. As such, solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, we have estimated bulk properties of neutron stars and investigated how the present calculations would agree with the expected dynamical-stability condition.</description>

      <title>PhenomGSF: A phenomenological model of gravitational self-force enhanced tides in inspiralling binary neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from inspiralling binary neutron stars provide unique access to ultra-dense nuclear matter and offer the ability to constrain the currently unknown neutron star equation-of-state through tidal measurements. This, however, requires the availability of accurate and efficient tidal waveform models. In this paper we present PhenomGSF, a new phenomenological tidal phase model for the inspiral of neutron stars in the frequency-domain, which captures the gravitational self-force informed tidal contributions of the time-domain effective-one-body model TEOBResumS. PhenomGSF is highly faithful and computationally efficient, and by choosing a modular approach, it can be used in conjunction with any frequency-domain binary black hole waveform model to generate the complete phase for a binary neutron star inspiral. PhenomGSF is valid for neutron star binaries with unequal masses and mass ratios between 1 and 3, and dimensionless tidal deformabilities up to 5000. Furthermore, PhenomGSF does not assume universal relations or parameterised equations-of-state, hence allowing for exotic matter analyses and beyond standard model physics investigations. We demonstrate the efficacy and accuracy of our model through comparisons against TEOBResumS, numerical relativity waveforms and full Bayesian inference, including a reanalysis of the binary neutron star observation GW170817.</description>

Abstract: We present quantum kinetic equations for neutrinos and derive Feynman rules for computing scattering rates involving coherent states. Our rules encompass both flavour- and particle-antiparticle coherence and allow writing down the scattering matrix elements and collision integrals with the same intuitive ease as with the usual non-coherent Feynman rules. Our results are useful for computing collision rates that arise routinely in the context of coherently mixing neutrinos with arbitrary masses. We give several explicit examples, including some collision integrals for coherently mixing neutrinos in supernovae.</description>

      <title>jetsimpy: A Highly Efficient Hydrodynamic Code for Gamma-ray Burst Afterglow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows are emissions from ultrarelativistic blast waves produced by a narrow jet interacting with surrounding matter. Since the first multimessenger observation of a neutron star merger, hydrodynamic modeling of GRB afterglows for structured jets with smoothly varying angular energy distributions has gained increased interest. While the evolution of a jet is well described by self-similar solutions in both ultrarelativistic and Newtonian limits, modeling the transitional phase remains challenging. This is due to the nonlinear spreading of a narrow jet to a spherical configuration and the breakdown of self-similar solutions. Analytical models are limited in capturing these nonlinear effects, while relativistic hydrodynamic simulations are computationally expensive, which restricts the exploration of various initial conditions. In this work, we introduce a reduced hydrodynamic model that approximates the blast wave as an infinitely thin two-dimensional surface. Further assuming axial symmetry, this model simplifies the simulation to one dimension and drastically reduces the computational costs. We have compared our modeling to relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and semianalytic methods, and applied it to fit the light curve and flux centroid motion of GRB 170817A. These comparisons demonstrate good agreement and validate our approach. We have developed this method into a numerical tool, \texttt{jetsimpy}, which models the synchrotron GRB afterglow emission from a blast wave with arbitrary angular energy and Lorentz factor distribution. Although the code is built with GRB afterglow in mind, it applies to any relativistic jet. This tool is particularly useful in Markov Chain Monte Carlo studies and is provided to the community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of seven years of multicolour photometric monitoring of a sample of 31 $\gamma$-ray bright blazars using the RINGO3 polarimeter on the Liverpool Telescope from 2013--2020. We explore the relationships between simultaneous observations of flux in three optical wavebands along with Fermi $\gamma$-ray data in order to explore the radiation mechanisms and particle populations in blazar jets. We find significant correlations between optical and $\gamma$-ray flux with no detectable time lag, suggesting leptonic emission processes in the jets of these sources. Furthermore, we find the spectral behaviour against optical and $\gamma$-ray flux for many sources is best fit logarithmically. This is suggestive of a transition between bluer-/redder-when-brighter into stable-when-brighter behaviour during high activity states; a behaviour that might be missed in poorly sampled data, resulting in apparent linear relationships.</description>

      <title>Accelerated protons produced by magnetic Penrose process in Sgr A*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Typical mechanisms to extract energies from a rotating black hole are the Blandford-Znajek process and the Penrose process. The Penrose process requires a special condition that is difficult to occur in common astrophysical situations. However, the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) does not require such a special condition, and can produce ultra-high energy cosmic rays. When neutrons decay near a rotating black hole, the MPP efficiency of the produced proton is maximized. The supermassive black hole in Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is likely to have a radiatively inefficient accretion flow that is hot enough to produce neutrons by nuclear reactions, which can be subsequently accelerated to high-energy by the MPP. We calculate the production rate of accelerated protons from the Sgr A* to estimated the gamma-ray flux at Earth produced by these accelerated protons and the flux of the accelerated protons themselves transported from Sgr A* to Earth. We find that these very high-energy gamma rays ($E_{\gamma}\gtrsim10\,\mathrm{TeV}$) amount to a significant fraction of the flux of the gamma-ray from the HESS J1745-290 and the central molecular zone around $100\,\mathrm{TeV}$. The accelerated proton flux, when the dimensionless spin parameter $a_{*}=0.5$ and the magnetic field strength in the vicinity of the black hole $B_{0}=100\,\mathrm{G}$, is about $1.6-4.1\%$ of the cosmic ray proton flux from KASCADE experiment at about $1\,\mathrm{PeV}$. Due to the finite decay time of neutrons which need to be transported from the accretion flow to the acceleration zone, our acceleration model can operate only around black holes with mass not much greater than $\sim10^8\,M_\odot$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.07889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imaging algorithms form powerful analysis tools for VLBI data analysis. However, these tools cannot measure certain image features (e.g., ring diameter) by their non-parametric nature. This is unfortunate since these image features are often related to astrophysically relevant quantities such as black hole mass. This paper details a new general image feature extraction technique that applies to a wide variety of VLBI image reconstructions called variational image domain analysis. Unlike previous tools, variational image domain analysis can be applied to any image reconstruction regardless of its structure. To demonstrate its flexibility, we analyze thousands of reconstructions from previous EHT synthetic datasets and recover image features such as diameter, orientation, and asymmetry. By measuring these features, VIDA can help extract astrophysically relevant quantities such as the mass and orientation of M 87.</description>

Abstract: Dark (hidden) photons are widely recognised as well motivated candidates for physics beyond the standard model, and have been invoked for the solution of several outstanding problems, including to account for the dark matter in the universe. In this paper, we consider a simple model for dark photons, which is coupled to ordinary matter only through kinetic mixing with ordinary photons. Within this framework, we calculate the flux of solar dark photons on Earth and revise the potential to detect it with the next generation of axion helioscopes, particularly with the International AXion Observatory (IAXO). This paper extends on previous theoretical analyses in two main ways. Firstly, it includes a more complete analysis of the possible sources of dark photons from the sun, including the contribution of the solar magnetic field and of nuclear processes, and secondly it includes predictions on the parameter space accessible in the gas-filled phase of IAXO.</description>

Abstract: Light hypothetical particles with masses up to $\mathcal{O}(100)\ {\rm MeV}$ can be produced in the core of supernovae. Their subsequent decays to neutrinos can produce a flux component with higher energies than the standard flux. We study the impact of heavy neutral leptons, $Z'$ bosons, in particular ${\rm U(1)}_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ and ${\rm U(1)}_{B-L}$ gauge bosons, and majorons coupled to neutrinos flavor-dependently. We obtain new strong limits on these particles from no events of high-energy SN 1987A neutrinos and their future sensitivities from observations of galactic supernova neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present here an extended nuclear network, with 90 species, designed for being coupled with hydrodynamic simulations, which includes neutrons, protons, electrons, positrons, and the corresponding neutrino and anti-neutrino emission. This network is also coupled with temperature, making it extremely robust and, together with its size, unique of its kind. The inclusion of electron captures on free protons makes the network very appropriate for multidimensional studies of Type Ia supernova explosions, especially when the exploding object is a massive white dwarf.
  The results obtained with the proposed medium-sized network compare fairly well, to a few percent, with those computed with the extended network WinNet (&gt; 2000 isotopes) in scenarios reproducing the gross physical conditions of current Type Ia supernova explosion models. In those cases where the carbon and oxygen fuel ignites at high density, the high-temperature plateau typical of the nuclear statistical equilibrium regime is well defined and stable, allowing large integration time steps. We show that the inclusion of electron captures on free protons substantially improves the estimation of the electron fraction of the mixture. Therefore, the pressure is better determined than in networks where electron captures are excluded, which will ultimately lead to more reliable hydrodynamic models. Explosive combustion of helium at low density, occurring near the surface layer of a white dwarf, is also better described with the proposed network, which gives nuclear energy generation rates much closer to WinNet than typical reduced alpha networks.</description>

Abstract: The Be star zeta Tau was recently reported to be a gamma Cas analog; that is, it displays an atypical (bright and hard) X-ray emission. The origin of these X-rays remains debated.The first X-ray observations indicated a very large absorption of the hot plasma component (N_H~ 10^{23}/cm^2). This is most probably related to the edge-on configuration of the zeta Tau disk. If the X-ray emission arises close to the companion, an orbital modulation of the absorption could be detected as the disk comes in and out of the line of sight. New XMM-Newton data were obtained to characterize the high-energy properties of zeta Tau in more detail. They are complemented by previous Chandra and SRG/eROSITA observations as well as by optical spectroscopy and TESS photometry. The high-quality XMM-Newton data reveal the presence of a faint soft X-ray emission, which appears in line with that recorded for non-gamma Cas Be stars. In addition, zeta Tau exhibits significant short-term variability at all energies, with larger amplitudes at lower frequencies (``red noise''), as is found in X-ray data of other gamma Cas stars. Transient variability (softness dip, low-frequency signal) may also be detected at some epochs. In addition, between X-ray exposures, large variations in the spectra are detected in the 1.5-4.keV energy band. They are due to large changes in absorption toward the hottest (9keV) plasma. These changes are not correlated with either the orbital phase or the depth of the shell absorption of the Halpha line. These observed properties are examined in the light of proposed gamma Cas models.</description>

      <title>Spectro-polarimetric view of the gamma-ray emitting NLS1 1H0323+342</title>

Abstract: The gamma-ray emitting narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies are a unique class of objects that launch powerful jets from relatively lower-mass black hole systems compared to the Blazars. However, the black hole masses estimated from the total flux spectrum suffer from the projection effect, making the mass measurement highly uncertain. The polarized spectrum provides a unique view of the central engine through scattered light. We performed spectro-polarimetric observations of the gamma-ray emitting narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H0323+342 using SPOL/MMT. The degree of polarization and polarization angle is 0.122 $\pm$ 0.040 % and 142 $\pm$ 9 degrees, while the H$\alpha$ line is polarized at 0.265 $\pm$ 0.280 %. We decomposed the total flux spectrum and estimated broad H$\alpha$ FWHM of 1015 km/s. The polarized flux spectrum shows a broadening similar to the total flux spectrum, with a broadening ratio of 1.22. The Monte Carlo radiative transfer code `STOKES' applied to the data provides the best fit for a small viewing angle of 9-24 degrees and a small optical depth ratio between the polar and the equatorial scatters. A thick BLR with significant scale height can explain a similar broadening of the polarized spectrum compared to the total flux spectrum with a small viewing angle.</description>
