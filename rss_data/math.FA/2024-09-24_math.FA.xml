      <title>Fibers and Gleason parts for the maximal ideal space of $\mathcal A_u(B_{\ell_p})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the early nineties, R. M. Aron, B. Cole, T. Gamelin and W.B. Johnson initiated the study of the maximal ideal space (spectrum) of Banach algebras of holomorphic functions defined on the open unit ball of an infinite dimensional complex Banach space. Within this framework, we investigate the fibers and Gleason parts of the spectrum of the algebra of holomorphic and uniformly continuous functions on the unit ball of $\ell_p$ ($1\le p&lt;\infty$). We show that the inherent geometry of these spaces provides a fundamental ingredient for our results. We prove that whenever $p\in\mathbb N$ ($p\ge 2$), the fiber of every $z\in B_{\ell_p}$ contains a set of cardinal $2^{\mathfrak c}$ such that any two elements of this set belong to different Gleason parts. For the case $p=1$, we complete the known description of the fibers, showing that, for each $z\in\overline B_{\ell_1''}\setminus S_{\ell_1}$, the fiber over $z$ is not a singleton. Also, we establish that different fibers over elements in $S_{\ell_1''}$ cannot share Gleason parts.</description>

      <title>Orthonormal Strichartz inequalities and their applications on abstract measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to extend certain fundamental inequalities from a single function to a family of orthonormal systems. In the first part of the paper, we consider a non-negative, self-adjoint operator $L$ on $L^2(X,\mu)$, where $(X,\mu)$ is a measure space. Under the assumption that the kernel $K_{it}(x,y)$ of the Schr\"{o}dinger propagator $e^{itL}$ satisfies a uniform $L^\infty$-decay estimate of the form
  \begin{equation*}
  \sup_{x,y\in X}|K_{it}(x,y)|\lesssim |t|^{-\frac{n}{2}},\,|t|&lt;T_0, \text{ for some }n\geq1,
  \end{equation*} where $T_0\in(0,+\infty]$, we establish Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"{o}dinger propagator $e^{itL}$ and using a duality principle argument by Frank-Sabin \cite{FS}, we extend it for a system of infinitely many fermions on $L^2(X)$. We also obtain orthonormal Strichartz estimates for a class of dispersive semigroup $U(t)=e^{it\phi(L)}\psi(\sqrt{L}),$ where $\phi: \mathbb{R}^+\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a smooth function and $\psi\in C_c^\infty([\frac{1}{2},2])$. As an application of these orthonormal versions of Strichartz estimates, we prove the well-posedness for the Hartree equation in the Schatten spaces.
  In the next part of the paper, we obtain some new orthonormal Strichartz estimates, which extend prior work of Kenig-Ponce-Vega \cite{Kenig-Ponce-Vega} for single functions. Using those orthonormal versions of Kenig-Ponce-Vega result, we prove the orthonormal restriction theorem for the Fourier transform on some particular noncompact hypersurface of the form $S=\{(\xi, \phi(\xi): \xi\in \mathbb{R})\}$, where $\phi$ satisfies certain growth condition.</description>

      <title>Operators on anti-dual pairs: Lebesgue decomposition via Arlinskii's iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to prove a general Lebesgue decomposition theorem for positive operators on so-called anti-dual pairs, following the iterative approach introduced by Arlinskii. This procedure and the resulting theorem encompass several special cases, including positive operators on Hilbert spaces, non-negative forms on vector spaces, and representable functionals over *-algebras.</description>

      <title>Contractivity of M\"obius functions of operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a injective bounded linear operator on a complex Hilbert space. We characterize the complex numbers $\lambda,\mu$ for which $(I+\lambda T)(I+\mu T)^{-1}$ is a contraction, the characterization being expressed in terms of the numerical range of the possibly unbounded operator $T^{-1}$. When $T=V$, the Volterra operator on $L^2[0,1]$, this leads to a result of Khadkhuu, Zem\'anek and the second author, characterizing those $\lambda,\mu$ for which $(I+\lambda V)(I+\mu V)^{-1}$ is a contraction. Taking $T=V^n$, we further deduce that $(I+\lambda V^n)(I+\mu V^n)^{-1}$ is never a contraction if $n\ge2$ and $\lambda\ne\mu$.</description>

      <title>On the Crouzeix ratio for $N\times N$ matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Crouzeix ratio $\psi(A)$ of an $N\times N$ complex matrix $A$ is the supremum of $\|p(A)\|$ taken over all polynomials $p$ such that $|p|\le 1$ on the numerical range of $A$. It is known that $\psi(A)\le 1+\sqrt{2}$, and it is conjectured that $\psi(A)\le 2$. In this note, we show that $\psi(A)\le C_N$, where $C_N$ is a constant depending only on $N$ and satisfying $C_N&lt;1+\sqrt{2}$. The proof is based on a study of the continuity properties of the map $A\mapsto \psi(A)$.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous approximation by neural network operators with applications to Voronovskaja formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we considered the problem of the simultaneous approximation of a function and its derivatives by means of the well-known neural network (NN) operators activated by sigmoidal function. Other than a uniform convergence theorem, we also provide a quantitative estimate for the order of approximation based on the modulus of continuity of the approximated derivative, including an asymptotic term depending on the decay behavior of the sigmoidal function and its derivatives. Furthermore, a qualitative and quantitative Voronovskaja-type formula is established, which provides information about the high order of approximation that can be achieved by NN operators. At the end of the paper, noteworthy examples have been discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Commutants of the sum of two quasihomogeneous Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major open question in the theory of Toeplitz operator on the Bergman space of the unit disk of the complex plane is the complete characterization of the set of all Toeplitz operators that commute with a given operator. In \cite{al}, the authors showed that when a sum $S=T_{e^{im\theta}f}+T_{e^{il\theta}g}$, where $f$ and $g$ are radial functions, commutes with a sum $T=T_{e^{ip\theta}r^{(2M+1)p}}+T_{e^{is\theta}r^{(2N+1)s}}$, then $S$ must be of the form $S=cT$, where $c$ is a constant. In this article, we will replace $r^{(2M+1)p}$ and $r^{(2N+1)s}$ with $r^n$ and $r^d$, where $n$ and $d$ are in $\mathbb{N}$, and we will show that the same result holds.</description>

      <title>On the faithful flatness of some modules arising in analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of faithful flatness of a module over a commutative ring is studied for two $R$-modules $M$ arising in functional analysis, where $R$ is a Banach algebra and $M$ is a Hilbert space. The following results are shown:
  If $X$ is a locally compact Hausdorff topological space, and $\mu$ is a positive Radon measure on $X$, then $L^2(X,\mu)$ is a flat $L^\infty(X,\mu)$-module.
  Moreover:
  (1) If $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite, then for every finitely generated, nonzero, proper ideal $\mathfrak{n}$ of $L^\infty(X,\mu)$, there holds $\mathfrak{n}L^2(X,\mu)\subsetneq L^2(X,\mu)$.
  (2) If $X$ is the union of an increasing family of Borel sets $U_n$, $n\in \mathbb{N}$, such that for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$, $\overline{U_n}$ is compact and $\mu(U_{n+1}\setminus U_n)&gt;0$, then $L^2(X,\mu)$ is not a faithfully flat $L^\infty(X,\mu)$-module.
  It is shown that the Hardy space $H^2$ is a flat, but not a faithfully flat $H^\infty$-module. This answers Alban Quadrat's question from 2005, and is based on an outline answer given by Donald Sarason.</description>

      <title>Typical properties of positive contractions and the invariant subspace problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first study some elementary properties of a typical positive contraction on $\ell_q$ for the Strong Operator Topology and the Strong* Operator Topology. Using these properties we prove that a typical positive contraction on $\ell_1$ (resp. on $\ell_2$) has a non-trivial invariant subspace for the Strong Operator Topology (resp. for the Strong Operator Topology and the Strong* Operator Topology). We then focus on the case where $X$ is a Banach space with a basis. We prove that a typical positive contraction on a Banach space with an unconditional basis has no non-trivial closed invariant ideals for the Strong Operator Topology and the Strong* Operator Topology. In particular this shows that when $X = \ell_q$ with $1 \leq q &lt; \infty$, a typical positive contraction $T$ on $X$ for the Strong Operator Topology (resp. for the Strong* Operator Topology when $1 &lt; q &lt; \infty$) does not satisfy the Abramovich, Aliprantis and Burkinshaw criterion, that is there is no non-zero positive operator in the commutant of $T$ which is quasinilpotent at a non-zero positive vector of $X$. Finally we prove that, for the Strong* Operator Topology, a typical positive contraction on a reflexive Banach space with a monotone basis does not satisfy the Abramovich, Aliprantis and Burkinshaw criterion.</description>

      <title>On positive norm-attaining operators between Banach lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the norm-attainment of positive operators between Banach lattices. By considering an absolute version of James boundaries, we prove that: If $E$ is a reflexive Banach lattice whose order is given by a basis and $F$ is a Dedekind complete Banach lattice, then every positive operator from $E$ to $F$ is compact if and only if every positive operator from $E$ to $F$ attains its norm. An analogue result considering that $E$ is reflexive and the order in $F$ is continuous and given by a basis was proven. We applied our result to study a positive version of the weak maximizing property.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We verify the continuity of the Riesz transform from the operator related Hardy space to $L^1$ - Lebesgue space of integrable functions. For the standard Euclidean Laplace operator, this is a classical result that plays a significant role in harmonic analysis and theory of singular integral operators. Here, we consider a one-dimensional model of manifolds with ends and external Dirichlet boundary operators. This setting extends the work of Hassell and the third author. Specifically, we examine the real line with the measure $|x|^{n-1}dx$ leading to various versions of Bessel operators. For integer $n$, this mimics the measure on Euclidean $n$-dimensional space and the obtained results are expected to provide good predictions for a class of Riemannian manifolds with Euclidean ends.</description>

We derive basic convergence results for both the series and study the asymptotic convergence behaviour.

      <title>Engineering SSF with singularities for self-adjoint operators on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the properties of the spectral shift function (SSF) for some dispersive self-adjoint operators under suitable compact perturbations. New mechanisms allowing the SSF to have singularities at the thresholds are exhibited, based on the degeneracy of the spectrum of the unperturbed operator. In particular, we show how any desired type of singularities can be engineered in this situation. These results are completed by Levinson type results.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Lipschitz free space of a countable simplicial quasi-tree is isomorphic to $\ell^1$. As a consequence, every finitely generated group with Property (QT) of Bestvina--Bromberg--Fujiwara has a proper uniformly Lipschitz affine action on $\ell^1$ with quasi-isometrically embedded orbits.

      <description>arXiv:2409.14214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study inequalities on the volume of Minkowski sum in the class of anti-blocking bodies. We prove analogues of Pl\"unnecke-Ruzsa type inequality and V. Milman inequality on the concavity of the ratio of volumes of bodies and their projections. We also study Firey $L_p-$sums of anti-blocking bodies and prove Pl\"unnecke-Ruzsa type inequality; V. Milman inequality and Roger-Shephard inequality. The sharp constants are provided in all of those inequalities, for the class of anti-blocking bodies. Finally, we extend our results to the case of unconditional product measures with decreasing density.</description>

      <title>A Sharp Entropy Condition For The Density Of Angular Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a holomorphic self-map of the unit disc. We show that if $\log (1-\lvert f(z) \rvert)$ is integrable on a sub-arc of the unit circle, $I$, then the set of Carath\'eodory angular derivatives of $f$ on $I$ is a countable union of Beurling-Carleson sets of finite entropy. Conversely, given a countable union of Beurling-Carleson sets, $E$, we construct a holomorphic self-map of the unit disc, such that its set of Carath\'eodory angular derivatives is equal to $E$ and $\log(1-\lvert f(z) \rvert)$ is integrable on the unit circle. Our main technical tools are the Aleksandrov disintegration Theorem and a characterization of countable unions of Beurling-Carleson sets due to Makarov and Nikolski.</description>

      <title>Campanato spaces via quantum Markov semigroups on finite von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Campanato spaces associated with quantum Markov semigroups on a finite von Neumann algebra $\mathcal M$.
  Let $\mathcal T=(T_{t})_{t\geq0}$ be a Markov semigroup, $\mathcal P=(P_{t})_{t\geq0}$ the subordinated Poisson semigroup and
  $\alpha&gt;0$. The column Campanato space ${\mathcal{L}^{c}_{\alpha}(\mathcal{P})}$ associated to $\mathcal P$ is defined to be the subset of $\mathcal M$ with finite norm which is given by \begin{align*} \|f\|_{\mathcal{L}^{c}_{\alpha}(\mathcal{P})}=\left\|f\right\|_{\infty}+\sup_{t&gt;0}\frac{1}{t^{\alpha}}\left\|P_{t}|(I-P_{t})^{[\alpha]+1}f|^{2}\right\|^{\frac{1}{2}}_{\infty}. \end{align*} The row space ${\mathcal{L}^{r}_{\alpha}(\mathcal{P})}$ is defined in a canonical way. In this article, we will first show the surprising coincidence of these two spaces ${\mathcal{L}^{c}_{\alpha}(\mathcal{P})}$ and ${\mathcal{L}^{r}_{\alpha}(\mathcal{P})}$ for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;2$. This equivalence of column and row norms is generally unexpected in the noncommutative setting. The approach is to identify both of them as the Lipschitz space ${\Lambda_{\alpha}(\mathcal{P})}$. This coincidence passes to the little Campanato spaces $\ell^{c}_{\alpha}(\mathcal{P})$ and $\ell^{r}_{\alpha}(\mathcal{P})$ for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\frac{1}{2}$ under the condition $\Gamma^{2}\geq0$.
  We also show that any element in ${\mathcal{L}^{c}_{\alpha}(\mathcal{P})}$ enjoys the higher order cancellation property, that is, the index $[\alpha]+1$ in the definition of the Campanato norm can be replaced by any integer greater than $\alpha$. It is a surprise that this property holds without further condition on the semigroup. Lastly, following Mei's work on BMO, we also introduce the spaces ${\mathcal{L}^{c}_{\alpha}(\mathcal{T})}$ and explore their connection with ${\mathcal{L}^{c}_{\alpha}(\mathcal{P})}$. All the above-mentioned results seem new even in the (semi-)commutative case.</description>

      <title>Constructing Nearby Commuting Matrices for Ogata's Theorem on Macroscopic Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resolving a conjecture of von Neumann, Ogata's theorem in arXiv:1111.5933 showed the highly nontrivial result that arbitrarily many matrices corresponding to macroscopic observables with $N$ sites and a fixed site dimension $d$ are asymptotically nearby commuting observables as $N \to \infty$. We develop a method to construct nearby commuting matrices for normalized highly reducible representations of $su(2)$ whose multiplicities of irreducible subrepresentations exhibit a certain monotonically decreasing behavior. We then provide a constructive proof of Ogata's theorem for site dimension $d=2$ with explicit estimates for how close the nearby observables are. Moreover, motivated by the application to time-reversal symmetry explored in arXiv:1012.3494, our construction has the property that real macroscopic observables are asymptotically nearby real commuting observables.
  This thesis also contains an introduction to the prerequisite matrix analysis for understanding the proof of the results gotten, a primer on the functional analysis of $C^\ast$-algebras frequently used in the literature of almost commuting operators, a detailed discussion of the history and main results in the problem of almost commuting matrices, a review of the basics of measurement of observables in finite dimensional quantum mechanical systems, and a discussion of the uncertainty principle for non-commuting bounded operators with some results obtained for observables with nearby commuting approximants.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{B}(H)$ be the bounded, linear operators on a separable Hilbert space equipped with the norm topology. A property is called typical if the set of operators fulfilling the property is co-meager. We show that having non-empty continuous spectrum is a typical property and that the operators with non-empty point spectrum form a nowhere dense set. In addition we show that the set of operators with empty point spectrum is dense and characterize the closure of the set of those operators for which the spectrum and the point spectrum coincide.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we will characterize those sets, over which every irreducible complete Nevanlinna--Pick space enjoys that its multiplier and supremum norms coincide. Moreover, we will prove that, if there exists an irreducible complete Nevanlinna--Pick space of holomorphic functions on a reduced complex space $X$ whose multiplier algebra is isometrically equal to the algebra of bounded holomorphic functions (we will say that such a space is of $\textbf{Hardy type}$ in this paper), then $X$ must be biholomorphic to the unit disk minus a zero analytic capacity set. This means that the Hardy space is characterized as a unique irreducible complete Nevanlinna--Pick space of Hardy type.</description>

      <title>Operator orbit frames and frame-like Fourier expansions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frames in a Hilbert space that are generated by operator orbits are vastly studied because of the applications in dynamic sampling and signal recovery. We demonstrate in this paper a representation theory for frames generated by operator orbits that provides explicit constructions of the frame and the operator when the operators are not surjective. It is known that the Kaczmarz algorithm for stationary sequences in Hilbert spaces generates a frame that arises from an operator orbit where the operator is not surjective. In this paper, we show that every frame generated by a not surjective operator in any Hilbert space arises from the Kaczmarz algorithm. Furthermore, we show that the operators generating these frames are similar to rank one perturbations of unitary operators. After this, we describe a large class of operator orbit frames that arise from Fourier expansions for singular measures. Moreover, we classify all measures that possess frame-like Fourier expansions arising from two-sided operator orbit frames. Finally, we show that measures that possess frame-like Fourier expansions arising from two-sided operator orbits are weighted Lebesgue measure with weight satisfying a weak $A_{2}$ condition, even in the non-frame case. We also use these results to classify measures with other types of frame-like Fourier expansions.</description>

Abstract: Let K denote a simply connected compact Lie group and let G denote its complexification. It is known that there exists an LK-biinvariant probability measure on a natural completion of the complex loop group LG. It is believed that there exist deformations which are positive line bundle valued and reproduce the unitary structure for (projective) positive energy representations of LK. These are notes which supplement lectures I have given on these measures, explaining a number of conjectures concerning how these measures are characterized, how they are computed, and how they are potentially useful for formulating quantum sigma models.</description>

      <title>The scalar $T1$ theorem for pairs of doubling measures fails for Riesz transforms when p not 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for an individual Riesz transform in the setting of doubling measures, the scalar $T1$ theorem fails when $p \neq 2$: for each $ p \in (1, \infty) \setminus \{2\}$, we construct a pair of doubling measures $(\sigma, \omega)$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ with doubling constant close to that of Lebesgue measure that also satisfy the scalar $\mathcal{A}_p$ condition and the full scalar $L^p$-testing conditions for an individual Riesz transform $R_j$, and yet $\left ( R_j \right )_{\sigma} : L^p (\sigma) \not \to L^p (\omega)$.
  On the other hand, a quadratic, or vector-valued, $T1$ theorem holds when $p \neq 2$ on pairs of doubling measures. Namely, we improve upon the quadratic $T1$ theorem of Sawyer-Wick and dispense with their vector-valued weak boundedness property to show that for pairs of doubling measures, the two-weight $L^p$ norm inequality for the vector Riesz transform is characterized by a quadratic Muckenhoupt condition $A_{p} ^{\ell^2, \operatorname{local}}$, and a quadratic testing condition.
  Finally, in the appendix, we use constructions of \cite{KaTr} to show that the two-weight norm inequality for the maximal function cannot be characterized solely by the $A_p$ condition when the measures are doubling, contrary to reports in the literature.</description>

Abstract: By means of hypercyclic operator theory, we complement our previous results on hypercyclic holomorphic maps between complex Euclidean spaces having slow growth rates,by showing {\it abstract abundance} rather than {\it explicit existence}. Next, we establish that, in the space of holomorphic maps from $\mathbb{C}^n$ to any connected Oka manifold $Y$, equipped with the compact-open topology, there exists a {\em dense} subset consisting of common {\em frequently hypercyclic} elements for all nontrivial translation operators. To our knowledge, this is new even for $n=1$ and $Y=\mathbb{C}$.</description>

For all negative plurisubharmonic functions $\psi$ satisfying that $\psi$ is close to $\varphi$ in the $L^1(\Omega)$ norm. Using the recent results about $L^2-$estimate for $\overline{\partial}-$equation and strong openness conjecture, we prove that there exists a holomorphic function $g$ belonging to $L^{2}( \Omega, \psi)$ such that $g$ is close to $f$ in the $L^2$ norm on some relatively compact open subset $\Omega^{'}$ of $\Omega.$</description>

      <title>Entanglement-assisted classical capacities of some channels acting as radial multipliers on fermion algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15440v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a new class of unital quantum channels on $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$, acting as radial multipliers when we identify the matrix algebra $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$ with a finite-dimensional fermion algebra. Our primary contribution lies in the precise computation of the (optimal) rate at which classical information can be transmitted through these channels from a sender to a receiver when they share an unlimited amount of entanglement. Our approach relies on new connections between fermion algebras with the $n$-dimensional discrete hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$. Significantly, our calculations yield exact values applicable to the operators of the fermionic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. This advancement not only provides deeper insights into the structure and behaviour of these channels but also enhances our understanding of Quantum Information Theory in a dimension-independent context.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend two celebrated inequalities by Busemann -- the random simplex inequality and the intersection inequality -- to both complex and quaternionic vector spaces. Our proof leverages a monotonicity property under symmetrization with respect to complex or quaternionic hyperplanes. Notably, we demonstrate that the standard Steiner symmetrization, contrary to assertions in a paper by Grinberg, does not exhibit this monotonicity property.</description>

Brevig, Chirre, Ortega-Cerd\`a, and Seip have recently shown that $\mathscr{C}_p&lt;p/2$ for all $p&gt;2$. We improve this bound for $2&lt;p \leq 5$ by solving an optimization problem.</description>
