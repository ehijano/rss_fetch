      <title>Random Features Hopfield Networks generalize retrieval to previously unseen examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recently shown that a learning transition happens when a Hopfield Network stores examples generated as superpositions of random features, where new attractors corresponding to such features appear in the model. In this work we reveal that the network also develops attractors corresponding to previously unseen examples generated with the same set of features. We explain this surprising behaviour in terms of spurious states of the learned features: we argue that, increasing the number of stored examples beyond the learning transition, the model also learns to mix the features to represent both stored and previously unseen examples. We support this claim with the computation of the phase diagram of the model.</description>

      <title>Zero-temperature Monte Carlo simulations of two-dimensional quantum spin glasses guided by neural network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A continuous-time projection quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed to simulate the ground state of a short-range quantum spin-glass model, namely, the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson Hamiltonian with transverse field, featuring Gaussian nearest-neighbor couplings. We numerically demonstrate that guiding wave functions based on self-learned neural networks suppress the population control bias below modest statistical uncertainties, at least up to a hundred spins. By projecting a two-fold replicated Hamiltonian, the spin overlap is determined. A finite-size scaling analysis is performed to estimate the critical transverse field where the spin-glass transition occurs, as well as the critical exponents of the correlation length and the spin-glass susceptibility. For the latter two, good agreement is found with recent estimates from the literature for different random couplings. We also address the spin-overlap distribution within the spin-glass phase, finding that, for the workable system sizes, it displays a non-trivial double-peak shape with large weight at zero overlap.</description>

      <title>Predicting VCSEL Emission Properties Using Transformer Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an innovative approach to predicting VCSEL emission characteristics using transformer neural networks. We demonstrate how to modify the transformer neural network for applications in physics. Our model achieved high accuracy in predicting parameters such as VCSEL's eigenenergy, quality factor, and threshold material gain, based on the laser's structure. This model trains faster and predicts more accurately compared to traditional neural networks. The transformer architecture we propose is also suitable for applications in other fields. A demo version is available for testing at https://abelonovskii.github.io/opto-transformer/.</description>

      <title>Unveiling nonmagnetic phase and many-body entanglement in two-dimensional random quantum magnets Sr$_2$CuTe$_{1-x}$W$_x$O$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a random-plaquette $J_1$-$J_2$ model on the square lattice to capture the physics of a series of spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet compounds Sr$_2$CuTe$_{1-x}$W$_x$O$_6$. With the input of experimentally relevant coupling strengths, our exact diagonalization (ED) study probes the ground state properties beyond previous linear spin-wave approach. An intermediate range of $x \in [0.08, 0.55]$ is identified for a nonmagnetic phase without the long-range N\'eel or stripe order. The absence of both valence-bond-glass order and spin-glass non-ergodic dynamics renders its nature intriguing. Deep inside this phase around $x = 0.3$, we observe signatures potentially linked to randomness-induced short-range spin-liquid-like (SLL) states, including close to zero spin-freezing parameter, vanishing spin-spin correlation beyond nearest neighbors, almost uniform static spin structure factor, as well as a broad tail in the dynamical spin structure factor. The nonmagnetic phase also features multipartite entanglement in the ground state witnessed by quantum Fisher information (QFI), which exhibits universal scaling behaviors at quantum critical points.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian Algorithms for Maximum Independent Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare two quantum Hamiltonian algorithms that address the maximum independent set problem: one based on emergent non-abelian gauge matrix in adiabatic evolution of an energetically isolated manifold of states; and one based on designed application of single-qubit operations. We demonstrate that they are mathematically equivalent, though at first sight they appear quite different. Despite their mathematical equivalence, their most straightforward physical implementations are different. Our numerical simulations show significant differences in performance, and suggest improved experimental protocols.Intriguingly, this equivalence unveils a deeper connection. We also demonstrate that the PXP model, recently prominent in quantum dynamics research, arises as the non-abelian gauge matrix governing quantum diffusion over the median graph of all independent sets.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Coupled Learning in Elastic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupled learning is a contrastive scheme for tuning the properties of individual elements within a network in order to achieve desired functionality of the system. It takes advantage of physics both to learn using local rules and to "compute" the output response to input data, thus enabling the system to perform decentralized computation without the need for a processor or external memory. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept mechanical network that can learn simple tasks such as self-symmetrizing via iterative tuning of individual spring rest lengths. These mechanical networks could feasibly be scaled and automated to solve increasingly complex tasks, hinting at a new class of smart metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Information limits and Thouless-Anderson-Palmer equations for spiked matrix models with structured noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a prototypical problem of Bayesian inference for a structured spiked model: a low-rank signal is corrupted by additive noise. While both information-theoretic and algorithmic limits are well understood when the noise is a Gaussian Wigner matrix, the more realistic case of structured noise still proves to be challenging. To capture the structure while maintaining mathematical tractability, a line of work has focused on rotationally invariant noise. However, existing studies either provide sub-optimal algorithms or are limited to special cases of noise ensembles. In this paper, using tools from statistical physics (replica method) and random matrix theory (generalized spherical integrals) we establish the first characterization of the information-theoretic limits for a noise matrix drawn from a general trace ensemble. Remarkably, our analysis unveils the asymptotic equivalence between the rotationally invariant model and a surrogate Gaussian one. Finally, we show how to saturate the predicted statistical limits using an efficient algorithm inspired by the theory of adaptive Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) equations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical control in a prethermalized molecular ultracold plasma: Local dissipation drives global relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prethermalization occurs as an important phase in the dynamics of many-body systems when strong coupling drives a quasi-equilibrium in a subspace separated from the thermodynamic equilibrium by the restriction of a gap in energy or other conserved quantity. Here, we report the signature of an enduring prethermal regime of arrested relaxation in the molecular ultracold plasma that forms following the avalanche of a state-selected Rydberg gas of nitric oxide. Electron collisions mix orbital angular momentum, scattering Rydberg molecules to states of very high-$\ell$. Spontaneous predissociation purifies this non-penetrating character, creating an extraordinary gap between the plasma states of $n \approx \ell$, with measured $n&gt;200$ and penetrating states of $\ell = 0, ~1$ and 2. Evolution to a statistically equilibrated state of N and O atoms cannot occur without Rydberg electron penetration, and this gap blocks relaxation for a millisecond or more. Evolving through the critical phase, electrons that balance the NO$^+$ charge behave as though localized in the prethermal phase and play an ineffective role in bridging this gap. However, the application of a weak radiofrequency (RF) field promotes a dramatic degree of relaxation owing to electron collisions. On an entirely different scale, exciting a quantum-state transition in an exceedingly small fraction of the molecules in the prethermalized ensemble acts with even greater effect to drive the entire system toward equilibrium. We ascribe this to dissipative character added to a small fraction of the states in the prethermally localized ensemble. Using the Lindblad master equation, we illustrate qualitatively similar dynamics for a toy model of an open quantum system that consists of a localized set of spins on which dissipation acts locally at a single site.</description>

      <title>Probing Random-Bond Disorder Effects on Ferromagnetic Skyrmion Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examined the impact of disorder in a ferromagnetic skyrmion lattice by introducing random-bond disorder based on two different models for both exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions: Model I, where both interactions present the same disorder distribution and thus the same local distortion, and Model II, where both interactions have different disorder distributions. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we explored the effect of bond disorder on the emergent phases induced by an external magnetic field at different temperatures, varying the disorder amplitude across a range from weak (10%) to strong (200%) regimes. Our study shows that for both models, moderate disorder at low magnetic fields breaks the helical order and induces a topologically non-trivial bimeron phase. We also found that the skyrmion lattice phase loses its periodicity, but surprisingly, the resulting phases retain topological characteristics up to high disorder amplitudes. Moreover, a significant difference between both disorder models is found at large magnetic fields: while in the first model, the high-field skyrmion phase is suppressed by disorder, in the second model, this phase is enhanced and expanded in temperature and magnetic field. Furthermore, for the second model, intermediate values of disorder induce a diluted skyrmion phase and chiral textures emerging from the ferromagnetic phase at low temperatures. Our results are relevant for layered magnets and provide valuable insights into the intricate behavior of skyrmion systems under varying disorder conditions.</description>
