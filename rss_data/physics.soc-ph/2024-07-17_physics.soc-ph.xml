      <title>Unveiling Scaling Laws in the Regulatory Functions of Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online platforms like Reddit, Wikipedia, and Facebook are integral to modern life, enabling content creation and sharing through posts, comments, and discussions. Despite their virtual and often anonymous nature, these platforms need rules and oversight to maintain a safe and productive environment. As these communities grow, a key question arises: how does the need for regulatory functions scale? Do larger groups require more regulatory actions and oversight per person, or can they manage with less? Our analysis of Reddit's regulatory functions reveals robust scaling relationships across different subreddits, suggesting universal patterns between community size and the amount of regulation needed. We found that the number of comments and moderator actions, such as comment removals, grew faster than the community size, with superlinear exponents of 1.12 and 1.18, respectively. However, bot-based rule enforcement did not keep pace with community growth, exhibiting a slightly sublinear exponent of 0.95. Further analysis of the residuals from these scaling behaviors identified a 'trade-off axis,' where one-way coordination mechanisms (bots and moderators) counteract two-way interactions (comments) and vice versa. Our findings suggest that a more proactive moderation approach, characterized by increased bot activity and moderator comment removals, tends to result in less user engagement under the scaling framework. Understanding these natural scaling patterns and interactions can help platform administrators and policymakers foster healthy online communities while mitigating harmful behaviors such as harassment, doxxing, and misinformation. Without proper regulation, these negative behaviors can proliferate and cause significant damage. Targeted interventions based on these insights are key to ensuring online platforms remain safe and beneficial spaces.</description>

      <title>Explicit solutions of the Bass and SI models on hypernetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the Bass model and the Susceptible-Infected (SI) model on hypergraphs with 3-body interactions. We derive the master equations for general hypernetworks, and use them to obtain explicit expressions for the expected adoption/infection level on infinite complete hypernetworks, infinite Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi hypernetworks, and on infinite hyperlines. These expressions are exact, as they are derived without making any approximation.</description>

      <title>American cities are defined by isolated rings and pockets characterized by limited socio-economic mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cities generate gains from interaction, but citizens often experience segregation as they move around the urban environment. Using GPS location data, we identify four distinct patterns of experienced segregation across US cities. Most common are affluent or poor neighborhoods where visitors lack diversity and residents have limited exposure to diversity elsewhere. Less frequent are majority-minority areas where residents must travel for diverse encounters, and wealthy urban zones with diverse visitors but where locals sort into homogeneous amenities. By clustering areas with similar mobility signatures, we uncover rings around cities and internal pockets where intergroup interaction is limited. Using a decision tree, we show that demography and location interact to create these zones. Our findings, persistent across time and prevalent across US cities, highlight the importance of considering both who is mixing and where in urban environments. Understanding the mesoscopic patterns that define experienced segregation in America illuminates neighborhood advantage and disadvantage, enabling interventions to foster economic opportunity and urban dynamism.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates city dynamics employing a nonextensive diffusion equation suited for addressing diffusion within a fractal medium, where the nonadditive parameter, $q$, plays a relevant role. The findings demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in determining the relation between the fractal dimension of the city, the allometric exponent and $q$, and elucidating the stationary phase of urban evolution. The dynamic methodology facilitates the correlation of the fractal dimension with both the entropic index and the urban scaling exponent identified in data analyses. The results reveal that the scaling behaviour observed in cities aligns with the fractal dimension measured through independent methods. Moreover, the interpretation of these findings underscores the intimate connection between the fractal dimension and social interactions within the urban context. This research contributes to a deeper comprehension of the intricate interplay between human behaviour, urban dynamics, and the underlying fractal nature of cities.</description>

      <title>Exploring the interplay of individual traits and interaction dynamics in preschool social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several studies have investigated human interaction using modern tracking techniques for face-to-face encounters across various settings and age groups. However, little attention has been given to understanding how individual characteristics relate to social behavior. This is particularly important in younger age groups due to its potential effects on early childhood development. In this study, conducted during the Complexity 72h Workshop, we analyze human social interactions in a French preschool, where children's face-to-face interactions were monitored using proximity sensors over an academic year. We use metadata from parent surveys and preschool linguistic tests, covering demographic information and home habits, to examine the interplay between individual characteristics and contact patterns. Using a mixture of approaches, from random forest classifiers to network-based metrics at both dyadic and higher-order (group) levels, we identify sex, age, language scores, and number of siblings as the variables displaying the most significant associations with interaction patterns. We explore these variables' relationships to interactions within and outside classrooms and across mixed and single-grade classes. At the group level, we investigate how group affinity affects group persistence. We also find that higher-order network centrality (hypercoreness) is higher among children with siblings, indicating different group embedding despite similar total contact duration. This study aligns with existing literature on early social development and highlights the importance of integrating individual traits into the study of human interactions. Focusing on 2-5-year-olds offers insights into emerging social preferences during critical phases of cognitive development. Future research could use these findings to enhance mechanistic models of complex social systems by incorporating individual traits.</description>

      <title>Physical partisan proximity outweighs online ties in predicting US voting outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affective polarization and increasing social divisions affect social mixing and the spread of information across online and physical spaces, reinforcing social and electoral cleavages and influencing political outcomes. Here, using aggregated and de-identified co-location and online network data, we investigate the relationship between partisan exposure and voting patterns in the USA by comparing three dimensions of partisan exposure: physical proximity and exposure to the same social contexts, online social ties, and residential sorting. By leveraging various statistical modeling approaches, we consistently find that partisan exposure in the physical space, as captured by co-location patterns, more accurately predicts electoral outcomes in US counties, outperforming online and residential exposures across metropolitan and non-metro areas. Moreover, our results show that physical partisan proximity is the best predictor of voting patterns in swing counties, where the election results are most uncertain. We also estimate county-level experienced partisan segregation and examine its relationship with individuals' demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Focusing on metropolitan areas, our results confirm the presence of extensive partisan segregation in the US and show that offline partisan isolation, both considering physical encounters or residential sorting, is higher than online segregation and is primarily associated with educational attainment. Our findings emphasize the importance of physical space in understanding the relationship between social networks and political behavior, in contrast to the intense scrutiny focused on online social networks and elections.</description>

      <title>The precursor of the critical transitions in majority vote model with the noise feedback from the vote layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11398v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate phase transitions in the Majority-Vote model coupled with noise layers of different structures. We examine the Square lattice and Random-regular networks, as well as their combinations, for both vote layers and noise layers. Our findings reveal the presence of independent third-order transitions in all cases and dependent third-order transitions when critical transitions occur. This suggests that dependent third-order transitions may serve as precursors to critical transitions in non-equilibrium systems. Furthermore, we observe that when the structure of vote layers is local, the coupling between the vote layer and the noise layer leads to the absence of critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Epidemic spreading under game-based self-quarantine behaviors: The different effects of local and global information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the outbreak of an epidemic, individuals may modify their behaviors in response to external (including local and global) infection-related information. However, the difference between local and global information in influencing the spread of diseases remains inadequately explored. Here we study a simple epidemic model that incorporates the game-based self-quarantine behavior of individuals, taking into account the influence of local infection status, global disease prevalence and node heterogeneity (non-identical degree distribution). Our findings reveal that local information can effectively contain an epidemic, even with only a small proportion of individuals opting for self-quarantine. On the other hand, global information can cause infection evolution curves shaking during the declining phase of an epidemic, owing to the synchronous release of nodes with the same degree from the quarantined state. In contrast, the releasing pattern under the local information appears to be more random. This shaking phenomenon can be observed in various types of networks associated with different characteristics. Moreover, it is found that under the proposed game-epidemic framework, a disease is more difficult to spread in heterogeneous networks than in homogeneous networks, which differs from conventional epidemic models.</description>

      <title>Social learning with complex contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a mathematical model that combines the concepts of complex contagion with payoff-biased imitation, to describe how social behaviors spread through a population. Traditional models of social learning by imitation are based on simple contagion -- where an individual may imitate a more successful neighbor following a single interaction. Our framework generalizes this process to incorporate complex contagion, which requires multiple exposures before an individual considers adopting a different behavior. We formulate this as a discrete time and state stochastic process in a finite population, and we derive its continuum limit as an ordinary differential equation that generalizes the replicator equation, the most widely used dynamical model in evolutionary game theory. When applied to linear frequency-dependent games, our social learning with complex contagion produces qualitatively different outcomes than traditional imitation dynamics: it can shift the Prisoner's Dilemma from a unique all-defector equilibrium to either a stable mixture of cooperators and defectors in the population, or a bistable system; it changes the Snowdrift game from a single to a bistable equilibrium; and it can alter the Coordination game from bistability at the boundaries to two internal equilibria. The long-term outcome depends on the balance between the complexity of the contagion process and the strength of selection that biases imitation towards more successful types. Our analysis intercalates the fields of evolutionary game theory with complex contagions, and it provides a synthetic framework that describes more realistic forms of behavioral change in social systems.</description>

      <title>Team careers in science: formation, composition and success of persistent collaborations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Teams are the fundamental units propelling innovation and advancing modern science. A rich literature links the fundamental features of teams, such as their size and diversity, to academic success. However, such analyses fail to capture temporal patterns, treating each group of co-authors as a distinct unit and neglecting the existence of persistent collaborations. By contrast, teams are dynamical entities, made of core members who consistently work together, surrounded by transient members who sporadically participate. Leveraging on a large dataset of over 205 million scientific papers published since 1900, we extract 511,550 core teams of statistically significant persistent collaborations of pairs and larger groups of scientists. We look into `team careers' investigating their trajectories in time, characterizing their formation, productivity and eventual dissolution. We characterize team composition along multiple dimensions, including age, academic affiliation and scientific disciplines. Finally, we investigate the academic impact of persistent collaborations, hallmarking the key compositional features underlying their success. Our work sheds light on the nature of persistent teams, informing researchers, institutions and funding agencies about the dynamics of their formation, evolution and success.</description>
