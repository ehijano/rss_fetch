      <title>Photoluminescent registration of fullerite C$_{60}$ derivatives during chemical interaction with H$_{2}$ and N$_{2}$ molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single crystals of C$_{60}$ saturated with molecular hydrogen and nitrogen were studied using the spectral-luminescent method of registration in the quantum counting mode at a low temperature of 20 K. Previously, it was found that the temperature limit of the adsorption crossover (the transition from the diffusion mechanism of intercalation - physisorption to chemical interaction - chemisorption) for fullerite C$_{60}$ in an H$_{2}$ atmosphere is about 525 K, and in an N$_{2}$ atmosphere 695 K, respectively. At saturation temperatures above those indicated, the process of chemical interaction of impurity molecules and the fullerite matrix occurs with the formation of new compounds. Therefore, saturation was carried out at temperatures of 570 K for hydrogen and 720 K for nitrogen under a pressure of 30 atm. For the first time, the results of registration of photoluminescent radiation at low temperatures from new substances based on fullerite C60 are presented. A mixture of weakly saturated fulleranes C$_{60}$H$_{X}$ was obtained by saturation of hydrogen from the gas phase at a temperature close to the sorption crossover temperature, and their low-temperature photoluminescence was identified for the first time. The analysis of the "blue" shift of the beginning of the spectrum of such radiation allowed us to more accurately attribute the obtained material to the initial segment of the fullerane series. The presence of radiation of the azafullerene dimer (biazafullerene) (C$_{59}$N)$_{2}$ in the spectra of the reaction products of C$_{60}$ with N$_{2}$ was also detected. It was shown that for polycrystalline samples of C$_{60}$ saturated in a nitrogen atmosphere, the characteristic luminescence of biazafullerene with a maximum at 1.53 eV determines the intensity and shape of the entire short-wave part of the emission spectrum of the complex of synthesized substances.</description>

      <title>Device Applications of Heterogeneously Integrated Strain-Switched Ferrimagnets/Topological Insulator/Piezoelectric Stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A family of ferrimagnets (CoV2O4, GdCo, TbCo) exhibits out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy when strained compressively and in-plane magnetic anisotropy when strained expansively (or vice versa). If such a ferrimagnetic thin film is placed on top of a topological insulator (TI) thin film and its magnetic anisotropy is modulated with strain, then interfacial exchange coupling between the ferrimagnet (FM) and the underlying TI will modulate the surface current flowing through the latter. If the strain is varied continuously, the current will also vary continuously and if the strain alternates in time, the current will also alternate with the frequency of the strain modulation, as long as the frequency is not so high that the period is smaller than the switching time of the FM. If the strain is generated with a gate voltage by integrating a piezoelectric underneath the FM/TI stack, then that can implement a transconductance amplifier or a synapse for neuromorphic computation.</description>

      <title>Staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and canting angle in centrosymmetric altermagnetic and ferromagnetic phases: influence on the anomalous Hall effect and Weyl points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple methodology to compute the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) as a function of the canting angles in ferromagnets and altermagnets, starting from a nonmagnetic Hamiltonian obtained from first-principles calculations that preserves the full symmetry of the crystal structure. Magnetism is introduced by including on-site spin splitting, spin-orbit coupling, and spin-canting angles. As a representative material, we study SrRuO$_3$, which supports spin canting and exhibits a sign change of the AHC. In the ferromagnetic phase, the low-energy AHC is found to be close to zero at the Fermi level, in agreement with experimental observations. We show that the dependence of the AHC on the relevant physical parameters is most pronounced in the central region of the electronic bandwidth. We determine the symmetry-allowed components of the AHC for different magnetic orders in the large family of transition-metal perovskite ABO$_3$ compounds with space group $62$, including the spontaneous in-plane anomalous Hall effect. Within density functional theory, we evaluate the range of spin-canting angles in SrRuO$_3$ and demonstrate that it is suppressed as electronic correlations increase. By analyzing the AHC as a function of the canting angle, we find that the collinear magnetic configurations contribute most to the AHC, while spin canting plays a secondary role in determining its magnitude in non-collinear ferromagnets and altermagnets. However, canting can become relevant and induce a sign change of the AHC when the collinear magnetic state exhibits an AHC close to zero. Finally, we investigate the locations of Weyl points in the Brillouin zone and their evolution as a function of the canting angle.</description>

      <title>Beyond the non-Hermitian skin effect: scaling-controlled topology from Exceptional-Bound Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a novel mechanism for topological transitions in non-Hermitian systems that are controlled by the system size. Based on a new paradigm known as exceptional-bound (EB) band engineering, its mechanism hinges on the unique critical scaling behavior near an exceptional point, totally unrelated to the well-known non-Hermitian skin effect. Through a series of ansatz models, we analytically derive and numerically demonstrate how topological transitions depend on the system size with increasingly sophisticated topological phase boundaries. Our approach can be generically applied to design scaling-dependent bands in multi-dimensional lattices, gapped or gapless, challenging established critical and entanglement behavior. It can be experimentally demonstrated in any non-Hermitian platform with versatile couplings or multi-orbital unit cells, such as photonic crystals, as well as classical and quantum circuits. The identification of this new EB band mechanism provides new design principles for engineering band structures through scaling-dependent phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems.</description>
