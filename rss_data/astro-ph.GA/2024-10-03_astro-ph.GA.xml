      <title>Strong rest-UV emission lines in a "little red dot" AGN at $z=7$: Early SMBH growth alongside compact massive star formation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has now revealed a population of broad-line AGN at $z&gt;4$ characterized by a distinctive SED shape, with very red rest-frame optical and very blue rest-frame UV continuum. While the optical continuum is thought to originate from the accretion disk, the origin of the UV continuum has been largely unclear. We report the detection of the strong rest-frame UV emission lines of CIII]$\lambda\lambda$1907,1909 and CIV$\lambda\lambda$1549,1551 in a "little red dot" AGN, COS-66964. Spectroscopically confirmed at $z=7.0371$, COS-66964 exhibits broad H$\alpha$ emission (FWHM $\sim 2000$ km s$^{-1}$), and weak broad H$\beta$, implying significant dust attenuation to the BLR ($A_V = 3.9^{+1.7}_{-0.9}$). The H$\alpha$ line width implies a central SMBH mass of $M_{\rm BH} = \left(1.9^{+1.6}_{-0.7}\right)\times10^{7}$ M$_\odot$, and an Eddington ratio $\lambda\sim0.3$-$0.5$. While marginal HeII$\lambda4687$ and [FeX]$\lambda6376$ detections further indicate that the AGN dominates in the rest-frame optical, the non-detection of HeII$\lambda1640$ in the UV despite high EW CIII] and CIV ($\sim 35$ {\AA}) is more consistent with photoionization by massive stars. The non-detection of MgII$\lambda\lambda$2800 is similarly inconsistent with an AGN scattered light interpretation. Assuming the rest-frame UV is dominated by stellar light, we derive a stellar mass of $\log M_\star/M_\odot\sim8.5$, implying an elevated $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratio $\sim2$ orders of magnitude above the local relation, but consistent with other high-$z$ AGN discovered by JWST. The source is unresolved in all bands, implying a very compact size $\lesssim200$ pc in the UV. This suggests that the simultaneous buildup of compact stellar populations (i.e., galaxy bulges) and the central SMBH is ongoing even at $z&gt;7$.</description>

      <title>The effect of local and large scale environment on the star formation histories of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to investigate how the local environment influences the star formation history (SFH) of galaxies residing in various large-scale environments. We categorise a sample of 9384 galaxies into the three primary large scale structures (voids, walls \&amp; filaments, and clusters) and further classify them based on their local environment (as either "singlets" or group members), through a search of companion galaxies within sky-projected distances $\Delta r_p &lt; 0.45$ Mpc and velocity differences $\Delta v &lt; 160$ $\text{km s}^{-1}$. Subsequently, we explore these subsamples through SFH data from previous works. Throughout the study, galaxies are divided into long-timescale SFH galaxies (LT-SFH), which assemble their mass steadily along cosmic time, and short-timescale SFH galaxies (ST-SFH), which form their stars early. We then compare characteristic mass assembly look-back times. The distributions of mass assembly look-back times in ST-SFH galaxies are statistically different for singlets and groups. These differences are only found in LT-SFH galaxies when studying these distributions in stellar mass bins. Our results indicate that the large-scale environment is related to a delay in mass assembly of up to $\sim$2 Gyr, while this delay is $&lt;$1 Gyr in the case of local environment. The effect of both kinds of environment is more significant in less massive galaxies, and in LT-SFHs. Our results are consistent with galaxies in groups assembling their stellar mass earlier than singlets, especially in voids and lower mass galaxies. Local environment plays a relevant role in stellar mass assembly times, although we find that large-scale structures also cause a delay in mass assembly, more so in the case of cluster galaxies.</description>

      <title>A Data-driven Discovery of the Causal Connection between Galaxy and Black Hole Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlations between galaxies and their supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have been observed, but the causal mechanisms remained unclear. The emerging field of causal inference now enables examining these relationships using observational data. This study, using advanced causal discovery techniques and a state-of-the-art dataset, reveals a causal link between galaxy properties and SMBH masses. In elliptical galaxies, bulge properties influence SMBH growth, while in spiral galaxies, SMBHs affect host galaxy properties, potentially through feedback in gas-rich environments. For spiral galaxies, SMBHs progressively quench star formation, whereas in elliptical galaxies, quenching is complete, and the causal connection has reversed. These findings support theoretical models of active galactic nuclei feedback regulating galaxy evolution and suggest further exploration of causal links in astrophysical and cosmological scaling relations.</description>

      <title>A candidate quadruple AGN system at $z \sim 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at kpc separation from each other are exceedingly rare, and in fact, only one quadruple AGN is known so far. These extreme density peaks are expected to pinpoint protocluster environments and therefore be surrounded by large galaxy overdensities. In this letter, we present another quadruple AGN candidate at $z \sim 3$ including two SDSS quasars at a separation of roughly 480 kpc. The brighter quasar is accompanied by two AGN candidates (a type 1 AGN and a likely type 2 quasar) at close ($\sim 20$ kpc) separation identified through emission line ratios, line widths and high ionization lines like NV$\lambda1240$. The extended Ly$\alpha$ emission associated with the close triple system is more modest in extent and brightness compared to similar multiple AGN systems and could be caused by ram-pressure stripping of the type-2 quasar host during infall into the central dark matter halo. The projected evolution of the system into a $z=0$ galaxy cluster with the AGN host galaxies forming the brightest cluster galaxy needs to be further tested by galaxy overdensity studies on large scales around the quadruple AGN candidate. If confirmed as a quadruple AGN with X-ray observations or rest-frame optical line ratios, this system would represent the second AGN quartet, the highest-redshift multiplet and the closest high-redshift triplet known.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Spectroscopic Confirmation of Aquarius III: A Low-Mass Milky Way Satellite Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of Aquarius III, an ultra-faint Milky Way satellite galaxy identified in the second data release of the DECam Local Volume Exploration (DELVE) survey. Based on deeper follow-up imaging with DECam, we find that Aquarius III is a low-luminosity ($M_V = -2.5^{+0.3}_{-0.5}$; $L_V = 850^{+380}_{-260} \ L_{\odot}$), extended ($r_{1/2} = 41^{+9}_{-8}$ pc) stellar system located in the outer halo ($D_{\odot} = 85 \pm 4$ kpc). From medium-resolution Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy, we identify 11 member stars and measure a mean heliocentric radial velocity of $v_{\rm sys} = -13.1^{+1.0}_{-0.9} \ \rm km \ s^{-1}$ for the system and place an upper limit of $\sigma_v &lt; 3.5 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$ ($\sigma_v &lt; 1.6 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$) on its velocity dispersion at the 95% (68%) credible level. Based on Calcium-Triplet-based metallicities of the six brightest red giant members, we find that Aquarius III is very metal-poor ([Fe/H]$ = -2.61 \pm 0.21$) with a statistically-significant metallicity spread ($\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]} = 0.46^{+0.26}_{-0.14}$ dex). We interpret this metallicity spread as strong evidence that the system is a dwarf galaxy as opposed to a star cluster. Combining our velocity measurement with $Gaia$ proper motions, we find that Aquarius III is currently situated near its orbital pericenter in the outer halo ($r_{\rm peri} = 78 \pm 7$ kpc) and that it is plausibly on first infall onto the Milky Way. This orbital history likely precludes significant tidal disruption from the Galactic disk, notably unlike other satellites with comparably low velocity dispersion limits in the literature. Thus, if further velocity measurements confirm that its velocity dispersion is truly below $\sigma_v \lesssim 2 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$, Aquarius III may serve as a useful laboratory for probing galaxy formation physics in low-mass halos.</description>

      <title>The currently observed clumps cannot be the "direct" precursors of the currently observed open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We categorized clumps, embedded clusters, and open clusters, and conducted a comparative analysis of their physical properties. Overall, the radii of open clusters are significantly larger than those of embedded clusters and clumps. The radii of embedded clusters are larger than those of clumps, which may be due to the expansion of embedded clusters. The open clusters have significantly larger masses than embedded clusters, by about one order of magnitude. Given the current mass distribution of clumps in the Milky Way, the evolutionary sequence from a single clump evolving into an embedded cluster and subsequently into an open cluster cannot account for the observed open clusters with old ages and large masses, which is also supported by N-body simulations of individual embedded clusters. To explain the mass and radius distributions of the observed open clusters, initial embedded clusters with masses larger than 3000 M$_{\odot}$ are necessary. However, the upper limit of the embedded cluster sample is less than 1000 M$_{\odot}$. And only few ATLASGAL clumps have a mass larger than 3000 M$_{\odot}$. Thus, the currently observed clumps cannot be the "direct" precursors of the currently observed open clusters. If the Milky Way has a burst-like and time-dependent star formation history, the currently observed open clusters with old ages and large masses may come from massive clumps in the past. There is also a great possibility that these open clusters originate from multiple embedded clusters mergers. We compared the separation of open clusters and the typical size of molecular clouds, and found that most molecular clouds may only form one open cluster, which supports the merger scenario. Further study is necessary to distinguish between different scenarios.</description>

      <title>TODDLERS: A New UV to Millimeter Emission Library for Star-Forming Regions. II. Star Formation Rate Indicators Using Auriga Zoom Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current galaxy formation simulations often approximate star-formation, necessitating models of star-forming regions to produce observables. In the first paper of the series, we introduced TODDLERS, a time-resolved model of UV-mm emission from star-forming regions implemented in the radiative transfer code SKIRT. This work uses SKIRT-TODDLERS to produce synthetic observations, demonstrating its potential through observables related to star-formation and comparing results with existing models in SKIRT. We calculate broadband and line emission maps for 30 Milky Way-like galaxies from the Auriga simulation at z=0. Analyzing FUV and IR data, we calculate kpc-resolved IR correction factors (k_IR), quantifying the ratio of FUV luminosity absorbed by dust to reprocessed IR luminosity. We use IR maps to calculate kpc-scale MIR (8 micron / 24 micron) and FIR (70 micron / 500 micron) colors. H alpha and H beta line maps are used to study the Balmer decrement and dust correction. We also verify the fidelity of our model FIR fine structure lines as SFR indicators. We find that the Auriga integrated UV-mm SEDs show higher FUV/NUV attenuation and lower 24 micron emission when using TODDLERS instead of the existing models in SKIRT, alleviating tensions with observations. The light-weighted mean k_IR increases with aperture and inclination, while its correlation with kpc-resolved sSFR is weaker than literature values. Kpc-scale MIR-FIR colors agree excellently with local observations, with anti-correlation degree varying by galaxy morphology. The Balmer decrement effectively corrects for dust, with attenuation law varying with dust amount. H alpha emission attenuation levels are comparable to high-density regions in state-of-the-art simulations. FIR fine-structure line emission-based luminosity-SFR relations align with global observations, [CII] showing best agreement.</description>

      <title>The Tale of Two Telescopes: How Hubble Uniquely Complements the James Webb Space Telescope: Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple but compelling argument, focusing on galaxy science, for preserving the main imagers and operational modes of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for as long as is technically feasible. While star-formation started at redshifts z$\gtrsim$10$-$13, when the universe was less than 300$-$500 Myr old, the CSFH did not peak until z$\simeq$1.9, and has steadily declined since that time. Hence, at least half of all stars in the universe formed in the era where HST provides its unique rest-frame UV view of unobscured young, massive stars tracing cosmic star-formation. By rendering a subset of the 556.3 hours of available HST images in 12 filters of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) in an appropriate mix of colors, we illustrate the unique capabilities of HST for galaxy science emphasizing that rest-frame UV$-$optical wavelength range. We then contrast this with the 52.7 publicly available hours of JWST/NIRCam images in 8 filters of the same HUDF area from the JADES project, rendering these at the redder near-IR wavelengths to illustrate the unique capabilities of JWST to detect older stellar populations at higher redshifts, as well as very dusty stellar populations and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). HST uniquely probes (unobscured) young, hot, massive stars in galaxies, while JWST reveals more advanced stages of older stellar populations, as well as relatively short-lived phases where galaxies produce and shed a lot of dust from intense star-formation, and the very high redshift universe (z$\gtrsim$10$-$11) not accessible by HST. We conclude that HST and JWST are highly complementary facilities that took decades to build to ensure decades of operation. To maximize return on investment on both HST and JWST, ways will need to be found to operate HST imaging instruments in all relevant modes for as long as possible into the JWST mission.</description>

      <title>Exploring the central region of NGC 1365 in the ultraviolet domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback and its impact on their host galaxies are critical to our understanding of galaxy evolution. Here, we present a combined analysis of new high resolution ultraviolet (UV) data from the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on AstroSat and archival optical spectroscopic data from VLT/MUSE, for the Seyfert galaxy, NGC 1365. Concentrating on the central 5 kpc region, the UVIT images in the far and near UV show bright star forming knots in the circumnuclear ring as well as a faint central source. After correcting for extinction, we found the star formation rate (SFR) surface density of the circumnuclear 2 kpc ring to be similar to other starbursts, despite the presence of an AGN outflow, as seen in [OIII] 5007 Angstrom. On the other hand, we found fainter UV and thus lower SFR in the direction south-east of the AGN relative to north-west in agreement with observations at other wavelengths from JWST and ALMA. The AGN outflow velocity is found to be lesser than the escape velocity, suggesting that the outflowing gas will rain back into the galaxy. The deep UV data has also revealed diffuse UV emission in the direction of the AGN outflow. By combining [OIII] and UV data, we found the diffuse emission to be of AGN origin.</description>

      <title>Optical spectroscopy of host-galaxies of intermediate mass black holes: evolution of central black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with masses below ($2 \times 10^5 M_{\odot}$) are pivotal in understanding the origin and growth mechanisms of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galactic nuclei. This study focuses on the search and detailed analysis of central lightweight black holes in various galaxies. An expanded sample of IMBH candidates was selected from the RCSED optical spectral catalog, followed by refined spectral observations using large telescopes, including the Magellan, SALT, Keck and CMO telescopes. Analyzing over 70 spectra, we obtained accurate virial masses, stellar population parameters, and kinematics. One significant finding includes the detection of a binary black hole system with masses ($1.7 \times 10^5 M_{\odot})$ and $(1.4 \times 10^6 M_{\odot}$). Our results indicate that IMBHs and their low-mass SMBH counterparts do not necessarily co-evolve with their host galaxies, suggesting super-Eddington accretion as a dominant growth mechanism. This research enhances the precision of virial mass estimates and offers new insights into the $M_{BH} - \sigma_{bulge}$ relation, potentially impacting future high-redshift SMBH observations using next-generation facilities.</description>

      <title>Proposed importance of HOCO chemistry: Inefficient formation of CO$_2$ from CO and OH reactions on ice dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of JWST ice observations, dedicated studies on the formation reactions of detected molecules are becoming increasingly important. One of the most interesting molecules in interstellar ice is CO$_2$. Despite its simplicity, the main formation reaction considered, CO + OH -&gt; CO$_2$ + H through the energetic HOCO* intermediate on ice dust, is subject to uncertainty because it directly competes with the stabilization of HOCO as a final product which is formed through energy dissipation of HOCO* to the water ice. When energy dissipation to the surface is effective during reaction, HOCO can be a dominant product. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate that the major product of the reaction is indeed not CO$_2$, but rather the highly reactive radical HOCO. The HOCO radical can later evolve into CO$_2$ through H-abstraction reactions, but these reactions compete with addition reactions, leading to the formation of carboxylic acids (R-COOH). Our results highlight the importance of HOCO chemistry and encourage further exploration of the chemistry of this radical.</description>

      <title>AGN -- host galaxy photometric decomposition using a fast, accurate and precise deep learning approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is extremely important for understanding galaxy evolution and its connection with the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBH). With the advent of deep and high angular resolution imaging surveys such as those conducted with the {\it James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST), it is now possible to identify galaxies with a central point source out to the very early Universe. In this study, we develop a fast, accurate and precise method to identify galaxies which host AGNs and recover the intrinsic AGN contribution to the observed total light ($f_{AGN}$). We trained a deep learning (DL) based method Zoobot to estimate the fractional contribution of a central point source to the total light. Our training sample comprises realistic mock JWST images of simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We injected different amounts of the real JWST point spread function (PSF) models to represent galaxies with different levels of $f_{AGN}$. We analyse the performance of our method and compare it with results obtained from the traditional light profile fitting tool GALFIT. We find excellent performance of our DL method in recovering the injected AGN fraction $f_{AGN}$, both in terms of precision and accuracy. The mean difference between the predicted and true injected $f_{AGN}$ is $-0.0006$ and the overall root mean square error (RMSE) is $0.027$. The relative absolute error (RAE) is $0.086$ and the outlier (defined as predictions with RAE $&gt;20\%$) fraction is $7.8\%$. In comparison, using GALFIT on the same dataset, we achieve a mean difference of -$0.024$, RMSE of $0.09$, RAE of $0.19$ and outlier fraction of $19\%$. Our DL-based method to identify AGNs and estimate $f_{AGN}$ is extremely fast and easy to use and has a huge potential in future applications to large galaxy imaging surveys.</description>

      <title>An eccentric transit timing test of modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MOND modified gravity paradigm, best known for its agreement with galactic rotation curve data, is difficult to devise laboratory tests for. MOND's predictions differ substantially from Newtonian gravity only in the case of very small accelerations ($a &lt; a_0 = 1.2\times10^{-10}~\mathrm{m/s}^2 = 3.8~\mathrm{mm/s/y}$). In the solar system, radio and laser measurements of test bodies do permit acceleration measurements this precise; however, in at least some viable realizations, MOND has an "external field effect" (EFE) which essentially disables the MOND effects in the presence of the inner Milky Way's background gravitational field, invalidating Solar System limits. Can we do any measurement with Solar-System-like acceleration precision, but on a system many kiloparsecs away that avoids the EFE? In this paper, we show that MOND's non-$1/r^2$ gravitational acceleration has a unique and hard-to-fake effect: in contrast to the non-precessing elliptical orbits predicted by two-body Newtonian gravity, in the presence of MOND we expect apsidal precession in two-body systems. An extreme precision apsidal precession detection opportunity is available for eclipsing binaries, where, for some viewing geometries, apsidal precession causes transit time variations (TTVs) and transit duration variations (TDVs). If appropriate binaries can be found and measured, the presence or absence of timing variations may provide a definitive "solar-system-like" test of many EFE-bearing MOND theories like QUMOND.</description>

      <title>Multiple-scale gas infall through gravity torques on Milky Way twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main problems raised by the feeding of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centres of galaxies is the huge angular momentum of the circumnuclear gas and of the gas reservoir in the galaxy disk. Because viscous torques are not efficient at kiloparsec or 100 pc scales, the angular momentum must be exchanged through gravity torques that arise from the non-axisymmetric patterns in the disks. Our goal here is to quantify the efficiency of bars and spirals in driving the gas towards the centre at different scales in galaxies. We selected a sample of nearby galaxies considered to be analogues of the Milky Way, that is, galaxies of late morphological type Sbc. Their bar strength was variable, either SB, or SAB, or SA, so that we were able to quantify the influence of the bar. The gravitational potential was computed from deprojected red images, either from Hubble Space Telescope or Legacy survey, depending on the spatial resolution and field of view considered. The torques were computed on the gas through CO emission maps from ALMA at different resolutions. H$\alpha$ maps from MUSE were used, when available. Eight out of ten galaxies are barred. The torques are found to be negative in the eight barred objects at kiloparsec scales, between corotation and the inner Lindblad resonance (ILR), with a loss of angular momentum in a few rotations. Inside the ILR, the torques are negative in only five cases, with a timescale of one to two rotations. The torques are positive for the galaxies without bars. The torques applied on the ionized gas are comparable to what is deduced from molecular gas. The bars are confirmed to be the essential pattern in the SMBH feeding at kiloparsec and 100 pc scales; higher-resolution gas maps are required to explore scales of 10 pc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce synax, a novel library for automatically differentiable simulation of Galactic synchrotron emission. Built on the JAX framework, synax leverages JAX's capabilities, including batch acceleration, just-in-time compilation, and hardware-specific optimizations (CPU, GPU, TPU). Crucially, synax uses JAX's automatic differentiation (AD) mechanism, enabling precise computation of derivatives with respect to any model parameters. This feature facilitates powerful inference algorithms, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and gradient-based optimization, which enables inference over models that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive. In its initial release, synax supports synchrotron intensity and polarization calculations down to GHz frequencies, alongside several models of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), cosmic ray (CR) spectra, and thermal electron density fields. We demonstrate the transformative potential of AD for tasks involving full posterior inference using gradient-based techniques or Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) optimization. Notably, we show that GPU acceleration brings a twenty-fold enhancement in efficiency, while HMC achieves a two-fold improvement over standard random walk Metropolis-Hastings (RWMH) when performing inference over a four-parameter test model. HMC still works on a more complex, 16-parameter model while RWMH fails to converge. Additionally, we showcase the application of synax in optimizing the GMF based on the Haslam 408 MHz map, achieving residuals with a standard deviation below 1 K.</description>

      <title>A SPectroscopic survey of biased halos In the Reionization Era (ASPIRE): JWST Supports Earlier Reionization around [OIII] Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding when and how reionization happened is crucial for studying the early structure formation and the properties of first galaxies in the Universe. At $z&gt;5.5$, the observed IGM optical depth shows a significant scatter, indicating an inhomogeneous reionization process. However, the nature of the inhomogeneous reionization remains debated. ASPIRE is a JWST Cycle 1 program that has spectroscopically identified $&gt;400$ [OIII] emitters in 25 quasar fields at $z&gt;6.5$. Combined with deep ground-based optical spectroscopy of ASPIRE quasars, ASPIRE program provides the current largest sample for IGM-galaxy connection studies during cosmic reionization. We present the first results of IGM effective optical depth measurements around [OIII] emitters using 14 ASPIRE quasar fields. We find the IGM transmission is tightly related with reionization-era galaxies to the extent that significant excess of Ly$\alpha$ transmission exists around [OIII] emitters. We measure the stacked IGM effective optical depth of IGM patches associated with [OIII] emitters and find they reach the same IGM effective optical depth at least dz~0.1 ahead of those IGM patches where no [OIII] emitters are detected, supporting earlier reionization around [OIII] emitters. Our results indicate an enhancement in IGM Ly$\alpha$ transmission around [OIII] emitters at scales beyond 25 $h^{-1}$ cMpc, consistent with the predicted topology of reionization from fluctuating UV background (UVB) models.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS). Overview of gaseous molecular emission and absorption in low-mass protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MIRI-MRS instrument onboard JWST allows for probing the molecular gas composition at mid-IR wavelengths at unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. It is important to study these features in low-mass embedded protostellar systems since the formation of planets is thought to start in this phase. We present JWST/MIRI-MRS data of 18 low-mass protostellar systems in the JOYS program, focusing on gas-phase molecular lines in spectra extracted from the central protostellar positions. Besides H2, the most commonly detected molecules are H2O, CO2, CO, and OH. Other molecules such as 13CO2, C2H2, 13CCH, HCN, C4H2, CH4, and SO2 are detected only toward at most three of the sources. The JOYS data also yield the surprising detection of SiO gas toward two sources (BHR71-IRS1, L1448-mm) and for the first time CS and NH3 at mid-IR wavelengths toward a low-mass protostar (B1-c). The temperatures derived for the majority of the molecules are 100-300 K, much lower than what is typically derived toward more evolved Class II sources (&gt;500 K). Toward three sources (e.g., TMC1-W), hot (~1000 K) H2O is detected, indicative of the presence of hot molecular gas in the embedded disks, but such warm emission from other molecules is absent. The agreement in abundance ratios with respect to H2O between ice and gas point toward ice sublimation in a hot core for a few sources (e.g., B1-c) whereas their disagreement and velocity offsets hint at high-temperature (shocked) conditions toward other sources (e.g., L1448-mm, BHR71-IRS1). The typical temperatures of the gas-phase molecules of 100-300 K are consistent with both ice sublimation in hot cores as well as high-temperature gas phase chemistry. Molecular features originating from the inner embedded disks are not commonly detected, likely because they are too extincted even at mid-IR wavelengths by small not-settled dust grains in upper layers of the disk.</description>

Abstract: The first interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, Borisov, and IM1, were discovered over the past decade. We follow the trajectories of known interstellar objects in the gravitational potential of the Milky Way galaxy to constrain their possible origin. By initiating the trajectories based on their measured velocities relative to the Local Standard of Rest and considering their vertical excursion from the Milky Way's disk mid-plane, we estimate their likely ages. We find that 'Oumuamua likely originated near the mid-plane of the thin disk, suggesting a younger age. Comet Borisov's trajectory suggests an age similar to the Sun, while IM1's larger excursions suggest an older source. Finally, we project that human-made probes like Voyager 1 and Pioneer 10 will reach the opposite side of the Milky Way disk in approximately 2 Gyr and return to the Solar vicinity before the Sun becomes a red giant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While cosmic rays $(E\gtrsim 1\,\mathrm{GeV})$ are well coupled to a galaxy's interstellar medium (ISM) at scales of $L&gt;100\,\mathrm{pc}$, adjusting stratification and driving outflows, their impact on small scales is less clear. Based on calculations of the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient from observations of the grammage in the Milky Way, cosmic rays have little time to dynamically impact the ISM on those small scales. Using numerical simulations, we explore how more complex cosmic ray transport could allow cosmic rays to couple to the ISM on small scales. We create a two-zone model of cosmic ray transport, with the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient set at the estimated Milky Way value in cold gas but smaller in warm gas. We compare this model to simulations with a constant diffusion coefficient. Quicker diffusion through cold gas allows more cold gas to form compared to a simulation with a constant, small diffusion coefficient. However, slower diffusion in warm gas allows cosmic rays to take energy from the turbulent cascade anisotropically. This cosmic ray energization comes at the expense of turbulent energy which would otherwise be lost during radiative cooling. Finally, we show our two-zone model is capable of matching observational estimates of the grammage for some transport paths through the simulation.</description>

      <title>Digging into the ultraviolet luminosity functions of galaxies at high redshifts: galaxies evolution, reionization, and cosmological parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thanks to the successful performance of the James Webb Space Telescope, our understanding of the epoch of reionization of the Universe has been advanced. The ultraviolet luminosity functions (UV LFs) of galaxies span a wide range of redshift, not only revealing the connection between galaxies and dark matter (DM) halos but also providing the information during reionization. In this work, we develop a model connecting galaxy counts and apparent magnitude based on UV LFs, which incorporates redshift-dependent star formation efficiency (SFE) and corrections for dust attenuation. By synthesizing some observations across the redshift range $4\le z \le 10$ from various galaxy surveys, we discern the evolving SFE with increasing redshift and DM halo mass through model fitting. Subsequent analyses indicate that the Thomson scattering optical depth was $\tau_{\rm e} = 0.054^{+0.001}_{-0.003}$ and the epoch of reionization started (ended) at $z=18.8^{+7.2}_{-6.0}$ ($z=5.3^{+0.8}_{-1.0}$) which is insensitive to the choice of the truncated magnitude of the UV LFs. Incorporating additional dataset and some reasonable constraints, the amplitude of matter perturbation is found to be $\sigma_8=0.80\pm0.05$, which is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Future galaxy surveys and the dynamical simulations of galaxy evolution will break the degeneracy between SFE and cosmological parameters, improving the accuracy and the precision of the UV LF model further.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Amplification during Stellar Collisions between Low-Mass Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blue straggler stars in stellar clusters are a subset of stars that are bluer and appear younger than other cluster members, seemingly straggling behind in their evolution. They offer a unique opportunity to understand the stellar dynamics and populations within their hosts. In the collisional formation scenario, a persistent challenge is the excessive angular momentum in the collision product. The consequent significant mass loss during transition to a stable state leads to a star with too low a mass to be a blue straggler, unless it spins down efficiently. While many proposed spin-down mechanisms involve boosted angular momentum loss via magnetic braking within the collision product, the existence or strength of these magnetic fields has not been confirmed. Here, we report three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of collisions between two low-mass main-sequence stars and investigate magnetic field amplification. Magnetic field energy is amplified by a factor of $10^{8}-10^{10}$, resulting in the magnetic field strength of $10^{7}-10^{8}$G at the core of the collision product, independent of collision parameters. The surface magnetic field strengths have increased up to $10-10^{4}$ G. In addition, a distinctly flattened, rotating gas structure appears around the collision products in off-axis collisions, which may be a hint of possible disk formation. Such significant magnetic amplification and potential disk formation suggest the possibility of efficient spin-down of collision products via magnetic braking and magnetic disk locking, which can result in their appearance as blue stragglers.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ly$\alpha$ Emission from Diffuse Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ly$\alpha$ emission has emerged as a powerful tool for probing diffuse gas within the large-scale structure of the universe. In this paper, we investigate cosmic Ly$\alpha$ emission by post-processing cosmological simulations from \texttt{IllustrisTNG} and \texttt{THESAN} project. Specifically, we calculate the Ly$\alpha$ emission from galaxies, circum-galactic medium (CGM) and inter-galactic medium (IGM) across various redshifts. Our results show that IGM alone is significantly under the current observational upper limits. Meanwhile, CGM overshoots the observed galaxy contribution at $z \lesssim 0.5$ indicating that either the escape fraction for the inner CGM is less than unity or the current photoionization equilibrium treatment with an approximate self-shielding prescription is less accurate. The galaxy component also overshoots at low redshift, indicating that the escape fraction has strong evolution caused by an evolving halo mass function and dust growth distribution, that agrees with observationally inferred escape fractions. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the Ly$\alpha$ emission from diffuse gas (CGM+IGM) peaked at $z \sim 4$ and diminishes toward lower redshift. The Ly$\alpha$ emission from diffuse gas mainly originates through the collisional excitation of hot plasma. By comparing models with observation, our predicted Ly$\alpha$ emission from diffuse gas remains $\sim 6$ times fainter than the observed cosmic Ly$\alpha$ emission at $z=1-3$. However, future large telescopes may hold great promise to detect Ly$\alpha$ emission from diffuse gas toward $z&gt;3$.</description>
