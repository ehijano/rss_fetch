      <title>PhotonSplat: 3D Scene Reconstruction and Colorization from SPAD Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction using neural rendering have enabled high-quality 3D capture. However, they often fail when the input imagery is corrupted by motion blur, due to fast motion of the camera or the objects in the scene. This work advances neural rendering techniques in such scenarios by using single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays, an emerging sensing technology capable of sensing images at extremely high speeds. However, the use of SPADs presents its own set of unique challenges in the form of binary images, that are driven by stochastic photon arrivals. To address this, we introduce PhotonSplat, a framework designed to reconstruct 3D scenes directly from SPAD binary images, effectively navigating the noise vs. blur trade-off. Our approach incorporates a novel 3D spatial filtering technique to reduce noise in the renderings. The framework also supports both no-reference using generative priors and reference-based colorization from a single blurry image, enabling downstream applications such as segmentation, object detection and appearance editing tasks. Additionally, we extend our method to incorporate dynamic scene representations, making it suitable for scenes with moving objects. We further contribute PhotonScenes, a real-world multi-view dataset captured with the SPAD sensors.</description>

      <title>TUS-REC2024: A Challenge to Reconstruct 3D Freehand Ultrasound Without External Tracker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trackerless freehand ultrasound reconstruction aims to reconstruct 3D volumes from sequences of 2D ultrasound images without relying on external tracking systems, offering a low-cost, portable, and widely deployable alternative for volumetric imaging. However, it presents significant challenges, including accurate inter-frame motion estimation, minimisation of drift accumulation over long sequences, and generalisability across scanning protocols. The TUS-REC2024 Challenge was established to benchmark and accelerate progress in trackerless 3D ultrasound reconstruction by providing a publicly available dataset for the first time, along with a baseline model and evaluation framework. The Challenge attracted over 43 registered teams, of which 6 teams submitted 21 valid dockerized solutions. Submitted methods spanned a wide range of algorithmic approaches, including recurrent models, registration-driven volume refinement, attention, and physics-informed models. This paper presents an overview of the Challenge design, summarises the key characteristics of the dataset, provides a concise literature review, introduces the technical details of the underlying methodology working with tracked freehand ultrasound data, and offers a comparative analysis of submitted methods across multiple evaluation metrics. The results highlight both the progress and current limitations of state-of-the-art approaches in this domain, and inform directions for future research. The data, evaluation code, and baseline are publicly available to facilitate ongoing development and reproducibility. As a live and evolving benchmark, this Challenge is designed to be continuously developed and improved. The Challenge was held at MICCAI 2024 and will be organised again at MICCAI 2025, reflecting its growing impact and the sustained commitment to advancing this field.</description>

      <title>Physical Degradation Model-Guided Interferometric Hyperspectral Reconstruction with Unfolding Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometric Hyperspectral Imaging (IHI) is a critical technique for large-scale remote sensing tasks due to its advantages in flux and spectral resolution. However, IHI is susceptible to complex errors arising from imaging steps, and its quality is limited by existing signal processing-based reconstruction algorithms. Two key challenges hinder performance enhancement: 1) the lack of training datasets. 2) the difficulty in eliminating IHI-specific degradation components through learning-based methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel IHI reconstruction pipeline. First, based on imaging physics and radiometric calibration data, we establish a simplified yet accurate IHI degradation model and a parameter estimation method. This model enables the synthesis of realistic IHI training datasets from hyperspectral images (HSIs), bridging the gap between IHI reconstruction and deep learning. Second, we design the Interferometric Hyperspectral Reconstruction Unfolding Transformer (IHRUT), which achieves effective spectral correction and detail restoration through a stripe-pattern enhancement mechanism and a spatial-spectral transformer architecture. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and generalization capability of our method.</description>

      <title>UnMix-NeRF: Spectral Unmixing Meets Neural Radiance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties. This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material segmentation to existing methods.

      <title>StableCodec: Taming One-Step Diffusion for Extreme Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has shown remarkable potential for achieving ultra-low bitrate coding (less than 0.05 bits per pixel) with high realism, by leveraging the generative priors of large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches require a large number of denoising steps at the decoder to generate realistic results under extreme bitrate constraints, limiting their application in real-time compression scenarios. Additionally, these methods often sacrifice reconstruction fidelity, as diffusion models typically fail to guarantee pixel-level consistency. To address these challenges, we introduce StableCodec, which enables one-step diffusion for high-fidelity and high-realism extreme image compression with improved coding efficiency. To achieve ultra-low bitrates, we first develop an efficient Deep Compression Latent Codec to transmit a noisy latent representation for a single-step denoising process. We then propose a Dual-Branch Coding Structure, consisting of a pair of auxiliary encoder and decoder, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, we adopt end-to-end optimization with joint bitrate and pixel-level constraints. Extensive experiments on the CLIC 2020, DIV2K, and Kodak dataset demonstrate that StableCodec outperforms existing methods in terms of FID, KID and DISTS by a significant margin, even at bitrates as low as 0.005 bits per pixel, while maintaining strong fidelity. Additionally, StableCodec achieves inference speeds comparable to mainstream transform coding schemes. All source code are available at https://github.com/LuizScarlet/StableCodec.</description>

      <title>Noise-Inspired Diffusion Model for Generalizable Low-Dose CT Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalization of deep learning-based low-dose computed tomography (CT) reconstruction models to doses unseen in the training data is important and remains challenging. Previous efforts heavily rely on paired data to improve the generalization performance and robustness through collecting either diverse CT data for re-training or a few test data for fine-tuning. Recently, diffusion models have shown promising and generalizable performance in low-dose CT (LDCT) reconstruction, however, they may produce unrealistic structures due to the CT image noise deviating from Gaussian distribution and imprecise prior information from the guidance of noisy LDCT images. In this paper, we propose a noise-inspired diffusion model for generalizable LDCT reconstruction, termed NEED, which tailors diffusion models for noise characteristics of each domain. First, we propose a novel shifted Poisson diffusion model to denoise projection data, which aligns the diffusion process with the noise model in pre-log LDCT projections. Second, we devise a doubly guided diffusion model to refine reconstructed images, which leverages LDCT images and initial reconstructions to more accurately locate prior information and enhance reconstruction fidelity. By cascading these two diffusion models for dual-domain reconstruction, our NEED requires only normal-dose data for training and can be effectively extended to various unseen dose levels during testing via a time step matching strategy. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and segmentation-based evaluations on two datasets demonstrate that our NEED consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and generalization performance.

      <title>Towards Scalable and Robust White Matter Lesion Localization via Multimodal Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are radiological markers of small vessel disease and neurodegeneration, whose accurate segmentation and spatial localization are crucial for diagnosis and monitoring. While multimodal MRI offers complementary contrasts for detecting and contextualizing WM lesions, existing approaches often lack flexibility in handling missing modalities and fail to integrate anatomical localization efficiently. We propose a deep learning framework for WM lesion segmentation and localization that operates directly in native space using single- and multi-modal MRI inputs. Our study evaluates four input configurations: FLAIR-only, T1-only, concatenated FLAIR and T1, and a modality-interchangeable setup. It further introduces a multi-task model for jointly predicting lesion and anatomical region masks to estimate region-wise lesion burden. Experiments conducted on the MICCAI WMH Segmentation Challenge dataset demonstrate that multimodal input significantly improves the segmentation performance, outperforming unimodal models. While the modality-interchangeable setting trades accuracy for robustness, it enables inference in cases with missing modalities. Joint lesion-region segmentation using multi-task learning was less effective than separate models, suggesting representational conflict between tasks. Our findings highlight the utility of multimodal fusion for accurate and robust WMH analysis, and the potential of joint modeling for integrated predictions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Aortic dissections are life-threatening cardiovascular conditions requiring accurate segmentation of true lumen (TL), false lumen (FL), and false lumen thrombosis (FLT) from CTA images for effective management. Manual segmentation is time-consuming and variable, necessitating automated solutions. Materials and Methods: We developed four deep learning-based pipelines for Type B aortic dissection segmentation: a single-step model, a sequential model, a sequential multi-task model, and an ensemble model, utilizing 3D U-Net and Swin-UnetR architectures. A dataset of 100 retrospective CTA images was split into training (n=80), validation (n=10), and testing (n=10). Performance was assessed using the Dice Coefficient and Hausdorff Distance. Results: Our approach achieved superior segmentation accuracy, with Dice Coefficients of 0.91 $\pm$ 0.07 for TL, 0.88 $\pm$ 0.18 for FL, and 0.47 $\pm$ 0.25 for FLT, outperforming Yao et al. (1), who reported 0.78 $\pm$ 0.20, 0.68 $\pm$ 0.18, and 0.25 $\pm$ 0.31, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed pipelines provide accurate segmentation of TBAD features, enabling derivation of morphological parameters for surveillance and treatment planning</description>

      <title>Cardiovascular disease classification using radiomics and geometric features from cardiac CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic detection and classification of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) from Computed Tomography (CT) images play an important part in facilitating better-informed clinical decisions. However, most of the recent deep learning based methods either directly work on raw CT data or utilize it in pair with anatomical cardiac structure segmentation by training an end-to-end classifier. As such, these approaches become much more difficult to interpret from a clinical perspective. To address this challenge, in this work, we break down the CVD classification pipeline into three components: (i) image segmentation, (ii) image registration, and (iii) downstream CVD classification. Specifically, we utilize the Atlas-ISTN framework and recent segmentation foundational models to generate anatomical structure segmentation and a normative healthy atlas. These are further utilized to extract clinically interpretable radiomic features as well as deformation field based geometric features (through atlas registration) for CVD classification. Our experiments on the publicly available ASOCA dataset show that utilizing these features leads to better CVD classification accuracy (87.50\%) when compared against classification model trained directly on raw CT images (67.50\%).

      <title>DIGS: Dynamic CBCT Reconstruction using Deformation-Informed 4D Gaussian Splatting and a Low-Rank Free-Form Deformation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) is widely used in radiotherapy but suffers from motion artifacts due to breathing. A common clinical approach mitigates this by sorting projections into respiratory phases and reconstructing images per phase, but this does not account for breathing variability. Dynamic CBCT instead reconstructs images at each projection, capturing continuous motion without phase sorting. Recent advancements in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) offer powerful tools for modeling dynamic scenes, yet their application to dynamic CBCT remains underexplored. Existing 4DGS methods, such as HexPlane, use implicit motion representations, which are computationally expensive. While explicit low-rank motion models have been proposed, they lack spatial regularization, leading to inconsistencies in Gaussian motion. To address these limitations, we introduce a free-form deformation (FFD)-based spatial basis function and a deformation-informed framework that enforces consistency by coupling the temporal evolution of Gaussian's mean position, scale, and rotation under a unified deformation field. We evaluate our approach on six CBCT datasets, demonstrating superior image quality with a 6x speedup over HexPlane. These results highlight the potential of deformation-informed 4DGS for efficient, motion-compensated CBCT reconstruction. The code is available at https://github.com/Yuliang-Huang/DIGS.</description>

      <title>Dehazing Light Microscopy Images with Guided Conditional Flow Matching: finding a sweet spot between fidelity and realism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22397v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data. Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID. Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on 5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available under a permissive license.</description>

      <title>Single-shot HDR using conventional image sensor shutter functions and optical randomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging is an essential technique for overcoming the dynamic range limits of image sensors. The classic method relies on multiple exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene. The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with 48dB dynamic range.</description>

      <title>End-to-End RGB-IR Joint Image Compression With Channel-wise Cross-modality Entropy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RGB-IR(RGB-Infrared) image pairs are frequently applied simultaneously in various applications like intelligent surveillance. However, as the number of modalities increases, the required data storage and transmission costs also double. Therefore, efficient RGB-IR data compression is essential. This work proposes a joint compression framework for RGB-IR image pair. Specifically, to fully utilize cross-modality prior information for accurate context probability modeling within and between modalities, we propose a Channel-wise Cross-modality Entropy Model (CCEM). Among CCEM, a Low-frequency Context Extraction Block (LCEB) and a Low-frequency Context Fusion Block (LCFB) are designed for extracting and aggregating the global low-frequency information from both modalities, which assist the model in predicting entropy parameters more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing RGB-IR image pair and single-modality compression methods on LLVIP and KAIST datasets. For instance, the proposed framework achieves a 23.1% bit rate saving on LLVIP dataset compared to the state-of-the-art RGB-IR image codec presented at CVPR 2022.</description>

      <title>TOAST: Task-Oriented Adaptive Semantic Transmission over Dynamic Wireless Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks demands a fundamental shift from bit-centric transmission to semantic-aware communication that emphasizes task-relevant information. This work introduces TOAST (Task-Oriented Adaptive Semantic Transmission), a unified framework designed to address the core challenge of multi-task optimization in dynamic wireless environments through three complementary components. First, we formulate adaptive task balancing as a Markov decision process, employing deep reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust the trade-off between image reconstruction fidelity and semantic classification accuracy based on real-time channel conditions. Second, we integrate module-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) mechanisms throughout our Swin Transformer-based joint source-channel coding architecture, enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning that dramatically reduces adaptation overhead while maintaining full performance across diverse channel impairments including Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), fading, phase noise, and impulse interference. Third, we incorporate an Elucidating diffusion model that operates in the latent space to restore features corrupted by channel noises, providing substantial quality improvements compared to baseline approaches. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that TOAST achieves superior performance compared to baseline approaches, with significant improvements in both classification accuracy and reconstruction quality at low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions while maintaining robust performance across all tested scenarios.</description>

      <title>ReF-LLE: Personalized Low-Light Enhancement via Reference-Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement presents two primary challenges: 1) Significant variations in low-light images across different conditions, and 2) Enhancement levels influenced by subjective preferences and user intent. To address these issues, we propose ReF-LLE, a novel personalized low-light image enhancement method that operates in the Fourier frequency domain and incorporates deep reinforcement learning. ReF-LLE is the first to integrate deep reinforcement learning into this domain. During training, a zero-reference image evaluation strategy is introduced to score enhanced images, providing reward signals that guide the model to handle varying degrees of low-light conditions effectively. In the inference phase, ReF-LLE employs a personalized adaptive iterative strategy, guided by the zero-frequency component in the Fourier domain, which represents the overall illumination level. This strategy enables the model to adaptively adjust low-light images to align with the illumination distribution of a user-provided reference image, ensuring personalized enhancement results. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ReF-LLE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior perceptual quality and adaptability in personalized low-light image enhancement.</description>

      <title>MarsQE: Semantic-Informed Quality Enhancement for Compressed Martian Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lossy image compression is essential for Mars exploration missions, due to the limited bandwidth between Earth and Mars. However, the compression may introduce visual artifacts that complicate the geological analysis of the Martian surface. Existing quality enhancement approaches, primarily designed for Earth images, fall short for Martian images due to a lack of consideration for the unique Martian semantics. In response to this challenge, we conduct an in-depth analysis of Martian images, yielding two key insights based on semantics: the presence of texture similarities and the compact nature of texture representations in Martian images. Inspired by these findings, we introduce MarsQE, an innovative, semantic-informed, two-phase quality enhancement approach specifically designed for Martian images. The first phase involves the semantic-based matching of texture-similar reference images, and the second phase enhances image quality by transferring texture patterns from these reference images to the compressed image. We also develop a post-enhancement network to further reduce compression artifacts and achieve superior compression quality. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MarsQE significantly outperforms existing approaches for Earth images, establishing a new benchmark for the quality enhancement on Martian images.</description>

      <title>A Wavelet Diffusion GAN for Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have emerged as a superior alternative to generative adversarial networks (GANs) for high-fidelity image generation, with wide applications in text-to-image generation, image-to-image translation, and super-resolution. However, their real-time feasibility is hindered by slow training and inference speeds. This study addresses this challenge by proposing a wavelet-based conditional Diffusion GAN scheme for Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR). Our approach utilizes the diffusion GAN paradigm to reduce the timesteps required by the reverse diffusion process and the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to achieve dimensionality reduction, decreasing training and inference times significantly. The results of an experimental validation on the CelebA-HQ dataset confirm the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methodologies successfully ensuring high-fidelity output while overcoming inherent drawbacks associated with diffusion models in time-sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Semantic Asymmetry for Precise Gross Tumor Volume Segmentation of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma in Planning CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the radiation therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), clinicians typically delineate the gross tumor volume (GTV) using non-contrast planning computed tomography to ensure accurate radiation dose delivery. However, the low contrast between tumors and adjacent normal tissues necessitates that radiation oncologists manually delineate the tumors, often relying on diagnostic MRI for guidance. % In this study, we propose a novel approach to directly segment NPC gross tumors on non-contrast planning CT images, circumventing potential registration errors when aligning MRI or MRI-derived tumor masks to planning CT. To address the low contrast issues between tumors and adjacent normal structures in planning CT, we introduce a 3D Semantic Asymmetry Tumor segmentation (SATs) method. Specifically, we posit that a healthy nasopharyngeal region is characteristically bilaterally symmetric, whereas the emergence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma disrupts this symmetry. Then, we propose a Siamese contrastive learning segmentation framework that minimizes the voxel-wise distance between original and flipped areas without tumor and encourages a larger distance between original and flipped areas with tumor. Thus, our approach enhances the sensitivity of features to semantic asymmetries. % Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SATs achieves the leading NPC GTV segmentation performance in both internal and external testing, \emph{e.g.}, with at least 2\% absolute Dice score improvement and 12\% average distance error reduction when compared to other state-of-the-art methods in the external testing.</description>

      <title>No More Sliding Window: Efficient 3D Medical Image Segmentation with Differentiable Top-k Patch Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D models surpass 2D models in CT/MRI segmentation by effectively capturing inter-slice relationships. However, the added depth dimension substantially increases memory consumption. While patch-based training alleviates memory constraints, it significantly slows down the inference speed due to the sliding window (SW) approach. We propose No-More-Sliding-Window (NMSW), a novel end-to-end trainable framework that enhances the efficiency of generic 3D segmentation backbone during an inference step by eliminating the need for SW. NMSW employs a differentiable Top-k module to selectively sample only the most relevant patches, thereby minimizing redundant computations. When patch-level predictions are insufficient, the framework intelligently leverages coarse global predictions to refine results. Evaluated across 3 tasks using 3 segmentation backbones, NMSW achieves competitive accuracy compared to SW inference while significantly reducing computational complexity by 91% (88.0 to 8.00 TMACs). Moreover, it delivers a 9.1x faster inference on the H100 GPU (99.0 to 8.3 sec) and a 11.1x faster inference on the Xeon Gold CPU (2110 to 189 sec). NMSW is model-agnostic, further boosting efficiency when integrated with any existing efficient segmentation backbones. The code is avaialble: https://github.com/Youngseok0001/open_nmsw.</description>

Abstract: Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables continuous and unobtrusive assessment of driver's state, allowing estimation of fatigue, stress, and user experience. Commonly used wearable PPG sensors, while effective, suffer from motion artifacts and user discomfort. This study explores the feasibility of non-contact Pulse Rate (PR) assessment using facial video recordings captured by a Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) camera in a driving simulator. The proposed approach detects subtle skin color variations due to blood flow and compares extracted PR values against reference measurements from a wearable Empatica E4 sensor. We evaluate the impact of Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM) on PR estimation and assess statistical differences in PR between age groups. Data obtained from 80 recordings from 64 healthy subjects covering a PR range of 45-160 bpm are analyzed, and PR extraction accuracy is quantified using metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Results show that EVM slightly improves PR estimation, reducing MAE from 6.48 bpm to 5.04 bpm. Significant differences between PRs in younger and older drivers are observed in both rPPG and reference data. The study also thoroughly discusses bias within Empatica E4. Overall, results support the feasibility of integrating camera-based PR monitoring into driving simulators for real-time subject's assessment.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Saliency Prediction and Image Quality Assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past few years, deep neural models have made considerable advances in image quality assessment (IQA). However, the underlying reasons for their success remain unclear, owing to the complex nature of deep neural networks. IQA aims to describe how the human visual system (HVS) works and to create its efficient approximations. On the other hand, Saliency Prediction task aims to emulate HVS via determining areas of visual interest. Thus, we believe that saliency plays a crucial role in human perception. In this work, we conduct an empirical study that reveals the relation between IQA and Saliency Prediction tasks, demonstrating that the former incorporates knowledge of the latter. Moreover, we introduce a novel SACID dataset of saliency-aware compressed images and conduct a large-scale comparison of classic and neural-based IQA methods. All supplementary code and data will be available at the time of publication.</description>

      <title>Secure Video Quality Assessment Resisting Adversarial Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exponential surge in video traffic has intensified the imperative for Video Quality Assessment (VQA). Leveraging cutting-edge architectures, current VQA models have achieved human-comparable accuracy. However, recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of existing VQA models against adversarial attacks. To establish a reliable and practical assessment system, a secure VQA model capable of resisting such malicious attacks is urgently demanded. Unfortunately, no attempt has been made to explore this issue. This paper first attempts to investigate general adversarial defense principles, aiming at endowing existing VQA models with security. Specifically, we first introduce random spatial grid sampling on the video frame for intra-frame defense. Then, we design pixel-wise randomization through a guardian map, globally neutralizing adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we extract temporal information from the video sequence as compensation for inter-frame defense. Building upon these principles, we present a novel VQA framework from the security-oriented perspective, termed SecureVQA. Extensive experiments indicate that SecureVQA sets a new benchmark in security while achieving competitive VQA performance compared with state-of-the-art models. Ablation studies delve deeper into analyzing the principles of SecureVQA, demonstrating their generalization and contributions to the security of leading VQA models.</description>

      <title>Self is the Best Learner: CT-free Ultra-Low-Dose PET Organ Segmentation via Collaborating Denoising and Segmentation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Organ segmentation in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) plays a vital role in cancer quantification. Low-dose PET (LDPET) provides a safer alternative by reducing radiation exposure. However, the inherent noise and blurred boundaries make organ segmentation more challenging. Additionally, existing PET organ segmentation methods rely on coregistered Computed Tomography (CT) annotations, overlooking the problem of modality mismatch. In this study, we propose LDOS, a novel CT-free ultra-LDPET organ segmentation pipeline. Inspired by Masked Autoencoders (MAE), we reinterpret LDPET as a naturally masked version of Full-Dose PET (FDPET). LDOS adopts a simple yet effective architecture: a shared encoder extracts generalized features, while task-specific decoders independently refine outputs for denoising and segmentation. By integrating CT-derived organ annotations into the denoising process, LDOS improves anatomical boundary recognition and alleviates the PET/CT misalignments. Experiments demonstrate that LDOS achieves state-of-the-art performance with mean Dice scores of 73.11% (18F-FDG) and 73.97% (68Ga-FAPI) across 18 organs in 5% dose PET. Our code will be available at https://github.com/yezanting/LDOS.</description>

      <title>Real-World Remote Sensing Image Dehazing: Benchmark and Baseline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote Sensing Image Dehazing (RSID) poses significant challenges in real-world scenarios due to the complex atmospheric conditions and severe color distortions that degrade image quality. The scarcity of real-world remote sensing hazy image pairs has compelled existing methods to rely primarily on synthetic datasets. However, these methods struggle with real-world applications due to the inherent domain gap between synthetic and real data. To address this, we introduce Real-World Remote Sensing Hazy Image Dataset (RRSHID), the first large-scale dataset featuring real-world hazy and dehazed image pairs across diverse atmospheric conditions. Based on this, we propose MCAF-Net, a novel framework tailored for real-world RSID. Its effectiveness arises from three innovative components: Multi-branch Feature Integration Block Aggregator (MFIBA), which enables robust feature extraction through cascaded integration blocks and parallel multi-branch processing; Color-Calibrated Self-Supervised Attention Module (CSAM), which mitigates complex color distortions via self-supervised learning and attention-guided refinement; and Multi-Scale Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (MFAFM), which integrates features effectively while preserving local details and global context. Extensive experiments validate that MCAF-Net demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in real-world RSID, while maintaining competitive performance on synthetic datasets. The introduction of RRSHID and MCAF-Net sets new benchmarks for real-world RSID research, advancing practical solutions for this complex task. The code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/lwCVer/RRSHID.</description>
