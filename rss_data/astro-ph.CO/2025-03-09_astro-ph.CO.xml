      <title>Measuring photo-ionization rate and mean free path of HeII ionizing photons at $2.5 \leq z \leq 3.6$: Evidence for late and rapid HeII reionization Part-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements of the spatially averaged HeII photo-ionization rate ($\langle \Gamma_{\rm HeII} \rangle$), mean free path of HeII ionizing photons ($\lambda_{\rm mfp, HeII}$), and HeII fraction ($f_{\rm HeII}$) across seven redshift bins within the redshift range $2&lt;z&lt;4$. The measurements are obtained by comparing the observed effective optical depth distribution of HeII ($\tau_{\rm eff, HeII}$) with models generated by post-processing of the Sherwood simulation suite using our code EXCITE. With EXCITE, we efficiently explore a large parameter space ($\sim 15000$ models) by varying $\lambda_{\rm mfp, HeII}$ and $\langle \Gamma_{\rm HeII} \rangle$. We employ Anderson-Darling test for the cumulative distribution of $\tau_{\rm eff, HeII}$ to simultaneously measure $\lambda_{\rm mfp, HeII}$ and $\langle \Gamma_{\rm HeII} \rangle$. Our measurements account for possible observational and modeling uncertainties stemming mainly from the finite signal-to-noise ratio of the observed data and thermal parameter uncertainties. We find significant evolution, with the best-fit $\langle \Gamma_{\rm HeII} \rangle$ and $\lambda_{\rm mfp, HeII}$ decreasing by factors of $\sim 4.32$ and $ \sim 3.27$, respectively, from $z = 2.88$ to $z = 3.16$. Based on these measurements, we constrain the emissivity at the HeII ionization frequency ($\epsilon_{228}$) and HeII ionizing photon emission rate ($\dot{n}$), finding consistency with results from galaxy and QSO surveys. Comparison of our measured parameters with widely used uniform UVB models supports a scenario where HeII reionization is not completed before $z\sim2.74$. Our measured evolution is complementary and in good agreement with recent measurements of thermal parameters of the IGM, suggesting a coherent picture of rather late and rapid HeII reionization.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on generalised axion-like potentials for the late Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions have emerged as compelling candidates for describing the dark sector of the Universe. In this work, we explore quintessence models inspired by axion-like potentials as a dynamical alternative to the cosmological constant. These models naturally exhibit a tracking behaviour, reducing the need for fine-tuned initial conditions. We perform a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis on a complete cosmological dataset of Planck PR4 cosmic microwave background (CMB), DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, low-$z$ Cepheid anchors, and DES Y1 large scale structure measurement. Unfortunately, neither the Hubble tension nor the $S_8$ tension is eased. The model does reach parity with $\Lambda$CDM model statistically according to DIC, WAIC and Bayesian ratio, suggesting that a quintessence model may still help with the cosmic tension by further extending the model we have investigated.</description>

      <title>The Three Hundred: Gas Properties Outside of Galaxy Cluster with the WHIM Contribution and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physical properties and detectability of warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) gas with temperatures in the range $10^5&lt;T&lt;10^7$K around galaxy clusters using simulated galaxy clusters from The Three Hundred project. In simulations with different input physics (GIZMO-SIMBA and Gadget-X), we consistently find that the median gas temperature decreases to the WHIM upper bound, $10^7$K, at $\sim 2 \times R_{200c}$, while the WHIM mass fraction increases with radius until $\sim 3\times R_{200c}$, where it plateaus at $\sim 70$ per cent.By simulating X-ray emission from all gas components, we find that the WHIM contribution to the soft X-ray band (0.2 - 2.3 keV) increases with radius but eventually plateaus at larger distances. The differences between the two simulations become more pronounced at higher redshifts and larger radii. Finally, after accounting for observational effects, primarily by removing (sub)halos, we predict that the signal-to-noise ratio of the X-ray signal obtained by stacking the eRASS1 galaxy cluster catalogue will be $\sim 7$ for GIZMO-SIMBA and $\sim 21$ for Gadget-X.</description>

      <title>Investigating Primordial Black Hole Accretion through Cosmic Optical Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH) accretion in the late Universe can lead to significant mass growth. A larger mass further accelerates the accretion radiation output for PBHs with initial masses greater than one solar mass, potentially leading to a stringent energy-dumping constraint derived from observations of the cosmic microwave background. The energy injected via PBH accretion is capable of ionizing and heating the intergalactic medium (IGM), ultimately affecting the optical depth of cosmic reionization and the 21-cm signal. This work investigates primordial black hole mass growth using the Bondi-Hoyle accretion model and accounts for additional ionization and heating induced by PBHs. We derive stringent PBH abundance limits using an upper limit on optical depth set by Planck 2018 CMB measurements. We find that accretion growth significantly strengthens late-time observational constraints for primordial black holes with initial masses ranging from several solar masses up to $10^4$ solar masses. The PBH fraction of the Universe's unobserved mass content can be constrained to $f_\mathrm{PBH, ini}\sim 10^{-2}$ to $10^{-7}$ in this mass range, and when not accounting for mass evolution our constraints can be weakened by up to one order of magnitude. In addition, we show that PBH mass growth will lead to an observable impact on the predicted hydrogen 21-cm brightness temperature.</description>

      <title>The growth of linear perturbations in the interacting dark energy models and observational constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the influence of interaction between dark matter and dark energy on the growth rate $f$ of matter density perturbations within the framework of an interacting $w$CDM model. The coupling term is assumed to be proportional to the dark energy density, and the growth rate $f$ is parameterized using the form $\Omega_{\rm m}^\gamma$. By considering the effect of this interaction on the growth index $\gamma$ and assuming that $\gamma$ varies with redshift $z$, we derive the $\gamma$ up to its second-order approximation. Our analysis demonstrates that the parameterized form $\Omega_{\rm m}^\gamma$ closely approximates the actual growth rate $f$. We utilize this parameterized form, along with the astronomic observations from Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Cosmic Microwave Background, Hubble parameter $H(z)$ measurements, and the growth rate data from theredshift space distortion (RSD) measurement, to make constraints on the free parameters of the interacting $w$CDM model. Our findings indicate that incorporating RSD measurement data into cosmic background observations can significantly tighten the constraints on the coupling constant, suggesting a preference for a weak interaction between dark matter and dark energy.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Induced Non-Gaussian Spectral Distortion in the Microwave Sky from Photon-Axion Conversion in Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conversion of CMB photons to axions (or axion-like particles (ALPs)) can lead to a unique spectral distortion in the temperature and polarization sky which can be explored in upcoming CMB experiments. In this work we have developed a numerical simulation-based technique of photons to ALPs conversion in the galaxy clusters and show for the first time that this physical process can lead to large non-Gaussian signal in the temperature and polarization field, which is impacted by the presence of inhomogeneities and turbulence in the electron density and magnetic field. Our simulation-based technique can simulate the theoretical signal for different scenarios of cluster electron density and magnetic field turbulence and provides testable predictions to discover ALPs from galaxy clusters using spatially non-Gaussian and anisotropic spectral distortion of the microwave sky. We show that the presence of turbulence in the magnetic field and electron density can impact the Gaussian part of the signal captured in terms of the angular power spectra of the signal by more than an order of magnitude. Also, the presence of turbulence in different clusters will lead the temperature and polarization fluctuations around the cluster region to have varying non-Gaussian distribution, with peaks and tails different from the Gaussian statistics of the CMB anisotropy. This new numerical technique has made it possible to calculate also the non-Gaussian signals and can be used in future CMB analysis in synergy with X-ray and radio observations to unveil ALPs coupling with photons in the currently unexplored ranges, for the masses between about $10^{-14}$ eV--$10^{-11}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Peaks sphericity of non-Gaussian random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the statistics of peaks of non-Gaussian random fields and implement it to study the sphericity of peaks. For non-Gaussianity of the local type, we present a general formalism valid regardless of how large the deviation from Gaussian statistics is. For general types of non-Gaussianity, we provide a framework that applies to any system with a given power spectrum and the corresponding bispectrum in the regime in which contributions from higher-order correlators can be neglected. We present an explicit expression for the most probable values of the sphericity parameters, including the effect of non-Gaussianity on the profile. We show that the effects of small perturbative non-Gaussianity on the sphericity parameters are negligible, as they are even smaller than the subleading Gaussian corrections. In contrast, we find that large non-Gaussianity can significantly distort the peak configurations, making them much less spherical.</description>

      <title>Impact of adiabatic temperature fluctuations on the power spectrum of axion density perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) have gained substantial attention as potential candidates for cold dark matter. The ALP field can exhibit fluctuations stemming from initial conditions. These initial field fluctuations hold the potential to give rise to gravitationally bound configurations known as axion miniclusters (AMC). While this proposition is widely accepted in the post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking scenario, uncertainties persist regarding the pre-inflationary scenario, where the effects of the initial field fluctuations may be suppressed by inflation. In this study, we investigate the influence of adiabatic temperature fluctuations of the primordial plasma on the evolution of axion density perturbations and their power spectrum, aiming to explore the possibility of AMC formation in the pre-inflationary scenario. Our analysis reveals that the impact of adiabatic temperature fluctuations becomes significant when $f_{\rm a} / H_{\rm inf} \gtrsim 1.25 \times 10^4$ and surpasses that of quantum fluctuations by up to five orders of magnitude on large scales. This emphasizes the possibility of also forming AMC within the pre-inflationary scenario. Consequently, a detection of AMC would not reliably differentiate between the pre- and post-inflationary origin of axions.</description>

      <title>Deeper multi-redshift upper limits on the Epoch of Reionization 21-cm signal power spectrum from LOFAR between z=8.3 and z=10.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new upper limits on the 21-cm signal power spectrum from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), at redshifts $z \approx 10.1, 9.1, \text{ and } 8.3$, based on reprocessed observations from the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). The analysis incorporates significant enhancements in calibration methods, sky model subtraction, radio-frequency interference (RFI) mitigation, and an improved signal separation technique using machine learning to develop a physically motivated covariance model for the 21-cm signal. These advancements have markedly reduced previously observed excess power due to residual systematics, bringing the measurements closer to the theoretical thermal noise limit across the entire $k$-space. Using comparable observational data, we achieve a 2 to 4-fold improvement over our previous LOFAR limits, with best upper limits of $\Delta_{21}^2 &lt; (68.7\,\mathrm{mK})^2$ at $k = 0.076\,h\,\mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$, $\Delta_{21}^2 &lt; (54.3\,\mathrm{mK})^2$ at $k = 0.076\,h\,\mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$ and $\Delta_{21}^2 &lt; (65.5\,\mathrm{mK})^2$ at $k = 0.083\,h\,\mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$ at redshifts $z \approx 10.1, 9.1$, and $8.3$, respectively. These new multi-redshift upper limits provide new constraints that can be used to refine our understanding of the astrophysical processes during the EoR. Comprehensive validation tests, including signal injection, were performed to ensure the robustness of our methods. The remaining excess power is attributed to residual foreground emissions from distant sources, beam model inaccuracies, and low-level RFI. We discuss ongoing and future improvements to the data processing pipeline aimed at further reducing these residuals, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of LOFAR observations in the quest to detect the 21-cm signal from the EoR.</description>

      <title>Reionization and the Hubble Constant: Correlations in the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has found early galaxies producing photons from more efficient ionization than previously assumed. This may suggest a reionization process with a larger reionization optical depth, $\tau_{\rm reio}$, in some mild disagreement with that inferred from measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB). Intriguingly, the CMB would prefer larger values of $\tau_{\rm reio}$, more consistent with the recent JWST hint, if the large-scale measurements (i.e. $\ell &lt;30$) of E-mode polarization are removed. In addition, $\tau_{\rm reio}$ has an indirect correlation with today's Hubble constant $H_0$ in $\Lambda$CDM. Motivated by these interesting observations, we investigate and reveal the underlying mechanism for this correlation, using the CMB dataset without the low-$\ell$ polarization data as a proxy for a potential cosmology with a larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$. We further explore how this correlation may impact the Hubble tension between early and late universe measurements of $H_0$, in $\Lambda$CDM as well as two proposals to alleviate the Hubble tension: the dark radiation (DR) and early dark energy (EDE) models. We find that the Hubble tension gets further reduced mildly for almost all cases due to the larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$ and its positive correlation with $H_0$, with either the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data before those from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) or the DESI data.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Coupled Scalar Dark Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled dark sector models have gained significant attention, motivated by recent advances in cosmology and the pressing need to address unresolved puzzles. In this work, we study coupled scalar dark sector models inspired by ultraviolet-complete frameworks such as supergravity and string theory. These models involve scalar couplings arising either from their kinetic terms, through a non-trivial field space metric, or from their scalar potential. We demonstrate how these couplings can be elegantly formulated in terms of an interacting vector, a standard tool in coupled dark sector studies, and analyse their distinct cosmological effects using a dynamical systems approach. Using this framework, we further investigate an axio-dilaton system recently explored in the literature, where the dilaton also couples to baryons. Intriguingly, we show that certain kinetic and potential interactions may mimic one another or even cancel out, making them observationally indistinguishable. If such a distinction becomes possible through observational constraints, it could provide valuable insights into the underlying field space metric and its connection to fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>A New Source for (QCD) Axion Dark Matter Production: Curvature-Induced</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a novel mechanism for generating dark matter from a fast-rolling scalar field, relevant for both inflation and rotating axion models, and apply it specifically to the (QCD) axion. Dark matter comes from scalar field fluctuations generated by the product of the curvature perturbation and the fast-rolling background field. These fluctuations can explain the totality of dark matter in a vast axion parameter space, particularly for the QCD axion, which will be targeted by upcoming experiments. We review the constraints on this mechanism and potential gravitational-wave signatures.</description>

      <title>The effects of projection on measuring the splashback feature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The splashback radius $R_{\rm sp}$ is a boundary of a halo that separates infalling and accreted matter. This results in a steep drop in the density profile at $R_{\rm st}$, which is a commonly adopted proxy for $R_{\rm sp}$. Observationally, $R_{\rm st}$ can be measured through fitting the projected galaxy number density profile of the halo, but there has been some discrepancy between the observed and expected $R_{\rm st}$. Therefore, we investigate whether the projection of the density profile onto the plane of the sky could lead to any systematic bias in determining $R_{\rm st}$, by studying the true 3-dimensional and projected halo density profiles from the IllustrisTNG simulation. We investigate a range of projection lengths, and find that $R^p_{\rm st}$ obtained from projected profiles is close to the true $R^*_{\rm st}$, but has a slight decreasing trend with increasing projection length. We also quantify the prominence of the splashback feature and find how the feature shape changes with projection length.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Molecular Hydrogen Cooling on the Galaxy Formation Threshold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of molecular (${\rm H_2}$) and atomic (HI) hydrogen cooling on the galaxy formation threshold. We calculate the fraction of dark matter (DM) halos that exceed a critical mass required for star formation, $M_{\mathrm{crit}}(z)$, as a function of their peak mass. By convolving analytic halo mass accretion histories (MAHs) with models for $M_{\mathrm{crit}}(z)$, we predict that halos with peak virial masses below $\sim 10^8~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ can form stars before reionization through ${\rm H_2}$ cooling. These halos remain dark when only HI cooling and reionization are modeled. However, less than $\approx 10\%$ of halos with peak masses below $\sim 10^{7}~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ ever exceed $M_{\mathrm{crit}}(z)$, even when ${\rm H_2}$ cooling is included; this threshold is primarily set by relative streaming motion between DM and baryons imprinted at recombination. We obtain similar results using subhalo MAHs from an extremely high-resolution cosmological DM--only zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way (MW) analog (particle mass $6.3\times 10^3~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$). Based on the abundance of MW satellites, these results imply that at least some known ultra-faint dwarf galaxies formed through ${\rm H_2}$ cooling. This work sharpens predictions for the galaxy formation threshold and demonstrates how its essential features emerge from the underlying distribution of halo growth histories.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Misalignment Mechanism for Axion Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rotation in the field space of a complex scalar field corresponds to a Bose-Einstein condensation of $U(1)$ charges. We point out that fluctuations in this rotating condensate exhibit sound-wave modes, which can be excited by cosmic perturbations and identified with axion fluctuations once the $U(1)$ charge condensate has been sufficiently diluted by cosmic expansion. We consider the possibility that these axion fluctuations constitute dark matter and develop a formalism to compute its abundance. We carefully account for the growth of fluctuations during the epoch where the complex scalar field rotates on the body of the potential and possible nonlinear evolution when the fluctuations become non-relativistic. We find that the resultant dark matter abundance can exceed the conventional and kinetic misalignment contributions if the radial direction of the complex scalar field is sufficiently heavy. The axion dark matter may also be warm enough to leave imprints on structure formation. We discuss the implications of this novel dark matter production mechanism -- {\it acoustic misalignment mechanism} -- for the axion rotation cosmology, including kination domination and baryogenesis from axion rotation, as well as for axion searches.</description>

      <title>Prospects of future MeV telescopes in probing weak-scale Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic weak-scale Dark Matter (DM) particles annihilating into lepton-rich channels not only produce gamma-rays via prompt radiation but also generate abundant energetic electrons and positrons, which subsequently emit through bremsstrahlung or inverse Compton scattering (collectively called `secondary-radiation photons'). While the prompt gamma-rays concentrate at high-energy, the secondary emission falls in the MeV range, which a number of upcoming experiments (AMEGO, E-ASTROGAM, MAST...) will probe. We investigate the sensitivity of these future telescopes for weak-scale DM, focusing for definiteness on observations of the galactic center. We find that they have the potential of probing a wide region of the DM parameter space which is currently unconstrained. Namely, in rather optimistic configurations, future MeV telescopes could probe thermally-produced DM with a mass up to the TeV range, or GeV DM with an annihilation cross section 2 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the current bounds, precisely thanks to the significant leverage provided by their sensitivity to secondary emissions. We comment on astrophysical and methodological uncertainties, and compare with the reach of high-energy gamma ray experiments.</description>

      <title>Bridging between reheating and late-time observations in quintessential inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an idea to build a bridge between reheating and late-time observations in quintessential inflation by backtracking the evolution of the inflaton field from the present time to the end of reheating. This idea is implemented when the potential gradient is negligible compared to the Hubble friction, rendering the inflaton field frozen, till the present time. We find a simple analytic relation between the reheating temperature and the observational parameters for dark energy, and numerically confirm its validity for typical models of quintessential inflation. This relation is universal and can apply to all quintessential inflation models with any reheating mechanism. It also implies that any quintessential inflation model with a successful reheating with the reheating temperature $1\textrm{MeV}\lesssim T_\textrm{re}\lesssim 10^{15}\textrm{GeV}$ predicts the equation of state of dark energy today extremely close to $-1$, i.e. $-1+10^{-60}\lesssim w_0\lesssim -1+10^{-24}$, unless the inflaton field unfreezes before the present time.</description>

      <title>Search for primordial black holes from gravitational wave populations using deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) signals detected by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration might be sourced (partly) by the merges of primordial black holes (PBHs). The conventional hierarchical Bayesian inference methods can allow us to study population properties of GW events to search for the hints for PBHs. However, hierarchical Bayesian analysis require an analytic population model, and becomes increasingly computationally expensive as the number of sources grows. In this paper, we present a novel population analysis method based on deep learning, which enables the direct and efficient estimation of PBH population hyperparameters, such as the PBH fraction in dark matter, $f_{\rm PBH}$. Our approach leverages neural posterior estimation combined with conditional normalizing flows and two embedding networks. Our results demonstrate that inference can be performed within seconds, highlighting the promise of deep learning as a powerful tool for population inference with an increasing number of GW signals for next-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>Bayesian framework to infer the Hubble constant from the cross-correlation of individual gravitational wave events with galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from the inspiral of binary compact objects offer a one-step measurement of the luminosity distance to the event, which is essential for the measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, which characterizes the expansion rate of the Universe. However, unlike binary neutron stars, the inspiral of binary black holes is not expected to be accompanied by electromagnetic radiation and a subsequent determination of its redshift. Consequently, independent redshift measurements of such GW events are necessary to measure $H_0$. In this study, we present a novel Bayesian approach to infer $H_0$ by measuring the overdensity of galaxies around individual binary black hole merger events in configuration space. We model the measured overdensity using the $3$D cross-correlation between galaxies and GW events, explicitly accounting for the GW event localization uncertainty. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method with $250$ simulated GW events distributed within $1$ Gpc in colored Gaussian noise of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors operating at O4 sensitivity. We show that such measurements can constrain the Hubble constant with a precision of $\lesssim 8 \%$ ($90\%$ highest density interval). We highlight the potential improvements that need to be accounted for in further studies before the method can be applied to real data.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning-based method for the detection of the unique gravitational microlensing signatures of extended dark objects, such as boson stars, axion miniclusters and subhalos. We adapt MicroLIA, a machine learning-based package tailored to handle the challenges posed by low-cadence data in microlensing surveys. Using realistic observational timestamps, our models are trained on simulated light curves to distinguish between microlensing by point-like and extended lenses, as well as from other object classes which give a variable magnitude. We show that boson stars, examples of objects with a relatively flat mass distribution, can be confidently identified for $0.8 \lesssim r/r_E\lesssim 3$. Intriguingly, we also find that more sharply peaked structures, such as NFW-subhalos, can be distinctly recognized from point-lenses under regular observation cadence. Our findings significantly advance the potential of microlensing data in uncovering the elusive nature of extended dark objects. The code and dataset used are also provided.</description>

      <title>The impact of large-scale galaxy clustering on the variance of the Hellings-Downs correlation: theoretical framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While pulsar timing array experiments have recently found evidence for the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, its origin is still unclear. If this background is of astrophysical origin, we expect the distribution of GW sources to follow the one of galaxies. Since galaxies are not perfectly isotropically distributed at large scales, but follow the cosmological large-scale structure, this would lead to an intrinsic anisotropy in the distribution of GW sources. In this work, we develop a formalism to account for this anisotropy, by considering a Gaussian ensemble of sources in each realization of the universe and then taking ensemble averages over all such realizations. We find that large-scale galaxy clustering has no impact on the expectation value of pulsar timing residual correlations, described by the Hellings-Downs curve. However, it introduces a new contribution to the variance of the Hellings-Downs correlation. Hence, the anisotropic distribution of sources contributes to the amount by which the measurements of pulsar timing residual correlations, in our single realization of the universe, may differ from the Hellings-Downs curve.</description>

      <title>Full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors: cosmological parameters and the structure growth anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors, which is the simplest approach to galaxy clustering data analysis that combines effective field theory (EFT) on large scales and numerical simulations on small scales. The core ingredient of our approach is the prior density of EFT parameters which we extract from a suite of 10500 galaxy simulations based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model. We measure the EFT parameters with the field-level forward model, which enables us to cancel cosmic variance. On the theory side, we develop a new efficient approach to calculate field-level transfer functions using time-sliced perturbation theory and the logarithmic fast Fourier transform. We find that the cosmology dependence of EFT parameters of galaxies is approximately degenerate with the HOD parameters, and hence it can be ignored for the purpose of prior generation. We use neural density estimation to model the measured distribution of EFT parameters. Our distribution model is then used as a prior in a reanalysis of the BOSS full-shape galaxy power spectrum data. Assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model, we find significant ($\approx 30\%$ and $\approx 60\%$) improvements for the matter density fraction and the mass fluctuation amplitude, which are constrained to $\Omega_{m}= 0.315 \pm 0.010$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.671 \pm 0.027$. The value of the Hubble constant does not change, $H_0= 68.7\pm 1.1$~km/s/Mpc. This reaffirms earlier reports of the structure growth tension from the BOSS data. Finally, we use the measured EFT parameters to constrain the galaxy-dark matter connection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic inflation, together with the $\Delta N$ formalism, provides a powerful tool for estimating the large-scale behaviour of primordial fluctuations. In this work, we develop a numerical code to capture the non-perturbative statistics of these fluctuations and validate it to obtain the exponential non-Gaussian tail of the curvature perturbations. We present a numerical algorithm to compute the non-perturbative curvature power spectrum and apply it to both slow-roll (SR) and ultra-slow-roll (USR) single-field models of inflation. We accurately generate a non-perturbative scale-invariant power spectrum in the SR scenario. In the USR case, we obtain a peak in the power spectrum that, in the time-independent regime, aligns with the structure of its perturbative counterpart. Additionally, We underscore how the evolving nature of the super-Hubble perturbations in the USR model complicates the numerical computation of the non-perturbative spectrum.</description>

      <title>Kick it like DESI: PNGB quintessence with a dynamically generated initial velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the hint for time-dependent dynamical dark energy from an analysis of the DESI Baryon Accoustic Oscillation (BAO) data together with information from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Supernovae (SN), we relax the assumption of a vanishing initial velocity for a quintessence field. In particular we focus on pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-Boson (PNGB) quintessence in the form of an axion like particle, that can arise as the phase of a complex scalar and could possess derivative couplings to fermions or topological couplings to abelian gauge fields, without upsetting the necessary flatness of its potential. We discuss mechanisms from the aforementioned interactions for sourcing an initial axion field velocity $\dot{\theta_i}$ at redshifts $3\leq z\leq 10$, that will "kick" it into motion. Driven by this initial velocity the axion will first roll up in its potential, similar to "freezing" dark energy. After it has reached the pinnacle of its trajectory, it will start to roll down, and behave as "thawing" quintessence. As a proof of concept we undertake a combined fit to BAO, SN and CMB data at the background level. We find that a scenario with $\dot{\theta_i}=\mathcal{O}(1) \; m_a$, where $m_a$ is the axion mass, is slightly preferred over both $\Lambda$CDM and the conventional "thawing" quintessence with $\dot{\theta_i}=0$. The best fit points for this case exhibit transplanckian decay constants and very flat potentials, which both are in tension with conjectures from string theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism of primordial black hole (PBH) formation through inverted bubble collapse. In this scenario, bubbles nucleate sparsely in an incomplete first-order phase transition, followed by a bulk phase transition in the rest of the universe that inverts these pre-existing bubbles into false vacuum regions. These spherically symmetric false-vacuum bubbles subsequently collapse to form PBHs. Unlike conventional PBH formation mechanisms associated with domain wall collapse or bubble coalescence, our inverted bubble collapse mechanism naturally ensures spherical collapse. We demonstrate that, when applied to the singlet extension of the Standard Model, this mechanism can produce highly monochromatic PBHs with masses up to ${\cal O}(10^{-7}\,\text{-}\,10^{-5}) M_\odot$, which potentially explain the microlensing events observed in the OGLE and Subaru HSC data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectroscopic study of black hole quasinormal modes in gravitational-wave ringdown observations is hindered by our ignorance of which modes should dominate astrophysical signals for different binary configurations, limiting tests of general relativity and astrophysics. In this work, we present a description of the quasinormal modes that are excited in the ringdowns of comparable mass, quasi-circular precessing binary black hole coalescences -- a key region of parameter space that has yet to be fully explored within the framework of black hole spectroscopy. We suggest that the remnant perturbation for precessing and non-precessing systems is approximately the same up to a rotation, which implies that the relative amplitudes of the quasinormal modes in both systems are also related by a rotation. We present evidence for this by analyzing an extensive catalog of numerical relativity simulations. Additional structure in the amplitudes is connected to the system's kick velocity and other asymmetries in the orbital dynamics. We find that the ringdowns of precessing systems need not be dominated by the ${(\ell,m)=(2,\pm 2)}$ quasinormal modes, and that instead the $(2,\pm 1)$~or~$(2,0)$ quasinormal modes can dominate. Our results are consistent with a ringdown analysis of the LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave signal GW190521, and may also help in understanding phenomenological inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model systematics.</description>

Abstract: Recent years have seen a great improvement in the computation of $CP$-conserving and $CP$-violating equilibration rates for leptogenesis. These are relevant for the relativistic regime of the sterile Majorana fermions and the dynamics of the Standard Model particles acting as spectator processes. In order to probe the regime of large $({\cal O}(10^2))$ washout parameters, we add $\Delta L = 2$ washout processes, which we derive in the CTP-formalism. To demonstrate their significance, we apply state-of-the-art computational techniques to a simple yet well-motivated phenomenological scenario: unflavored leptogenesis in a hierarchical type-I seesaw model. We then perform a parameter scan of the final baryon asymmetry and find a constraint $m_\text{lightest} \lesssim 0.15 \, \text{eV}$ on the absolute neutrino mass scale, which is slightly less stringent than previously reported bounds obtained without the aforementioned improvements. The relaxation of the bounds is mainly due to partially equilibrated spectator fields, which protect part of the asymmetry from washout and lead to larger final asymmetries. While this might seem like a minor correction, the actual dynamics of the fields is substantially altered by these effects. Even though we focused on a particularly simple scenario for leptogenesis, the methods employed here can and should be extended to other models, thus giving us a more accurate picture of the different leptogenesis scenarios.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the Coma cluster, one of the richest and most well-known systems at low redshifts, to explore the importance of low-flux objects in the identification of cluster substructures. In addition, we conduct a study of the infall flow around Coma, considering the presence or absence of low-flux objects across the projected phase space of the cluster. Our results indicate that low-luminosity galaxies play a fundamental role in understanding the dynamical state of galaxy clusters. These galaxies, often overlooked because of their faint nature, serve as sensitive tracers of substructure dynamics and provide crucial insights into the cluster's evolutionary history. We show that not considering the low-flux objects present in clusters can lead to significant underestimates of the numbers of substructures, both in most central parts, in the infall regions, and beyond, connecting to the large-scale structure up to a distance of approximately $8 R_{200}$ from the center of Coma.</description>
