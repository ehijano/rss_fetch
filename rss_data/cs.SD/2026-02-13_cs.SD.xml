      <title>Surface impedance inference via neural fields and sparse acoustic data obtained by a compact array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standardized laboratory characterizations for absorbing materials rely on idealized sound field assumptions, which deviate largely from real-life conditions. Consequently, \emph{in-situ} acoustic characterization has become essential for accurate diagnosis and virtual prototyping. We propose a physics-informed neural field that reconstructs local, near-surface broadband sound fields from sparse pressure samples to directly infer complex surface impedance. A parallel, multi-frequency architecture enables a broadband impedance retrieval within runtimes on the order of seconds to minutes. To validate the method, we developed a compact microphone array with low hardware complexity. Numerical verifications and laboratory experiments demonstrate accurate impedance retrieval with a small number of sensors under realistic conditions. We further showcase the approach in a vehicle cabin to provide practical guidance on measurement locations that avoid strong interference. Here, we show that this approach offers a robust means of characterizing \emph{in-situ} boundary conditions for architectural and automotive acoustics.</description>

      <title>Musical Metamerism with Time--Frequency Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of metamerism originates from colorimetry, where it describes a sensation of visual similarity between two colored lights despite significant differences in spectral content. Likewise, we propose to call ``musical metamerism'' the sensation of auditory similarity which is elicited by two music fragments which differ in terms of underlying waveforms. In this technical report, we describe a method to generate musical metamers from any audio recording. Our method is based on joint time--frequency scattering in Kymatio, an open-source software in Python which enables GPU computing and automatic differentiation. The advantage of our method is that it does not require any manual preprocessing, such as transcription, beat tracking, or source separation. We provide a mathematical description of JTFS as well as some excerpts from the Kymatio source code. Lastly, we review the prior work on JTFS and draw connections with closely related algorithms, such as spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRF), modulation power spectra (MPS), and Gabor filterbank (GBFB).</description>

      <title>Echo: Towards Advanced Audio Comprehension via Audio-Interleaved Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maturation of Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) has raised growing expectations for them to comprehend complex audio much like humans. Current efforts primarily replicate text-based reasoning by contextualizing audio content through a one-time encoding, which introduces a critical information bottleneck. Drawing inspiration from human cognition, we propose audio-interleaved reasoning to break through this bottleneck. It treats audio as an active reasoning component, enabling sustained audio engagement and perception-grounded analysis. To instantiate it, we introduce a two-stage training framework, first teaching LALMs to localize salient audio segments through supervised fine-tuning, and then incentivizing proficient re-listening via reinforcement learning. In parallel, a structured data generation pipeline is developed to produce high-quality training data. Consequently, we present Echo, a LALM capable of dynamically re-listening to audio in demand during reasoning. On audio comprehension benchmarks, Echo achieves overall superiority in both challenging expert-level and general-purpose tasks. Comprehensive analysis further confirms the efficiency and generalizability of audio-interleaved reasoning, establishing it as a promising direction for advancing audio comprehension.

      <title>TADA! Tuning Audio Diffusion Models through Activation Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio diffusion models can synthesize high-fidelity music from text, yet their internal mechanisms for representing high-level concepts remain poorly understood. In this work, we use activation patching to demonstrate that distinct semantic musical concepts, such as the presence of specific instruments, vocals, or genre characteristics, are controlled by a small, shared subset of attention layers in state-of-the-art audio diffusion architectures. Next, we demonstrate that applying Contrastive Activation Addition and Sparse Autoencoders in these layers enables more precise control over the generated audio, indicating a direct benefit of the specialization phenomenon. By steering activations of the identified layers, we can alter specific musical elements with high precision, such as modulating tempo or changing a track's mood.</description>

      <title>When Audio-LLMs Don't Listen: A Cross-Linguistic Study of Modality Arbitration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When audio and text conflict, speech-enabled language models follow the text 10 times more often than when arbitrating between two text sources, even when explicitly instructed to trust the audio. Using ALME, a benchmark of 57,602 controlled audio-text conflict stimuli across 8 languages, we find that Gemini 2.0 Flash exhibits 16.6\% text dominance under audio-text conflict versus 1.6\% under text-text conflict with identical reliability cues. This gap is not explained by audio quality: audio-only accuracy (97.2\%) exceeds cascade accuracy (93.9\%), indicating audio embeddings preserve more information than text transcripts. We propose that text dominance reflects an asymmetry not in information content but in arbitration accessibility: how easily the model can reason over competing representations.
  This framework explains otherwise puzzling findings. Forcing transcription before answering increases text dominance (19\% to 33\%), sacrificing audio's information advantage without improving accessibility. Framing text as ``deliberately corrupted'' reduces text dominance by 80\%. A fine-tuning ablation provides interventional evidence: training only the audio projection layer increases text dominance (+26.5\%), while LoRA on the language model halves it ($-$23.9\%), localizing text dominance to the LLM's reasoning rather than the audio encoder. Experiments across four state-of-the-art audio-LLMs and 8 languages show consistent trends with substantial cross-linguistic and cross-model variation, establishing modality arbitration as a distinct reliability dimension not captured by standard speech benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Moonshine v2: Ergodic Streaming Encoder ASR for Latency-Critical Speech Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latency-critical speech applications (e.g., live transcription, voice commands, and real-time translation) demand low time-to-first-token (TTFT) and high transcription accuracy, particularly on resource-constrained edge devices. Full-attention Transformer encoders remain a strong accuracy baseline for automatic speech recognition (ASR) because every frame can directly attend to every other frame, which resolves otherwise locally ambiguous acoustics using distant lexical context. However, this global dependency incurs quadratic complexity in sequence length, inducing an inherent "encode-the-whole-utterance" latency profile. For streaming use cases, this causes TTFT to grow linearly with utterance length as the encoder must process the entire prefix before any decoder token can be emitted. To better meet the needs of on-device, streaming ASR use cases we introduce Moonshine v2, an ergodic streaming-encoder ASR model that employs sliding-window self-attention to achieve bounded, low-latency inference while preserving strong local context. Our models achieve state of the art word error rates across standard benchmarks, attaining accuracy on-par with models 6x their size while running significantly faster. These results demonstrate that carefully designed local attention is competitive with the accuracy of full attention at a fraction of the size and latency cost, opening new possibilities for interactive speech interfaces on edge devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imagine placing your smartphone on a table in a noisy restaurant and clearly capturing the voices of friends seated around you, or recording a lecturer's voice with clarity in a reverberant auditorium. We introduce SonicSieve, the first intelligent directional speech extraction system for smartphones using a bio-inspired acoustic microstructure. Our passive design embeds directional cues onto incoming speech without any additional electronics. It attaches to the in-line mic of low-cost wired earphones which can be attached to smartphones. We present an end-to-end neural network that processes the raw audio mixtures in real-time on mobile devices. Our results show that SonicSieve achieves a signal quality improvement of 5.0 dB when focusing on a 30{\deg} angular region. Additionally, the performance of our system based on only two microphones exceeds that of conventional 5-microphone arrays.</description>

      <title>Lightweight and Generalizable Acoustic Scene Representations via Contrastive Fine-Tuning and Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acoustic scene classification (ASC) models on edge devices typically operate under fixed class assumptions, lacking the transferability needed for real-world applications that require adaptation to new or refined acoustic categories. We propose ContrastASC, which learns generalizable acoustic scene representations by structuring the embedding space to preserve semantic relationships between scenes, enabling adaptation to unseen categories without retraining. Our approach combines supervised contrastive fine-tuning of pre-trained models with contrastive representation distillation to transfer this structured knowledge to compact student models. Our evaluation shows that ContrastASC demonstrates improved few-shot adaptation to unseen categories while maintaining strong closed-set performance.</description>

      <title>Improving Speech Emotion Recognition with Mutual Information Regularized Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10078v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lack of large, well-annotated emotional speech corpora continues to limit the performance and robustness of speech emotion recognition (SER), particularly as models grow more complex and the demand for multimodal systems increases. While generative data augmentation offers a promising solution, existing approaches often produce emotionally inconsistent samples due to oversimplified conditioning on categorical labels. This paper introduces a novel mutual-information-regularised generative framework that combines cross-modal alignment with feature-level synthesis. Building on an InfoGAN-style architecture, our method first learns a semantically aligned audio-text representation space using pre-trained transformers and contrastive objectives. A feature generator is then trained to produce emotion-aware audio features while employing mutual information as a quantitative regulariser to ensure strong dependency between generated features and their conditioning variables. We extend this approach to multimodal settings, enabling the generation of novel, paired (audio, text) features. Comprehensive evaluation on three benchmark datasets (IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV, MSP-Podcast) demonstrates that our framework consistently outperforms existing augmentation methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improvements of up to 2.6% in unimodal SER and 3.2% in multimodal emotion recognition. Most importantly, we demonstrate that mutual information functions as both a regulariser and a measurable metric for generative quality, offering a systematic approach to data augmentation in affective computing.</description>

      <title>Stable Differentiable Modal Synthesis for Learning Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modal methods are a long-standing approach to physical modelling synthesis. Extensions to nonlinear problems are possible, leading to coupled nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations. Recent work in scalar auxiliary variable techniques has enabled construction of explicit and stable numerical solvers for such systems. On the other hand, neural ordinary differential equations have been successful in modelling nonlinear systems from data. In this work, we examine how scalar auxiliary variable techniques can be combined with neural ordinary differential equations to yield a stable differentiable model capable of learning nonlinear dynamics. The proposed approach leverages the analytical solution for linear vibration of the system's modes so that physical parameters of a system remain easily accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the model architecture. Compared to our previous work that used multilayer perceptrons to parametrise nonlinear dynamics, we employ gradient networks that allow an interpretation in terms of a closed-form and non-negative potential required by scalar auxiliary variable techniques. As a proof of concept, we generate synthetic data for the nonlinear transverse vibration of a string and show that the model can be trained to reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Sound examples are presented.</description>

      <title>No Word Left Behind: Mitigating Prefix Bias in Open-Vocabulary Keyword Spotting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary keyword spotting (OV-KWS) enables personalized device control via arbitrary voice commands. Recently, researchers have explored using audio-text joint embeddings, allowing users to enroll phrases with text, and proposed techniques to disambiguate similar utterances. We find that existing OV-KWS solutions often overly bias the beginning phonemes of an enrollment, causing false triggers when negative enrollment-query-pairs share a prefix (``turn the volume up'' vs. ``turn the volume down''). We trace this to two factors: training data bias and position-biased cross-modal scoring. To address these limitations, we introduce the Partial Overlap Benchmark (POB) with two datasets, POB-Spark and POB-LibriPhrase (POB-LP), containing mismatched audio-text pairs with shared prefixes, and propose Equal-weighting Position Scoring (EPS), a lightweight decision layer. Using EPS alone reduces EER on POB-Spark from 64.4\% to 29.3\% and improves POB-LP accuracy from 87.6\% to 96.8\%, while maintaining performance on LibriPhrase and Google Speech Commands (GSC). With POB data added in training, our work achieves the best POB benchmark results while incurring the least amount of degradation on prior metrics among baselines. This degradation is most pronounced in GSC, which contains only one-word commands. We surface mitigating this trade-off as future work.</description>

      <title>NarraScore: Bridging Visual Narrative and Musical Dynamics via Hierarchical Affective Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthesizing coherent soundtracks for long-form videos remains a formidable challenge, currently stalled by three critical impediments: computational scalability, temporal coherence, and, most critically, a pervasive semantic blindness to evolving narrative logic. To bridge these gaps, we propose NarraScore, a hierarchical framework predicated on the core insight that emotion serves as a high-density compression of narrative logic. Uniquely, we repurpose frozen Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as continuous affective sensors, distilling high-dimensional visual streams into dense, narrative-aware Valence-Arousal trajectories. Mechanistically, NarraScore employs a Dual-Branch Injection strategy to reconcile global structure with local dynamism: a \textit{Global Semantic Anchor} ensures stylistic stability, while a surgical \textit{Token-Level Affective Adapter} modulates local tension via direct element-wise residual injection. This minimalist design bypasses the bottlenecks of dense attention and architectural cloning, effectively mitigating the overfitting risks associated with data scarcity. Experiments demonstrate that NarraScore achieves state-of-the-art consistency and narrative alignment with negligible computational overhead, establishing a fully autonomous paradigm for long-video soundtrack generation.</description>

      <title>MOSS-Audio-Tokenizer: Scaling Audio Tokenizers for Future Audio Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete audio tokenizers are fundamental to empowering large language models with native audio processing and generation capabilities. Despite recent progress, existing approaches often rely on pretrained encoders, semantic distillation, or heterogeneous CNN-based architectures. These designs introduce fixed inductive biases that limit reconstruction fidelity and hinder effective scaling. In this paper, we argue that discrete audio tokenization should be learned fully end-to-end using a homogeneous and scalable architecture. To this end, we first propose CAT (Causal Audio Tokenizer with Transformer), a purely Transformer-based architecture that jointly optimizes the encoder, quantizer, and decoder from scratch for high-fidelity reconstruction. Building on the CAT architecture, we develop MOSS-Audio-Tokenizer, a large-scale audio tokenizer featuring 1.6 billion parameters, pre-trained on 3 million hours of diverse, general audio data. We show that this simple, fully end-to-end approach built from homogeneous, causal Transformer blocks scales gracefully and supports high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse audio domains. Across speech, sound, and music, MOSS-Audio-Tokenizer consistently outperforms prior codecs over a wide range of bitrates, while exhibiting predictable improvements with increased scale. Notably, leveraging the discrete tokens from our model, we develop the first purely autoregressive TTS model that surpasses prior non-autoregressive and cascaded systems. Furthermore, MOSS-Audio-Tokenizer enables competitive ASR performance without auxiliary encoders. Our findings position the CAT architecture as a unified, scalable interface for the next generation of native audio foundation models.</description>

      <title>Tiny is not small enough: High-quality, low-resource facial animation models through hybrid knowledge distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The training of high-quality, robust machine learning models for speech-driven 3D facial animation requires a large, diverse dataset of high-quality audio-animation pairs. To overcome the lack of such a dataset, recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations. This paves the way for on-device inference, an important step towards realistic, model-driven digital characters.</description>

      <title>How Does a Deep Neural Network Look at Lexical Stress in English Words?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07229</link>

Abstract: Despite their success in speech processing, neural networks often operate as black boxes, prompting the question: what informs their decisions, and how can we interpret them? This work examines this issue in the context of lexical stress. A dataset of English disyllabic words was automatically constructed from read and spontaneous speech. Several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were trained to predict stress position from a spectrographic representation of disyllabic words lacking minimal stress pairs (e.g., initial stress WAllet, final stress exTEND), achieving up to 92% accuracy on held-out test data. Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique for neural network interpretability analysis, revealed that predictions for held-out minimal pairs (PROtest vs. proTEST ) were most strongly influenced by information in stressed versus unstressed syllables, particularly the spectral properties of stressed vowels. However, the classifiers also attended to information throughout the word. A feature-specific relevance analysis is proposed, and its results suggest that our best-performing classifier is strongly influenced by the stressed vowel's first and second formants, with some evidence that its pitch and third formant also contribute. These results reveal deep learning's ability to acquire distributed cues to stress from naturally occurring data, extending traditional phonetic work based around highly controlled stimuli.</description>

      <title>AuthGlass: Benchmarking Voice Liveness Detection and Authentication on Smart Glasses via Comprehensive Acoustic Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20799v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of smart glasses, voice interaction has been widely adopted due to its naturalness and convenience. However, its practical deployment is often undermined by vulnerability to spoofing attacks, while no public dataset currently exists for voice liveness detection and authentication in smart-glasses scenarios. To address this challenge, we first collect a multi-acoustic-modal dataset comprising 16-channel audio data from 42 subjects, along with corresponding attack samples covering two attack categories. Based on insights derived from this collected data, we propose AuthG-Live, a sound-field-based voice liveness detection method, and AuthG-Net, a multi-acoustic-modal authentication model. We further benchmark seven voice liveness detection methods and four authentication methods across diverse acoustic modalities. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark tasks, and extensive ablation studies validate the generalizability of our methods across different modality combinations. Finally, we release this dataset, termed AuthGlass, to facilitate future research on voice liveness detection and authentication for smart glasses.</description>
