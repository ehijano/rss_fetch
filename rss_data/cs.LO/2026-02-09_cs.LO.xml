      <title>The proof theory and semantics of second-order (intuitionistic) tense logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a second-order extension of intuitionistic modal logic, allowing quantification over propositions, both syntactically and semantically. A key feature of second-order logic is its capacity to define positive connectives from the negative fragment. Duly we are able to recover the diamond (and its associated theory) using only boxes, as long as we include both forward and backward modalities (`tense' modalities).
  We propose axiomatic, proof theoretic and model theoretic definitions of `second-order intuitionistic tense logic', and ultimately prove that they all coincide. In particular we establish completeness of a labelled sequent calculus via a proof search argument, yielding at the same time a cut-admissibility result. Our methodology also applies to the classical version of second-order tense logic, which we develop in tandem with the intuitionistic case.</description>

      <title>Linear Realisability and Implicative Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizability, introduced by Kleene, can be understood as a concretization of the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov (BHK) interpretation of proofs, providing a framework to interpret mathematical statements and proofs in terms of their constructive or computational content. Over time, this concept has evolved through various extensions, such as Kreisel's modified realizability or Krivine's classical realizability. Parallel to these developments, Girard's work on linear logic introduced another perspective, often seen as another concrete realization of the BHK interpretation. The resulting constructions, encompassing models like geometry of interaction, ludics, and interaction graphs, were recently unified under the term linear realizability models to stress the intuitive connection with intuitionnistic and classical realizability. The present work establishes for the first time a formal link between linear realizability models and the realizability constructions of Kleene and Krivine. Our approach leverages Miquel's framework: just as linear logic can be viewed as a decomposition of intuitionistic and classical logic, we propose a linear decomposition of implicative algebras and show that linear realisability models provide concrete examples of such decompositions.</description>

      <title>Topological Semantics for Common Inductive Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lewis' account of common knowledge in Convention describes the generation of higher-order expectations between agents as hinging upon agents' inductive standards and a shared witness. This paper attempts to draw from insights in learning theory to provide a formal account of common inductive knowledge and how it can be generated by a witness. Our language has a rather rich syntax in order to capture equally rich notions central to Lewis' account of common knowledge; for instance, we speak of an agent 'having some reason to believe' a proposition and one proposition 'indicating' to an agent that another proposition holds. A similar line of work was pursued by Cubitt &amp; Sugden 2003; however, their account was left wanting for a corresponding semantics. Our syntax affords a novel topological semantics which, following Kelly 1996's approach in The Logic of Reliable Inquiry, takes as primitives agents' information bases. In particular, we endow each agent with a 'switching tolerance' meant to represent their personal inductive standards for learning. Curiously, when all agents are truly inductive learners (not choosing to believe only those propositions which are deductively verified), we show that the set of worlds where a proposition $P$ is common inductive knowledge is invariant of agents' switching tolerances. Contrarily, the question of whether a specific witness $W$ generates common inductive knowledge of $P$ is sensitive to changing agents' switching tolerances. After establishing soundness of our proof system with respect to this semantics, we conclude by applying our logic to solve an 'inductive' variant of the coordinated attack problem.</description>

      <title>Distributed Knowledge in Simplicial Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The usual semantics of multi-agent epistemic logic is based on Kripke models, defined in terms of binary relations on a set of possible worlds. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using simplicial complexes rather than graphs, as models for multi-agent epistemic logic.
  This approach uses agents' views as the fundamental object instead of worlds. A set of views by different agents about a world forms a simplex, and a set of simplexes defines a simplicial complex, that can serve as a model for multi-agent epistemic logic. This new approach reveals topological information that is implicit in Kripke models, because the binary indistinguishability relations are more clearly seen as n-ary relations in the simplicial complex.
  This paper, written for an economics audience, introduces simplicial models to non-experts and connects distributed computing, epistemic logic and topology. Our focus is on distributed knowledge and its fixed point, common distributed knowledge. These concepts arise when considering the knowledge that a group of agents would acquire, if they could communicate their local knowledge perfectly. While common knowledge has been shown to be related to consensus, we illustrate how distributed knowledge is related to a task weaker to consensus, called majority consensus.
  We describe three models of communication, some well-known (immediate snapshot), and others less studied (related to broadcast and test-and-set). When majority consensus is solvable, we describe the distributed knowledge that is used to solve it. When it is not solvable, we present a logical obstruction, a formula that should always be known according to the task specification, but which the players cannot know.</description>

      <title>Do It for HER: First-Order Temporal Logic Reward Specification in Reinforcement Learning (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework for the logical specification of non-Markovian rewards in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with large state spaces. Our approach leverages Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over finite traces (LTLfMT), a more expressive extension of classical temporal logic in which predicates are first-order formulas of arbitrary first-order theories rather than simple Boolean variables. This enhanced expressiveness enables the specification of complex tasks over unstructured and heterogeneous data domains, promoting a unified and reusable framework that eliminates the need for manual predicate encoding. However, the increased expressive power of LTLfMT introduces additional theoretical and computational challenges compared to standard LTLf specifications. We address these challenges from a theoretical standpoint, identifying a fragment of LTLfMT that is tractable but sufficiently expressive for reward specification in an infinite-state-space context. From a practical perspective, we introduce a method based on reward machines and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to translate first-order logic specifications and address reward sparsity. We evaluate this approach to a continuous-control setting using Non-Linear Arithmetic Theory, showing that it enables natural specification of complex tasks. Experimental results show how a tailored implementation of HER is fundamental in solving tasks with complex goals.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness is Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Value independence is enormously beneficial for reasoning about software systems at scale. These benefits carry over into the world of formal verification. Reasoning about programs algebraically is a simple affair in a proof assistant, whereas programs with unconstrained mutation necessitate much more complex techniques, such as Separation Logic, where invariants about memory safety, aliasing, and state changes must be established by manual proof. Uniqueness type systems allow programs to be compiled to code that uses mutation for efficiency, while retaining a semantics that enjoys value independence for reasoning. The restrictions of these type systems, however, are often too onerous for realistic software. Thus, most uniqueness type systems include some "escape hatch" where the benefits of value independence for reasoning are lost, but the restrictions of uniqueness types are lifted. To formally verify a system with such mixed guarantees, the value independence guarantees from uniqueness types must be expressed in terms of imperative, mutable semantics. In other words, we ought to express value independence as an assertion in Separation Logic.</description>

      <title>A Complete Equational Theory for Real-Clifford+CH Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a complete equational theory for the fragment of quantum circuits generated by the real Clifford gates plus the two-qubit controlled-Hadamard gate. That is, we give a simple set of equalities between circuits of this fragment, and prove that any other true equation can be derived from these. This is the first such completeness result for a finitely-generated, universal fragment of quantum circuits, with no parameterized gates and no need for ancillas.</description>

      <title>Optimal Abstractions for Verifying Properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for verifying properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a class of neural networks characterized by nonlinear, univariate activation functions typically implemented as piecewise polynomial splines or Gaussian processes. Our method creates mathematical ``abstractions'' by replacing each KAN unit with a piecewise affine (PWA) function, providing both local and global error estimates between the original network and its approximation. These abstractions enable property verification by encoding the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), determining whether outputs satisfy specified properties when inputs belong to a given set. A critical challenge lies in balancing the number of pieces in the PWA approximation: too many pieces add binary variables that make verification computationally intractable, while too few pieces create excessive error margins that yield uninformative bounds. Our key contribution is a systematic framework that exploits KAN structure to find optimal abstractions. By combining dynamic programming at the unit level with a knapsack optimization across the network, we minimize the total number of pieces while guaranteeing specified error bounds. This approach determines the optimal approximation strategy for each unit while maintaining overall accuracy requirements. Empirical evaluation across multiple KAN benchmarks demonstrates that the upfront analysis costs of our method are justified by superior verification results.</description>

      <title>Implementing Grassroots Logic Programs with Multiagent Transition Systems and AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grassroots Logic Programs (GLP) is a concurrent logic programming language with variables partitioned into paired \emph{readers} and \emph{writers}, conjuring both linear logic and futures/promises: an assignment is produced at most once via the sole occurrence of a writer (promise) and consumed at most once via the sole occurrence of its paired reader (future), and may contain additional readers and/or writers, enabling the concise expression of rich multidirectional communication modalities.
  GLP was designed as a language for grassroots platforms -- distributed systems with multiple instances that can operate independently of each other and of any global resource, and can coalesce into ever larger instances -- with its target architecture being smartphones communicating peer-to-peer. The operational semantics of Concurrent (single-agent) GLP and of multiagent GLP (maGLP) were defined via transition systems/multiagent transition systems, respectively.
  Here, we describe the mathematics developed to facilitate the workstation- and smartphone-based implementations of GLP by AI in Dart. We developed dGLP -- implementation-ready deterministic operational semantics for single-agent GLP -- and proved it correct with respect to the Concurrent GLP operational semantics; dGLP was used by AI as a formal spec, from which it developed a workstation-based implementation of GLP. We developed madGLP -- an implementation-ready multiagent operational semantics for maGLP -- and proved it correct with respect to the maGLP operational semantics; madGLP is deterministic at the agent level (not at the system level due to communication asynchrony), and is being used by AI as a formal spec from which it develops a smartphone-based implementation of maGLP.</description>

      <title>On the role of connectivity in Linear Logic proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a property that extends the Danos-Regnier correctness criterion for linear logic proof-structures. The property applies to the correctness graphs of a proof-structure: it states that any such graph is acyclic and the number of its connected components is exactly one more than the number of nodes bottom or weakening. This is known to be necessary but not sufficient in multiplicative exponential linear logic to recover a sequent calculus proof from a proof-structure. We present a geometric condition on untyped proof-structures allowing us to turn this necessary property into a sufficient one: we can thus isolate fragments of linear logic for which this property is indeed a correctness criterion. In a suitable fragment of multiplicative linear logic with units, the criterion yields a characterization of the equivalence induced by permutations of rules in sequent calculus. In intuitionistic linear logic, the property is equivalent to the familiar requirement of having exactly one output conclusion, and it is sufficient for sequentialization in the axiom-free setting.</description>

      <title>Neuro-symbolic AI for Predictive Maintenance (PdM) -- review and recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this document we perform a systematic review of the State-of-the-art in Predictive Maintenance (PdM) over the last five years in industrial settings such as commercial buildings, pharmaceutical facilities, or semi-conductor manufacturing. In general, data-driven methods such as those based on deep learning, exhibit higher accuracy than traditional knowledge-based systems. These systems however, are not without significant limitations. The need for large labeled data sets, a lack of generalizability to new environments (out-of-distribution generalization), and a lack of transparency at inference time are some of the obstacles to adoption in real world environments. In contrast, traditional approaches based on domain expertise in the form of rules, logic or first principles suffer from poor accuracy, many false positives and a need for ongoing expert supervision and manual tuning. While the majority of approaches in recent literature utilize some form of data-driven architecture, there are hybrid systems which also take into account domain specific knowledge. Such hybrid systems have the potential to overcome the weaknesses of either approach on its own while preserving their strengths. We propose taking the hybrid approach even further and integrating deep learning with symbolic logic, or Neuro-symbolic AI, to create more accurate, explainable, interpretable, and robust systems. We describe several neuro-symbolic architectures and examine their strengths and limitations within the PdM domain. We focus specifically on methods which involve the use of sensor data and manually crafted rules as inputs by describing concrete NeSy architectures. In short, this survey outlines the context of modern maintenance, defines key concepts, establishes a generalized framework, reviews current modeling approaches and challenges, and introduces the proposed focus on Neuro-symbolic AI (NESY).</description>
