      <title>Size-dependent critical localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying critical states in quasiperiodic systems is of great importance in localization physics. Previously identified critical states share a common characteristic: they exhibit persistent critical features in the thermodynamic limit. In this Letter, we predict an exotic type of critical state, termed size-dependent critical states, which exhibit a fundamentally distinct behavior. Specifically, they display critical localization signatures only at finite sizes, but transition to Anderson localization in the thermodynamic limit. We establish that the physical origin of size-dependent critical states lies in the synergistic interplay between local non-reciprocal domain wall and NHSE. By revealing a critical phase that challenges the established paradigm of critical localization, our work opens new avenues for exploring localization phenomena in quasiperiodic systems.</description>

      <title>Localization and topological signatures under periodic twisting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically explore a dynamical generalization of the Aubry-Andr\'e model in two dimensions formed by superimposing two square-lattice potentials. Motivated by the rich physics emerging at different twist angles between the two lattices at equilibrium, we introduce periodic twisting by continuously rotating one of the lattices with respect to the other in the plane. We demonstrate that the distinct time-dependent twisting in this system gives rise to an intricate form of periodic multi-frequency driving that changes with the distance from the rotation axis. We find that the incommensurate nature of the potential no longer plays the pivotal role as it does in the static case. Rather, the tunneling can be understood in terms of a local, spatially varying dynamical localization effect, which we show to yield ring-shaped states localized within the bulk that have interesting transport signatures. Quantifying the eigenstates with the Bott index and local Chern marker, we find that there is a zoo of states with non-trivial topological signatures, the most ubiquitous of which result in relatively uniform ring-shaped regions of the Chern marker. We investigate the origin of these effects from various angles and identify that hybridization between different delocalized ring states plays a vital role. Lastly, we discuss possible experimental realizations in quantum simulation settings. Our results open a new avenue of investigation with periodic twisting inducing a spatially varying multi-frequency drive.</description>

      <title>Training the classification capability of large-scale quantum cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the vicinity of a phase transition ergodicity can be broken. Here, different initial many-body configurations evolve towards one of several fixed points, which are macroscopically distinguishable through an order parameter. This mechanism enables state classification in quantum cellular automata and feed-forward quantum neural networks. We demonstrate that this capability can be efficiently learned from training data even in extremely high-dimensional state spaces. We illustrate this using a quantum cellular automaton that allows binary classification, which is closely connected to the dynamics of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric Ising model with local interactions and dissipation. This approach can be generalized beyond binary classification and offers a natural framework for exploring the link between emergent many-body phenomena and the interpretation of data processing capabilities in the context of quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Rashba and valley-Zeeman splittings in weak localization of spin-orbit coupled graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak localization theory is developed for graphene heterostructures with transition metal dichalcogenides and topological insulators where the Rashba and valey-Zeeman spin-splittings of the energy spectrum are large enough. The anomalous magnetoresistance in low fields caused by weak localization is calculated. It is shown that the valley-Zeeman splitting has no effect on weak localization in the absence of Rashba splitting but it results in the change of the magnetoconductivity sign in the Rashba-coupled graphene. Inter-valley scattering also affects the quantum correction to the conductivity resulting in its sign reversal. Analytical expressions are obtained for the anomalous magnetoconductivity at arbitrary relations between the Rashba and valley-Zeeman splittings as well as the inter-valley scattering rates.</description>

      <title>Impact of Static Disorder and Dephasing on Quantum Transport in LH1-RC Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study excitation transfer in an artificial LH1--RC complex -- an $N$-site donor ring coupled to a central acceptor -- driven by a narrowband optical mode and evolved under a Lindblad master equation with loss and dephasing. In the absence of disorder, the light-driven system exhibits a tall, narrow on-resonance efficiency peak (near unity for our parameters); dephasing lowers and narrows this peak without shifting its position. Off resonance, the efficiency shows environmentally assisted transport with a clear non-monotonic dependence on dephasing and a finite optimum. Under static disorder, two regimes emerge: photon--ring coupling and diagonal energetic disorder mix the drive into dark ring modes, activate dissipative channels, and depress efficiency over a detuning window, whereas intra-ring coupling disorder has a much smaller impact in the tested range; increasing the intra-ring coupling $g$ moves dark-mode crossings away from the operating detuning and restores near-peak performance. In the ordered, symmetric, single-excitation, narrowband limit we \emph{analytically derive} closed-form transfer efficiencies by projecting onto the $k{=}0$ bright mode and solving the photon--bright mode--acceptor trimer via a Laplace/linear-algebra (determinant) formula; these expressions include a probability-conservation identity $\eta + \sum_k L_k = 1$ that benchmarks the simulations and quantitatively predicts the resonant line shape and its dephasing-induced narrowing. A minimal ring toy model further reproduces coherent trapping and its relief by moderate dephasing (ENAQT). These analytics are exact in the ordered limit and serve as mechanistic guides outside this limit, yielding practical design rules for robust, bio-inspired light-harvesting devices.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of disordered insulating lattice under nonlinear electric field</title>

Abstract: Quenched disorder in a solid state system can result in Anderson localization, where electrons are exponentially localized and the system behaves like an insulator. By solving exactly a disordered electronic lattice model out of equilibrium, we investigate the effect of a DC electric field on Anderson localization in an open system, and provide a minimal platform to study disorder-nonequilibrium interplay in electronic lattice systems. We perform steady-state Keldysh Green's function calculations on an infinite lattice with a finite-range of disorder-active region that are coupled to fermion reservoirs. Our solutions out of a fully electronic model verify Mott's temperature scaling of the variable-range-hopping transport and the Lifshitz tail, well-corroborated by the coherent-potential approximation. We further reveal that a nonequilibrium electronic lattice creates a statistical evolution that shows a counterintuitive shift of the distribution edge in the opposite direction of the band edge. The rich evolution of non-thermal statistics highlights the importance of an explicit band structure and the impurity correlations in strong nonequilibrium theories.</description>

      <title>Electron transport in disordered insulating lattice under nonlinear electric field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transport in disordered systems often occurs via the variable range hopping (VRH) in the dilute carrier density limit, where electrons hop between randomly distributed localized levels. We study the nonequilibrium transport by a uniform DC electric field on a one-dimensional insulating tight-binding chain with the on-site disorder, using a disordered-lattice calculation and the coherent potential approximation. We develop a theory of electric-field-assisted variable range hopping as a mechanism for nonlinear transport in a disordered chain. Our disordered-lattice calculations of the electron propagation distance and the electron mobility determine the range of the variable range hopping as $\Delta &lt; W \lesssim 2\Delta$ in the gap $\Delta$. We further propose a nonlinear scaling of the conductivity by an electric field by extending Mott's variable range hopping. The nonlinear conductivity of an electronic lattice model follows the scaling law $\sigma(E) \propto \exp[-(E_0/E)^{\nu}]$ with the exponent $\nu = 1/3$ in one dimension for the VRH. We also discuss the experimental relevance of temperature-dependent nonlinear current-voltage relation.</description>

      <title>Time-tronics: from temporal printed circuit board to quantum computer</title>

Abstract: Time crystalline structures can be created in periodically driven systems. They are temporal lattices which can reveal different condensed matter behaviours ranging from Anderson localization in time to temporal analogues of many-body localization or topological insulators. However, the potential practical applications of time crystalline structures have yet to be explored. Here, we pave the way for time-tronics where temporal lattices are like printed circuit boards for realization of a broad range of quantum devices. The elements of these devices can correspond to structures of dimensions higher than three and can be arbitrarily connected and reconfigured at any moment. Moreover, our approach allows for the construction of a quantum computer, enabling quantum gate operations for all possible pairs of qubits. Our findings indicate that the limitations faced in building devices using conventional spatial crystals can be overcome by adopting crystalline structures in time.</description>
