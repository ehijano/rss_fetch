      <title>Relativistic quintuple-zeta basis sets for the s block</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic basis sets of quintuple-zeta quality are presented for the s-block elements. The basis sets include SCF exponents for the occupied spinors and for the np shell (the latter is considered here a valence orbital). Valence and core correlating functions were optimized within multireference SDCI calculations for the ground valence configuration. Diffuse functions optimized for the corresponding anions or derived from neighboring elements are also provided. The new basis sets were applied to a range of basic atomic and molecular properties for benchmarking purposes. Smooth convergence to the basis set limit is observed with increased basis set quality from existing double-zeta, triple-zeta, and quadruple-zeta to the newly developed quintuple-zeta basis sets. Use of these basis sets in combination with state-of-the-art approaches for treatment of relativity and correlation will allow achieving higher accuracy and lower uncertainty than previously possible in calculations on heavy atoms and molecules. The basis sets are available from zenodo.org.</description>

      <title>Portable Laser-Pumped Rb Atomic Clock with Digital Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing the size and complexity of high-performance timekeeping devices is an ever-growing need for various applications, such as 6G wireless technology, positioning, navigation and timing (PNT), Internet of Things (IoT), and ultrafast spectroscopy. This work presents a distributed feedback (DFB) laser-pumped Rb atomic clock, which features extraordinary frequency stability, small size and low power consumption. The DFB laser head employs a built-in isolator with a linewidth of approximately 1 MHz. For complete optical pumping of the atoms in the absorption cell, the laser beam is expanded to a diameter of 10 mm by using an optical diffuser-based beam expander. The physics package is based on a magnetron microwave cavity and surrounded by two layers of magnetic shielding. The overall volume of the optical system combined with the physics package is 250 cm$^3$. The proposed atomic clock is also designed to operate at a low temperature, whose absorption cell is maintained at 323 K. Benefiting from the lower Rb atom density, the excited atoms present a long population relaxation time of 5.8 ms. The frequency synthesizer and frequency-locked loop are implemented by digital circuits. The short-term stability of the atomic clock is measured to be $1.8\times10^{-12}\tau ^{-1/2}$ (1-100s). Our achievement paves the way for practical application of the laser-pumped Rb atomic clocks.</description>

      <title>Relativistic atomic structure calculations in support of spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theory can provide important support at all the stages of spectroscopic experiments, from planning the measurements to the interpretation of the results. Such support is particularly valuable for the challenging experiments on heavy, unstable, and superheavy elements and for precision measurements aimed at testing the Standard Model of particle physics. To be reliable and useful in experimental context, theoretical predictions should be based on high-accuracy calculations. For heavy elements, such calculations must treat both relativistic effects and electron correlation on the highest possible level. Relativistic coupled cluster is considered one of the most powerful methods for accurate calculations on heavy many-electron atoms and molecules. This approach is highly accurate and versatile and can be used to obtain energies and a variety of atomic and molecular properties. Furthermore, its robust and transparent formulation allows for systematic improvement of the accuracy of the calculated results and for assigning uncertainties on theoretical values. The Fock-space coupled cluster (FSCC) variant of this method is particularly useful in the context of spectroscopic measurements as it provides access to atomic spectra and properties of the excited states. In this review, we present in detail the relativistic coupled cluster approach and its FSCC variant. We provide a description of the computational procedure used for accurate calculations and for assigning uncertainties. Outstanding recent examples of application to atomic properties, focusing on the experimental context are presented. Finally, we provide a brief discussion of the perspectives for future developments and applications of the CC approach.</description>

      <title>Transient Phase Sensing in a Three-Photon Rydberg Ladder Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Rydberg atoms have shown promise for use in novel types of radio frequency receivers, they have generally not been considered phase sensitive without the use of closed-loop interferometry or auxiliary radio frequency fields. Here, we show that the high coherency of a narrow-linewidth three-photon ladder excitation scheme unique to Cesium atoms enables all-optical sensing of transient changes in RF phase within a room temperature vapor cell. The transient response on the probe laser's transmission originates from phase-to-amplitude conversion via a disturbance of the coherency of the system in response to the phase shift of the radio frequency field. We show that the amplitude and frequency of the oscillatory response provides information on the magnitude and direction of any radio frequency field detuning. We demonstrate that the detuning sensitivity can be used to identify Doppler shifts in radar applications, by applying phase shifts embedded in radio frequency pulses. The phase modulation within the radar pulse acts as a form of compression that facilitates the simultaneous detection of both target position and velocity.</description>

      <title>100-ns-level timing holdover after 12 years for rubidium atomic fountains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While atomic frequency standards are improving at a staggering pace, the timing community has relied on the same continuously running atomic clocks for decades: commercial cesium beams and hydrogen masers. Challenges in incorporating the latest technological advancements into operational clocks has resulted in technology lag compared with frequency standards that consequently impacts timing applications, such as system synchronization, positioning and timescales. The first cold-atom clocks to contribute to the free running international atomic timescale, EAL, are the four rubidium fountains in operation at the U.S.~Naval Observatory in Washington, DC, that came online in 2011. With 12 years of uninterrupted data from the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) from Modified Julian Date (MJD) 56074 to MJD 60429, we report on the long-term timing performance of these clocks. The highest performing fountain exhibits TDEV of 8~ns at $\sim 3$~years and a holdover of BIPM's best timescale of $\pm14$~ns at 12 years.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Information-Inspired Ansatz for Variational Quantum Eigensolver Algorithm: Applications to Atomic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum information-inspired ansatz for the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and demonstrate its efficacy in calculating ground-state energies of atomic systems. Instead of adopting a heuristic approach, we start with an approximate multi-qubit target state and utilize two quantum information-theoretic quantities, i.e., von Neumann entropy and quantum mutual information, to construct our ansatz. The quantum information encoded in the target state helps us to design unique blocks and identify qubit pairs that share maximum quantum correlations among them in the multi-qubit system, thereby enabling us to deterministically place two-qubit entanglers in the suitably constructed parametrized quantum circuit. We find that our approach has the advantage of reduced circuit depth compared to the unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) ansatz (the gold standard for VQE), and yet yields accurate results. To test the performance of our ansatz, we apply it to compute ground-state energies of atomic systems. We find that for up to 12 qubits (or 12 spin orbitals) noiseless calculation, the proposed ansatz yields energies with 99.99% accuracy relative to the complete active space configuration interaction values, while utilizing only two blocks, which contain at most 99% fewer 2-qubit gates than the UCC ansatz.</description>

      <title>Control of Dipolar Dynamics by Geometrical Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and theoretically analyze methods for quantum many-body control through geometric reshaping of molecular tweezer arrays. Dynamic rearrangement during entanglement is readily available due to the extended coherence times of molecular rotational qubits. We show how motional dephasing can be suppressed and enhanced spin squeezing can be achieved in an actively rearranged short-range XY model. We also analyze in detail a specific static geometry that significantly suppresses decoherence. These general methods as applied to programmable quantum systems offer robust control modalities that are well suited to molecules.</description>

      <title>Atom-surface interaction induced by quenched monopolar charge disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the modification to the energy level shifts of an atom induced by the quenched monopolar charge disorder inside the bulk of neighboring dielectric slabs as well as their surfaces. By assuming that the charge disorder follows Gaussian statistics with a zero mean, we find that the disorder generally results in a downward shift of the energy levels, which corresponds to an attractive force that can compete with and overcome the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force for sufficiently large atom-surface separations $z_0$. For an atom near a single semi-infinite slab with bulk (surface) charge disorder, the shift decays as $z_0^{-1}$ ($z_0^{-2}$). For both surface and bulk disorder, the shift is proportional to the variance of the charge disorder density. In addition, we investigate the behavior of the charge disorder-induced energy level shift for an atom confined to a vacuum gap between two coplanar and semi-infinite slabs of the same dielectric material, finding that the position of net zero disorder-induced force occurs closer to the surface of the slab with the smaller charge disorder variance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of our quantum annealing computations of the permanent electric dipole
  moments of several molecules. By applying an electric field as a perturbation and measuring the
  corresponding energy responses, the molecular electric dipole moments are obtained numerically
  through the finite field method. The ground-state electronic wavefunctions and energies are obtained
  using the quantum annealer eignsolver algorithm. This work provides a pathway for the computation
  of molecular properties in the quantum annealing paradigm.</description>

      <title>Reaction processes of muon-catalyzed fusion in the muonic molecule $dd\mu$ studied with the tractable $T$-matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muon-catalyzed fusion has recently regained significant attention due to experimental and theoretical developments being performed. The present authors [Phys. Rev. C {\bf 109} 054625 (2024)] proposed the tractable $T$-matrix model based on the Lippmann-Schwinger equation to approximate the elaborate two- and three-body coupled-channel (CC) calculations [Kamimura, Kino, and Yamashita, Phys. Rev. C {\bf 107}, 034607 (2023)] for the nuclear reaction processes in the muonic molecule $dt\mu$, $(dt\mu)_{J=0} \to\!^4{\rm He} + n + \mu + 17.6 \, {\rm MeV}$. % or $(^4{\rm He}\mu)_{nl} + n + 17.6 \,{\rm MeV}$. The $T$-matrix model well reproduced almost all of the results generated by the CC work. In the present paper, we apply this model to the nuclear reaction processes in the $dd\mu$ molecule, $(dd\mu)_{J=1} \to\!^3{\rm He} + n + \mu +3.27 \,$ MeV or $t + p + \mu + 4.03 \,$ MeV, in which the fusion takes place via the $p$-wave $d$-$d$ relative motion. Recently, significantly different $p$-wave astrophysical $S(E)$ factors of the reaction $d + d \to\!^3{\rm He} + n$ or $t + p$ at $E \! \simeq \! 1$ keV to 1 MeV have been reported experimentally and theoretically by five groups. Employing many sets of nuclear interactions that can reproduce those five cases of $p$-wave $S(E)$ factors, we calculate the fusion rate of the $(dd\mu)_{J=1}$ molecule using three kinds of methods where results are consistent with each other. We also derive the $^3{\rm He}$-$\mu$ sticking probability and the absolute values of the energy and momentum spectra of the emitted muon. The violation of charge symmetry in the $p$-wave $d$-$d$ reaction and the $dd\mu$ fusion reaction is discussed. Information on the emitted 2.45-MeV neutrons and \mbox{1 keV-dominant} muons should be useful for the application of $dd\mu$ fusion.</description>

      <title>Energy relaxation in superthermal collisions of carbon with oxygen: the influence of isotopic substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition from a once-dense Martian atmosphere to the thin one observed today implies a substantial loss of carbon, either through atmospheric escape or surface deposition. Accurately modeling this carbon escape necessitates accounting for collisions between energetic carbon atoms and the primary atmospheric constituents, including oxygen. To this end, we computed a highly accurate and comprehensive set of potential energy curves (PECs) for the C($^3$P) + O($^3$P) system. Based on these PECs, we derived statistically averaged total elastic and differential cross sections. Comparison with literature data for O($^3$P) + O($^3$P) collisions reveals that cross sections involving carbon can differ by up to a factor of two, indicating that oxygen is not a good proxy for modeling carbon escape. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of all possible isotopic combinations in C($^3$P) + O($^3$P) collisions and found variations in cross sections of up to 8\%. Given the observed isotopic enrichment of carbon and oxygen in the Martian atmosphere, even such moderate differences can have a significant effect on escape models and the interpretation of planetary evolution.</description>

      <title>Coherence of Microwave and Optical Qubit Levels in Neutral Thulium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperfine-encoded qubits in alkali atoms have established themselves as robust platforms for quantum computing, while alkaline-earth-like elements expand the state manipulation toolbox through their rich spectrum of optical transitions and metastable states. In this work, we demonstrate that thulium is a viable candidate for quantum computing, combining advantages of hyperfine qubit encoding with a rich energy-level structure of alkaline-earth-like atoms. We describe protocols for the initial state preparation and state-selective readout, and show single-qubit operations on the microwave transition at $1 497$ MHz. We demonstrate ground state hyperfine qubit coherence times up to $T_2^* = 22^{+2}_{-2}$ s and $T_2 = 55^{+59}_{-14}$ s, representing record-scale performance for neutral-atom systems. Furthermore, we show operations involving metastable optical states, including shelving for the state-selective readout as well as coherent population transfer of the ground state qubit with coherence time primarily limited by the metastable level natural lifetime of $112$ ms. These results mark the first step toward using thulium for quantum computing applications and highlight its promising characteristics.</description>

      <title>Host-dependent frequency offsets in $^{229}$Th nuclear clockwork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in laser excitation of the low-energy nuclear isomer transition in $^{229}$Th have opened avenues for developing nuclear clocks, a novel quantum technology with exceptional performance and sensitivity to exotic physics. Here we explore the host-dependence of the nuclear clock frequency, focusing on the isomer shift induced by the difference in the nuclear charge distribution between the ground and excited nuclear states. We combine relativistic many-body methods of atomic structure with periodic density functional theory to evaluate the isomer shifts in solid-state hosts. We elucidate the critical importance of the ``relaxation'' effect in evaluating the isomer shifts. Our analysis predicts nuclear clock frequencies for various solid-state and trapped ion platforms: $ \omega_\text{clk}(\text{solid state}) = 2,020,407,384(40) \, \text{MHz}$, $\omega_\text{clk}(^{229}\text{Th}^{4+}) = 2,020,407,648(70) \, \text{MHz}$, and $ \omega_\text{clk}(^{229}\text{Th}^{3+}) = 2,020,407,114(70) \, \text{MHz}$. We also determine the nuclear transition energy for the bare $^{229}$Th nucleus to be $\omega_\text{nuc} = 8.272(22) \,\text{eV}$. Our calculated valence-band isomer shifts for different host materials constrain the nuclear transition frequencies to an 80 MHz-wide frequency window, aiding experimental searches for the $^{229}$Th nuclear transition in novel materials.</description>

Abstract: We present a scheme to synthesize a three-dimensional laser field that produces a chiral electron momentum distribution upon strong-field ionization of atoms. Our approach employs two orthogonally propagating two-color laser beams. This results in a time-dependent three-dimensional electric field vector of the combined light field which varies for different positions within the focal volume. For each position, we conduct a simulation of the corresponding electron momentum distribution that includes non-adiabatic dynamics and Coulomb interaction after tunneling. For suitable laser parameters, only a small region of the focal volume contributes to the final momentum distribution. Thus, integrating over all position coordinates, a specific chiral laser field dominates. This leads to a volume-averaged electron momentum distribution, which is chiral, as well. This work will serve as a benchmark for future strong-field experiments aiming at the synthetization of well-defined, three-dimensional laser fields.</description>

      <title>Observing the dynamics of octupolar structural transitions in trapped-ion clusters</title>

Abstract: Interacting many-particle systems can self-organize into a rich variety of crystalline structures. While symmetry provides a powerful framework for predicting whether transitions between crystal states are continuous or discontinuous, collective lattice dynamics offer complementary insights into the microscopic mechanisms that drive these transitions. Trapped laser-cooled ions present a pristine and highly controllable few-body system for studying this interplay of symmetry and dynamics. Here, we use real-time fluorescence imaging while deforming the trap potential to observe a variety of structural transitions in three-dimensional (3D), unit-cell-like ion clusters. We identify a set of transitions signaled by parity-odd octupole order parameters, and probe their distinct dynamical signatures. Our observations reveal the softening of a collective Higgs-like mode indicating spontaneous symmetry-breaking, hysteresis resulting from a catastrophe where a metastable state vanishes abruptly, and stochastic switching between metastable states of differing symmetries. We also uncover a remarkable coincidence of symmetry-breaking and discontinuous transitions, analogous to a thermodynamic triple point. Our results establish 3D trapped-ion clusters as a versatile platform to engineer complex potential energy landscapes, opening new avenues for studies of reaction kinetics, geometric frustration, and related phenomena in mesoscopic platforms.</description>

      <title>$^{88}$Sr Reference Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10487</link>

Abstract: Strontium-88 is a versatile atomic species often used in quantum optics, precision metrology, and quantum computing. Consolidated atomic data is essential for the planning, execution, and evaluation of experiments. In this reference, we present physical and optical properties of neutral $^{88}$Sr relevant to these applications. Here we focus on experimental results and supplement these with theoretical values. We present equations to convert values and derive important parameters. Tabulated results include key parameters for commonly used transitions in $^{88}$Sr ($^1\mathrm{S}_0 \rightarrow \, ^1\mathrm{P}_1$, $^1\mathrm{S}_0 \rightarrow \, ^3\mathrm{P}_{0,1,2}$, and $^3\mathrm{P}_{0,1,2} \rightarrow \, ^3\mathrm{S}_1$). This dataset serves as an up-to-date reference for studies involving bosonic $^{88}$Sr.</description>

      <title>Quantum synchronization at the critical point of Floquet driven Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The criticality enhanced correlations and susceptibility allow weak periodic driving to induce collective synchronization due to critical slowing down, providing a unique platform to study non-equilibrium order emergence. This establishes a powerful paradigm for investigating non-equilibrium order formation, yet the fundamental mechanisms of critical-point synchronization remain poorly understood. Here, we utilize a microwave pulse as a seed to induce quantum synchronization at the critical point of Floquet driven Rydberg atoms. In the experiment, the microwave periodic driving on Rydberg states acts as a seeded temporal order in subspace, which triggers synchronization across the entire ensemble. The behavior of the emergent synchronized oscillation is elaborately linked to alterations in the seed, such as the relative phase shift and the frequency difference, which result in phase-dependent seeding and embryonic synchronization. This result opens up new possibilities for studying and harnessing time-dependent quantum many-body phenomena, offering insight into the behavior of complex many-body systems under seeding.</description>
