      <title>Electrostatics of Salt-Dependent Reentrant Phase Behaviors Highlights Diverse Roles of ATP in Biomolecular Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) involving intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) is a major physical mechanism for biological membraneless compartmentalization. The multifaceted electrostatic effects in these biomolecular condensates are exemplified here by experimental and theoretical investigations of the different salt- and ATP-dependent LLPSs of an IDR of messenger RNA-regulating protein Caprin1 and its phosphorylated variant pY-Caprin1, exhibiting, e.g., reentrant behaviors in some instances but not others. Experimental data are rationalized by physical modeling using analytical theory, molecular dynamics, and polymer field-theoretic simulations, indicating in general that interchain salt bridges enhance LLPS of polyelectrolytes such as Caprin1 and that the high valency of ATP-magnesium is a significant factor for its colocalization with the condensed phases, as similar trends are observed for several other IDRs. Our findings underscore the role of biomolecular condensates in modulating ion concentrations and its functional ramifications.</description>

      <title>SurfPro: Functional Protein Design Based on Continuous Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How can we design proteins with desired functions? We are motivated by a chemical intuition that both geometric structure and biochemical properties are critical to a protein's function. In this paper, we propose SurfPro, a new method to generate functional proteins given a desired surface and its associated biochemical properties. SurfPro comprises a hierarchical encoder that progressively models the geometric shape and biochemical features of a protein surface, and an autoregressive decoder to produce an amino acid sequence. We evaluate SurfPro on a standard inverse folding benchmark CATH 4.2 and two functional protein design tasks: protein binder design and enzyme design. Our SurfPro consistently surpasses previous state-of-the-art inverse folding methods, achieving a recovery rate of 57.78% on CATH 4.2 and higher success rates in terms of protein-protein binding and enzyme-substrate interaction scores.</description>
