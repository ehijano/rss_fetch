      <title>Mean-field analysis for cognitively-grounded opinion dynamics with confirmation bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how individuals' beliefs and attitudes evolve within a population is crucial for explaining social phenomena such as polarization and consensus formation. We explore a persuasive arguments model incorporating confirmation bias, where individuals preferentially accept information aligning with their existing beliefs. By employing a mean-field approach, widely used in statistical physics, we simplify complex processes of argument exchange within the population. Our analysis proceeds by projecting the model onto continuous opinion dynamics and further reducing it through mean-field reasoning. The findings highlight the robustness of mean-field predictions and their compatibility with agent-based simulations, capturing the transition from consensus to polarization induced by confirmation bias.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Network Science for Urban Resilience: The CASA Model's Approach to Social and Environmental Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resilience in social systems is crucial for mitigating the impacts of crises, such as climate change, which poses an existential threat to communities globally. As disasters become more frequent and severe, enhancing community resilience has become imperative. This study introduces a cutting-edge framework, quantitative network-based modeling called Complex Analysis for Socio-environmental Adaptation (CASA) to evaluate and strengthen social resilience. CASA transforms resilience models' linear and static structure into a complex network that integrates complexity and systems thinking, utilizing global scientific knowledge and complex network methodologies. The resulting resilience framework features rich interdependencies, and subsequent dimensionality reduction produces robust resilience indicators. This innovative application of network sciences is then demonstrated by quantitatively assessing what are known as "Sacrifice Zones," socio-environmentally sensitive areas. Results unveil the potential of this novel application of complex network methodologies as tools for systemic diagnostics, identifying vulnerabilities, and guiding policies and practices to enhance climate resilience and adaptation. The CASA framework represents a pioneering tool for assessing territorial resilience, leveraging network science applications, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence. CASA serves as a systemic diagnostic tool for urban resilience and a guide for policymakers, urban planners, and other professionals to promote sustainable, healthy cities in an era of climate change.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of energy-consuming random walkers: Variability in energy helps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy considerations can significantly affect the behavior of a population of energy-consuming agents with limited energy budgets, for instance, in the movement process of people in a city. We consider a population of interacting agents with an initial energy budget walking on a graph according to an exploration and return (to home) strategy that is based on the current energy of the person. Each move reduces the available energy depending on the flow of movements and the strength of interactions, and the movement ends when an agent returns home with a negative energy. We observe that a uniform distribution of initial energy budgets results in a larger number of visited sites per consumed energy (efficiency) compared to case that all agents have the same initial energy if return to home is relevant from the beginning of the process. The uniform energy distribution also reduces the amount of uncertainties in the total travel times (entropy production) which is more pronounced when the strength of interactions and exploration play the relevant role in the movement process. That is variability in the energies can help to increase the efficiency and reduce the entropy production specially in presence of strong interactions.</description>

      <title>When Randomness Beats Redundancy: Insights into the Diffusion of Complex Contagions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How does social network structure amplify or stifle behavior diffusion? Existing theory suggests that when social reinforcement makes the adoption of behavior more likely, it should spread more -- both farther and faster -- on clustered networks with redundant ties. Conversely, if adoption does not benefit from social reinforcement, then it should spread more on random networks without such redundancies. We develop a novel model of behavior diffusion with tunable probabilistic adoption and social reinforcement parameters to systematically evaluate the conditions under which clustered networks better spread a behavior compared to random networks. Using both simulations and analytical techniques we find precise boundaries in the parameter space where either network type outperforms the other or performs equally. We find that in most cases, random networks spread a behavior equally as far or farther compared to clustered networks despite strong social reinforcement. While there are regions in which clustered networks better diffuse contagions with social reinforcement, this only holds when the diffusion process approaches that of a deterministic threshold model and does not hold for all socially reinforced behaviors more generally. At best, clustered networks only outperform random networks by at least a five percent margin in 18\% of the parameter space, and when social reinforcement is large relative to the baseline probability of adoption.</description>

      <title>Revisiting institutional punishment in the $N$-person prisoner's dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conflict between individual and collective interests makes fostering cooperation in human societies a challenging task, requiring drastic measures such as the establishment of sanctioning institutions. These institutions are costly because they have to be maintained regardless of the presence or absence of offenders. Here we revisit some improvements to the standard $N$-person prisoner's dilemma formulation with institutional punishment in a well-mixed population, namely the elimination of overpunishment, the requirement of a minimum number of contributors to establish the sanctioning institution, and the sharing of its maintenance costs once this minimum number is reached. In addition, we focus on large groups or communities for which sanctioning institutions are ubiquitous. Using the replicator equation framework for an infinite population, we find that by sufficiently fining players who fail to contribute either to the public good or to the sanctioning institution, a population of contributors immune to invasion by these free riders can be established, provided that the contributors are sufficiently numerous. In a finite population, we use finite-size scaling to show that, for some parameter settings, demographic noise helps to fixate the strategy that contributes to the public good but not to the sanctioning institution even for infinitely large populations when, somewhat counterintuitively, its proportion in the initial population vanishes with a small power of the population size.</description>

      <title>Social dilemmas, network reciprocity and the small-world property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit two evolutionary game theory models, namely the Prisoner and the Snowdrift dilemmas, on top of small-world networks. These dynamics on networked populations (individuals occupying nodes of a graph) are mainly concerning on the competition between to cooperate or to defect, by allowing some process of revision of strategies. Cooperators avoid defectors by forming clusters in a process known as network reciprocity. This defense strategy is based on the fact that any individual interact only with its nearest neighbors. The minimum cluster, in turn, is formed by a set of three completely connected nodes and the bulk of these triplets is associated with the transitivity property of a network. Particularly, we show that the transitivity increases eventually assuming a constant behavior when observed as a function of the number of contacts of an individual. We investigate the influence of the network reciprocity on that transitivity increasing regime on the promotion of a cooperative behavior. The dynamics on small-world networks are compared with those random regular, and annealed networks, the later typically studied as the well-mixed approach. We observe that the Snowdrift Game converge to an annealed scenario as randonness and coordination number increase, whereas the Prisoner's Dilemma becomes more severe against the cooperative behavior under the regime of an increasing network reciprocity.</description>

      <title>Is methane the 'climate culprit'? Fixing the 'Broken Record' while unmasking the dangers of using imprecise, long-term GWP for methane to address the climate emergency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) with a short atmospheric half-life (~8.4 years) and a high short-term impact on global warming which is significantly higher than that of CO2. Traditional metrics such as the 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100) obscure the short-term, negative climatic effects of methane, potentially leading to inadequate policy responses. This study examines the limitations of GWP100 in capturing the true climate impact of methane, explores alternative metrics, and discusses the implications of under-reporting methane emissions. We highlight the necessity of adopting a more immediate perspective on methane to accelerate climate emergency action, while noting the adverse effects of the rapid growth rate of methane emissions on reduction efforts. Additionally, we hope that during COP29, policymakers will adopt actions that pay appropriate attention to the short-term warming potential of methane to dramatically reduce emissions and address the immediate climate crisis.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations in the Kuramoto model with external forcing and higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is an important phenomenon in a wide variety of systems comprising interacting oscillatory units, whether natural (like neurons, biochemical reactions, cardiac cells) or artificial (like metronomes, power grids, Josephson junctions). The Kuramoto model provides a simple description of these systems and has been useful in their mathematical exploration. Here we investigate this model combining two common features that have been observed in many systems: external periodic forcing and higher-order interactions among the elements. We show that the combination of these ingredients leads to a very rich bifurcation scenario that produces 11 different asymptotic states of the system, with competition between forced and spontaneous synchronization. We found, in particular, that saddle-node, Hopf and homoclinic manifolds are duplicated in regions of parameter space where the unforced system displays bi-stability.</description>
