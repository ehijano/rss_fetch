      <title>An interpretable formula for lattice thermal conductivity of crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity (kL) is a crucial physical property of crystals with applications in thermal management, such as heat dissipation, insulation, and thermoelectric energy conversion. However, accurately and rapidly determining kL poses a considerable challenge. In this study, we introduce an formula that achieves high precision (mean relative error=8.97%) and provides fast predictions, taking less than one minute, for kL across a wide range of inorganic binary and ternary materials. Our interpretable, dimensionally aligned and physical grounded formula forecasts kL values for 4,601 binary and 6,995 ternary materials in the Materials Project database. Notably, we predict undiscovered high kL values for AlBN2 (kL=101 W/ m/ K) and the undetectedlow kL Cs2Se (kL=0.98 W/ m/ K) at room temperature. This method for determining kL streamlines the traditionally time-consuming process associated with complex phonon physics. It provides insights into microscopic heat transport and facilitates the design and screening of materials with targeted and extreme kL values through the application of phonon engineering. Our findings offer opportunities for controlling and optimizing macroscopic transport properties of materials by engineering their bulk modulus, shear modulus, and Gruneisen parameter.</description>

      <title>Lattice thermal conductivity and phonon properties of polycrystalline graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using spectral energy density method, we predict the phonon scattering mean lifetimes of polycrystalline graphene (PC-G) having polycrystallinity only along $\rm{x}$-axis with seven different misorientation (tilt) angles at room temperature. Contrary to other studies on PC-G samples, our results indicate strong dependence of the thermal conductivity (TC) on the tilt angles. We also show that the square of the group velocity components along $\rm{x}$ and $\rm{y}$ axes and the phonon lifetimes are uncorrelated and the phonon density of states are almost the same for all samples with different tilt angles. Further, a distribution of the group velocity component along $\rm{x}$ or $\rm{y}$ axis as function of normal frequency is found to be exponentially decaying whereas that of phonon lifetime showed piecewise constant function behavior with respect to frequency. We provide parameters for these distribution functions and suggest another measure of the TC based on these distributions. Finally, we perform a size-dependent analysis for two tilt angles, $21.78^\circ$ and $32.20^\circ$, and find that bulk TC components decrease by around 34% to 62% in comparison to the bulk TC values of the pristine graphene. Our analysis reveals intriguing insights into the interplay between grain orientation, phonon scattering and thermal conductivity in graphene.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Tuning of the Anomalous Hall Effect in Altermagnetic MnTe Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) sensitive to the magnetic state of antiferromagnets can trigger a new era of spintronics, if materials that host a tunable and strong AHE are identified. Altermagnets are a new class of materials that can under certain conditions manifest a strong AHE, without having a net magnetization. But the ability to control their AHE is still lacking. In this study, we demonstrate that the AHE in altermagnetic {\alpha}-MnTe grown on GaAs(111) substrates can be "written on-demand" by cooling the material under an in-plane magnetic field. The magnetic field controls the strength and the coercivity of the AHE. Remarkably, this control is unique to {\alpha}-MnTe grown on GaAs and is absent in {\alpha}-MnTe grown on SrF2. The tunability that we reveal challenges our current understanding of the symmetry-allowed AHE in this material and opens new possibilities for the design of altermagnetic spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Search and Prediction of Layered 4f-Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of multifunctional devices calls for the discovery of new layered materials with novel electronic properties. f-electron systems naturally host a rich set of competing and intertwining phases owning to the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling, electron-electron interactions, and hybridization between itinerant and local electrons. However, very little attention has been devoted to exploring the f-electron family of compounds for new promising layered material candidates. Here, we identify 295 rare earth compounds from across the lanthanide series of elements that exhibit a spectrum of lattice symmetries and electronic properties. In particular, we find metallic compounds and insulating systems with band gaps covering a 0.1 eV to 5.3 eV range which opens new possibilities in infrared quantum sensors, designer photocatalysts, and tunable transistors. The inclusion of 4f-states in a layered system also suggests the possibility of 2D confined heavy-fermion superconductivity and topological semimetals. Our study serves as a springboard to further systematic theoretical investigation of correlation-driven properties of the 4f and other 2D materials composed of heavy elements.</description>

      <title>Theoretical spin transport analysis for a spin pseudovalve-type $\mathrm{L}_j$/semiconductor/$\mathrm{L}_j$ trilayer (with $\mathrm{L}_j$ = ferromagnetic)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a theoretical study of spin transport in a pseudovalve spin (PSV) heterostructure is conducted. For the semiconductor (SC), the conduction band at the $\Gamma$ point of reciprocal space and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are considered. For the ferromagnetic (FM) electrodes on the left ($l$) and right ($r$), the internal exchange energy ($\Delta_j$, where $j = \left(l,r\right)$) and the magnetization normal vector ($\mathbf{n}_j$) on the barrier plane are taken into account. An analytical expression for the transmission probability as a function of $\mathbf{n}_j$ direction was obtained from the {\em Schr\"odinger-Pauli} equations with the boundary conditions. Furthermore, the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) at T $\approx$ 0 K was calculated, depending on the direction of the crystallographic axis favoring the magnetization ($\theta_m$) of the FM and the thickness of the SC, using the {\em Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker} formula for a single channel. It is observed that the TMR reaches its maximum value when the $\mathbf{n}_l$ direction is parallel to $\theta_m$. Applying this physico-mathematical model to the Fe/SC/Fe PSV, with SC as GaAs, GaSb, and InAs, it was found that the {\em Dresselhaus} SOC does not significantly contribute to the TMR.</description>

      <title>Predicting electrical conductivity in bi-metal composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating high magnetic fields requires materials with not only high electric conductivity, but also good strength properties in order to withstand the necessarily strong Lorentz forces. A number of bi-metal composites, most notably Cu/Nb, are considered to be good candidates for this purpose. Here, we generalize our previous work on Cu/Nb in order to predict, from theory, the dependence of electric conductivity on the microstructure and volume fraction of the less conductive component for a number of other bi-metal composites. Together with information on strength properties (taken from previous literature), the conductivity information we provide in this work can help to identify new promising candidate materials for magnet applications with the highest achievable field strengths.</description>

      <title>High-quality hexagonal boron nitride selectively grown on patterned epigraphene by MOVPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride encapsulation is the method of choice for protecting graphene from environmental doping and impurity scattering. It was previously demonstrated that metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) grows epitaxially ordered, uniform BN layers on epigraphene (graphene grown on SiC). Due to graphene non-wetting properties, h-BN growth starts preferentially from the graphene ledges. We use this fact here to selectively promote growth of high-quality flat h-BN on epigraphene by patterning epigraphene microstructures prior to BN growth. Thin h-BN films (down to 6 nm) grown by MOVPE show smooth and pleated surface morphology on epigraphene, while crumpled BN is observed on the SiC. Cross-sectional high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images and fluorescence imaging confirm the higher BN quality grown on the epigraphene. Transport measurements reveal p-doping as expected from hydrogen intercalation of epigraphene and regions of high and low mobility. This method can be used to produce structurally uniform high-quality h-BN/epigraphene micro/nano scale heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Chiral damping of magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral magnets have garnered significant interest due to the emergence of unique phenomena prohibited in inversion-symmetric magnets. While the equilibrium characteristics of chiral magnets have been extensively explored through the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), non-equilibrium properties like magnetic damping have received comparatively less attention. We present the inaugural direct observation of chiral damping through Brillouin light scattering (BLS) spectroscopy. Employing BLS spectrum analysis, we independently deduce the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and chiral damping, extracting them from the frequency shift and linewidth of the spectrum peak, respectively. The resulting linewidths exhibit clear odd symmetry with respect to the magnon wave vector, unambiguously confirming the presence of chiral damping. Our study introduces a novel methodology for quantifying chiral damping, with potential ramifications on diverse nonequilibrium phenomena within chiral magnets.</description>

      <title>Powder Diffraction Crystal Structure Determination Using Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate crystal structure determination is critical across all scientific disciplines involving crystalline materials. However, solving and refining inorganic crystal structures from powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data is traditionally a labor-intensive and time-consuming process that demands substantial expertise. In this work, we introduce PXRDGen, an end-to-end neural network that determines crystal structures by learning joint structural distributions from experimentally stable crystals and their PXRD, producing atomically accurate structures refined through PXRD data. PXRDGen integrates a pretrained XRD encoder, a diffusion/flow-based structure generator, and a Rietveld refinement module, enabling the solution of structures with unparalleled accuracy in a matter of seconds. Evaluation on MP-20 inorganic dataset reveals a remarkable matching rate of 82% (1 sample) and 96% (20 samples) for valid compounds, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) approaching the precision limits of Rietveld refinement. PXRDGen effectively tackles key challenges in XRD, such as the precise localization of light atoms, differentiation of neighboring elements, and resolution of overlapping peaks. Overall, PXRDGen marks a significant advancement in the automated determination of crystal structures from powder diffraction data.</description>

      <title>CrysAtom: Distributed Representation of Atoms for Crystal Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Application of artificial intelligence (AI) has been ubiquitous in the growth of research in the areas of basic sciences. Frequent use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based methodologies by researchers has resulted in significant advancements in the last decade. These techniques led to notable performance enhancements in different tasks such as protein structure prediction, drug-target binding affinity prediction, and molecular property prediction. In material science literature, it is well-known that crystalline materials exhibit topological structures. Such topological structures may be represented as graphs and utilization of graph neural network (GNN) based approaches could help encoding them into an augmented representation space. Primarily, such frameworks adopt supervised learning techniques targeted towards downstream property prediction tasks on the basis of electronic properties (formation energy, bandgap, total energy, etc.) and crystalline structures. Generally, such type of frameworks rely highly on the handcrafted atom feature representations along with the structural representations. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised framework namely, CrysAtom, using untagged crystal data to generate dense vector representation of atoms, which can be utilized in existing GNN-based property predictor models to accurately predict important properties of crystals. Empirical results show that our dense representation embeds chemical properties of atoms and enhance the performance of the baseline property predictor models significantly.</description>

      <title>Ferro-Valleytricity with In-Plane Magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferro-valleytricity, a fundamental phenomenon that manifests spontaneous valley polarization, is generally considered to occur in two-dimensional (2D) materials with out-of-plane magnetization. Here, we propose a mechanism to realize ferro-valleytricity in 2D materials with in-plane magnetization, wherein the physics correlates to non-collinear magnetism in triangular lattice. Our model analysis provides comprehensive ingredients that allows for in-plane ferro-valleytricity, revealing that mirror symmetry is required for remarkable valley polarization and time-reversal-mirror joint-symmetry should be excluded. Through modulating in-plane magnetization offset, the valley polarization could be reversed. Followed by first-principles, such mechanism is demonstrated in a multiferroic triangular lattice of single-layer W3Cl8. We further show that the reversal of valley polarization could also be driven by applying electric field that modulates ferroelectricity. Our findings greatly enrich the valley physics research and significantly extend the scope for material classes of ferro-valleytricity.</description>

      <title>Highly polarized single photon emitter from intrinsic localized excitons in a WSe2/CrSBr heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single photons emitters (SPEs) are key components in quantum information applications and are commonly generated in 2D materials by inhomogeneous strain engineering. Here, we report an alternative approach that involves a 2D semiconductor/2D magnet heterostructure. The optical study of the WSe2/CrSBr heterostructures reveals several new emission lines at lower energies compared to characteristic WSe2 emissions, that are assigned to localized excitons. Further investigation demonstrates that one of these emergent lines is an SPE with a strong valley polarization response and large energy shift with the field-induced metamagnetic transition in CrSBr, linking it to the magnetic proximity effect of the adjacent CrSBr layer. In contrast to previous reports on WSe2 that only allow tuning of the SPEs by out-of-plane magnetic field, our emitter is sensitive to both in- and out-of-plane fields. Our findings demonstrate the potential of this approach for improved control and polarization of SPEs in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dichroism in darkfield UV photoemission electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) has evolved into an indispensable tool for structural and magnetic characterization of surfaces at the nanometer scale. In strong contrast to synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray PEEM as a leading method for element-specific magnetic properties via magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), laboratory ultraviolet (UV) PEEM has seen limited application with much smaller dichroism effects for in-plane magnetization. Here we introduce darkfield PEEM as a novel approach to enhance MCD contrast in threshold photoemission, enabling efficient MCD imaging with significantly enhanced contrast by an order-of-magnitude for Fe(001). This advancement paves the way for MCD imaging on femtosecond timescales using modern lasers. The experimental results will be quantitatively benchmarked against advanced relativistic photoemission calculations.</description>

      <title>FePd2Te2: An Anisotropic Two-Dimensional Ferromagnet with One-Dimensional Fe Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnets have attracted significant attentions in recent years due to their importance in the research on both fundamental physics and spintronic applications. Here, we report the discovery of a new ternary compound FePd2Te2. It features a layered quasi-2D crystal structure with one-dimensional Fe zigzag chains extending along the b-axis in the cleavage plane. Single crystals of FePd2Te2 with centimeter-size could be grown. Density functional theory calculations, mechanical exfoliation and atomic force microscopy on these crystals reveal that they are 2D materialsthat can be thinned down to 5 nm. Magnetic characterization shows that FePd2Te2 is an easy-plane ferromagnet with Tc 183 K and strong in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Magnetoresistance and anomalous Hall effect demonstrate that ferromagnetism could maintain in FePd2Te2 flakes with large coercivity. A crystal twinning effect is observed by scanning tunneling microscopy which makes the Fe chains right-angle bent in the cleavage plane and creates an intriguing spin texture. Our results show that FePd2Te2 is a correlated anisotropic 2D magnets that may attract multidisciplinary research interests.</description>

      <title>A meta-generalized gradient approximation-based time-dependent and dielectric function dependent method for optical properties of solid materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient calculation of optical response properties of solid materials is still challenging. We present a meta-generalized gradient approximation (metaGGA) density functional based time-dependent and dielectric function dependent method for calculating optical absorption, exciton binding energy and intrinsic exciton lifetime for bulk solids and two-dimensional (2D) monolayer materials. This method uses advanced metaGGA functionals to describe the band structures, and a dielectric function mBSE (model Bethe-Salpeter equation) to capture the screening effect accurately and efficiently and the interaction between electrons and holes. The calculated optical absorption spectra of bulk Si, diamond, SiC, MgO, and monolayer MoS2 qualitatively agree with experimental results. The exciton binding energies of the first prominent peak in the optical absorption spectra of the direct band gap solids Ar, NaCl and MgO from mBSE qualitatively agree with those from standard GW-BSE. For monolayer MoS2, mBSE predicts quantitatively accurate binding energy for the first prominent peak, better than GW-BSE does. The calculated intrinsic exciton lifetimes for materials considered here show magnitudes of several nanoseconds for most bright excitons. The presented mtaGGA-mBSE method is established as a computationally efficient alternative for optical properties of materials with an overall qualitative accuracy.</description>

      <title>p-(001)NiO/n-(0001)ZnO heterostructures grown by pulsed laser deposition technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NiO/ZnO heterostructures are grown on c-sapphire substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique. X-ray diffraction study shows that the ZnO layer epitaxially grows along [0001]-direction on (0001)sapphire surface as expected. While, the epitaxial NiO film is found to be deposited along [001]-direction on the (0001)ZnO surface. Moreover, the presence of three (001)NiO domains laterally rotated by 30{\deg} with respect to each other, has also been observed in our NiO films. The study reveals the continuous nature of the NiO film, which also possesses a very smooth surface morphology. In a sharp contrast, ZnO films are found to grow along [0001]-direction when deposited on (111)NiO layers. These films also show columnar morphology. (001)NiO/(0001)ZnO layers exhibit the rectifying current-voltage characteristics that suggests the existence of p-n junction in these devices. However, the behavior could not be observed in (0001)ZnO/(111)NiO heterojunctions. The reason could be the columnar morphology of the ZnO layer. Such a morphology can facilitate the propagation of the metal ions from the contact pads to the underlying NiO layer and suppress the p-n junction effect.</description>

      <title>Strain in 2D TMDCs induced by metal-assisted exfoliation from the polyvinilalcohol-covered substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have modified the metal-assisted transfer technique to obtain large-area few-layer flakes from transition metal dichalcogenides bulk crystals by introducing an initial stage - exfoliation of the bulk crystal onto an intermediate substrate, specifically a silicon wafer coated with polyvinyl alcohol. Following this, we thermally evaporate silver onto the sample and transfer the top layers of the crystal along with the silver layer to the target substrate. This technique allows the production of visually non-corrugated single- and few-layer flakes with high yield. A direct comparison of the micro-Raman and micro-photoluminescence spectra of flakes exfoliated using our method with the spectra of those exfoliated from scotch tape reveals differences in their properties. We identify signatures of deformations in the flakes exfoliated from the intermediate substrate, indicating the presence of static friction between the substrate and the flake. Our findings thus suggest a novel method to induce intrinsic deformation in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Learning polycrystal plasticity using mesh-based subgraph geometric deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycrystal plasticity in metals is characterized by nonlinear behavior and strain hardening, making numerical models computationally intensive. We employ Graph Neural Network (GNN) to surrogate polycrystal plasticity from finite element method (FEM) simulations. We present a novel message-passing GNN that encodes nodal strain and edge distances between FEM mesh cells, aggregates them to obtain embeddings, and combines the decoded embeddings with the nodal strains to predict stress tensors on graph nodes. We demonstrate training GNN based on subgraphs generated from FEM mesh-graphs, in which the mesh cells are converted to nodes and edges are created between adjacent cells. The GNN is trained on 72 graphs and tested on 18 graphs. We apply the trained GNN to periodic polycrystals and learn the stress-strain maps based on strain-gradient plasticity theory. The GNN is accurately trained based on FEM graphs, in which the $R^2$ for both training and testing sets are 0.993. The proposed GNN plasticity constitutive model speeds up more than 150 times compared with the benchmark FEM method on randomly selected test polycrystals. We also apply the trained GNN to 30 unseen FEM simulations and the GNN generalizes well with an overall $R^2$ of 0.992. Analysis of the von Mises stress distributions in polycrystals shows that the GNN model accurately learns the stress distribution with low error. By comparing the error distribution across training, testing, and unseen datasets, we can deduce that the proposed model does not overfit and generalizes well beyond the training data. This work is expected to pave the way for using graphs as surrogates in polycrystal plasticity modeling.</description>

      <title>Room temperature synthesis of gallium oxide film with a fluidic exfoliation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional metal oxides play an important role in electronics and optoelectronics, and it is still a challenge to obtain thin oxides film. Here, a fluidic exfoliation method is applied to synthesis the metal oxides film by using galinstan as the reactant, and Ga2O3 film with ~1 cm size is obtained. Optical microscope and scanning electron microscope images show that the Ga2O3 film is exfoliated from the galinstan without any droplets left. Energy Dispersive X-Ray measurements confirm the existence of the Ga2O3 film. Transmission electron microscope and selected area electron diffraction patterns indicate the oxidation process do not have a prior direction. The alloy liquid based fluidic exfoliation method in room temperature provide a promising route for the synthesis of two-dimensional mental oxides, which shows significant applications in electronic and photoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Lead-free room-temperature ferroelectric thermal conductivity switch using anisotropies in thermal conductivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with on-demand control of thermal conductivity are the prerequisites to build thermal conductivity switches, where the thermal conductivity can be turned ON and OFF. However, the ideal switch, while required to develop novel approaches to solid-state refrigeration, energy harvesting, and even phononic circuits, is still missing. It should consist of an active material only, be environment friendly, and operate near room temperature with a reversible, fast, and large switching ratio. Here, we first predict by ab initio electronic structure calculations that ferroelectric domains in barium titanate exhibit anisotropic thermal conductivities. We confirm this prediction by combining frequency-domain thermoreflectance and scanning thermal microscopy measurements on a single crystal of barium titanate. We then use this gained knowledge to propose a lead-free thermal conductivity switch without inactive material, operating reversibly with an electric field. At room temperature, we find a switching ratio of 1.6 $\pm$ 0.3, exceeding the performances of state-of-the-art materials suggested for thermal conductivity switches.</description>

      <title>Investigating Material Interface Diffusion Phenomena through Graph Neural Networks in Applied Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting interface diffusion phenomena in materials is crucial for various industrial applications, including semiconductor manufacturing, battery technology, and catalysis. In this study, we propose a novel approach utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to investigate and model material interface diffusion. We begin by collecting experimental and simulated data on diffusion coefficients, concentration gradients, and other relevant parameters from diverse material systems. The data are preprocessed, and key features influencing interface diffusion are extracted. Subsequently, we construct a GNN model tailored to the diffusion problem, with a graph representation capturing the atomic structure of materials. The model architecture includes multiple graph convolutional layers for feature aggregation and update, as well as optional graph attention layers to capture complex relationships between atoms. We train and validate the GNN model using the preprocessed data, achieving accurate predictions of diffusion coefficients, diffusion rates, concentration profiles, and potential diffusion pathways. Our approach offers insights into the underlying mechanisms of interface diffusion and provides a valuable tool for optimizing material design and engineering. Additionally, our method offers possible strategies to solve the longstanding problems related to materials interface diffusion.</description>

      <title>Effect of very slow O diffusion at high temperature on very fast H diffusion in the hydride ion conductor LaH2.75O0.125</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network potential based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the excellent H conductor LaH2.75O0.125 show that O starts diffusing above a critical temperature of Tc~550 K, according to the variance of atom positions regardless of the time step. The original diffusion process at temperatures below Tc has an activation barrier of 0.25 eV. Use of MD simulations with various O and La mass revealed, at above Tc, the coexistence of the 0.25 eV process and an additional diffusion process with an activation barrier of 0.20 eV. The O and La have strongly anharmonic characters.</description>

      <title>Integral transform technique for determining stress intensity factor in wave propagation through functionally graded piezoelectric-viscoelastic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs an integral transform approach for Love wave propagation in a rotating composite structure having an interfacial crack. The structure comprises an initially stressed functionally graded piezoelectric viscoelastic half-space bonded to a piezoelectric viscoelastic half-space. The study focuses on two material systems: Epoxy-BNKLBT paired with Epoxy-KNLNTS and Epoxy-BNKLBT paired with Epoxy-PZT7A. The viscoelastic materials are modeled to reflect their complex behavior under rotational and stress conditions. The Galilean transformation is applied to convert the Cartesian coordinates system into a moving reference frame aligned with the Love wave's propagation. Employing Bessel function properties, the system is converted into a set of double integral equations and subsequently reformulated into simultaneous Fredholm integral equations. Numerical solutions to these Fredholm integral equations are used to calculate the electric displacement intensity factor (EDIF) and stress intensity factor (SIF) near the interfacial crack. The key objective of this study is to visualize the impact of different material parameters, like piezoelectric constants, dielectric constants, initial stress, interface electric displacement, interface stress, and rotation, on SIF and EDIF. The investigations of this study will be helpful for advanced technologies like surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors and piezoelectric actuators, as well as to enhance SAW bio-sensor sensitivity and stability for early cancer detection and biomedical implants.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Planarity of an Aromatic Thianthrene-Based Molecule on Au(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-planar aromatic molecules are interesting systems for organic electronics and optoelectronics applications due to their high stability and electronic properties. By using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we investigated thianthrene-based molecules adsorbed on Au(111), which are non-planar in the gas phase and the bulk solid state. Varying the molecular coverage leads to the formation of two different kinds of self-assembled structures: close-packed islands and quasi one-dimensional chains. We found that the molecules are non-planar within the close-packed islands, while the configuration is planar in the molecular chain and for single adsorbed molecules. Using vertical tip manipulation to isolate a molecule from the island, we demonstrate the conversion of a non-planar molecule to its planar configuration. We discuss the two different geometries and their electronic properties with the support of density functional theory calculations.</description>

      <title>Probing Optoelectronic Properties of Stable Vacancy-Ordered Double Perovskites: Insights from Many-Body Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A$_{2}$BX$_{6}$ vacancy-ordered double perovskites (VODPs) have captured substantial research interest in the scientific community as they offer environmentally friendly and stable alternatives to lead halide perovskites. In this study, we investigate Rb$_{2}$BCl$_{6}$ (B = Ti, Se, Ru, Pd) VODPs as promising optoelectronic materials employing state-of-the-art first-principles-based methodologies, specifically density functional theory combined with density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and many-body perturbation theory [within the framework of GW and BSE]. Our calculations reveal that all these materials possess a cubic lattice structure and are both dynamically and mechanically stable. Interestingly, they all exhibit indirect bandgaps, except Rb$_{2}$RuCl$_{6}$ displays a metallic character. The G$_{0}$W$_{0}$ bandgap values for these compounds fall within the range of 3.63 to 5.14 eV. Additionally, the results of the BSE indicate that they exhibit exceptional absorption capabilities across the near-ultraviolet to mid-ultraviolet light region. Furthermore, studies on transport and excitonic properties suggest that they exhibit lower effective electron masses compared to holes, with exciton binding energies spanning between 0.16$-$0.98 eV. We additionally observed a prevalent hole-phonon coupling compared to electron-phonon coupling in these compounds. Overall, this study provides valuable insights to guide the design of vacancy-ordered double perovskites as promising lead-free candidates for future optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Exploring the potential of combining over- and under-stoichiometric MIEC materials for Oxygen-Ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for energy storage solutions has spurred intensive research into next-generation battery technologies. Oxygen-ion batteries (OIBs), which leverage mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) oxides, have emerged as promising candidates due to their solid, non-flammable nature and potential for high power densities. This study investigates the use of over-stoichiometric La2NiO4+delta (L2NO4) as a cathode material for OIBs, exploring its capacity for electrochemical energy storage. Half-cell measurements reveal that L2NO4 with a closed-pore microstructure can store oxygen, achieving a volumetric charge of 63 mA.h.cm-3 at 400 {\deg}C with a current density of 3.6 uA.cm-2 and potentials up to 0.75 V vs. 1 bar O2. Additionally, a functional full cell combining over-stoichiometric L2NO4 and under-stoichiometric La0.5Sr0.5Cr0.2Mn0.8O3-delta (LSCrMn) has been successfully developed, demonstrating excellent cyclability and coulomb efficiency. The full cell reaches a maximum volumetric charge of 90 mA.h.cm-3 at 400 {\deg}C, 17.8 uA.cm-2, and a cut-off voltage of 1.8 V. This proof of concept underscores the viability of combining over- and under-stoichiometric MIEC materials in OIBs and provides critical insights into optimizing electrode materials and tuning oxygen content for improved performance. This research lays the groundwork for future advancements in OIB technology, aiming to develop materials with lower resistance and higher efficiency.</description>

      <title>Structural Analysis of Amorphous GeO$_2$ under High Pressure Using Reverse Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural properties of amorphous GeO$_2$, a prototypical network glass, were investigated under ambient to high pressure using reverse Monte Carlo simulations based on reported structure factors from in situ high-pressure neutron diffraction experiments with isotopic substitution. The results indicate the retention of the topological structure containing predominantly tetrahedral GeO$_4$ units up to ca.~\SI{4}{\giga\pascal} ($\rho/\rho_0 = 1.15$), which is explained by the reduction of cavity volumes. With further application of pressure, an increase in the number of GeO$_5$ units is first observed, which is then followed more gradually by an increase in the number of GeO$_6$ units.</description>

      <title>Unusual Phonon Thermal Transport Mechanisms in Monolayer Beryllene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the thermal conductivity of monolayer beryllene using the linearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation with interatomic force constants obtained from \textit{ab-initio} calculations. Monolayer beryllene exhibits an impressive thermal conductivity of 270 W/m$\cdot$K at room temperature, exceeding that of bulk beryllium by over 100%. Our study reveals a remarkable temperature-dependent behavior: $\kappa \sim T^{-2}$ at low temperatures, attributed to higher normal phonon-phonon scatterings, and $\kappa \sim T^{-1}$ at high temperatures, due to Umklapp phonon interactions. Mode-specific analysis reveals that flexural phonons with longer lifetimes are the primary contributors to thermal conductivity, accounting for approximately 80%. This dominance results from their lower scattering rates in the out-of-plane direction due to a restricted phase space for scattering processes. Additionally, our findings highlight suppressed Umklapp scattering and reduced phase space for flexural modes, providing a thorough understanding of the eased thermal conductivity in monolayer beryllene and its potential for advanced thermal management applications.</description>

      <title>Effects of Interfacial Oxygen Diffusion on the Magnetic Properties and Thermal Stability of Pd/CoFeB/Pd/Ta Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the effects of annealing temperatures (TA) on a Pd (5 nm)/CoFeB (10 nm)/Pd (3 nm)/Ta (10 nm) multilayer structure. The as-deposited sample showed an amorphous state with in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA), resulting in low coercivity and moderate damping constant ({\alpha}) values. Increasing TA led to crystallization, forming bcc-CoFe (110) crystals, which increased in-plane coercivity and introduced isotropic magnetic anisotropy, slightly reducing the {\alpha}. The two-fold UMA persists up to 600 C, and the thermal stability of the in-plane magnetic anisotropy remains intact even TA = 700 C. The TA significantly influenced the magnetic properties such as in-plane saturation magnetization (Ms//), in-plane and out-of-plane coercivities, and in-plane effective magnetic anisotropy energy density (Keff). Above 600 C, Keff decreased, indicating a transition towards uniaxial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Interfacial oxidation and diffusion from the Ta capping layer to the Pd/CoFeB/Pd interfaces were observed, influencing chemical bonding states. Annealing at 700 C, reduced oxygen within TaOx through a redox reaction involving Ta crystallization, forming TaB, PdO, and BOx states. Ferromagnetic resonance spectra analysis indicated variations in resonance field (Hr) due to local chemical environments. The {\alpha} reduction, reaching a minimum at 300 C annealing, was attributed to reduced structural disorder from inhomogeneities. Tailoring magnetic anisotropy and spin dynamic properties in Pd/CoFeB/Pd/Ta structures through TA-controlled oxygen diffusion/oxidation highlights their potential for SOT, DMI, and magnetic skyrmion-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the potential use of multi-block chemometric methods to provide improved unsupervised classification of compositionally complex materials through the integration of multi-modal spectrometric data sets (one XRF, two NIR, and two FT-Raman) was tested. We concluded that multi-block HPLS models are effective at combining multi-modal spectrometric data to provide a more comprehensive classification of compositionally complex samples, and VIP can reduce HPLS model complexity, while increasing its data interpretability.</description>

      <title>The Current and Future Perspectives of Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles in the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review explores the synthesis, characterization, and therapeutic applications of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The study delves into both chemical and green synthesis methods, comparing their impacts on nanoparticle properties. Key characterization techniques such as XRD, FTIR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and SEM confirm the crystalline structure, optical properties, and morphology of the nanoparticles. ZnO NPs demonstrate significant biological activities, including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic effects. These nanoparticles show promise in improving glucose regulation, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and boosting glucose uptake in cells. Despite these benefits, the potential toxicity and long-term effects of ZnO NPs warrant further investigation. Future research should focus on optimizing synthesis methods and conducting comprehensive studies to fully exploit ZnO NPs' potential in diabetes management and other biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Cavity Control of Topological Qubits: Fusion Rule, Anyon Braiding and Majorana-Schr\"odinger Cat States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of introducing a local cavity within the center of a topological chain, revealing profound effects on the system's quantum states. Notably, the cavity induces a scissor-like effect that bisects the chain, liberating Majorana zero modes (MZMs) within the bulk. Our results demonstrate that this setup enables the observation of non-trivial fusion rules and braiding -- key signatures of non-Abelian anyons -- facilitated by the spatially selective ultra-strong coupling of the cavity photon field. These MZM characteristics can be directly probed through fermionic parity readouts and photon Berry phases, respectively. Furthermore, by leveraging the symmetry properties of fermion modes within a two-site cavity, we propose a novel method for generating MZM-polariton Schr\"odinger cat states. Our findings present a significant advancement in the control of topological quantum systems, offering new avenues for both fundamental research and potential quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Nonlinear Transport in a Floquet-Weyl Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic laser driving, known as Floquet engineering, is a powerful tool to manipulate the properties of quantum materials. Using circularly polarized light, artificial magnetic fields, called Berry curvature, can be created in the photon-dressed Floquet-Bloch states that form. This mechanism, when applied to 3D Dirac and Weyl systems, is predicted to lead to photon-dressed movement of Weyl nodes which should be detectable in the transport sector. The transport response of such a topological light-matter hybrid, however, remains experimentally unknown. Here, we report on the transport properties of the type-II Weyl semimetal T$\mathrm{_d}$-MoTe$_\mathrm{2}$ illuminated by a femtosecond pulse of circularly polarized light. Using an ultrafast optoelectronic device architecture, we observed injection currents and a helicity-dependent anomalous Hall effect whose scaling with laser field strongly deviate from the perturbative laws of nonlinear optics. We show using Floquet theory that this discovery corresponds to the formation of a magnetic Floquet-Weyl semimetal state. Numerical ab initio simulations support this interpretation, indicating that the light-induced motion of the Weyl nodes contributes substantially to the measured transport signals. This work demonstrates the ability to generate large effective magnetic fields ($&gt;$ 30T) with light, which can be used to manipulate the magnetic and topological properties of a range of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Superconductivity in Twisted MoTe2 Nanojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introducing superconductivity in topological materials can lead to innovative electronic phases and device functionalities. Here, we present a new strategy for quantum engineering of superconducting junctions in moire materials through direct, on-chip, and fully encapsulated 2D crystal growth. We achieve robust and designable superconductivity in Pd-metalized twisted bilayer molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) and observe anomalous superconducting effects in high-quality junctions across ~ 20 moire cells. Surprisingly, the junction develops enhanced, instead of weakened, superconducting behaviors, exhibiting fluctuations to a higher critical magnetic field compared to its adjacent Pd7MoTe2 superconductor. Additionally, the critical current further exhibits a striking V-shaped minimum at zero magnetic field. These features are unexpected in conventional Josephson junctions and indeed absent in junctions of natural bilayer MoTe2 created using the same approach. We discuss implications of these observations, including the possible formation of mixed even- and odd-parity superconductivity at the moire junctions. Our results also demonstrate a pathway to engineer and investigate superconductivity in fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Colloidoscope: Detecting Dense Colloids in 3d with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloidoscope is a deep learning pipeline employing a 3D residual Unet architecture, designed to enhance the tracking of dense colloidal suspensions through confocal microscopy. This methodology uses a simulated training dataset that reflects a wide array of real-world imaging conditions, specifically targeting high colloid volume fraction and low-contrast scenarios where traditional detection methods struggle. Central to our approach is the use of experimental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and point-spread-functions (PSFs) to accurately quantify and simulate the experimental data. Our findings reveal that Colloidoscope achieves superior recall in particle detection (finds more particles) compared to conventional heuristic methods. Simultaneously, high precision is maintained (high fraction of true positives.) The model demonstrates a notable robustness to photobleached samples, thereby prolonging the imaging time and number of frames than may be acquired. Furthermore, Colloidoscope maintains small scale resolution sufficient to classify local structural motifs. Evaluated across both simulated and experimental datasets, Colloidoscope brings the advancements in computer vision offered by deep learning to particle tracking at high volume fractions. We offer a promising tool for researchers in the soft matter community, this model is deployed and available to use pretrained: https://github.com/wahabk/colloidoscope.</description>

Abstract: We present a geometric design rule for size-controlled clustering of self-propelled particles. Active particles that tend to rotate under an external force have an intrinsic signed-parameter with units of curvature, which we term curvity, derivable from first principles. Robot experiments and numerical simulations show that the properties of the individual robot alone -- radius and curvity -- control pair-cohesion in a binary system as well as the stability of flocking and clustering in a swarm. Our results have applications in meta-materials and embodied decentralized control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrical characteristics of a carbon nanotube can be significantly modified by applying elastic strain. This study focuses on exploring this phenomenon in a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) using tight-binding transport calculations. The results indicate that, under specific strains, an armchair SWNT can act as a filter, separating the two valley electrons K and Kp. Notably, when subjected to deformation, the SWNT exhibits intriguing behaviors, including a quantized conductance profile that varies with the strength of the strain. Consequently, precise control of the width of the quantized plateaus allows for the generation of a polarized valley current. Furthermore, when both K-types are conducted, the strain is demonstrated to completely separate them, directing each K-type through a distinct pathway.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motile liquid crystal (LC) colloids show peculiar behavior due to the high sensitivity to external stimuli driven by the LC elastic and surface effects. However, few studies focus on harnessing the LC phase transitions to propel colloidal inclusions by the nematic-isotropic (NI) interface. We engineer a quasi-2D active system consisting of solid micron-sized light-absorbent platelets immersed in a thermotropic nematic LC. The platelets self-propel in the presence of light while self-inducing a localized NI phase transition. The sample's temperature, light intensity, and confinement determine three different regimes: a 2D large regime where the platelet-isotropic phase bubble is static and the NI interface remains stable; a compact motile-2D regime where the NI interface lies closer to the platelet's contour; and a motile-3D-confinement regime characterized by the emergence of multipolar configurations of the LC. We perform continuum-theory simulations that predict stationary platelet-LC states when confined in 3D. Our study in an intrinsically far-from-equilibrium landscape is crucial for designing simple synthetic systems that contribute to our understanding of harnessing liquid crystals' phase transitions to propel colloidal inclusions and trigger tunable topological reconfigurations leading to photonic responses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals monolayers featuring magnetic states provide a fundamental building block for artificial quantum matter. Here, we establish the emergence of a multicomponent ground state featuring magneto-orbital excitations of the 3d2-transition metal trihalide VCl3 monolayer. We show that monolayer VCl3 realizes a ground state with simultaneous magnetic and orbital ordering using density functional theory. Using first-principles methods we derive an effective Hamiltonian with intertwined spin and orbital degree of freedom, which we demonstrate can be tuned by strain. We show that magneto-orbitons appear as the collective modes of this complex order, and arise from coupled orbiton magnon excitations due to the magneto-orbital coupling in the system. Our results establish VCl3 as a promising 2D material to observe emergent magneto-orbital excitations and provide a platform for multicomponent symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Enforced Neural Network to Predict Polymer Melt Viscosity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving superior polymeric components through additive manufacturing (AM) relies on precise control of rheology. One key rheological property particularly relevant to AM is melt viscosity ($\eta$). Melt viscosity is influenced by polymer chemistry, molecular weight ($M_w$), polydispersity, induced shear rate ($\dot\gamma$), and processing temperature ($T$). The relationship of $\eta$ with $M_w$, $\dot\gamma$, and $T$ may be captured by parameterized equations. Several physical experiments are required to fit the parameters, so predicting $\eta$ of a new polymer material in unexplored physical domains is a laborious process. Here, we develop a Physics-Enforced Neural Network (PENN) model that predicts the empirical parameters and encodes the parametrized equations to calculate $\eta$ as a function of polymer chemistry, $M_w$, polydispersity, $\dot\gamma$, and $T$. We benchmark our PENN against physics-unaware Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models. Finally, we demonstrate that the PENN offers superior values of $\eta$ when extrapolating to unseen values of $M_w$, $\dot\gamma$, and $T$ for sparsely seen polymers.</description>

      <title>Preventing overfitting in infrared ellipsometry using temperature dependence: fused silica as a case study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05323v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersive linear optical properties of materials are frequently described using oscillator models, where the oscillators represent interactions between light and various material resonances (vibrational, free-carrier, interband, etc.). The state-of-the-art measurement of the complex refractive index is variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), where additional measurement angles and the measured depolarization of light provides much more information compared to simpler measurements such as single-angle reflectance and transmittance. Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art VASE data can be hard to uniquely fit using oscillator models, and the resulting models may be hard to interpret physically. Here, we demonstrate the use of an additional degree of freedom, temperature, to improve the accuracy, uniqueness, and physicality of oscillator models of materials. Our approach relies on the well-understood temperature dependence of material resonances, and in particular vibrational resonances in amorphous SiO2, which are expected to change monotonically from room temperature to hundreds of degrees C. We performed VASE measurements at different temperatures, independently fitted the data at each temperature, and then confirmed that our models are unique and physical by monitoring the temperature dependence of the resulting fitting parameters. Using this technique, we generated highly accurate and precise data sets and material models describing the mid-infrared complex refractive index of three different grades of fused SiO2, which can then be used for modeling of mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.</description>

      <title>Origin of nonlinear photocurrents in chiral multifold semimetal CoSi unveiled by terahertz emission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic identification of distinct nonlinear photocurrents unveils quantum geometric properties of electron wavefunctions and the momentum-space topological structures. This is especially interesting, but still puzzling, for chiral topological semimetals with possibilities of hosting giant quantized circular photogalvanic effect. Here we report a comprehensive terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopic analysis of nonlinear photoconductivity of chiral multifold CoSi at 0.26 ~ 1 eV. We find a large linear shift conductivity (17 {\mu}A/V2), and confirm a giant injection conductivity (167 {\mu}A/V2) as a consequence of strongly interfered non-quantized contributions from the vicinity of multifold nodes with opposite chiralities. The bulk injection current excited by the pump field with a complex wavevector is shown to carry both longitudinal and transverse components. Symmetry analyses further unveil weak nonlocal photon drag effect in addition to the photogalvanic effect. This work not only highlights chiral transition metal monosilicides for mid-infrared photovoltaic applications via various nonlinear optical channels, but also consolidates the THz spectroscopy for quantitative photovoltaic research.</description>

      <title>SciAgents: Automating scientific discovery through multi-agent intelligent graph reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in artificial intelligence is the creation of systems capable of autonomously advancing scientific understanding by exploring novel domains, identifying complex patterns, and uncovering previously unseen connections in vast scientific data. In this work, we present SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts: (1) the use of large-scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi-agent systems with in-situ learning capabilities. Applied to biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses traditional human-driven research methods. The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties. By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the intelligent system yields material discoveries, critique and improve existing hypotheses, retrieve up-to-date data about existing research, and highlights their strengths and limitations. Our case studies demonstrate scalable capabilities to combine generative AI, ontological representations, and multi-agent modeling, harnessing a `swarm of intelligence' similar to biological systems. This provides new avenues for materials discovery and accelerates the development of advanced materials by unlocking Nature's design principles.</description>

      <title>Real-time optical gas sensing with two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are highly appealing for gas sensors, lab-on-a-chip devices and bio-sensing applications because of their strong light-matter interaction and high surface-to-volume ratio. The ability to grow these van der Waals materials on different substrates and waveguide geometries opens a horizon toward scalable on-chip photonic nanodevices. Here, we report on a versatile technique for real time remote optical gas sensing using two-dimensional TMDs. The adsorption of the gas molecules on the monolayer surface provides a gateway for gas sensing based on charge-transfer-induced photoluminescence variation. For gases that are weakly adsorbed on the surface of monolayer TMDs, purging the monolayers' surface by an inert gas like N2 can desorb gases from the monolayers at room temperature. We demonstrate CO, NO and NO2 detection by monitoring photoluminescence from semiconducting MoS2 monolayers grown on SiO2/Si chips at a level of 10 ppm with fast response time. Observations are supported by our density functional theory calculations, which predict a significant interaction between these gases and MoS2 monolayers. These findings may lead to advances in remote sensing, surface-sensitive bioanalytics and lab-on-a-chip sensors.</description>

      <title>Improved ACOM pattern matching in 4D STEM through adaptive sub pixel peak detection and image reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The technique known as 4D-STEM has recently emerged as a powerful tool for the local characterization of crystalline structures in materials, such as cathode materials for Li-ion batteries or perovskite materials for photovoltaics. However, the use of new detectors optimized for electron diffraction patterns and other advanced techniques requires constant adaptation of methodologies to address the challenges associated with crystalline materials. In this study, we present a novel image processing method to improve pattern matching in the determination of crystalline orientations and phases. Our approach uses sub-pixelar adaptative image processing to register and reconstruct electron diffraction signals in large 4D-STEM datasets. By using adaptive prominence and linear filters such as mean and gaussian blur, we are able to improve the quality of the diffraction pattern registration. The resulting data compression rate of 103 is well-suited for the era of big data and provides a significant enhancement in the performance of the entire ACOM data processing method. Our approach is evaluated using dedicated metrics, which demonstrate a high improvement in phase recognition. Our results demonstrate that this data preparation method not only enhances the quality of the resulting image but also boosts the confidence level in the analysis of the outcomes related to determining crystal orientation and phase. Additionally, it mitigates the impact of user bias that may occur during the application of the method through the manipulation of parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addressing the intricate challenges in plane elasticity, especially with non-vanishing traction and complex geometries, requires innovative methods. This paper offers a novel approach, drawing inspiration from the Neumann problem for the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann problem. Our method caters to domains that are conformally equivalent to a unit disk or annulus and emphasizes deriving explicit solutions for the displacement field rather than the stress tensor, differentiating it from most traditional methods. We explore solutions for specific traditional cases to demonstrate its efficacy, such as a cardioid domain, a ring domain with a shifted hole, and a gear-like structure. This work augments the existing toolbox for researchers and practitioners addressing isotropic planar elastostatics challenges, presenting a unified and flexible approach.</description>

      <title>Growth of bilayer stanene on a magnetic topological insulator aided by a buffer layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stanene, a two-dimensional counterpart to graphene, has the potential to exhibit novel quantum phenomena when grown on a magnetic topological insulator (MTI). This work demonstrates the formation of up to bilayer stanene on 30\% Sb-doped MnBi$_{2}$Te$_4$ (MBST), a well known MTI, albeit with a buffer layer (BL) in between. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), when combined with density functional theory (DFT), reveals stanene related bands such as two hole-like bands and an inverted parabolic band around the $\overline{\Gamma}$ point. An outer hole-like band traverses the Fermi level (\ef) and gives rise to a hexagonal Fermi surface, showing that stanene on MBST is metallic. In contrast, a bandgap of 0.8 eV is observed at the $\overline{K}$ point. We find that DFT shows good agreement with ARPES only when the BL and hydrogen passivation of the top Sn layer are considered in the calculation. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) establishes the honeycomb buckled structure of stanene. A stanene-related component is also detected in the Sn $d$ core level spectra, in addition to a BL-related component. The BL, which forms because of the chemical bonding between Sn and the top two layers of MBST, has an ordered crystal lattice with random anti-site defects. The composition of the BL is estimated to be Sn:Te:Bi/Sb $\approx$ 2:1:1 from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Low energy electron diffraction shows that the lattice constant of stanene is marginally larger than that of MBST, and the STM result aligns with this. The BL bridges this disparity and provides a platform for stanene growth.</description>

      <title>Rational design of nanoscale stabilized oxide catalysts for OER with OC22</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficiency of $H_2$ production via water electrolysis is typically limited to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As such, significant emphasis has been placed upon improving the rate of OER through the anode catalyst. More recently, the Open Catalyst 2022 (OC22) framework has provided a large dataset of density functional theory (DFT) calculations for OER intermediates on the surfaces of oxides. When coupled with state-of-the-art graph neural network models, total energy predictions can be achieved with a mean absolute error as low as 0.22 eV. In this work, we interpolated a database of the total energy predictions for all slabs and OER surface intermediates for 4,119 oxide materials in the original OC22 dataset using pre-trained models from the OC22 framework. This database includes all terminations of all facets up to a maximum Miller index of 1. To demonstrate the full utility of this database, we constructed a flexible screening framework to identify viable candidate anode catalysts for OER under varying reaction conditions for bulk, surface, and nanoscale Pourbaix stability as well as material cost, overpotential, and metastability. From our assessment, we were able to identify 122 and 68 viable candidates for OER under the bulk and nanoscale regime respectively.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning in Materials Informatics: structure-property relationships through minimal but highly informative multimodal input</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we propose simple, effective and computationally efficient transfer learning approaches for structure-property relation predictions in the context of materials, with highly informative input from different modalities. As materials properties stand from their electronic structure, representations are extracted directly from datasets of electronic charge density profile images using Neural Networks. We demonstrate transferability of the existing pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks and Large Language Models knowledge to physics domain data, exploring a wide set of compositions for the regression of energetics- or structure- related properties, and the role of semantic crystallographic information in the context of multimodal approaches. We test the applicability of the CLIP multimodal model, and employ as well a training protocol for building a more interpretable and versatile stacked custom solution from different pre-trained modalities. The study offers a promising avenue for enhancing the effectiveness of descriptor identification in physical systems, shedding light on the power of multimodal transfer learning for materials property prediction, without any support of complex geometrical architectures and with potential impact on decision making for new low-cost AI methods in the field of Materials and Chemoinformatics.</description>

      <title>Electric polarization evolution equation for antiferromagnetic multiferroics with the polarization proportional to the scalar product of the spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin current model of electric polarization of multiferroics is justified via the quantum hydrodynamic method and the mean-field part of the spin-orbit interaction. The spin current model is applied to derive the electric polarization proportional to the scalar product of the spins of the near by ions, which appears to be caused by the Dzylaoshinskii-Moriya interaction. Symmetric tensor spin structure of the polarization is discussed as well. We start our derivations for the ferromagnetic multiferroic materials and present the further generalization for the antiferromagnetic multiferroic materials. We rederive the operator of the electric dipole moment, which provides the macroscopic polarization obtained via the spin current model. Finally, we use the quantum average of the found electric dipole moment operator in order to derive the polarization evolution equation for the antiferromagnetic multiferroic materials. Possibility of spiral spin structures is analyzed.</description>

      <title>A first principles study of the Stark shift effect on the zero-phonon line of the NV center in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07771v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point defects in semiconductors are attractive candidates for quantum information science applications owing to their ability to act as spin-photon interface or single-photon emitters. However, the coupling between the change of dipole moment upon electronic excitation and stray electric fields in the vicinity of the defect, an effect known as Stark shift, can cause significant spectral diffusion in the emitted photons. In this work, using first principles computations, we revisit the methodology to compute the Stark shift of point defects up to the second order. The approach consists of applying an electric field on a defect in a slab and monitoring the changes in the computed zero-phonon line (i.e., difference in energy between the ground and excited state) obtained from constraining the orbital occupations (constrained-DFT). We study the Stark shift of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond using this slab approach. We discuss and compare two approaches to ensure a negatively charged defect in a slab and we show that converged values of the Stark shift measured by the change in dipole moment between the ground and excited states ($\Delta \mu$) can be obtained. We obtain a Stark shift of $\Delta \mu$=2.68D using the semi-local GGA-PBE functional and of $\Delta \mu$=2.23D using the HSE hybrid-functional. These values are in good agreement with experimental results. We also show that modern of theory of polarization can be used on constrained-DFT to obtain Stark shifts in very good agreement with the slab computations.</description>

      <title>Tuning the thermal conductivity of Si membrane using nanopillars: from crystalline to amorphous pillars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tuning thermal transport in nanostructures is essential for many applications, such as thermal management and thermoelectrics. Nanophononic metamaterials (NPM) have shown great potential for reducing thermal conductivity by introducing local resonant hybridization. In this work, the thermal conductivity of NPM with crystalline Si (c-Si) pillar, crystalline Ge (c-Ge) pillar and amorphous Si (a-Si) pillar are systematically investigated by molecular dynamics method. The analyses of phonon dispersion and spectral energy density show that phonon dispersions of Si membrane are flattened due to local resonant hybridization induced by both crystalline and amorphous pillar. In addition, a-Si pillar can cause larger reduction of thermal conductivity compared with c-Si pillar. Specifically, when increasing the atomic mass of atoms in pillars, the thermal conductivity of NPMs with crystalline pillar is increased because of the weakened phonon hybridization, however, the thermal conductivity of NPMs with amorphous pillar is almost unchanged, which indicates that the phonon transports are mainly affected by the scatterings at the interface between amorphous pillar and Si membrane. The results of this work can provide meaningful insights on controlling thermal transport in NPMs by choosing the materials and atomic mass of pillars for specific applications.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Characterization of Thermoelectric Performance in Copper-Based Chalcogenide CsCu$_3$S$_2$: Unveiling the role of Anharmonic Lattice Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explicitly consider both phonon energy shifts and broadening arising from both cubic and quartic anharmonicities, as well as diagonal/non-diagonal terms of heat flux operators in thermal conductivity. Our findings show that the strong anharmonicity of CsCu$_3$S$_2$ primarily arises from the presence of $p$-$d$ anti-bonding hybridization between Cu and S atoms, coupled with the random oscillations of Cs atoms. Notably, the competition between phonon hardening described by the loop diagram and softening induced by the bubble diagram significantly influences particle-like propagation, predominantly reflected in group velocity and energy-conservation rule. Additionally, the electrical transport properties are determined by employing the precise momentum relaxation-time approximation (MRTA). At high temperatures, the thermoelectric performance of $p$-type CsCu$_3$S$_2$ reaches its optimum theoretical value of 0.94 along the in-plane direction based on advanced phonon renormalization theory. In striking contrast, the harmonic approximation theory significantly overestimates the thermoelectric efficiency at the same temperatures, rendering it an impractical expectation. Conversely, the first-order renormalization approach leads to a serious underestimation of the thermoelectric properties due to the over-correction of phonon energy. Our study not only reveals the pivotal role of anharmonic lattice dynamics in accurately assessing thermoelectric properties but also underscores the potential thermoelectric applications for novel copper-based chalcogenides.</description>

Abstract: In magnetic fields, thermal gradient-induced effects such as the Nernst and thermal Hall effects are significantly influenced by phonon drag, which works in conjunction with the force on electrons in a magnetic field. We introduce a method to calculate Nernst and thermal Hall conductivities influenced by phonon drag using linear response theory to treat the magnetic field as a first-order perturbation. Our formula is general enough to apply to various systems in which the Green's functions of electrons and phonons are given. We apply the obtained general theory to the recent experiments of dilute metal SrTiO$_{3-\delta}$, known for strong Nernst and thermal Hall effects due to phonon drag. We find good agreement even quantitatively. This is notable as all model parameters are derived from experimental data without adjustable parameters.</description>

A variable counting scheme is described that preferentially counts in the high-angle region of the diffraction pattern. The effects on the resulting PDF are studied by varying the overall count time, the use of Soller slits, and limiting the out-of-plane divergence of the incident beam. The protocols are tested using an amorphous silica and a quartz sample. We also present a modification to the current PDFgetX3 data corrections to take care of sample absorption, which was previously neglected in the use of that program for high-energy synchrotron x-ray data. We show that, despite limitations in the Q-range and flux of laboratory instruments, reasonable data for PDF model fits may be obtained using the best protocols in a few hours of counting.</description>

      <title>Quantum Emission from Coupled Spin Pairs in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optically addressable defect qubits in wide band gap materials are favorable candidates for room temperature quantum information processing. The two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an attractive solid state platform with a great potential for hosting bright quantum emitters with quantum memories with leveraging the potential of 2D materials for realizing scalable preparation of defect qubits. Although, room temperature bright defect qubits have been recently reported in hBN but their microscopic origin, the nature of the optical transition as well as the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) have been remained elusive. Here we connect the variance in the optical spectra, optical lifetimes and spectral stability of quantum emitters to donor-acceptor pairs (DAP) in hBN by means of ab initio calculations. We find that DAPs can exhibit ODMR signal for the acceptor counterpart of the defect pair with S=1/2 ground state at non-zero magnetic fields depending on the donor partner. The donor-acceptor pair model and its transition mechanisms provide a recipe towards defect qubit identification and performance optimization in hBN for quantum applications.</description>

Abstract: We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of predicting the performance of various ion-doped NASICON compounds by leveraging extensive datasets from prior experimental investigation.The model demonstrated high accuracy and efficiency in predicting ionic conductivity and electrochemical properties. Key findings include the successful synthesis and validation of three NASICON materials predicted by the model, with experimental results closely matching the model predictions. This research not only enhances the understanding of ion-doping effects in NASICON materials but also establishes a robust framework for material design and practical applications. It bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental validations.</description>

      <title>SpinMultiNet: Neural Network Potential Incorporating Spin Degrees of Freedom with Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Network Potentials (NNPs) have attracted significant attention as a method for accelerating density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, conventional NNP models typically do not incorporate spin degrees of freedom, limiting their applicability to systems where spin states critically influence material properties, such as transition metal oxides. This study introduces SpinMultiNet, a novel NNP model that integrates spin degrees of freedom through multi-task learning. SpinMultiNet achieves accurate predictions without relying on correct spin values obtained from DFT calculations. Instead, it utilizes initial spin estimates as input and leverages multi-task learning to optimize the spin latent representation while maintaining both $E(3)$ and time-reversal equivariance. Validation on a dataset of transition metal oxides demonstrates the high predictive accuracy of SpinMultiNet. The model successfully reproduces the energy ordering of stable spin configurations originating from superexchange interactions and accurately captures the rhombohedral distortion of the rocksalt structure. These results pave the way for new possibilities in materials simulations that consider spin degrees of freedom, promising future applications in large-scale simulations of various material systems, including magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Biot-Savart law in the geometrical theory of dislocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal mechanical principles may exist behind seemingly unrelated physical phenomena, providing novel insights into these phenomena. This study sheds light on the geometrical theory of dislocations through an analogy with electromagnetics. In this theory, solving Cartan's first structure equation is essential for connecting the dislocation density to the plastic deformation field of the dislocations. The additional constraint of a divergence-free condition, derived from the Helmholtz decomposition, forms the governing equations that mirror Amp\`ere's and Gauss' law in electromagnetics. This allows for the analytical integration of the equations using the Biot-Savart law. The plastic deformation fields of screw and edge dislocations obtained through this process form both a vortex and an orthogonal coordinate system on the cross-section perpendicular to the dislocation line. This orthogonality is rooted in the conformal property of the corresponding complex function that satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, leading to the complex potential of plastic deformation. We validate the results through a comparison with the classical dislocation theory. The incompatibility tensor is crucial in the generation of the mechanical field. These findings reveal a profound unification of dislocation theories, electromagnetics, and complex functions through their underlying mathematical parallels.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear screening and charge redistribution in periodically doped graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The screening problem for the Coulomb potential of a charge located in a two-dimensional (2D) system has an intriguing solution with a power law distance screening factor due to out-of-plane electrical fields. This is crucially different from a three-dimensional case with exponential screening. The long-range action of electric fields results in the effective inflow of electrons from high-doped regions to low-doped regions of a 2D heterostructure. In graphene and other materials with linear energy spectrum for electrons, such inflow in low-doped regions also occurs, but its effectiveness is dependent on doping level. This can be used for fabricating high-mobility conducting channels. We provide the theory for determining electron potential and concentration in a periodically doped graphene sheet along one dimension taking into account all effects of long-range 2D screening. This results in a substantially nonlinear integro-differential problem, which is solved numerically via computationally cheap algorithm. Similar nonlinear problems arise in a wide range of doped 2D heterostructures made of linear spectrum materials.</description>

      <title>Second-order nonlocal shifts of scattered wave-packets: What can be measured by Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00375v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scattering of wavepackets with arbitrary energy dispersion on surfaces has been analyzed. Expanding up to second order in scattering shifts, it is found that besides the known Goos-H\"anchen or Imbert-Fedorov spatial offset, as well as the Wigner delay time, new momentum and frequency shifts appear. Furthermore, the width of the scattered wave packet becomes modified as well, which can lead to a shrinking of pulses by multiple scattering. For a model of dielectric material characterized by a longitudinal and transverse dielectric function the shifts are calculated analytically. From the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts one can access the longitudinal and transversal dielectric function. Perfectly aligned crystal symmetry axes with respect to scattering beam shows no Imbert-Fedorov effect. It is found that the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effect are absent for homogeneous materials. Oppositely it is found that the Wigner delay time and the shrinking of the temporal pulse width allows to access the dielectric function independent on the beam geometry.</description>

      <title>Electronic correlations and long-range magnetic ordering in NiO tuned by pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the DFT+dynamical mean-field theory method we revisit the pressure-temperature phase diagram of the prototypical correlated insulator NiO. We study the pressure-induced evolution of the electronic structure, magnetic state, and exchange couplings of the antiferromagnetic phase of NiO. We calculate the ordered magnetic moments and uniform spin susceptibility of the Ni $3d$ states of NiO, which allow us to determine the pressure-dependence of the N\'eel temperature $T_N$. We note that the long-range magnetism has no significant effects on the valence band photoemission spectra of NiO under moderate compressions, implying the importance of correlations effects to explain the insulating state of NiO. The antiferromagnetic insulating state is found to be stable up to the high compression value $\sim$0.4 $V_0$ (assuming the cubic $B1$ crystal structure of NiO), and is associated with a (correlated-assisted) Slater insulating state driven by the long-range magnetic ordering. In fact, the paramagnetic phase of NiO at such high compression is found to be metallic, implying delocalization of the Ni $3d$ states. The calculated $T_N$ exhibits a non-monotonic behavior upon compression, with a maximum associated with the crossover from Mott localized (strong coupling) to itinerant moment regimes, in qualitative agreement with the phase diagram of the half-filled single-band Hubbard model. We point out the importance of the non-local correlation effects to explain the magnetic properties of NiO.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Skin Effect through a Hermitian-non-Hermitian Correspondence and Its Observation in an Acoustic Kagome Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a distinctive topological phenomenon observed in nonHermitian systems. Recently, there has been considerable interest in exploring higher-order NHSE occurrences in two and three dimensions. In such systems, topological edge states collapse into a corner while bulk states remain delocalized. Through a Hermitian-non-Hermitian correspondence, this study predicts and experimentally observes the higher-order NHSE in an acoustic Kagome lattice possessing nonreciprocal hoppings. By rotating the frequency spectrum and employing complexfrequency excitation techniques, we observe the localization of acoustic energy towards a corner of the lattice in the topologically nontrivial phase, even when the source is located far from that corner. In contrast, the acoustic energy spreads out when excited at the frequencies hosting the bulk states. These observations are unequivocal evidence of the higher-order NHSE.</description>
