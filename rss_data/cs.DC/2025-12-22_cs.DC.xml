      <title>Fixed-Priority and EDF Schedules for ROS2 Graphs on Uniprocessor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses limitations of current scheduling methods in the Robot Operating System (ROS)2, focusing on scheduling tasks beyond simple chains and analyzing arbitrary Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). While previous research has focused mostly on chain-based scheduling with ad-hoc response time analyses, we propose a novel approach using the events executor to implement fixed-job-level-priority schedulers for arbitrary ROS2 graphs on uniprocessor systems. We demonstrate that ROS 2 applications can be abstracted as forests of trees, enabling the mapping of ROS 2 applications to traditional real-time DAG task models. Our usage of the events executor requires a special implementation of the events queue and a communication middleware that supports LIFO-ordered message delivery, features not yet standard in ROS2. We show that our implementation generates the same schedules as a conventional fixed-priority DAG task scheduler, in spite of lacking access to the precedence information that usually is required. This further closes the gap between established real-time systems theory and ROS2 scheduling analyses.</description>

      <title>LLM-HPC++: Evaluating LLM-Generated Modern C++ and MPI+OpenMP Codes for Scalable Mandelbrot Set Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel programming remains one of the most challenging aspects of High-Performance Computing (HPC), requiring deep knowledge of synchronization, communication, and memory models. While modern C++ standards and frameworks like OpenMP and MPI have simplified parallelism, mastering these paradigms is still complex. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating code generation, but their effectiveness in producing correct and efficient HPC code is not well understood. In this work, we systematically evaluate leading LLMs including ChatGPT 4 and 5, Claude, and LLaMA on the task of generating C++ implementations of the Mandelbrot set using shared-memory, directive-based, and distributed-memory paradigms. Each generated program is compiled and executed with GCC 11.5.0 to assess its correctness, robustness, and scalability. Results show that ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-5 achieve strong syntactic precision and scalable performance.</description>

      <title>Taming the Memory Footprint Crisis: System Design for Production Diffusion LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Models (ARMs), utilizing parallel decoding to overcome sequential bottlenecks. However, existing research focuses primarily on kernel-level optimizations, lacking a holistic serving framework that addresses the unique memory dynamics of diffusion processes in production. We identify a critical "memory footprint crisis" specific to dLLMs, driven by monolithic logit tensors and the severe resource oscillation between compute-bound "Refresh" phases and bandwidth-bound "Reuse" phases. To bridge this gap, we present dLLM-Serve, an efficient dLLM serving system that co-optimizes memory footprint, computational scheduling, and generation quality. dLLM-Serve introduces Logit-Aware Activation Budgeting to decompose transient tensor peaks, a Phase-Multiplexed Scheduler to interleave heterogeneous request phases, and Head-Centric Sparse Attention to decouple logical sparsity from physical storage. We evaluate dLLM-Serve on diverse workloads (LiveBench, Burst, OSC) and GPUs (RTX 4090, L40S). Relative to the state-of-the-art baseline, dLLM-Serve improves throughput by 1.61$\times$-1.81$\times$ on the consumer-grade RTX 4090 and 1.60$\times$-1.74$\times$ on the server-grade NVIDIA L40S, while reducing tail latency by nearly 4$\times$ under heavy contention. dLLM-Serve establishes the first blueprint for scalable dLLM inference, converting theoretical algorithmic sparsity into tangible wall-clock acceleration across heterogeneous hardware.</description>

      <title>Scalable Distributed Vector Search via Accuracy Preserving Index Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) to billions of vectors requires distributed indexes that balance accuracy, latency, and throughput. Yet existing index designs struggle with this tradeoff. This paper presents SPIRE, a scalable vector index based on two design decisions. First, it identifies a balanced partition granularity that avoids read-cost explosion. Second, it introduces an accuracy-preserving recursive construction that builds a multi-level index with predictable search cost and stable accuracy. In experiments with up to 8 billion vectors across 46 nodes, SPIRE achieves high scalability and up to 9.64X higher throughput than state-of-the-art systems.</description>

      <title>The HEAL Data Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: The objective was to develop a cloud-based, federated system to serve as a single point of search, discovery and analysis for data generated under the NIH Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) Initiative.
  Materials and methods: The HEAL Data Platform is built on the open source Gen3 platform, utilizing a small set of framework services and exposed APIs to interoperate with both NIH and non-NIH data repositories. Framework services include those for authentication and authorization, creating persistent identifiers for data objects, and adding and updating metadata.
  Results: The HEAL Data Platform serves as a single point of discovery of over one thousand studies funded under the HEAL Initiative. With hundreds of users per month, the HEAL Data Platform provides rich metadata and interoperates with data repositories and commons to provide access to shared datasets. Secure, cloud-based compute environments that are integrated with STRIDES facilitate secondary analysis of HEAL data. The HEAL Data Platform currently interoperates with nineteen data repositories.
  Discussion: Studies funded under the HEAL Initiative generate a wide variety of data types, which are deposited across multiple NIH and third-party data repositories. The mesh architecture of the HEAL Data Platform provides a single point of discovery of these data resources, accelerating and facilitating secondary use.
  Conclusion: The HEAL Data Platform enables search, discovery, and analysis of data that are deposited in connected data repositories and commons. By ensuring that these data are fully Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR), the HEAL Data Platform maximizes the value of data generated under the HEAL Initiative.</description>

      <title>Enabling Disaggregated Multi-Stage MLLM Inference via GPU-Internal Scheduling and Resource Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend LLMs with visual understanding through a three-stage pipeline: multimodal preprocessing, vision encoding, and LLM inference. While these stages enhance capability, they introduce significant system bottlenecks. First, multimodal preprocessing-especially video decoding-often dominates Time-to-First-Token (TTFT). Most systems rely on CPU-based decoding, which severely limits throughput, while existing GPU-based approaches prioritize throughput-oriented parallelism and fail to meet the latency-sensitive requirements of MLLM inference. Second, the vision encoder is a standalone, compute-intensive stage that produces visual embeddings and cannot be co-batched with LLM prefill or decoding. This heterogeneity forces inter-stage blocking and increases token-generation latency. Even when deployed on separate GPUs, these stages underutilize available compute and memory resources, reducing overall utilization and constraining system throughput.
  To address these challenges, we present FlashCodec and UnifiedServe, two complementary designs that jointly optimize the end-to-end MLLM pipeline. FlashCodec accelerates the multimodal preprocessing stage through collaborative multi-GPU video decoding, reducing decoding latency while preserving high throughput. UnifiedServe optimizes the vision-to-text and inference stages using a logically decoupled their execution to eliminate inter-stage blocking, yet physically sharing GPU resources to maximize GPU system utilization. By carefully orchestrating execution across stages and minimizing interference, UnifiedServe Together, our proposed framework forms an end-to-end optimized stack that can serve up to 3.0$\times$ more requests or enforce 1.5$\times$ tighter SLOs, while achieving up to 4.4$\times$ higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Design Patterns and Benchmark Practices in Apache Kafka Event-Streaming Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Apache Kafka has become a foundational platform for high throughput event streaming, enabling real time analytics, financial transaction processing, industrial telemetry, and large scale data driven systems. Despite its maturity and widespread adoption, consolidated research on reusable architectural design patterns and reproducible benchmarking methodologies remains fragmented across academic and industrial publications. This paper presents a structured synthesis of forty two peer reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2025, identifying nine recurring Kafka design patterns including log compaction, CQRS bus, exactly once pipelines, change data capture, stream table joins, saga orchestration, tiered storage, multi tenant topics, and event sourcing replay. The analysis examines co usage trends, domain specific deployments, and empirical benchmarking practices using standard suites such as TPCx Kafka and the Yahoo Streaming Benchmark, as well as custom workloads. The study highlights significant inconsistencies in configuration disclosure, evaluation rigor, and reproducibility that limit cross study comparison and practical replication. By providing a unified taxonomy, pattern benchmark matrix, and actionable decision heuristics, this work offers practical guidance for architects and researchers designing reproducible, high performance, and fault tolerant Kafka based event streaming systems.</description>

      <title>Dion2: A Simple Method to Shrink Matrix in Muon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Muon optimizer enjoys strong empirical performance and theoretical grounding. However, the super-linear cost of its orthonormalization step introduces increasing overhead with scale. To alleviate this cost, several works have attempted to reduce the size of the matrix entering the orthonormalization step. We introduce Dion2, a much simpler method for shrinking the matrix involved in Muon's computation compared to prior approaches. At a high level, Dion2 selects a fraction of rows or columns at each iteration and orthonormalizes only those. This sampling procedure makes the update sparse, reducing both computation and communication costs which in turn improves the scalability of Muon.</description>

      <title>Sedna: Sharding transactions in multiple concurrent proposer blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern blockchains increasingly adopt multi-proposer (MCP) consensus to remove single-leader bottlenecks and improve censorship resistance. However, MCP alone does not resolve how users should disseminate transactions to proposers. Today, users either naively replicate full transactions to many proposers, sacrificing goodput and exposing payloads to MEV, or target few proposers and accept weak censorship and latency guarantees. This yields a practical trilemma among censorship resistance, low latency, and reasonable cost (in fees or system goodput).
  We present Sedna, a user-facing protocol that replaces naive transaction replication with verifiable, rateless coding. Users privately deliver addressed symbol bundles to subsets of proposers; execution follows a deterministic order once enough symbols are finalized to decode. We prove Sedna guarantees liveness and \emph{until-decode privacy}, significantly reducing MEV exposure. Analytically, the protocol approaches the information-theoretic lower bound for bandwidth overhead, yielding a 2-3x efficiency improvement over naive replication. Sedna requires no consensus modifications, enabling incremental deployment.</description>

      <title>Practical Framework for Privacy-Preserving and Byzantine-robust Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing their private data. However, FL is vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, where adversaries manipulate client models to compromise the federated model, and privacy inference attacks, where adversaries exploit client models to infer private data. Existing defenses against both backdoor and privacy inference attacks introduce significant computational and communication overhead, creating a gap between theory and practice. To address this, we propose ABBR, a practical framework for Byzantine-robust and privacy-preserving FL. We are the first to utilize dimensionality reduction to speed up the private computation of complex filtering rules in privacy-preserving FL. Additionally, we analyze the accuracy loss of vector-wise filtering in low-dimensional space and introduce an adaptive tuning strategy to minimize the impact of malicious models that bypass filtering on the global model. We implement ABBR with state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust aggregation rules and evaluate it on public datasets, showing that it runs significantly faster, has minimal communication overhead, and maintains nearly the same Byzantine-resilience as the baselines.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Graph Pruning with Sudden-Events Evaluation for Traffic Prediction using Online Semi-Decentralized ST-GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) are well-suited for processing high-frequency data streams from geographically distributed sensors in smart mobility systems. However, their deployment at the edge across distributed compute nodes (cloudlets) createssubstantial communication overhead due to repeated transmission of overlapping node features between neighbouring cloudlets. To address this, we propose an adaptive pruning algorithm that dynamically filters redundant neighbour features while preserving the most informative spatial context for prediction. The algorithm adjusts pruning rates based on recent model performance, allowing each cloudlet to focus on regions experiencing traffic changes without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the Sudden Event Prediction Accuracy (SEPA), a novel event-focused metric designed to measure responsiveness to traffic slowdowns and recoveries, which are often missed by standard error metrics. We evaluate our approach in an online semi-decentralized setting with traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning on two large-scale traffic datasets, PeMS-BAY and PeMSD7-M, across short-, mid-, and long-term prediction horizons. Experiments show that, in contrast to standard metrics, SEPA exposes the true value of spatial connectivity in predicting dynamic and irregular traffic. Our adaptive pruning algorithm maintains prediction accuracy while significantly lowering communication cost in all online semi-decentralized settings, demonstrating that communication can be reduced without compromising responsiveness to critical traffic events.</description>

      <title>Democratizing Scalable Cloud Applications: Transactional Stateful Functions on Streaming Dataflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Web applications underpin much of modern digital life, yet building scalable and consistent cloud applications remains difficult, requiring expertise across cloud computing, distributed systems, databases, and software engineering. These demands restrict development to a small number of highly specialized engineers. This thesis aims to democratize cloud application development by addressing three challenges: programmability, high-performance fault-tolerant serializable transactions, and serverless semantics.
  The thesis identifies strong parallels between cloud applications and the streaming dataflow execution model. It first explores this connection through T-Statefun, a transactional extension of Apache Flink Statefun, demonstrating that dataflow systems can support transactional cloud applications via a stateful functions-as-a-service API. However, this approach revealed significant limitations in programmability and performance.
  To overcome these issues, the thesis introduces Stateflow, a high-level object-oriented programming model that compiles applications into stateful dataflow graphs with minimal boilerplate. Building on this model, the thesis presents Styx, a distributed streaming dataflow engine that provides deterministic, multi-partition, serializable transactions with strong fault tolerance guarantees. Styx eliminates explicit transaction failure handling and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems.
  Finally, the thesis extends Styx with transactional state migration to support elasticity under dynamic workloads.</description>

      <title>Torrent: A Distributed DMA for Efficient and Flexible Point-to-Multipoint Data Movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing disparity between computational power and on-chip communication bandwidth is a critical bottleneck in modern Systems-on-Chip (SoCs), especially for data-parallel workloads like AI. Efficient point-to-multipoint (P2MP) data movement, such as multicast, is essential for high performance. However, native multicast support is lacking in standard interconnect protocols. Existing P2MP solutions, such as multicast-capable Network-on-Chip (NoC), impose additional overhead to the network hardware and require modifications to the interconnect protocol, compromising scalability and compatibility.
  This paper introduces Torrent, a novel distributed DMA architecture that enables efficient P2MP data transfers without modifying NoC hardware and interconnect protocol. Torrent conducts P2MP data transfers by forming logical chains over the NoC, where the data traverses through targeted destinations resembling a linked list. This Chainwrite mechanism preserves the P2P nature of every data transfer while enabling flexible data transfers to an unlimited number of destinations. To optimize the performance and energy consumption of Chainwrite, two scheduling algorithms are developed to determine the optimal chain order based on NoC topology.
  Our RTL and FPGA prototype evaluations using both synthetic and real workloads demonstrate significant advantages in performance, flexibility, and scalability over network-layer multicast. Compared to the unicast baseline, Torrent achieves up to a 7.88x speedup. ASIC synthesis on 16nm technology confirms the architecture's minimal footprint in area (1.2%) and power (2.3%). Thanks to the Chainwrite, Torrent delivers scalable P2MP data transfers with a small cycle overhead of 82CC and area overhead of 207um2 per destination.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of galactic small-scale dynamos at modest magnetic Prandtl number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are critical at many scales to galactic dynamics and structure, including multiphase pressure balance, dust processing, and star formation. Dynamo action determines their dynamical structure and strength. Simulations of combined large- and small-scale dynamos have successfully developed mean fields with strength and topology consistent with observations but with turbulent fields much weaker than observed, while simulations of small-scale dynamos with parameters relevant to the interstellar medium yield turbulent fields an order of magnitude below the values observed or expected theoretically. We use the Pencil Code accelerated on GPUs with Astaroth to perform high-resolution simulations of a supernova-driven galactic dynamo including heating and cooling in a periodic domain. Our models show that the strength of the turbulent field produced by the small-scale dynamo approaches an asymptote at only modest magnetic Prandtl numbers. This allows us to use these models to suggest the essential characteristics of this constituent of the magnetic field for inclusion in global galactic models. The asymptotic limit occurs already at magnetic Prandtl number of only a few hundred, many orders of magnitude below physical values in the the interstellar medium and consistent with previous findings for isothermal compressible flows.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Predictive Resource Management in Complex Science Workflows</title>

Abstract: The collaborative efforts of large communities in science experiments, often comprising thousands of global members, reflect a monumental commitment to exploration and discovery. Recently, advanced and complex data processing has gained increasing importance in science experiments. Data processing workflows typically consist of multiple intricate steps, and the precise specification of resource requirements is crucial for each step to allocate optimal resources for effective processing. Estimating resource requirements in advance is challenging due to a wide range of analysis scenarios, varying skill levels among community members, and the continuously increasing spectrum of computing options. One practical approach to mitigate these challenges involves initially processing a subset of each step to measure precise resource utilization from actual processing profiles before completing the entire step. While this two-staged approach enables processing on optimal resources for most of the workflow, it has drawbacks such as initial inaccuracies leading to potential failures and suboptimal resource usage, along with overhead from waiting for initial processing completion, which is critical for fast-turnaround analyses. In this context, our study introduces a novel pipeline of machine learning models within a comprehensive workflow management system, the Production and Distributed Analysis (PanDA) system. These models employ advanced machine learning techniques to predict key resource requirements, overcoming challenges posed by limited upfront knowledge of characteristics at each step. Accurate forecasts of resource requirements enable informed and proactive decision-making in workflow management, enhancing the efficiency of handling diverse, complex workflows across heterogeneous resources.</description>

      <title>Beyond Exascale: Dataflow Domain Translation on a Cerebras Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation of physical systems is essential across scientific and engineering domains. Commonly used domain decomposition methods are unable to simultaneously deliver both high simulation rate and high utilization in network computing environments. In particular, Exascale systems deliver only a small fraction their peak performance for these workloads. This paper introduces the novel Domain Translation algorithm, designed to overcome these limitations. On a cluster of 64 Cerebras CS-3 systems, we use this method to demonstrate unprecedented cluster performance across a range of metrics: we show simulations running in excess of 1.6 million time steps per second; we also demonstrate perfect weak scaling at 88% of peak performance. At this cluster scale, our implementation provides 112 PFLOP/s in a power-unconstrained environment, and 57 GFLOP/J in a power-limited environment. We illustrate the method by applying the shallow-water equations to model a tsunami following an asteroid impact at 460m-resolution on a planetary scale.</description>

      <title>LeaseGuard: Raft Leases Done Right</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Raft is a leading consensus algorithm for replicating writes in distributed databases. However, distributed databases also require consistent reads. To guarantee read consistency, a Raft-based system must either accept the high communication overhead of a safety check for each read, or implement leader leases. Prior lease protocols are vaguely specified and hurt availability, so most Raft systems implement them incorrectly or not at all. We introduce LeaseGuard, a novel lease algorithm that relies on guarantees specific to Raft elections. LeaseGuard is simple, rigorously specified in TLA+, and includes two novel optimizations that maximize availability during leader failover. The first optimization restores write throughput quickly, and the second improves read availability. We evaluate LeaseGuard with a simulation in Python and an implementation in LogCabin, the C++ reference implementation of Raft. By replacing LogCabin's default consistency mechanism (quorum checks), LeaseGuard reduces the overhead of consistent reads from one to zero network roundtrips. It also improves write throughput from ~1000 to ~10,000 writes per second, by eliminating contention between writes and quorum reads. Whereas traditional leases ban all reads on a new leader while it waits for a lease, in our LeaseGuard test the new leader instantly allows 99% of reads to succeed.</description>

      <title>PeerSync: Accelerating Containerized Service Delivery at the Network Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient container image distribution is crucial for enabling machine learning inference at the network edge, where resource limitations and dynamic network conditions create significant challenges. In this paper, we present PeerSync, a decentralized P2P-based system designed to optimize image distribution in edge environments. PeerSync employs a popularity- and network-aware download engine that dynamically adapts to content popularity and real-time network conditions. PeerSync further integrates automated tracker election for rapid peer discovery and dynamic cache management for efficient storage utilization. We implement PeerSync with 8000+ lines of Rust code and test its performance extensively on both large-scale Docker-based emulations and physical edge devices. Experimental results show that PeerSync delivers a remarkable speed increase of 2.72$\times$, 1.79$\times$, and 1.28$\times$ compared to the Baseline solution, Dragonfly, and Kraken, respectively, while significantly reducing cross-network traffic by 90.72% under congested and varying network conditions.</description>

      <title>Dual-Distilled Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Adaptive Margins for Trainable Global Prototypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HFL) has gained significant attention for its capacity to handle both model and data heterogeneity across clients. Prototype-based HFL methods emerge as a promising solution to address statistical and model heterogeneity as well as privacy challenges, paving the way for new advancements in HFL research. This method focuses on sharing class-representative prototypes among heterogeneous clients. However, aggregating these prototypes via standard weighted averaging often yields sub-optimal global knowledge. Specifically, the averaging approach induces a shrinking of the aggregated prototypes' decision margins, thereby degrading model performance in scenarios with model heterogeneity and non-IID data distributions. The propose FedProtoKD in a Heterogeneous Federated Learning setting, utilizing an enhanced dual-knowledge distillation mechanism to enhance system performance by leveraging clients' logits and prototype feature representations. The proposed framework aims to resolve the prototype margin-shrinking problem using a contrastive learning-based trainable server prototype by leveraging a class-wise adaptive prototype margin. Furthermore, the framework assess the importance of public samples using the closeness of the sample's prototype to its class representative prototypes, which enhances learning performance. FedProtoKD improved test accuracy by an average of 1.13% and up to 34.13% across various settings, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art HFL methods.</description>

      <title>BugMagnifier: TON Transaction Simulator for Revealing Smart Contract Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Open Network (TON) blockchain employs an asynchronous execution model that introduces unique security challenges for smart contracts, particularly race conditions arising from unpredictable message processing order. While previous work established vulnerability patterns through static analysis of audit reports, dynamic detection of temporal dependencies through systematic testing remains an open problem. We present BugMagnifier, a transaction simulation framework that systematically reveals vulnerabilities in TON smart contracts through controlled message orchestration. Built atop TON Sandbox and integrated with the TON Virtual Machine (TVM), our tool combines precise message queue manipulation with differential state analysis and probabilistic permutation testing to detect asynchronous execution flaws. Experimental evaluation demonstrates BugMagnifier's effectiveness through extensive parametric studies on purpose-built vulnerable contracts, revealing message ratio-dependent detection complexity that aligns with theoretical predictions. This quantitative model enables predictive vulnerability assessment while shifting discovery from manual expert analysis to automated evidence generation. By providing reproducible test scenarios for temporal vulnerabilities, BugMagnifier addresses a critical gap in the TON security tooling, offering practical support for safer smart contract development in asynchronous blockchain environments.</description>

      <title>TreeVQA: A Tree-Structured Execution Framework for Shot Reduction in Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are promising for near- and intermediate-term quantum computing, but their execution cost is substantial. Each task requires many iterations and numerous circuits per iteration, and real-world applications often involve multiple tasks, scaling with the precision needed to explore the application's energy landscape. This demands an enormous number of execution shots, making practical use prohibitively expensive. We observe that VQA costs can be significantly reduced by exploiting execution similarities across an application's tasks. Based on this insight, we propose TreeVQA, a tree-based execution framework that begins by executing tasks jointly and progressively branches only as their quantum executions diverge. Implemented as a VQA wrapper, TreeVQA integrates with typical VQA applications. Evaluations on scientific and combinatorial benchmarks show shot count reductions of $25.9\times$ on average and over $100\times$ for large-scale problems at the same target accuracy. The benefits grow further with increasing problem size and precision requirements.</description>

      <title>Efficient Bitcoin Meta-Protocol Transaction and Data Discovery Through nLockTime Field Repurposing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the Lockchain Protocol, a lightweight Bitcoin meta-protocol that enables highly efficient transaction discovery at zero marginal block space cost, and data verification without introducing any new on-chain storage mechanism. The protocol repurposes the mandatory 4-byte nLockTime field of every Bitcoin transaction as a compact metadata header. By constraining values to an unused range of past Unix timestamps greater than or equal to 500,000,000, the field can encode a protocol signal, type, variant, and sequence identifier while remaining fully valid under Bitcoin consensus and policy rules. The primary contribution of the protocol is an efficient discovery layer. Indexers can filter candidate transactions by examining a fixed-size header field, independent of transaction payload size, and only then selectively inspect heavier data such as OP RETURN outputs or witness fields. The Lockchain Protocol applies established protocol design patterns to an under-optimised problem domain, namely transaction discovery at scale, and does not claim new cryptographic primitives or storage methods.</description>
