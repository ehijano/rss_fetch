      <title>Reply to Comment on "Revisiting the divergent multipole expansion of atom-surface interactions: Hydrogen and positronium, alpha-quartz, and physisorption" (arXiv:2501.14803)</title>

Abstract: We present a Reply to the Comment by G. L. Klimchitskaya, arXiv:2501.14803 [physics.atom-ph]. It is shown that the criticism formulated in the Comment fails to appreciate recently obtained results for the upper limit of the short-range expansion of atom-surface interactions, and that the application of our results to physisorption is based on a valid extension of Lifshitz theory to the physisorption range, which can be accomplished by refining the concept of the atom-surface distance with the help of a reference-plane that takes the response function of the solid into account. Some details on the calculation of the reference-plane are recalled from the literature.</description>

      <title>Theory of composite Ramsey sequences of radiofrequency pulses beyond the rotating wave approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of composite Ramsey sequences of rf pulses interacting with the Zeeman structure at the long-lived atomic level, beyond the rotating wave approximation. Such sequences are proposed in experiments to detect the violation of local Lorentz invariance [R. Shaniv, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 103202 (2018)]. Based on Fourier analysis, we have shown that taking into account non-resonant contributions leads to a radical change in the dynamics of the quantum system (with respect to the rotating wave approximation) in the case when the number of Ramsey pulses exceeds several tens. As a result, the effectiveness of using such rf pulses sequences to test local Lorentz invariance has not yet been fully determined and requires additional research.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed dual-comb spectroscopy of complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multiplexed dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) approach for high-resolution, broadband spectral measurements is presented, demonstrating its effectiveness in studying complex atomic systems. By implementing a photodetector array, we enhance DCS capabilities, addressing the fundamental trade-off between signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral coverage. To resolve ambiguities in frequency conversion, we introduced a relative offset in the radio frequency (RF) comb teeth, ensuring accurate spectral reconstruction. As a proof of concept, the absorption spectrum of samarium (Sm) vapor is investigated over a 52nm range, and several previously unreported absorption lines are detected. This is a step toward "Spectroscopy 2.0", enabling massively parallel spectroscopic measurements (including those at &gt;100 T magnetic fields) crucial for atomic physics and fundamental interactions research.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Universality of Rydberg-Excitation Spreading on a Dynamic Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the universal properties of non-equilibrium phase transitions of spreading processes is a challenging problem. This applies in particular to irregular and dynamically varying networks. We here investigate an experimentally accessible model system for such processes, namely the absorbing-state phase transition (ASPT) of Rydberg-excitation spreading, known as Rydberg facilitation, in a laser-driven gas of mobile atoms. It occurs on an irregular graph, set by the random atom positions in the gas and, depending on temperature, changes its character from static to dynamic. By studying the behavior of the order parameter in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 173401 (2024)] we showed numerical evidence for a crossover from directed percolation (DP) universality through various phases of anomalous directed percolation (ADP) to mean-field (MF) behavior when the temperature of the gas is increased. As the behavior of the order parameter is not sufficient to uniquely determine the universality class, we here analyze the distribution of avalanches - characteristic of non-equilibrium critical behavior - to fully characterize the ASPT. Performing extended numerical calculations and experiments on a cold $^{87}$Rb atom gas we confirm our earlier numerical findings and our phenomenological model that maps the dynamic network to a static one with power-law tails of the distribution of excitation distances. Furthermore we discuss the influence of dissipation, present in the experiment and a necessary ingredient for the self-organization of the system to the critical point. In particular we study the potential modification of the universality class by losses as a function of dissipation strength.</description>

      <title>Taming Recoil Effect in Cavity-Assisted Quantum Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon recoil is one of the fundamental limitations for high-fidelity control of trapped-atom qubits such as neutral atoms and trapped ions. In this work, we derive an analytical model for efficiently evaluating the motion-induced infidelity in remote entanglement generation protocols. Our model is applicable for various photonic qubit encodings such as polarization, time-bin, and frequency, and with arbitrary initial motional states, thus providing a crucial theoretical tool for realizing high-fidelity quantum networking. For the case of tweezer-trapped neutral atoms, our results indicate that operating in the bad-cavity regime with cavity decay rate exceeding atom-photon coupling rate, and near-ground-state cooling with motional quanta below 1, are desired to suppress the motion-induced infidelity sufficiently below the 1\% level required for efficient quantum networking. Finite temperature effects can be mitigated efficiently by detection time filtering at the moderate cost of success probability and network speed. These results extend the understanding of infidelity sources in remote entanglement generation protocols, establishing a concrete path towards fault-tolerant quantum networking with scalable trapped-atom qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Phenomenon of a stronger trapping behaviour in $\Lambda$-type quantum systems with symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\Lambda$, $V$, $\Xi$ (ladder), and other three-level quantum systems with one forbidden transition ($\Lambda$-type systems) play an important role in quantum physics. Various applications require manipulation by such systems using as control shaped laser field. In this work, we study how degeneracy in energy states and Bohr frequencies of these systems affects the efficiency or difficulty of finding optimal shape of the control field. For this, we adopt the notion of higher order traps which was introduced in [A.N. Pechen and D.J. Tannor, Are there traps in quantum control landscapes? Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 106}, 120402 (2011)], where second/third order traps were discovered for $\Lambda$-type systems with one forbidden transition and with non-degenerate energy levels. We study control of such systems with and without denegeracy in their eigenstates and Bohr frequencies, and investigate how these degeneracies influence on the efficiency of optimizing the control laser field. We find that the degeneracy of Bohr frequencies in the $\Xi$ system leads to the appearance of seventh order trap with a more significant attracting domain resulting in a more difficult optimization, while degeneracy in energy states of $\Lambda$-type systems does not lead to increase of the order of the zero control trap compared to the non-degenerate case.</description>

      <title>Quantum Logic Spectroscopy of an Electron and Positron for Precise Tests of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for quantum logic spectroscopy of an electron or positron in a Penning trap. An electron or positron in a spectroscopy trap is coupled to a remote logic electron or positron via a wire to achieve motional entanglement. By separating the two traps, one can significantly improve magnetic field homogeneity, microwave characteristics, and detection sensitivity. The proposed scheme will improve the measurement precision of the electron's and positron's magnetic moments and charge-to-mass ratios, enabling precise tests of the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle involves a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. This is done with a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free-fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Temporal Periodic Density Patterns in Driven Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of collective excitations is a crucial tool for understanding many-body quantum systems. For instance, they play a central role in the exploration of superfluidity and other quantum macroscopic phenomena in Bose and Fermi systems. In this work we present a variational and a numerical study of a parametrically driven Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a cylindrical harmonic trap in which the aspect ratio can be varied from a prolate (cigar-shaped) to an oblate (pancake-shaped) system. The excitation can be applied by periodically modulating the harmonic frequencies of the trap or, alternatively, the interatomic interaction strength at a frequency that matches that of the system breathing mode. As a result, we observe the formation of dynamical density patterns that depend on the geometry of the trap: a fringe pattern in a prolate system and a ring pattern in an oblate one. By decomposing the total energy into its kinetic, potential, and interaction terms, we show that the onset of these patterns coincides with the redistribution of kinetic energy along the weakly trapped directions of the sample, indicating the three-dimensional nature of the studied phenomena. Finally, our analysis shows that the difference between the two excitation mechanisms lies on the system stability. Modulating the trap destabilizes the system quicker than modulating the interactions, leading to earlier formation of the patterns.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Fermi's Golden Rule in the Probing of a Quantum Many-Body System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) is one of the most impactful formulas in quantum mechanics, providing a link between easy-to-measure observables - such as transition rates - and fundamental microscopic properties - such as density of states or spectral functions. Its validity relies on three key assumptions: the existence of a continuum, an appropriate time window, and a weak coupling. Understanding the regime of validity of FGR is critical for the proper interpretation of most spectroscopic experiments. While the assumptions underlying FGR are straightforward to analyze in simple models, their applicability is significantly more complex in quantum many-body systems. Here, we observe the emergence and breakdown of FGR, using a strongly interacting homogeneous spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas coupled to a radio-frequency (rf) field. Measuring the transition probability into an outcoupled internal state, we map the system's dynamical response diagram versus the rf-pulse duration $t$ and Rabi frequency $\Omega_0$. For weak drives, we identify three regimes: an early-time regime where the transition probability takes off as $t^2$, an intermediate-time FGR regime, and a long-time non-perturbative regime. Beyond a threshold Rabi frequency, Rabi oscillations appear. Our results provide a blueprint for the applicability of linear response theory to the spectroscopy of quantum many-body systems.</description>
