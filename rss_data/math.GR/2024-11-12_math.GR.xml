      <title>Coboundary expansion inside Chevalley coset complex HDXs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent major results in property testing~\cite{BLM24,DDL24} and PCPs~\cite{BMV24} were unlocked by moving to high-dimensional expanders (HDXs) constructed from $\widetilde{C}_d$-type buildings, rather than the long-known $\widetilde{A}_d$-type ones. At the same time, these building quotient HDXs are not as easy to understand as the more elementary (and more symmetric/explicit) \emph{coset complex} HDXs constructed by Kaufman--Oppenheim~\cite{KO18} (of $A_d$-type) and O'Donnell--Pratt~\cite{OP22} (of $B_d$-, $C_d$-, $D_d$-type). Motivated by these considerations, we study the $B_3$-type generalization of a recent work of Kaufman--Oppenheim~\cite{KO21}, which showed that the $A_3$-type coset complex HDXs have good $1$-coboundary expansion in their links, and thus yield $2$-dimensional topological expanders.
  The crux of Kaufman--Oppenheim's proof of $1$-coboundary expansion was: (1)~identifying a group-theoretic result by Biss and Dasgupta~\cite{BD01} on small presentations for the $A_3$-unipotent group over~$\mathbb{F}_q$; (2)~``lifting'' it to an analogous result for an $A_3$-unipotent group over polynomial extensions~$\mathbb{F}_q[x]$.
  For our $B_3$-type generalization, the analogue of~(1) appears to not hold. We manage to circumvent this with a significantly more involved strategy: (1)~getting a computer-assisted proof of vanishing $1$-cohomology of $B_3$-type unipotent groups over~$\mathbb{F}_5$; (2)~developing significant new ``lifting'' technology to deduce the required quantitative $1$-cohomology results in $B_3$-type unipotent groups over $\mathbb{F}_{5^k}[x]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new geometric characterization for the spine of untwisted outer space of a right-angled Artin group, constructed by Charney, Stambaugh, and Vogtmann. We realize the spine as the natural simplicial complex associated with the category of spatial cube complexes, a new class of locally CAT(0) cube complexes with a simple definition in terms of hyperplane collapses.</description>

      <title>The joint translation spectrum and Manhattan manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study geometric versions of the Benoist limit cone and matrix joint spectrum, which we call the translation cone and the joint translation spectrum, respectively. These new notions allow us to generalize the study of embeddings into products of rank-one simple Lie groups and to compare group actions on different metric spaces, quasi-morphisms, Anosov representations and many other natural objects of study.
  We identify the joint translation spectrum with the image of the gradient function of a corresponding Manhattan manifold: a higher dimensional version of the well known and studied Manhattan curve. As a consequence we deduce many properties of the spectrum. For example we show that it is given by the closure of the set of all possible drift vectors associated to finitely supported, symmetric, admissible random walks on the associated group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose the study of the hyperbolic cover $\tilde{W}$ of an elliptic Weyl group. For $\tilde{c}$ a Coxeter transformation in $\tilde{W}$ we prove Hurwitz transitivity of the braid group on the set of reduced reflection factorizations of $\tilde{c}$, which then enables us to establish for a weighted projective line $\mathbb{X}$ of tubular type an order preserving bijection between the poset of thick subcategories of $\mathrm{coh}(\mathbb{X})$ generated by an exceptional sequence and the interval poset $[\mathrm{id}, \tilde{c}]$ ordered by the absolute order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of word maps on groups has been of deep interest in recent years. This survey focuses on the case of power maps on groups; $viz.$ the map $x\mapsto x^M$ for a group $G$, and an integer $M\geq 2$. Here, we accumulate various results on the subject and pose some questions.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap for products and a strong normal subgroup theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a general spectral gap theorem for actions of products of groups which may replace Kazhdan's property (T) in various situations. As a main application, we prove that a confined subgroup of an irreducible lattice in a higher rank semisimple Lie group is of finite index. This significantly strengthens the classical normal subgroup theorem of Margulis and removes the property (T) assumption from the recent counterpart result of Fraczyk and Gelander. We further show that any confined discrete subgroup of a higher rank semisimple Lie group satisfying a certain irreducibility condition is an irreducible lattice. This implies a variant of the Stuck-Zimmer conjecture under a strong irreducibility assumption of the action.</description>

      <title>Bounds on hyperbolic sphere packings: On a conjecture by Cohn and Zhao</title>

Abstract: We prove sphere packing density bounds in hyperbolic space (and more generally irreducible symmetric spaces of noncompact type), which were conjectured by Cohn and Zhao and generalize Euclidean bounds by Cohn and Elkies. We work within the Bowen-Radin framework of packing density and replace the use of the Poisson summation formula in the proof of the Euclidean bound by Cohn and Elkies with an analogous formula arising from methods used in the theory of mathematical quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Diophantine Geometry over Groups IX: Envelopes and Imaginaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:0909.0774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the ninth in a sequence on the structure of sets of solutions to systems of equations in free and hyperbolic groups, projections of such sets (Diophantine sets), and the structure of definable sets over free and hyperbolic groups. In the ninth paper we associate a Diophantine set with a definable set, and view it as the Diophantine envelope of the definable set. We use the envelope and duo limit groups that were used in proving stability of the theory of free and torsion-free hyperbolic groups [Se9], to study definable equivalence relations, and in particular, to classify imaginaries over these groups.</description>

      <title>The finite basis problem for endomorphism semirings of finite chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every semilattice $\mathcal{S}=(S,+)$, the set $\mathrm{End}(\mathcal{S})$ of its endomorphisms forms a semiring under point-wise addition and composition. We prove that the semiring of all endomorphisms of the 3-element chain has no finite identity basis. This, combined with earlier results by Dolinka (The finite basis problem for endomorphism semirings of finite semilattices with zero, Algebra Universalis 61, 441-448 (2009)), gives a complete solution to the finite basis problem for semirings of the form $\mathrm{End}(\mathcal{S})$ where $\mathcal{S}$ is a finite chain.</description>

      <title>Small values and forbidden values for the Fourier antidiagonal constant of a finite group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13998v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$, let ${\rm AD}(G)$ denote the Fourier norm of the antidiagonal in $G\times G$. It was shown recently by the author (IMRN, 2023) that ${\rm AD}(G)$ coincides with the amenability constant of the Fourier algebra of $G$, and is equal to the normalized sum of the cubes of character degrees of $G$. Motivated by a gap result for amenability constants due to Johnson (JLMS, 1994), we determine exactly which numbers in the interval $[1,2]$ arise as values of ${\rm AD}(G)$.
  As a by-product, we show that the set of values of ${\rm AD}(G)$ does not contain all its limit points. Some other calculations or bounds for ${\rm AD}(G)$ are given for familiar classes of finite groups. We also indicate a connection between ${\rm AD}(G)$ and the commuting probability of $G$, and use this to show that every finite group $G$ satisfying ${\rm AD}(G)&lt; \frac{61}{15}$ must be solvable; here the value $\frac{61}{15}$ is best possible.</description>

      <title>Locally approximating groups of homeomorphisms of manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact, connected manifold of positive dimension and let $\mathcal G\leq\textrm{Homeo}(M)$ be \emph{locally approximating} in the sense that for all open $U\subseteq M$ compactly contained in a single Euclidean chart of $M$, the subgroup $\mathcal G[U]$ consisting of elements of $\mathcal G$ supported in $U$ is dense in the full group of homeomorphisms supported in $U$. We prove that $\mathcal G$ interprets first order arithmetic, as well as a first order predicate that encodes membership in finitely generated subgroups of $\mathcal G$. As a consequence, we show that if $\mathcal G$ is not finitely generated, then no group elementarily equivalent to $\mathcal G$ can be finitely generated. We show that many finitely generated locally approximating groups of homeomorphisms $\mathcal G$ of a manifold are prime models of their theories, and give conditions that guarantee any finitely presented group $G$ that is elementarily equivalent to $\mathcal G$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal G$. We thus recover some results of Lasserre about the model theory of Thompson's groups $F$ and $T$. Finally, we obtain several action rigidity result for locally approximating groups of homeomorphisms. If $\mathcal G$ acts in a locally approximating way on a compact, connected manifold $M$ then the dimension of $M$ is uniquely determined by the elementary equivalence class of $\mathcal G$. Moreover, if $\dim M\leq 3$ then $M$ is uniquely determined up to homeomorphism. In for general closed smooth manifolds, the homotopy type of $M$ is uniquely determined. In this way, we obtain a generalization of a well-known result of Rubin.</description>

      <title>Bounded multiplier algebras arising from Fock representation associated to semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we attempt to introduce the "Multiplier algebra" associated to the Fock representation that arising from the left-cancellative semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ (denoted by $M(\mathcal{S})$) by adopting the concept of multiplier algebra of a $C^*$-algebra. Then, we investigate the basic properties and examples of the multiplier algebras. In order to make sense of multiplier algebra, we establish two key results of the multiplier algebras. We demonstrate that $M(\mathcal{S})$ is an unital Banach algebra if $\mathcal{S}$ is a left-cancellative semigroup. In the consideration, $G$ is a group, we demonstrate that $M(G)$ is a $C^*$-algebra.
  We illustrate that the associated multiplier algebras $M(\mathbb{Z}_{+}), M(\mathbb{Z}^2_+)$ are identified with respective Hardy algebras $H^{\infty}(\mathbb{D})$ and $H^{\infty}(\mathbb{D}^2)$ for $\mathcal{S}=\mathbb{Z}_{+}, \mathbb{Z}^2_{+}.$ Next, we discuss that multiplier algebra associated to the free semigroup $\mathcal{S}=\mathbb{F}^+_{n}$. We clearly show that the well-known non-commutative Hardy algebra $\mathbb{F}_{n}^{\infty}$ (introduced and thoroughly studied by G. Popescu) and the multiplier algebra $M(\mathbb{F}_{n}^+)$ are isometrically isomorphic.
  Finally, using the operator space technique, we have demonstrated an intriguing result that $M(\mathcal{S})$ is an operator algebra (specifically, thanks to celebrated Blecher-Ruan-Sinclair theorem).</description>

      <title>Enabling Efficient Equivariant Operations in the Fourier Basis via Gaunt Tensor Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing equivariant neural networks for the E(3) group plays an important role in modeling 3D data across real-world applications. Enforcing this equivariance primarily involves the tensor products of irreducible representations (irreps). However, the computational complexity of such operations increases significantly as higher-order tensors are used. In this work, we propose a systematic approach to substantially accelerate the computation of the tensor products of irreps. We mathematically connect the commonly used Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to the Gaunt coefficients, which are integrals of products of three spherical harmonics. Through Gaunt coefficients, the tensor product of irreps becomes equivalent to the multiplication between spherical functions represented by spherical harmonics. This perspective further allows us to change the basis for the equivariant operations from spherical harmonics to a 2D Fourier basis. Consequently, the multiplication between spherical functions represented by a 2D Fourier basis can be efficiently computed via the convolution theorem and Fast Fourier Transforms. This transformation reduces the complexity of full tensor products of irreps from $\mathcal{O}(L^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L^3)$, where $L$ is the max degree of irreps. Leveraging this approach, we introduce the Gaunt Tensor Product, which serves as a new method to construct efficient equivariant operations across different model architectures. Our experiments on the Open Catalyst Project and 3BPA datasets demonstrate both the increased efficiency and improved performance of our approach.</description>
