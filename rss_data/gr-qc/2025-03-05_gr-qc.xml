      <title>Entropy created when colliding particles fall into a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If two particles collide in the vicinity of a black hole horizon, their center of mass energy is practically unlimited, so another black hole with a large mass and thus entropy can be created. The resulting black hole can then merge with the original one. If the black hole is created very close to the horizon, its energy will be highly redshifted for an asymptotic observer. However, its entropy is not redshifted. We demonstrated that the newly created entropy can be higher than the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the final black hole, though we neglect that a certain amount of energy can escape to infinity, carrying away part of the entropy produced in the process. This is a counter-example to the statement that the black hole thermal entropy counts all the states inside the black hole. Unlike similar examples, this colliding process does not involve exotic matter, alternative theories of gravity, nor artificial ad hoc gluing of two different spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave cosmology in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (EsGB) gravity, we systematically study gravitational waves (GWs), first produced by remote compact astrophysical sources and then propagating through the flat homogeneous and isotropic Universe at cosmic distances before arriving at detectors. Assuming that the speed $c_T$ of the spin-2 graviton is the same as that of photons, we find explicitly the stability conditions of the theory and then obtain the severest observational constraint found so far. In particular, all these conditions and constraints are satisfied, provided that $0 \leq \alpha\dot{f}(\phi_0) \lesssim 8.97 \times 10^{-24}$ (km), where $\alpha{f}(\phi)$ denotes the coupling strength between the scalar field $\phi$ and the Gauss-Bonnet term, an over-dot represents the derivative with respect to the cosmic time, and $\phi_0$ is the present value of $\phi$. The trajectories for both spin-2 and spin-0 gravitons and the amplitudes of GWs along the trajectories are explicitly obtained. The amplitude of a spin-2 GW is practically indistinguishable from that of GR, while the spin-0 GWs remain almost constant during radiation- and matter-dominated epochs, and in the dark energy-dominated epoch it is proportional to the physical distance between the source and the observer. A careful analysis shows that the latter is due to the assumption $c_T = 1$. When $c_T \not= 1$ to the extent that is consistent with the stability conditions and observational constraints, the above behavior disappears.</description>

      <title>Time operator from parametrization invariance and implications for cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the parametrization invariance of cosmological Lagrangians and their equivalence to systems describing the motion of particles in curved backgrounds, we identify the phase space analogue of the notion of proper time. We define the corresponding quantum operator, which results in being canonically conjugate to that of the vanishing Hamiltonian. In the context of particle dynamics, this leads to an uncertainty relation of the form $\Delta E_0 \,\Delta T \geq \hbar$, where $E_0$ is the rest energy of the particle. By studying the non-relativistic limit, we show that the action of the operator reduces to multiplication by the classical time coordinate. Finally, we derive the generic expression for the introduced time variable in the cosmological setting.</description>

      <title>Kiselev black strings: the charged rotating solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of a charged rotating black string immersed in a Kiselev anisotropic fluid in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. The Einstein-Maxwell equations with an anisotropic stress-energy tensor and cosmological constant are analyzed and solved exactly. In this work, we calculate the Kretschmann scalar, obtaining a consistent result that agrees with the existing literature in the absence of charge and fluid. The rotating solution is obtained by applying a coordinate transformation on time and angular coordinates. The event horizon associated with specific values of the equation of state parameter $w_q$ is studied. The results show an important influence of the fluid parameters $N_{q}$ and $w_{q}$, the charge parameter $Q$, and the rotation parameter $a$ on the size of the black string horizon. In addition, we determine the conditions for the existence of closed timelike curves (CTCs) and compute the conserved charges, such as mass, angular momentum, and electric charge of the black string. Utilizing the Klein-Gordon equation, we employ the quantum particle tunneling approach to obtain the probability of charged scalar particles tunneling across the event horizon. We obtain the correspondent Hawking temperature as a consequence. Furthermore, we examine the thermodynamic properties, including entropy and heat capacity, to assess the effects of the quintessence field and charge on the black string. The results include particular cases such as the Lemos black string, providing a broader view of black string configurations in AdS spacetime.</description>

      <title>Study of Null Geodesics and their Stability in Horndeski Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the motion of particles in the background of a scalar-tensor theory of gravity in which the scalar field is kinetically coupled to the Einstein tensor and we present the null geodesic structure for asymptotically flat, AdS, and dS Horndeski black holes, studying the effect of the cosmological constant on the orbits. Also, we consider three classical test of the gravity in the solar system, such as, the bending of the light, the gravitational redshift, and the Shapiro time delay in order to constraint the coupling parameters of the scalar field to gravity. Calculating the Lyapunov exponent we explore the stability of these geodesics for various values of the cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>The impact of local noise recorded at the ET candidate sites on the signal to noise ratio of CBC gravitational wave signals for the ET triangle configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an evaluation of how site dependent noise can affect the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals in the future 3rd generation gravitational wave (GW) detector Einstein Telescope (ET). The design of ET is currently pushing the scientific community to study its scientific potential with respect to known, and possibly unexpected, GW signals using its design sensitivity curves. However, local ambient noise may have an impact on the ET sensitivity at low frequency and therefore affect the SNR of CBC signals at low frequency. Therefore, we study the impact of ambient noise on the ET sensitivity curve at the two sites candidate to host ET - Sardinia, in Italy, and the Euregio Meuse-Rhine (EMR) at the Netherlands-Belgium border - and infer the impact on the ET sensitivity curve and how the SNR of CBC signals at low frequencies is affected. We find that Sardinia shows results which are on par, if not better, than the design case. On the other hand, ambient noise for the current EMR sensitivity curve in Terziet causes a higher degradation of the SNR performances.</description>

      <title>Shadows aspect of rotating black holes in the Einstein-AdS SU(N)-nonlinear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of the supermassive black holes M87* and Sgr A* by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have opened new avenues for testing gravity theories through black hole shadow observables. These observations offer a means to distinguish between general relativity and modified gravity theories while providing insights into the astrophysical properties of the observed black holes. In this work, we investigate photon orbits and shadow characteristics of rotating black holes within the Einstein-$\mathrm{SU(N)}$ nonlinear sigma model. We first analyze the static, spherically symmetric black hole solution, focusing on its asymptotically Anti-de Sitter behavior and causal structure. The Modified Newman-Janis Algorithm is then applied to obtain the rotating counterpart, followed by an examination of its geometric properties, ergoregions, and causal structure. Utilizing the Lagrangian formalism, we derive the equations of motion for photons and study the resulting black hole shadow on the celestial plane. We explore the dependence of the shadow's size and shape on the black hole parameters $K$ and $N$, imposing constraints using EHT observational data for M87* and Sgr A*. Finally, we analyze the black hole's evaporation rate under different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Residual test to search for microlensing signatures in strongly lensed gravitational wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a gravitational wave signal encounters a massive object, such as a galaxy or galaxy cluster, it undergoes strong gravitational lensing, producing multiple copies of the original signal. These strongly lensed signals exhibit identical waveform morphology in the frequency domain, allowing analysis without the need for complex lens models. However, stellar fields and dark matter substructures within the galactic lens introduce microlensing effects that alter individual signal morphologies. Identifying these microlensing signatures is computationally challenging within Bayesian frameworks. In this study, we propose a novel residual test to efficiently search for microlensing signatures by leveraging the fact that current Bayesian inference pipelines are optimized solely for the strong lensing hypothesis. Using cross-correlation techniques, we investigate the microlensing-induced deviations from the strong hypothesis, which are imprinted in the residuals. Our simulated signals from realistic microlensing populations reveal that while most events exhibit small mismatches, a fraction exhibit significant deviations. We find that 31% (55%) and 45% (65%) of microlensed events with mismatch &gt; 0.03 and &gt; 0.1, respectively, can be discerned with O4 (O5) detector sensitivities, which demonstrates that high-mismatch events are more likely to be identified as microlensed. Including all events from a realistic population, 12% (21.5%) are identifiable with O4 (O5) sensitivity using our approach.</description>

      <title>Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit: a perspective from local geometrical invariants and matter distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the logarithmic divergence of the deflection angle in the strong deflection limit in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. We propose a novel analytical framework that connects its physical origin to local, coordinate-invariant geometric quantities and properties of the matter distributions. Conventional approaches describe the divergence rate, characterized by the coefficient $\bar{a}$, in terms of coordinate-dependent metric functions. In contrast, our method relates $\bar{a}$ to the components of the Einstein tensor in an orthonormal tetrad adapted to the spacetime symmetry. By employing the Einstein equations, we express $\bar{a}$ in terms of the local values of energy density $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}$ and tangential pressure $\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}$ at the photon sphere with an areal radius $R_{\mathrm{m}}$: \begin{align*} \bar{a}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-8\pi R_{\mathrm{m}}^2\left(\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}\right)}}. \end{align*} This formula clearly shows that, through the combination $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}$, the strong field limit coefficient $\bar{a}$ depends on the local matter distribution. In particular, if the matter fields satisfy $\rho+\Pi=0$, the universal result $\bar{a}=1$ emerges. This finding not only accounts for the behavior observed in the Schwarzschild spacetime but also provides a unified description applicable to a variety of spacetimes, including certain naked singularities and wormholes supported by a massless scalar field. Furthermore, these local properties are reflected in the frequencies of quasinormal modes, suggesting a profound connection between strong gravitational lensing and the dynamical response of gravitational wave signals. Our framework, independent of any specific gravitational theory, serves as a universal tool for testing gravitational theories and interpreting astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Curled orbit and epicyclic oscillation of charged particles around the weakly magnetized black hole in the presence of Lorentz violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the motion of charged particles around the weakly magnetized Schwarzschild-like bumblebee black hole which has Lorentz symmetry violation. Charged particles have curled orbits around the black hole which can only appear in the presence of magnetic field. We investigate the effect of Lorentz violation factor on the curled orbit for both the case with and without cosmological constant. Furthermore, we investigate the harmonic oscillation behavior of the charged particles around the stable circular orbit and relate it to the results of twin high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in microquasars. Our results not only point out the possibility for the appearance of Lorentz violation near the microquasars but also provide the constraints on the Lorentz violating parameters. As the black hole shadow for Schwarzschild-like bumblebee black hole degenerates to the ordinary Schwarzschild black hole, the constraints we obtained using the method of quasi-period oscillation is crucial for further searching for the imprint of Lorentz symmetry violation in our universe.</description>

      <title>Testing the behaviour of exotic matter near wormhole throat in $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I propose a static wormhole model within modified $f(R,T)$ gravity where $f(R,T)=R+2\lambda T$. The wormhole solutions have been evolved in four cases: three different shape function along with redshift $\phi=\frac{\phi_0}{r}$ and a variable EoS parameter $\omega(r)$ with constant redshift function. I also have explored the energy conditions and the behaviour of exotic matter within the wormhole in all scenarios. Presence of exotic matter violates necessary energy conditions near wormhole throat which gives constraint on modified gravity parameter $\lambda$ in all different cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that if the universe started as a vacuum fluctuation rather than from a singular Big Bang state, the universe must have a late-time cosmic acceleration. This is required by a ``cosmological sum rule'' derived using the Schwarzian form of the Friedmann equations. We discuss possible connections to conformal and M\"obius transformations, and also compute that the best fit present cosmic data is consistent with the necessary crossing of the Schwarzian through zero having occurred (while it would not yet have happened in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology).</description>

      <title>Late Time Cosmic Acceleration in Modified Gravity and Gauss-Bonnet Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis focuses on late-time cosmic acceleration within modified theories of gravity, using various observational data sets and statistical analysis. The Universe is assumed to be spatially homogeneous and isotropic and is described by the Friedmann Lema\^{i}tre Robertson Walker metric. The late-time acceleration of the Universe has posed a significant challenge to contemporary cosmology. General relativity addresses this by introducing the cosmological constant, forming the basis of the standard cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM). However, this model has limitations, leading cosmologists to explore alternative explanations for late-time acceleration. These alternatives range from models involving a dynamic dark fluid known as dark energy, to large-scale modifications of gravitational interaction, known as modified gravity. The formulation of general relativity fundamentally changed our understanding of gravitation, redefining gravity as a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime rather than a force as described by Newton. Despite its success, general relativity has shown incompatibilities with observations, necessitating the introduction of dark matter and dark energy....</description>

      <title>Electric Penrose process and collisions of particles near five-dimensional weakly charged Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The particle dynamics and the electric Penrose process for the five-dimensional weakly charged Schwarzschild black hole are studied. Firstly, the horizon structure and the effective potential for the test particle are explored. The radial profile of the effective potential is plotted for different values of the BH charge. Then, we studied energy efficiency using the conservation laws for energy, angular momentum, and charge of particles. The appropriate plots were obtained and compared with the results for the four-dimensional Schwarzschild BH. Moreover, we obtained the constraints on mass and charge of black hole to accelerate protons of different energies ($1$-$10^{9}$ GeV). Finally, collisions of electrically charged particles near the horizon of the five-dimensional Schwarzschild BH are studied. We demonstrated the radial dependence of the center of mass energy for different values of the angular momentum and charge of the particles together with the BH charge.</description>

      <title>Quantum representation of reduced twisted geometry in loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the quantum representation of the algebra among reduced twisted geometries (with respect to the Gauss constraint) is constructed in the gauge invariant Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity. It is shown that the reduced twisted geometric variables not only describe the spatial discrete geometry more clearly, but also form a simple Poisson algebra which is analogous to that in quantum mechanics. By regularizing the reduced twisted geometric variables properly, the fundamental algebra of reduced twisted geometry is established, with the gauge invariant Hilbert space in loop quantum gravity as the corresponding quantum representation space. This quantum representation also leads to fundamental operators associated with reduced twisted geometry. Based on these fundamental operators, a new type of extrinsic curvature operator is constructed in loop quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Finite collisionless accretion disks in the Kerr spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct general-relativistic kinetic models of stationary finite accretion disks in the Kerr spacetime. Our analysis generalizes a previous model of razor-thin accretion disks of collisionless gas in the Kerr spacetime, extending to infinity in the equatorial plane. We investigate monoenergetic configurations, as well as models characterized by Maxwell-J\"{u}ttner type distributions at the outer edge of the disk. In both cases, we consider particles moving along orbits reaching the outer boundary of the disk, either plunging into the black hole, or scattered by the centrifugal barrier. For Maxwell-J\"{u}ttner models, the location of the outer disk boundary affects the mass and angular momentum accretion rates at a similar order of magnitude as the temperature parameter in the assumed Maxwell-J\"{u}ttner distribution.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Einstein-Maxwell dilaton-axion gravity from the observed quasi-periodic oscillations in black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String-inspired models are often believed to provide an interesting framework for quantum gravity and force unification with promising prospects to resolve issues like dark matter and dark energy which cannot be satisfactorily incorporated within the framework of general relativity (GR). The goal of the present work is to investigate the role of the Einstein-Maxwell dilaton-axion (EMDA) gravity arising in the low energy effective action of the heterotic string theory in explaining astrophysical observations, in particular, the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) observed in the power spectrum of black holes. EMDA gravity has interesting cosmological implications and hence it is worthwhile to explore the footprints of such a theory in available astrophysical observations. This requires one to study the stationary, axi-symmetric black hole solution in EMDA gravity, which corresponds to the Kerr-Sen spacetime. Such black holes are endowed with a dilatonic charge while the rotation is sourced from the axionic field. We investigate the orbital and epicyclic frequencies of matter rotating in the Kerr-Sen spacetime and consider eleven well-studied QPO models in this work. We compare the model dependent QPO frequencies with the available observations of five BH sources, namely, XTE J1550-564, GRS 1915+105, H 143+322, GRO J1655-40 and Sgr A*. Our analysis provides constrains on the spins of the aforesaid black holes which when compared with previous estimates enables us to understand the observationally favored QPO models for each of these sources. Further, from the current data the EMDA scenario cannot be ruled out in favor of general relativity. We comment on the implications and limitations of our finding and how the present constrains compare with the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Once more about radiation from uniformly accelerating charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an electric charge uniformly accelerating along $x$ direction and moving with constant velocity along $y$ direction. We show that in the co-accelerating along $x$ direction Rinder's frame this charge creates non-zero Poynting vector, which, however, does not lead to a non-vanishing flux through an infinitely distant surface. Furthermore, we show that in the laboratory Minkowski frame such a charge creates a stress energy flux that does not vanish at infinity. We interpret these observations as that while the Rindler's frame corresponds to the static zone around the charge, the Minkowski frame does contain the wave zone. We give detailed calculations and explanations concluding that uniformly accelerating charge does radiate</description>

      <title>Curvature Perturbations from First-Order Phase Transitions: Implications to Black Holes and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a covariant formalism to study the evolution of cosmological perturbations during a first-order phase transition, addressing in particular their gauge dependence that have been overlooked so far. Our results reveal that non-covariant treatments employed in previous studies can substantially overestimate the production of primordial black holes and scalar-induced gravitational waves. Once gauge dependencies are properly accounted for, we find that both effects occur at significantly lower levels than previously estimated.</description>

      <title>Schwinger Current in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study classical background electric fields and the Schwinger effect in de Sitter space. We show that having a constant electric field in de Sitter requires the photon to have a tachyonic mass proportional to the Hubble scale. This has physical implications for the induced Schwinger current which affect its IR behaviour. To study this we recompute the Schwinger current in de Sitter space for charged fermions and minimally coupled scalars imposing a physically consistent renormalization condition. We find a finite and positive Schwinger current even in the massless limit. This is in contrast to previous calculations in the literature which found a negative IR divergence. We also obtain the first result of the Schwinger current for a non-minimally coupled scalar, including for a conformally coupled scalar which we find has very similar behaviour to the fermion current. Our results may have physical implications for both magnetogenesis and inflationary dark matter production.</description>

      <title>Cuscuton Bounce Beyond the Linear Regime: Bispectrum and Strong Coupling Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cuscuton Gravity is characterized as a scalar field that can be added to general relativity without introducing any new dynamical degrees of freedom on a cosmological background. Yet, it modifies gravity such that spacetime singularities can be avoided. This has led to the Cuscuton bounce, a nonsingular cosmology that has been shown to be linearly stable, which is a rare feat. Upon introducing mechanisms known to generate a near-scale-invariant power spectrum of isocurvature perturbations in the prebounce contracting phase, we perform an extensive linear analysis of all scalar perturbations as they evolve through the Cuscuton bounce, both analytically and numerically. Then, after deriving the third-order perturbed action for our theory, we compare the magnitude of its terms (on shell) to those in the second-order action. We show that perturbativity is maintained in the infrared throughout the evolution, including through the bounce. In the ultraviolet, we show that a hierarchy of scales is maintained, with the strong coupling scale well above the relevant background energy scale at all times. We reconfirm these results by computing the three-point functions in various limits and demonstrate that the models do not have any strong coupling problems and furthermore that there is negligible non-Gaussianities on observable scales. Consequently, the primary potential source of observable non-Gaussianities may only arise from the conversion of isocurvature perturbations to curvature perturbations. The whole scenario is thus a robust, stable, weakly coupled nonsingular cosmological model, consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Siren: Astrophysical Gravitational-Wave Background Measurements of the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from individually resolved compact object mergers can be used as standard sirens, offering a novel self-calibrating precision probe of cosmology. While the standard siren method has been well-explored, the gravitational-wave background arising from unresolved mergers offers a novel alternative to probing cosmology. We demonstrate that the combination of resolved binary black hole mergers with the unresolved signals composing the stochastic gravitational-wave background can be used to measure cosmological parameters, including the Hubble constant, $H_0$. We apply this ``stochastic siren'' method to existing gravitational-wave data and find that including the current non-detection of the background increases the accuracy at which $H_0$ can be measured, relative to using resolved mergers alone. We also provide projections for upcoming detectors to highlight their ability to probe cosmology with the background. With the anticipated detection of the astrophysical gravitational-wave background, the stochastic siren approach can be expected to improve future standard siren cosmological measurements.</description>

      <title>A common origin of two accelerating universes: inflation and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a quantum theory of inflaton and its decay product of various gauge boson pairs to investigate the preheating towards thermalized universe. The inflaton decay into gauge-boson pairs is shown to be inevitably accompanied by tachyon-mass-like correction to inflation potential that ultimately leads to an inflaton escape out of trapped local potential minimum towards the field infinity. This gives rise to a conversion mechanism of early inflationary acceleration to a quintessence dark energy acceleration at late stages of cosmic evolution. The success of the escape depends on how standard particles are incorporated into a scheme of extended Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity. New types of super-radiance mechanism that enhance the ending of preheating are identified and compared with the Dicke model.</description>

      <title>Towards $\mathcal{N}=2$ higher-spin supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the superfield formulation of $\mathcal{N}=2$ higher-spin supergravity theory in harmonic superspace. The analysis of both the hypermultiplet higher-spin supersymmetries and conformal supersymmetries is performed. The analytic superspace gauging of these symmetries gives rise to a set of unconstrained analytical prepotentials describing $\mathcal{N}=2$ higher-spin off-shell supermultiplets. This procedure naturally yields cubic interaction vertices of $\mathcal{N}=2$ higher spins with the hypermultiplet. Based on these results, the consistent interaction of an infinite tower of $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal higher spins with hypermultiplet is presented. Proceeding from this model, a method to construct a consistent interacting theory of $\mathcal{N}=2$ higher-spin supergravity by making use of the conformal compensators is proposed.</description>

      <title>Universal Density and Velocity Distributions of Dark Matter around Massive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of dark matter at the galactic center, crucial for indirect searches, remains uncertain. In particular, in the vicinity of the massive black hole in the center of a galaxy where indirect signals may be stronger, the density of a dark matter spike may undergo redistribution. Here we calculate the density surrounding Schwarzschild black holes that originate from diverse initial dark halos and estimate the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. By employing a series of Hernquist and power-law initial dark halos, we obtain a fitting formula between dark matter spikes and black hole masses. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is utilized to approximate the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. As an application, taking into account dark matter self-annihilation, we assess the relic densities of dark matter spikes around black holes. We find that the relic spikes for s-wave annihilation are higher than p-wave annihilation, and the relic densities obtained for p-wave annihilation depend on the velocity distribution, varying significantly with distance. The findings shall further provide useful insights for multi-messenger dark matter detections in the future.</description>

      <title>High-frequency magnetic response measurement of test mass with a fluxgate magnetometer for gravitational wave detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For space-borne gravitational wave detectors,such as LISA and TianQin ,the disturbance caused by the coupling of test masses and the external magnetic fields is one of the main sources of the residual acceleration noise. Although the detection frequency band is from 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz, magnetic fields with frequencies higher than 1 Hz can still contribute to the noise through down conversion effect. Therefore, it is necessary to measure the AC magnetic susceptibility or magnetic response of the test mass at higher frequency for the evaluation of the magnetic noise. In this work, we propose a magnetic field response measurement method by directly probing the induced magnetic field of the test mass placed in a spatially uniform magnetic field. The frequency can be measured up to 1500 Hz, satisfying the requirement of space-borne gravitational wave detection.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave probes of particle dark matter: a review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various theories of dark matter predict distinctive astrophysical signatures in gravitational-wave sources that could be observed by ground- and space-based laser interferometers. Different candidates-including axions, dark photons, macroscopic dark matter, WIMPs, and dark-matter spikes-may appear in interferometer data via their coupling to gravity or the Standard Model, altering the measured gravitational-wave strain in distinct ways. Despite their differences, these candidates share two key features: (1) they can be probed through their effects on gravitational waves from inspiraling compact objects, isolated black holes, and neutron stars, or via direct interactions with detectors, and (2) their signatures likely persist far longer than the seconds-long mergers detected today, necessitating new data analysis methods beyond matched filtering. This review outlines these dark matter candidates, their observational signatures, and approaches for their detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a minimal setup within the framework of Horndeski gravity that can describe a nonpathological Genesis scenario. Our setup allows for a fully stable transition to the kination epoch, during which General Relativity (GR) is restored. This Genesis scenario circumvents the no-go theorem at the cost of encountering the risk of strong coupling in the past. Interestingly, our scenario admits two different regimes for the background solution for Hubble parameter at the Genesis stage: power-law behavior and manifestly non-power-law behavior. We explicitly show that, in both regimes, our model remains within unitarity bounds. In most cases, the tensor spectrum is blue-tilted. Then, we adopt a mechanism with a spectator field that allows for a red-tilted scalar power spectrum. We also suggest a deformation of the model that enables us to achieve sufficiently small values for the r ratio. Finally, we discuss the geodesic (in)completeness of the current model.</description>

      <title>The 18-cycle in Bianchi $VI_{-1/9}^{^{*}}$: Combined Linear Local Passage and Numerical Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we find an example for a periodic heteroclinic chain in Bianchi $VI_{-1/9}^{^{*}}$ that allows Takens Linearization at all base points. It turns out to be a "18-cycle'', i.e. involving a heteroclinic chain of 18 different base points at the Kasner circle. We then show that the combined cinear local passage at the 18-cycle is a contraction. This qualifies the 18-cycle as a candidate for proving the first rigorous convergence theorem in Bianchi $VI_{-1/9}^{^{*}}$.
  For the numerical simulation of solutions that follow such heteroclinic cycles, we use a variable-step, variable-order (VSVO) Adams-Bashforth-Moulton PECE solver in Matlab. We conclude with a discussion on how to proceed further in studying Bianchi cosmologies, and also discuss directions for future research in inhomogeneous (PDE-) cosmological models. This puts our results in a broader perspective. The appendix contains symbolic and computations done by Mathematica for examples discussed throughout the text.</description>

      <title>Conservative Dynamics of Relativistic Binaries Beyond Einstein Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the conservative dynamics of spinless compact objects in a general effective theory of gravity which includes a metric and an arbitrary number of scalar fields, through $\mathcal{O}(G^{3})$. Departures from Einstein gravity, which preserve general coordinate and local Lorentz invariance, are characterized by higher-derivative terms in a Lagrangian whose coupling constants scale as powers of a ``new-physics'' length scale, $\ell$. For a purely metric theory we compute the contributions from the the leading and subleading higher-curvature curvature corrections. In four dimensions these are cubic and quartic curvature terms, i.e. orders $\ell^4$ and $\ell^6$. We also study a general multi-scalar-tensor theory of gravity to order $\ell^{4}$, which includes both Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) and dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) higher-order couplings. Specifically, we compute the radial action in a post-Minkowskian approximation for scattering orbits, to two-loop order. The result encodes the fully relativistic dynamics of the compact objects, and serves as a generating function for gauge-invariant orbital observables for both bound and unbound binary systems. Where overlapping post-Newtonian results are available, we've verified agreement.</description>

      <title>A New $\sim 5\sigma$ Tension at Characteristic Redshift from DESI DR1 and DES-SN5YR observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a model-independent reconstruction of the angular diameter distance ($D_{A}$) using the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) framework with DESI-DR1 BAO and DES-SN5YR datasets. We calibrate the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch $r_d$ to the Planck best-fit value, ensuring consistency with early-universe physics. With the reconstructed $D_A$ at two key redshifts, $z\sim 1.63$ (where $D_{A}^{\prime} =0$) and at $z\sim 0.512$ (where $D_{A}^{\prime} = D_{A}$), we derive the expansion rate of the Universe $H(z)$ at these redshifts. Our findings reveal that at $z\sim 1.63$, the $H(z)$ is fully consistent with the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM prediction, confirming no new physics at that redshift. However, at $z \sim 0.512$, the derived $H(z)$ shows a more than $5\sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM prediction, suggesting a possible breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM model as constrained by Planck-2018 at this lower redshift. This emerging $\sim 5\sigma$ tension at $z\sim 0.512$, distinct from the existing ``Hubble Tension'', may signal the first strong evidence for new physics at low redshifts.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the effect of the population model uncertainty on the strong lensing Bayes factor using nonparametric methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong lensing of gravitational waves can produce several detectable images as repeated events in the upcoming observing runs, which can be detected with the posterior overlap analysis (Bayes factor). The choice of the binary black hole population plays an important role in the analysis as two gravitational-wave events could be similar either because of lensing or astrophysical coincidence. In this study, we investigate the biases induced by different population models on the Bayes factor. We build up a mock catalog of gravitational-wave events following a benchmark population and reconstruct it using both nonparametric and parametric methods. Using these reconstructions, we compute the Bayes factor for lensed pair events by utilizing both models and compare the results with a benchmark model. We show that the use of a nonparametric population model gives a smaller bias than parametric population models. Therefore, our study demonstrates the importance of choosing a sufficiently agnostic population model for strong lensing analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 2023 second edition of a 2006 encyclopedia article on mathematical aspects of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes (QFTCST). Section-titles (with new sections indicated with stars) are: Introduction and preliminaries, Construction of a $*$-algebra for a real linear scalar field on globally hyperbolic spacetimes and some general theorems, *More about (quasifree) Hadamard states, Particle creation and the limitations of the particle concept, Theory of the stress-energy tensor, *More about the intersection of QFTCST with AQFT and the Fewster-Verch No-Go Theorem, Hawking and Unruh effects, *More about (classical and) quantum fields on black hole backgrounds, Non-globally hyperbolic spacetimes and the time-machine question, *More about QFT on non-globally hyperbolic spacetimes, Other related topics and some warnings. The article contains many references. It also includes a review of, and also compares and contrasts, recent results on the implications of QFTCST for the question of the instability of three sorts of Cauchy horizon -- first those inside black holes such as especially Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter and Kerr-de Sitter, second the compactly generated Cauchy horizons of spacetimes in which time-machines get manufactured, and third the Cauchy horizon of the spacetime which is believed to describe evaporating black holes and which underlies (one version of) the black hole information-loss puzzle.</description>

      <title>Exploring the cosmological degeneracy between decaying dark matter model and viscous $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of a homogeneous and isotropic universe, we consider the degeneracy condition at the background level between two scenarios in which processes out of equilibrium are possible; this consideration allows us to deviate from the perfect fluid description, and in this case bulk viscosity represents a viable candidate to describe entirely such effects. The cosmological model describing an unstable dark matter sector is mapped into a slight modification of the $\Lambda$CDM model characterized by a viscous dark matter sector; under this consideration our description does not depend on a specific formulation of viscous effects and these can be fully reconstructed and characterized by the parameter that determines the decay ratio of dark matter. However, in this new scenario the cosmic expansion is influenced by the viscous pressure and the dark energy sector given by the cosmological constant is translated into a dynamical one. As a consequence of our formulation, the test against observations of the model indicates consistency with quintessence dark energy, but the crossing of the phantom divide can be accessible.</description>

      <title>On the KG-constrained Bekenstein's disformal transformation of the Einstein-Hilbert action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by an inclination for symmetry and possible extension of the General Theory of Relativity within the framework of Scalar Theory, we investigate the Bekenstein's disformal transformation of the Einstein-Hilbert action. Owing to the complicated combinations of second order metric derivatives encoded in the Ricci scalar of the action, such a transformation yields an unwieldy expression. To ``tame'' the transformed action, we exploit the Klein-Gordon (KG) conformal-disformal constraint previously discovered in the study of the invariance of the massless Klein-Gordon equation under disformal transformation. The result upon its application is a surprisingly much more concise and simple action in four spacetime dimensions containing three out of four sub-Lagrangians in the Horndeski action, and three beyond-Horndeski terms. The latter group of terms may be attributed to the kinetic-{term} dependence of the conformal and disformal factors in the Bekenstein's disformal transformation. Going down to three dimensions, we find a relatively simpler resulting action but the signature of the three ``extraneous'' terms remains. Lastly, in two dimensions, we find an invariant action consistent with its topological nature in these dimensions.</description>

      <title>Doppler correlation-driven vetoes for the Frequency Hough analysis in continuous gravitational-wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19420v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an improved method for vetoing candidates of continuous gravitational-wave sources during all-sky searches utilizing the Frequency Hough pipeline. This approach leverages linear correlations between source parameters induced by the Earth Doppler effect, which can be effectively identified through the Hough Transform. Candidates that do not align with these patterns are considered spurious and can thus be vetoed, enhancing the depth and statistical significance of follow-up analyses. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the method calibration, which intrinsically linked to the total duration of the observing run. On average, the procedure successfully vetoes $56\%$ of candidates. To assess the method performance, we conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation injecting fake continuous-wave signals into data from the third observing run of the LIGO detectors. This analysis allowed us to infer strain amplitude upper limits at a $90\%$ confidence level. We found that the optimal sensitivity is $h_0^{90\%} = 3.62^{+0.23}_{-0.22}\times 10^{-26}$ in the [128, 200] Hz band, which is within the most sensible frequency band of the LIGO detectors.</description>

      <title>New rotating Lorentzian wormhole spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A rotating version of a known static, spherically symmetric, zero Ricci scalar Lorentzian wormhole is constructed. It turns out that for this given non-rotating geometry, the standard Newman-Janis algorithm does not produce a rotating wormhole and, therefore, the method pioneered by Azreg-A\"inou has to be used. The rotating spacetime thus obtained is shown to be regular with wormhole features, though it is no longer a $R=0$ spacetime. The required matter is found to violate the energy conditions, as expected. A few other characteristic properties of this new rotating spacetime are mentioned. Finally, we calculate the shadow for this geometry and discuss its features {\em vis-a-vis} the Kerr geometry and available event horizon telescope observations.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormholes with Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09236v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that a spherically symmetric traversable wormhole solution of the Einstein field equations can be supported by minimally coupled self-interacting scalar field which allows a spontaneous symmetry breaking of the field around the wormhole throat. We study two cases : (i) the phantom wormhole solution of Bronnikov and (ii) a generalized Kiselev wormhole. We study the property of radial null geodesics and show that the metric can describe either a two-way or a one-way traversable wormhole depending on certain parameter ranges. The scalar field exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking within the coordinate range where a wormhole throat forms and helps one suggest that spontaneous symmetry breaking may act as a threshold for wormhole throat formation. We also compute the radius of the photon sphere, the Lyapunov exponent, the shadow radius, and the innermost stable circular orbits for the geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between quantum theory and gravity by exploring gravitational lensing and Einstein ring images in a weak gravitational field induced by a mass source in spatial quantum superposition. We analyze a quantum massless scalar field propagating in two distinct models of gravity: the first quantized Newtonian gravity (QG) model, which generates quantum entanglement between the mass source and other systems, and the Schr\"odinger-Newton (SN) gravity model, which does not produce entanglement. Visualizing the two-point correlation function of the scalar field, we find that the QG model produces a composition of multiple Einstein rings, reflecting the spatial superposition of the mass source. By contrast, the SN model yields a single deformed ring image, representing a classical spacetime configuration. Furthermore, we introduce a specific quantity named the which-path information indicator and visualize its image. The QG model again reveals multiple Einstein rings, while the image intensity in the SN model notably vanishes. Our findings provide a visual approach to witness gravity-induced entanglement through distinct features in Einstein ring images. This study advances our understanding of quantum effects in general relativistic contexts and establishes a foundation for future studies of other relativistic phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent proposals suggested quantum clock interferometry for tests of the Einstein equivalence principle. However, atom interferometric models often include relativistic effects only in an ad hoc fashion. Here, instead, we start from the multi-particle nature of quantum-delocalizable atoms in curved spacetime and generalize the special-relativistic center of mass (COM) and relative coordinates that have previously been studied for Minkowski spacetime to obtain the light-matter dynamics in curved spacetime. In particular, for a local Schwarzschild observer located at the surface of the Earth using Fermi-Walker coordinates, we find gravitational correction terms for the Poincar\'e symmetry generators and use them to derive general relativistic COM and relative coordinates. In these coordinates we obtain the Hamiltonian of a fully first-quantized two-particle atom interacting with the electromagnetic field in curved spacetime that naturally incorporates special and general relativistic effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a newly proposed fluid description of dark energy within the framework of the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe. Our primary objective is to explore the theoretical foundation of the proposed equation of state by establishing its correspondence with well-known scalar field models such as quintessence, k-essence, and DBI-essence. Through this correspondence, we reconstruct key field parameters, including the scalar field $\phi$ and scalar potential $V(\phi)$, and analyze their evolutionary behavior across cosmic time. The study also evaluates the model's physical consistency and cosmological implications by examining fundamental energy conditions - Null Energy Condition (NEC), Dominant Energy Condition (DEC), and Strong Energy Condition (SEC). Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive stability analysis to ensure the robustness of the model and investigate its thermodynamic properties, including possible phase transitions using entropy and Gibbs free energy. To assess the observational viability of the model, we compare its predictions against recent datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), and Supernova Type Ia from the Pantheon+SH0ES compilation and Union 2.1, as well as recent DESI and DESY5 data. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed fluid model aligns well with observational constraints, reproduces the late-time acceleration of the universe, and offers a compelling alternative to the standard $\Lambda$-CDM model while maintaining consistency with current data.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic strings play a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of the fundamental structure and evolution of the universe, unifying our knowledge of cosmology, and potentially unveiling new physical laws and phenomena. The advent and operation of space-based detectors provide an important opportunity for detecting stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB) generated by cosmic strings. However, the intricate nature of SGWB poses a formidable challenge in distinguishing its signal from the complex noise by some traditional methods. Therefore, we attempt to identify SGWB based on machine learning. Our findings show that the joint detection of LISA and Taiji significantly outperforms individual detectors, and even in the presence of numerous low signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) signals, the identification accuracy remains exceptionally high with 95%. Although our discussion is based solely on simulated data, the relevant methods can provide data-driven analytical capabilities for future observations of SGWB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review explores modified theories of gravity, particularly $f(R)$ gravity, as extensions to General Relativity (GR) that offer alternatives to dark energy for explaining cosmic acceleration. These models generalize the Einstein-Hilbert action to include functions of the Ricci scalar, providing new insights into cosmology and astrophysics. The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has enabled rigorous tests of $f(R)$ gravity, as deviations in GW propagation, speed, and polarization can signal modifications to GR. Constraints on $f(R)$ models arise from LIGO-Virgo observations of binary mergers, the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), and complementary tests in cosmology and weak-field regimes. Future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope, will enhance sensitivity to smaller deviations from GR, necessitating advancements in theoretical modeling.

      <title>Cosmological phase-space analysis of $f(G)$-theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of topological terms that modify the Hilbert-Einstein action is here explored by virtue of a further $f(G)$ contribution. In particular, we investigate the phase-space stability and critical points of an equivalent scalar field representation that makes use of a massive field, whose potential is function of the topological correction. To do so, we introduce to the gravitational Action Integral a Lagrange multiplier and model the modified Friedmann equations by virtue of new non-dimensional variables. We single out dimensionless variables that permit \emph{a priori} the Hubble rate change of sign, enabling regions in which the Hubble parameter either vanishes or becomes negative. In this respect, we thus analyze the various possibilities associated with a universe characterized by such topological contributions and find the attractors, saddle points and regions of stability, in general. The overall analysis is carried out considering the exponential potential first and then shifting to more complicated cases, where the underlying variables do not simplify. We compute the eigenvalues of our coupled differential equations and, accordingly, the stability of the system, in both a spatially-flat and non-flat universe. Quite remarkably, regardless of the spatial curvature, we show that a stable de Sitter-like phase that can model current time appears only a small fraction of the entire phase-space, suggesting that the model under exam is unlikely in describing the whole universe dynamics, i.e., the topological terms appear disfavored in framing the entire evolution of the universe.</description>

      <title>Fixing the AdS$_3$ metric from the pure state entanglement entropies of CFT$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:1710.08448v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, based on RT formula, by identifying the pure state UV and IR entanglement entropies of a perturbed CFT$_2$ with geodesic lengths in the bulk, we demonstrate that the dual geometry is uniquely determined to be asymptotically AdS$_3$. The pure AdS$_3$ geometry is recovered by taking the massless limit of the system. Our derivations hold in both static and covariant scenarios.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Conformal Higgs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13640v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scale-invariant extensions of the electroweak theory are not only attractive because they can dynamically generate the weak scale, but also due to their role in facilitating supercooled first-order phase transitions. We study the minimal scale-invariant $U(1)_{\rm D}$ extension of the standard model and show that Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) can be abundantly produced. The mass of these PBHs is bounded from above by that of the moon due to QCD catalysis limiting the amount of supercooling. Lunar-mass PBHs, which are produced for dark Higgs vev $v_\phi\simeq 20~\rm TeV$, correspond to the best likelihood to explain the HSC lensing anomaly. For $v_\phi\gtrsim 400~\rm TeV$, the model can explain hundred per cent of dark matter. At even larger hierarchy of scales, it can contribute to the $511~\rm keV$ line. While the gravitational wave (GW) signal produced by the HSC anomaly interpretation is large and detectable by LISA above astrophysical foreground, the dark matter interpretation in terms of PBHs can not be entirely probed by future GW detection. This is due to the dilution of the signal by the entropy injected during the decay of the long-lived $U(1)_{\rm D}$ scalar. This extended lifetime is a natural consequence of the large hierarchy of scales.</description>

      <title>Cooling and heating regions of Joule-Thomson expansion for AdS black holes: Einstein-Maxwell-Power-Yang-Mills and Kerr Sen black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Joule-Thomson Expansion (JTE) process for two types of black holes: AdS-Einstein-Maxwell-Power-Yang-Mills (AEMPYM) and AdS-Kerr-Sen (AKS). Our study focuses on understanding how various parameters influence the Joule-Thomson Coefficient (JTC), the inversion curve, and the ratio of minimum inversion temperature to critical temperature. For the AKS black hole, we observe that the isenthalpic curves can exhibit either cooling or heating behavior. This behavior is determined by the inversion curve, which is affected by the black hole's mass and specific parameters such as $b$ (parameter signifies the ionic charge of the black hole) and $a$ (rotation parameter). In the case of the AEMPYM black hole, our findings reveal that the ratio of minimum inversion temperature to critical temperature approaches a specific value as Maxwell's charge increases. This ratio remains constant for certain parameter values, while it varies for others. Specifically, when the parameter $q$ (real positive parameter of AEMPYM black hole) is greater than 1, the ratio is almost equal to 1/2 as Maxwell's charge (C) increases. When q equals 1/2, the ratio is exactly 1/2 for all values of (C). For values of (q) between 1/2 and 1, the ratio is close to 1/2, and for values of (q) between 0 and 1/2, the ratio decreases, moving away from 1/2. For the AKS black hole, we find that specific parameter values, such as (a = 0.00951) and (b = 0.00475 ), yield a ratio of minimum inversion temperature to a critical temperature that is approximately 1/2. This consistency across different parameter values highlights the robustness of our findings. Finally, we compare our results with those reported in the existing literature, providing a comprehensive summary in detailed tables.</description>

      <title>A new diagnostic for the null test of dynamical dark energy in light of DESI 2024 and other BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new diagnostic for the null tests of dynamical dark energy alongside two other combined equivalent diagnostics. These diagnostics are useful, especially when we include anisotropic baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data in an analysis, to quantify the deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We also consider another diagnostic for isotropic BAO observations. These null tests are independent of any late-time dark energy model or parametrization. With these diagnostics, we study the evidence for dynamical dark energy in light of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 data combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations of the Planck 2018 mission and local $H_0$ measurements. We find no strong evidence for dynamical dark energy. The exclusion of the individual deviations at the effective redshift 0.51 of the DESI 2024 data makes the evidence even weaker. We get nearly similar results for other non-DESI BAO data. Both for DESI 2024 and other non-DESI BAO data, the evidence is almost independent of early-time physics. The evidence corresponding to the SHOES value of $H_0$ is higher than the corresponding tRGB value of $H_0$ for all combinations of data, but still not strong enough to reject the flat $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Dwarf galaxies imply dark matter is heavier than $\mathbf{2.2 \times 10^{-21}} \, \mathbf{eV}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is widely established that a lower bound on the dark matter particle mass, $m$, can be obtained by demanding that the de Broglie wavelength in a given galaxy must be smaller than the virial radius of the galaxy, leading to $m\gtrsim 10^{-22}\text{ eV}$ when applied to typical dwarf galaxies. This lower limit has never been derived precisely or rigorously. We use stellar kinematical data for the Milky Way satellite galaxy Leo II to self-consistently reconstruct a statistical ensemble of dark matter wavefunctions and corresponding density profiles. By comparison to a data-driven, model-independent reconstruction, and using a variant of the maximum mean discrepancy as a statistical measure, we determine that a self-consistent description of dark matter in the local Universe requires $m&gt;2.2 \times 10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}\;\mathrm{(CL&gt;95\%)}$. This lower limit is free of any assumptions pertaining to cosmology, microphysics (including spin), or dynamics of dark matter, and only assumes that it is predominantly composed of a single bosonic particle species.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing from Gravity as Universal Dephasing Channel for Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction of a transmon qubit with a classical gravitational field. Exploiting the generic phenomena of the gravitational redshift and Aharonov-Bohm phase, we show that entangled quantum states dephase with a universal rate. The gravitational phase shift is expressed in terms of a quantum computing noise channel. We give a measurement protocol based on a modified phase estimation algorithm which is linear in the phase drift, which is optimal for measuring the small phase that is acquired from the gravitation channel. Additionally, we propose qubit-based platforms as quantum sensors for precision gravitometers and mechanical strain gauges as an example of this phenomenon's utility. We estimate a sensitivity for measuring the local gravitational acceleration to be $\delta g/g \sim 10^{-7}$. This paper demonstrates that classical gravitation has a non-trivial influence on quantum computing hardware, and provides an illustration of how quantum computing hardware may be utilized for purposes other than computation. While we focus on superconducting qubits, we point the universal nature of gravitational phase effects for all quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Exploring the dynamical interplay between mass-energy equivalence, interactions and entanglement in an optical lattice clock</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose protocols that probe manifestations of the mass-energy equivalence in an optical lattice clock (OLC) interrogated with spin coherent and entangled quantum states. To tune and uniquely distinguish the mass-energy equivalence effects (gravitational redshift and second order Doppler shift) in such a setting, we devise a dressing protocol using an additional nuclear spin state. We then analyze the dynamical interplay between photon-mediated interactions and gravitational redshift and show that such interplay can lead to entanglement generation and frequency synchronization dynamics. In the regime where all atomic spins synchronize, we show the synchronization time depends on the initial entanglement of the state and can be used as a proxy of its metrological gain compared to a classical state. Our work opens new possibilities for exploring the effects of general relativity on quantum coherence and entanglement in OLC experiments.</description>

      <title>Every Poincar\'e gauge theory is conformal: a compelling case for dynamical vector torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Poincar\'e gauge theory (PGT) of gravity provides a viable formulation of general relativity (Einstein-Cartan theory), and a popular model-building framework for modified gravity with torsion. Notoriously, however, the PGT terms which propagate vector torsion lead to strongly-coupled ghosts: the modern view is that only scalar torsion can propagate. To fix this, we revisit the concept of embedding explicit mass scales in scale-invariant theories, showing how the Klein-Gordon theory naturally leads to a slowly-rolling inflaton. We then show that the unique scale-invariant embedding of PGT leads to two new terms, one of which is the Maxwell term for vector torsion. We provide the full spectrum of quantum particles in the resulting theory. Our result means that every PGT is conformal and - after a two-decade hiatus - vector torsion is back on the menu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15271v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional quantum gravity endowed with a positive cosmological constant and coupled to a conformal field theory of large and positive central charge. We study cosmological properties at the classical and quantum level. We provide a complete ADM analysis of the classical phase space, revealing a family of either bouncing or big bang/crunch type cosmologies. At the quantum level, we solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation exactly. In the semiclassical limit, we link the Wheeler-DeWitt state space to the classical phase space. Wavefunctionals of the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin type are identified, and we uncover a quantum version of the bouncing spacetime. We retrieve the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction from the disk path integral of timelike Liouville theory. To do so, we must select a particular contour in the space of complexified fields. The quantum information content of the big bang cosmology is discussed, and contrasted with the de Sitter horizon entropy as computed by a gravitational path integral over the two-sphere.</description>

      <title>Expanding covariant cosmography of the local Universe: incorporating the snap and axial symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies show that the model-independent, fully non-perturbative covariant cosmographic approach is suitable for analyzing the local Universe $(z\lesssim 0.1)$. However, accurately characterizing large and inhomogeneous mass distributions requires the fourth-order term in the redshift expansion of the covariant luminosity distance $d_L(z,\boldsymbol{n})$. We calculate the covariant snap parameter $\mathbb{S}$ and its spherical harmonic multipole moments using the matter expansion tensor and the evolution equations for lightray bundles. The fourth-order term adds 36 degrees of freedom, since the highest independent multipole of the snap is the 32-pole (dotriacontapole) $(\ell=5)$. Including this term helps to de-bias estimations of the covariant deceleration parameter. Given that observations suggest axially symmetric anisotropies in the Hubble diagram for $z \lesssim 0.1$ and theory shows that only a subset of multipoles contributes to the signal, we demonstrate that only 12 degrees of freedom are needed for a model-independent description of the local universe. We use an analytical axisymmetric model of the local Universe, with data that matches the Zwicky Transient Facility survey, in order to provide a numerical example of the amplitude of the snap multipoles and to forecast precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated the influence of \(\kappa\) Minkowski-type quantum spacetime on neutrino oscillations, revealing that spacetime fluctuations introduce a unique energy-dependent power law, \(E^{-4}\), in the decoherence effect for relic neutrinos. This effect is particularly pronounced for low-energy neutrinos, such as those from the cosmic neutrino background ($C\nu B$). Our results indicate the potential for new models of low-energy quantum gravity-induced decoherence, which could pave the way for future experiments, such as IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT, to further constrain the deformation parameter.</description>

      <title>Remarks on ghost resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study various aspects of ghost resonances: the resummation that leads to the dressed propagator, the poles locations, the analytic continuation into the second Riemann sheet and the spectral representations in both first and second sheets. In particular, we show that for real masses above the multiparticle threshold the ghost propagator has a pair of complex conjugate poles in the first sheet, unlike the case of an ordinary unstable resonance which has no pole in the first sheet but a complex conjugate pair in the second sheet. Mathematical and physical implications of this feature are discussed. We also clarify an important point regarding the two absorptive contributions of a ghost propagator in the narrow-width approximation. Furthermore, we argue that finite-time quantum field theories are needed to consistently derive the dressed ghost propagator and capture the true physical properties of ghost resonances. Throughout the work, different prescriptions to define the ghost propagator on the real axis are considered: Feynman, anti-Feynman and fakeon prescriptions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the causal structure of Generalized Quadratic Gravity (GQG) and Einsteinian Cubic Gravity (ECG). It is well known that gravitons in higher-curvature theories can exhibit superluminal propagation, rendering the conventional definition of causal structures based on null curves inadequate. Instead, the causal structure must be defined using the fastest propagating modes, which travel along characteristic surfaces. The superluminal propagation in higher-curvature theories has significant implications for black holes. Specifically, if the Killing horizon of a black hole is not a characteristic surface corresponding to the fastest propagating mode, the horizon can no longer function as a causal barrier. Our analysis demonstrates that GQG with a genuine fourth-order equation of motion possesses only null characteristics, implying that the horizon is a characteristic surface. Furthermore, we perform a detailed characteristic analysis of ECG. We show that while all null surfaces are characteristic surfaces in ECG, the converse is not true - there exist non-null characteristic surfaces. In particular, we identify a non-null characteristic surface in a Type N spacetime in the algebraic classification of spacetimes. Despite the existence of multiple characteristic surfaces in ECG, we establish that the black hole horizon remains a characteristic surface.</description>
