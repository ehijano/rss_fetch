      <title>Renormalization-Group Improved Resummation of Super-Leading Logarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new strategy is presented for systematically treating super-leading logarithmic contributions including higher-order Glauber exchanges for non-global LHC observables in renormalization-group (RG) improved perturbation theory. This represents an important improvement over previous approaches, as it allows for the consistent inclusion of the scale dependence of the strong coupling, thereby providing more reliable estimates of the scale uncertainties in theoretical predictions. The key idea is to rearrange the relevant RG evolution operator in such a way that all double-logarithmic corrections are exponentiated from the outset. This forms the starting point for the first resummation of super-leading logarithms at leading order in RG-improved perturbation theory for arbitrary $2\to M$ scattering processes. Moreover, the asymptotic scaling of subleading logarithmic corrections from higher-order Glauber exchanges is determined, demonstrating their parametric suppression.</description>

      <title>Optimal Celestial Bodies for Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide variety of celestial bodies have been considered as dark matter detectors. Which stands the best chance of delivering the discovery of dark matter? Which is the most powerful dark matter detector? We investigate a range of objects, including the Sun, Earth, Jupiter, Brown Dwarfs, White Dwarfs, Neutron Stars, Stellar populations, and Exoplanets. We quantify how different objects are optimal dark matter detectors in different regimes by deconstructing some of the in-built assumptions in these search sensitivities, including observation potential and particle model assumptions. We show how different objects can be expected to deliver corroborating signals. We discuss different search strategies, their opportunities and limitations, and the interplay of regimes where different celestial objects are optimal dark matter detectors.</description>

      <title>Solar neutrinos and leptonic spin forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify the effects on the evolution of solar neutrinos of light spin-zero particles with pseudoscalar couplings to leptons and scalar couplings to nucleons. In this scenario the matter potential sourced by the nucleons in the Sun's matter gives rise to spin precession of the relativistic neutrino ensemble. As such the effects in the solar observables are different if neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles. For Dirac neutrinos the spin-flavour precession results into left-handed neutrino to right-handed neutrino (i.e., active--sterile) oscillations, while for Majorana neutrinos it results into left-handed neutrino to right-handed antineutrino (i.e., active-active) oscillations. In both cases this leads to distortions in the solar neutrino spectrum which we use to derive constraints on the allowed values of the mediator mass and couplings via a global analysis of the solar neutrino data. In addition for Majorana neutrinos spin-flavour precession results into a potentially observable flux of solar electron antineutrinos at the Earth which we quantify and constrain with the existing bounds from Borexino and KamLAND.</description>

      <title>Quasielastic Lepton-Nucleus Scattering and the Correlated Fermi Gas Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutrino research program in the coming decades will require improved precision. A major source of uncertainty is the interaction of neutrinos with nuclei that serve as targets for such experiments. Broadly speaking, this interaction often depends, e.g., for charge-current quasi-elastic scattering, on the combination of ``nucleon physics", expressed by form factors, and ``nuclear physics", expressed by a nuclear model. It is important to get a good handle on both. We present a fully analytic implementation of the Correlated Fermi Gas Model for electron-nucleus and charge-current quasi-elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering. The implementation is used to compare separately form factors and nuclear model effects for both electron-carbon and neutrino-carbon scattering data.</description>

      <title>Bosonic multi-Higgs correlations beyond leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of multiple Higgs bosons at the LHC and beyond is a strong test of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. Taking inspiration from recent experimental efforts to move towards limits on triple Higgs production at the Large Hadron Collider, we consider generic bosonic deviations of $HH$ and $HHH$ production from the Standard Model in the guise of Higgs Effective Field Theory. Including one-loop radiative corrections within the HEFT and going up to ${\mathcal{O}}(p^4)$ in the momentum expansion, we provide a detailed motivation of the parameter range that the LHC (and future hadron colliders) can explore, through accessing non-standard coupling modifications and momentum dependencies that probe Higgs boson non-linearities. In particular, we find that radiative corrections can enhance the sensitivity to Higgs-self coupling modifiers and HEFT-specific momentum dependencies can vastly increase triple Higgs production thus providing further motivation to consider these processes during the LHC's high-luminosity phase.</description>

      <title>The effect of anisotropy on the formation of heavy quarkonium bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the real part of the static potential of a heavy quark-antiquark system in an anisotropic plasma medium. We use a quasi-particle approach where the collective dynamics of the plasma constituents is described using hard-loop perturbation theory. The parton distribution function is characterized by a set of parameters that can accurately describe the anisotropy of the plasma produced in a heavy ion collision. We calculate the potential numerically in strongly anisotropic systems and study the angular dependence of the distortion of the potential relative to the isotropic one. We obtain an analytic expression for the real part of the heavy quark potential in the limit of weak anisotropy using a model that expresses the potential in terms of effective screening masses that depend on the anisotropy parameters and the orientation of the quark-antiquark pair. A 1-dimensional potential is formulated in terms of angle averaged screening masses that incorporate the anisotropy of the medium into a radial coordinate. We solve the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation and show that the magnitude of the binding energy typically increases with anisotropy. Anisotropy can play an important role, especially in states with non-zero angular momentum. This means that the number of bound states that are formed could depend on specific characteristics of the anisotropy of the plasma. Our study suggests that plasma anisotropy plays an important role in the dynamics of heavy quarkonium and motivates further study.</description>

      <title>On supposed oscillations of differential cross sections in pp-scattering at sqrt{s} = 13 TeV</title>

Abstract: The question of possible existence of oscillations in the region of the diffraction peak in pp-scattering is considered in detail at sqrt{s}=13 TeV. It is shown that within the framework of the available experimental data published by the TOTEM and ALFA/ATLAS collaborations, raising the question of searching for such a subtle effect looks premature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the factorization framework of nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics, we study the associated $J/\psi+c+\bar{c}$ photoproduction process at next-to-leading order in $\alpha_s$ and leading order in the velocity expansion. The total cross section and differential cross section in $p_T^2$, $W$ and $z$ are presented. The results indicate that the next-to-leading order corrections are substantial, and testable in experiment.</description>

      <title>Matter Asymmetries in the $Z_N$ Dark matter -companion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of $Z_{N\geq 3}$-symmetric WIMP dark matter models that are characterized by the semi-annihilation into the companion of dark matter has been proposed in ref.~\cite{Guo:2021rre}, providing a mechanism to evade the stringent direct detection constraint. In this work, we point out that such models naturally provide the three Sakharov elements necessary for dark matter asymmetry, and moreover this asymmetry can be transferred to the visible sector with a proper link to the leptonic or quark sector. In our minimal $Z_3$ example, the migration to the leptonic sector is via the asymmetric companion decay into neutrinos, and the lepton asymmetry can be further transferred to the quark sector. The CP violation parameter in the model is suppressed in the limit of static annihilation of dark matter, and the lift from thermal motion has been studied for the first time. A preliminary numerical analysis based on the Boltzmann equations shows that both correct relic density of dark matter and baryon asymmetry can be accommodated.</description>

      <title>Incoherent Fermionic Dark Matter Absorption with Nucleon Fermi Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the incoherent regime of the fermionic dark matter absorption by nuclei using the relativistic Fermi gas model and nuclear form factors. With the momentum transfer being roughly equal to the dark matter mass $m_\chi$, the incoherent regime contributes significantly to the absorption process for $m_\chi \gtrsim 100$ MeV with a spin-independent operator and for even smaller mass with a spin-dependent one. We also compare the situations for various target nuclei ($^{131}$Xe, $^{72}$Ge, $^{40}$Ar, $^{20}$Ne and $^4$He) that are typically used in the dark matter direct detection. A heavier nucleus actually has the advantage of probing the incoherent scattering of the fermionic absorption dark matter. Observing both the coherent and incoherent contributions would be an important justification of the fermionic dark matter absorption.</description>

      <title>VAIM - CFF: A variational autoencoder inverse mapper solution to Compton form factor extraction from deeply virtual exclusive reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new methodology for extracting Compton form factors (CFFs) in from deeply virtual exclusive reactions such as the unpolarized DVCS cross section using a specialized inverse problem solver, a variational autoencoder inverse mapper (VAIM). The VAIM-CFF framework not only allows us access to a fitted solution set possibly containing multiple solutions in the extraction of all 8 CFFs from a single cross section measurement, but also accesses the lost information contained in the forward mapping from CFFs to cross section. We investigate various assumptions and their effects on the predicted CFFs such as cross section organization, number of extracted CFFs, use of uncertainty quantification technique, and inclusion of prior physics information. We then use dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis to visualize the missing physics information tracked in the latent space of the VAIM framework. Through re-framing the extraction of CFFs as an inverse problem, we gain access to fundamental properties of the problem not comprehensible in standard fitting methodologies: exploring the limits of the information encoded in deeply virtual exclusive experiments.</description>

      <title>Exploring solutions to the muon g-2 anomaly in a THDM-like model under flavor constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic moment of the muon can receive significant two-loop contributions from the scalar spectrum in Two Higgs Doublet Models (THDM), particularly for a light pseudoscalar. It is established that the symmetry breaking from $SU(3)_L \times U(1)_N$ to $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ generates an effective Type-III THDM, which invariably leads to flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes. In this study, we examine whether such an effective THDM framework can account for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, considering the constraints imposed by $B$-meson decays, meson mixing, and invisible Higgs decays. Our principal finding reveals that a pseudoscalar with a mass of 66 GeV and a $\tan \beta$ value of 58 can account for the $g-2$ anomaly without conflicting with existing experimental limits.</description>

      <title>Swampland Conjectures Constraints on Dark Energy from a Highly Curved Field Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay of the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture (TCC) and the swampland distance conjecture (SDC) in the context of multifield dark energy in a curved field space. In this scenario, the phase of accelerated expansion is realized as non-geodesic motion in a highly-curved field space, reminiscent of models developed in the context of inflation. The model features a stable attractor solution with near constant equation of state $w\simeq -1$, and predicts that the current era of accelerated expansion is eternal. The latter implies an eventual conflict with the TCC, which holds that the duration of any epoch of cosmic acceleration is bounded by the requirement that the large-scale observable universe is blind to Planck-scale early universe physics. This tension can be resolved by an interplay with the distance conjecture: for suitable parameter values, the apparent violation of the TCC occurs well after the fields have traversed a Planckian distance. The SDC then predicts a breakdown of the effective field theory (EFT) before the TCC can be violated. We derive the constraints on the model arising from the SDC+TCC and the de Sitter conjecture. We demonstrate that the model can be consistent with both swampland conjectures and observational data from Planck 2018 and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our universe is permeated with interstellar plasma, which prevents propagation of low-frequency electromagnetic waves. Here, we show that two dramatic consequences arise out of such suppression; (i) if plasma permeates the light ring of a black hole, electromagnetic modes are screened entirely from the gravitational-wave signal, changing the black hole spectroscopy paradigm; (ii) if a near vacuum cavity is formed close to a charged black hole, as expected for near equal-mass mergers, ringdown "echoes" are excited. The amplitude of such echoes decays slowly and could thus serve as a silver bullet for plasmas near charged black holes.</description>

Abstract: The generation of charged pions, kaons, and protons from proton beam incident on Carbon at 31 GeV/c is calculated and compared with the results of the NA61/SHINE experiment. Predictions of the single charged particle yield by proton off the Carbon target is calculated using the Giessen Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) model and compared with the recent data of the EMPHATIC hadron scattering and production experiment for incident proton beam energies of 20, 30, and 120 GeV/c within $\pm$20 mrad with respect to the beam particle. We present the analysis for the single and double differential cross-sections for the produced particles at various scattering angles and conduct a comprehensive comparison with the experimental data. These studies show significant agreement with the measured data.</description>

Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is a collective quantum phenomenon that arises from the interplay between gauge field topology and fermion chiral anomaly, encompassing a wide range of physical systems from semimetals to quark-gluon plasma. This review, with a focus on CME and related effects in heavy ion collisions, aims to provide an introductory discussion on its conceptual foundation and measurement methodology, a timely update on the present status in terms of experimental findings and theoretical progress, as well as an outlook into the open problems and future developments.</description>

      <title>On the mixing between flavor singlets in lattice gauge theories coupled to matter fields in multiple representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the first extensive, numerical study of the non-trivial problem of mixing between flavor-singlet composite states emerging in strongly coupled lattice field theories with matter field content consisting of fermions transforming in different representations of the gauge group. The theory of interest is the minimal candidate for a composite Higgs model that also accommodates a mechanism for top partial compositeness: the $Sp(4)$ gauge theory coupled to two (Dirac) fermions transforming as the fundamental and three as the two-index antisymmetric representation of the gauge group, respectively. We apply an admixture of APE and Wuppertal smearings, as well as the generalized eigenvalue problem approach, to two-point functions involving flavor-singlet mesons, for ensembles having time extent longer than the space extent. We demonstrate that, in the region of lattice parameter space accessible to this study, both masses and mixing angles can be measured effectively, despite the presence of (numerically noisy) contributions from disconnected diagrams.</description>

      <title>Probing CPV mixing in the Higgs sector in VBF at 1 TeV ILC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the current precision of measurements by the ATLAS and CMS experiments, it cannot be excluded that a SM-like Higgs boson is a CP violating mixture of CP-even and CP-odd states. We explore this possibility here, assuming Higgs boson production in ZZ-fusion, at 1 TeV ILC, with unpolarized beams. The full simulation of SM background and fast simulation of the signal is performed, simulating 8 ab$^{-1}$ of data collected with the ILD detector. We demonstrate that the CP mixing angle $\Psi_{\mathrm{CP}}$ between scalar and pseudoscalar states can be measured with the statistical uncertainty of 3.8 mrad at 68% CL, corresponding to 1.44 $\cdot 10^{-5}$ for the CP parameter $f_\mathrm{CP}$, for the pure scalar state. This is the first result on sensitivity of an $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider to measure $f_\mathrm{CP}$ in the Higgs production vertex in vector boson fusion.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative determination of the $N_f=2+1$ QCD sphaleron rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong sphaleron rate, i.e., the rate of real time QCD topological transitions, is a key phenomenological quantity, playing a fundamental role in several physical contexts. In heavy-ion collisions, a non-vanishing rate can lead to the so-called Chiral Magnetic Effect. In early-Universe cosmology, instead, it can be related to the rate of thermal production of QCD axions. In this talk, we present the first reliable fully non-perturbative computation of the strong sphaleron rate in $N_f=2+1$ QCD at the physical point by means of lattice simulations, in a range of temperatures going from 200 MeV to 600 MeV. Our strategy is based on the inversion of lattice correlators via a recently-proposed modified version of the Backus-Gilbert method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historically studied in the context of heavy-ion collisions, the extent to which free nucleon-nucleon forces are modified in-medium remains undetermined by these data sets. Therefore, we investigate the impact of NN in-medium modifications on neutrino-nucleus cross section predictions using the GiBUU transport model. We find that including an in-medium lowering of the NN cross section and density dependence on $\Delta$ excitation improves agreement with MicroBooNE neutrino-argon scattering data. This is observed for both proton and neutral pion spectra in charged-current muon neutrino and neutral-current single pion production datasets. The impact of collision broadening of the $\Delta$ resonance is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Exploring light dark matter with the Migdal effect in hydrogen-doped liquid xenon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ongoing challenge in dark matter direct detection is to improve the sensitivity to light dark matter in the MeV--GeV mass range. One proposal is to dope a liquid noble-element direct detection experiment with a lighter element such as hydrogen. This has the advantage of enabling larger recoil energies compared to scattering on a heavy target, while leveraging existing detector technologies. Direct detection experiments can also extend their reach to lower masses by exploiting the Migdal effect, where a nuclear recoil leads to electronic ionisation or excitation. In this work we combine these ideas to study the sensitivity of a hydrogen-doped LZ experiment (HydroX), and a future large-scale experiment such as XLZD. We find that HydroX could have sensitivity to dark matter masses as low as 5~MeV for both spin-independent and spin-dependent scattering, with XLZD extending that reach to lower cross sections. Notably, this technique substantially enhances the sensitivity of direct detection to spin-dependent proton scattering, well beyond the reach of any current experiments.</description>

Abstract: The best way to probe CP violation in the lepton sector is with long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments in the appearance mode: the appearance of $\nu_e$ in predominantly $\nu_\mu$ beams. Here we show that it is possible to discover CP violation with disappearance experiments only, by combining JUNO for electron neutrinos and DUNE or Hyper-Kamiokande for muon neutrinos. While the maximum sensitivity to discover CP is quite modest ($1.6\sigma$ with 6 years of JUNO and 13 years of DUNE), some values of $\delta$ may be disfavored by $&gt;3\sigma$ depending on the true value of $\delta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Little Higgs models address the hierarchy problem by identifying the SM Higgs doublet as pseudo-Nambu--Goldstone bosons (pNGB) arising from global symmetries with collective breakings. These models are designed to address the little hierarchy problem up to a scale of $\Lambda\!\sim\! {\cal O}(10)$ TeV. Consequently, these models necessitate an ultraviolet (UV) completion above this scale. On the other hand, conformal extensions of the Standard Model are intriguing because scales emerge as a consequence of dimensional transmutation. In this study, we present a unified framework in which the electroweak hierarchy problem is tackled through a conformal symmetry collectively broken around the TeV scale, offering an appealing UV completion for little Higgs models. Notably, this framework automatically ensures the presence of the required UV fixed points, eliminating the need for careful adjustments to the particle content of the theory. Moreover, this framework naturally addresses the flavor puzzles associated with composite or little Higgs models. Furthermore, we suggest that in this framework all known little Higgs models can be UV-completed through conformal dynamics above the scale $\Lambda$ up to arbitrary high scales.</description>

      <title>On the minimal mass of thermal dark matter and the viability of millicharged particles affecting 21cm cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal freeze-out offers an attractive explanation of the dark matter density free from fine-tuning of initial conditions. For dark matter with a mass below tens of MeV, photons, electrons, and neutrinos are the only available direct Standard Model annihilation products. Using a full three-sector abundance calculation, we determine the minimal mass of dark matter, allowing for an arbitrary branching into electrons/photons and neutrinos that is compatible with current cosmological observations. The analysis takes into account the heat transfer between the various sectors from annihilation and elastic scattering, representing the first fully self-consistent analysis that tracks the respective sectors' temperatures. We thereby provide accurate thermal annihilation cross sections, particularly for velocity-dependent cases, and deduce the sensitivity of current and upcoming CMB experiments to MeV thermal dark matter. In the latter context, we also establish the fine-tuned parameter region where a tiny admixture of neutrinos in the final states rules in MeV-scale $p$-wave annihilating DM into electrons. Finally, we show that a sub-% millicharged dark matter with an interaction strength that interferes with 21 cm cosmology is still allowed when freeze-out is supplemented with annihilation into neutrinos. For all cases considered, we provide concrete particle physics models and supplement our findings with a discussion of other relevant experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a unified description of the experimental data of the $\pi^+\pi^-$ and $J/\psi\pi^\pm$ invariant mass spectra for $e^+e^- \rightarrow J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$ and the $D^0 D^{\ast-}$ mass spectrum for $e^+e^- \rightarrow D^0 D^{\ast-} \pi^+$ at $e^+e^-$ center-of-mass energies 4.23 and 4.26 GeV. The analysis takes into account open-charm meson loops that contain triangle singularities, the $J/\psi\pi$-$D\bar D^*$ coupled-channel interaction respecting unitarity, and the strong $\pi\pi$-$K\bar K$ final state interaction using dispersion relations. The analysis leads to a precise determination of the $Z_c(3900)$ pole with the pole mass and width $(3880.7 \pm 1.7_\text{stat}\pm 22.4_\text{syst})$ MeV and $(35.9 \pm 1.4_\text{stat}\pm 15.3_\text{syst})$ MeV, respectively, and hints at that the $D\bar D^*$ molecular and non-molecular components are of similar importance in the $Z_c(3900)$ formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is challenging to resolve the small-scale problem for dark matter being a weakly-interacting massive particle. We attempt to address this issue by proposing a self-interacting freeze-in dark matter via dark photon. In this model, the dark matter obtains the observed relic abundance via Standard Model $\gamma$ and $Z$ boson induced freeze-in processes, whereas the dark matter force mediator has a negligible relic abundance and a lifetime larger than the age of Universe. We place constraints in classical and resonant regime resolving the small-scale problem from CMB, $X/\gamma$-ray, Supernova 1987A and out-of-equilibrium condition. It turns out that the CMB constraint on dark matter annihilations is satisfied despite large Sommerfeld effect taking place, while the other constraints are trivially accommodated due to various millicharge induced suppressions. Finally we briefly discuss future cosmological tests on such freeze-in dark matter model.</description>

      <title>Stability and causality of rest frame modes in second-order spin hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the low- and high-momentum rest frame modes in the second-order spin hydrodynamics and check the asymptotic causality of the theory. A truncation scheme of the Israel-Stewart formalism derived in our earlier work is proposed that extends the minimal causal formulation. It consists of altogether 40 interconnected relaxation-type dynamical equations -- 16 (24) of them correspond to the independent components of the energy-momentum (spin) tensor. Similarly to previous studies, we find that the stability of the perturbations and asymptotic causality require using the spin equation of state that satisfies the generalized Frenkel condition demanding that the ``electric'' and ``magnetic'' components of the spin density tensor have opposite signs. For low-momentum modes this behavior is similar to that found earlier for the first-order (Navier-Stokes) spin hydrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By considering the one loop background field method for a quark-antiquark interaction, mediated by one (non perturbative) gluon exchange, sixth order quark effective interactions are derived and investigated in the limit of zero momentum transfer for large quark and/or gluon effective masses. They extend fourth order quark interactions worked out in previous works of the author. These interactions break $U_A(1)$ symmetry and may be either momentum independent or dependent. Part of these interactions vanish in the limit of massless quarks, and several other - involving vector and/or axial quark currents - survive. In the local limit of the resulting interactions, some phenomenological implications are presented, which correspond to corrections to the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. By means of the auxiliary field method, the local interactions give rise to three meson interactions whose values are compared to phenomenological values found in the literature. Contributions for meson-mixing parameters are calculated and compared to available results.</description>

      <title>Prospects to study hyperon-nucleon interactions at BESIII</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prospects to study hyperon-nuclei/nucleon interactions at BESIII and similar $e^+ e^-$ colliders are proposed in this work. Utilizing the large quantity of hyperons produced by the decay of 10 billion $J/\psi$ and 2.7 billion $\psi(3686)$ collected at BESIII, the cross sections of several specific elastic or inelastic hyperon-nuclei reactions can be measured via the scattering between the hyperons and the nucleus in the dense objects of BESIII detector. Subsequently, the cross sections of corresponding hyperon-nucleon interactions are able to be extracted with further phenomenological calculation. Furthermore, the interactions between antihyperon and nuclei/nucleon, including scattering and annihilation, can also be studied via the method proposed in this paper. The results will definitely benefit a lot the precise probe of the hyperon-nuclei/nucleon interactions and provide constraints for the studies of the potential of strong interaction, the origin of color confinement, the unified model for baryon-baryon interactions, and the internal structure of neutron stars. In addition, the desirable prospects of corresponding studies in the future Super Tau-Charm Factory (STCF) are discussed and estimated in this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral magnets with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions feature a rich phase diagram with a variety of thermodynamical phases. These include helical and conical spin arrangements and topologically charged objects such as (anti)skyrmions. Crucially, due to hysteresis effects, the thermodynamical phases can co-exist at any given temperature and external magnetic field, typically leading to metastability of, e.g., the material's topological phase. In this work, we use Monte Carlo simulations to study these effects. We compute the relative free energies of co-existing states, enabling us to determine the ground state at all values of the external parameters. We also introduce a method to estimate the activation energy, i.e. the height of the energy barrier that separates the topological phase from the ground state. This is one of the key ingredients for the determination of the skyrmion lifetime, which is relevant for technological applications. Finally, we prescribe predicting the system's evolution through any path in the space of external parameters. This can serve as a guideline to prepare the magnetic material in any desired phase or even trigger a phase transition in an experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Binary Supermassive Black Holes Orbiting Dark Matter Solitons: From the Dual AGN in UGC4211 to NanoHertz Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore orbital implications of the Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) binary in UGC4211 for the energy spectrum of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), measured with pulsar timing. The SMBH binary in UGC4211 has a projected separation of $\sim 230\,$pc and relative velocity of $\sim 150\,$km/s along the line of sight. It orbits with a disk of gas and stars, with a total mass $\sim 1.7 \times 10^9 M_\odot$ that is several times larger than the combined SMBHs plus the observed gas and stars. The unseen mass can be naturally explained by a soliton of wave dark matter present within the SMBH orbit. Such a scenario is encouraging as during galaxy merger, the two precursor galactic solitons are expected to combine to generate a new soliton and hence bind the two initial SMBHs efficiently. Generalizing this scenario to the cosmological population of SMBH binaries, we show the SGWB spectrum produced by late-stage inspiraling is modified preferentially at low frequency by the presence of soliton. Finally, we demonstrate that the NANOGrav and EPTA data can be well-fit in this scenario, favoring $\{m_a, f_a\} \sim \{10^{-21.7} {\rm eV}, 10^{15.5} {\rm GeV}\}$ and $\{10^{-20.5} {\rm eV}, 10^{16.8} {\rm GeV}\}$ respectively when the UGC4211 data and the constraints from dwarf galaxies are also combined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09385v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the primordial plasma, at temperatures above the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking, the presence of chiral asymmetries is expected to induce the development of helical hypermagnetic fields through the phenomenon of chiral plasma instability. It results in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence due to the high conductivity and low viscosity and sources gravitational waves that survive in the universe today as a stochastic polarized gravitational wave background. In this article, we show that this scenario only relies on Standard Model physics, and therefore the observable signatures, namely the relic magnetic field and gravitational background, are linked to a single parameter controlling the initial chiral asymmetry. We estimate the magnetic field and gravitational wave spectra, and validate these estimates with 3D numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: The hadron mass can be obtained through the calculation of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor in the hadron which includes the trace anomaly and sigma terms. The anomaly due to conformal symmetry breaking is believed to be an important ingredient for hadron mass generation and confinement. In this work, we will present the calculation of the glue part of the trace anomaly form factors of the pion up to $Q^2\sim 4.3~\mathrm{GeV}^2$ and the nucleon up to $Q^2\sim 1~\mathrm{GeV}^2$. The calculations are performed on a domain wall fermion ensemble with overlap valence quarks at seven valence pion masses varying from $\sim 250$ to $\sim 540$ MeV, including the unitary point $\sim 340$ MeV. We calculate the radius of the glue trace anomaly for the pion and the nucleon from the $z$ expansion. By performing a two-dimensional Fourier transform on the glue trace anomaly form factors in the infinite momentum frame with no energy transfer, we also obtain their spatial distributions for several valence quark masses. The results are qualitatively extrapolated to the physical valence pion mass with systematic errors from the unphysical sea quark mass, discretization effects in the renormalization sum rule, and finite-volume effects to be addressed in the future. We find the pion's form factor changes sign, as does its spatial distribution, for light quark masses. This explains how the trace anomaly contribution to the pion mass approaches zero toward the chiral limit.</description>

      <title>Scalar perturbations from inflation in the presence of gauge fields</title>

Abstract: We study how Abelian-gauge-field production during inflation affects scalar perturbations in the case when the gauge field interacts with the inflaton directly (by means of generic kinetic and axial couplings) and via gravity. The homogeneous background solution is defined by self-consistently taking into account the backreaction of the gauge field on the evolution of the inflaton and the scale factor. For the perturbations on top of this background, all possible scalar contributions coming from the inflaton, the metric, and the gauge field are considered. We derive a second-order differential equation for the curvature perturbation, $\zeta$, capturing the impact of the gauge field, both on the background dynamics and on the evolution of scalar perturbations. The latter is described by a source term in the $\zeta$-equation, which is quadratic in the gauge-field operators and leads to non-Gaussianities in the curvature perturbations. We derive general expressions for the induced scalar power spectrum and bispectrum. Finally, we apply our formalism to the well-known case of axion inflation without backreaction. Numerical results show that, in this example, the effect of including metric perturbations is small for values of the gauge-field production parameter $\xi&gt; 3$. This is in agreement with the previous results in the literature. However, in the region of smaller values, $\xi\lesssim 2$, our new results exhibit order-of-unity deviations when compared to previous results.</description>
