      <title>Topological cluster synchronization via Dirac spectral programming on directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective synchronization in complex systems arises from the interplay between topology and dynamics, yet how to design and control such patterns in higher-order networks remains unclear. Here we show that a Dirac spectral programming framework enables programmable topological cluster synchronization on directed hypergraphs. By encoding tail-head hyperedges into a topological Dirac operator and introducing a tunable mass term, we obtain a spectrum whose isolated eigenvalues correspond to distinct synchronization clusters defined jointly on nodes and hyperedges. Selecting a target eigenvalue allows the system to self-organize toward the associated cluster state without modifying the underlying hypergraph structure. Simulations on directed-hypergraph block models and empirical systems--including higher-order contact networks and the ABIDE functional brain network--confirm that spectral selection alone determines the accessible synchronization patterns. Our results establish a general and interpretable route for controlling collective dynamics in directed higher-order systems.</description>

      <title>ColliderML: The First Release of an OpenDataDetector High-Luminosity Physics Benchmark Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ColliderML - a large, open, experiment-agnostic dataset of fully simulated and digitised proton-proton collisions in High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider conditions ($\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV, mean pile-up $\mu = 200$). ColliderML provides one million events across ten Standard Model and Beyond Standard Model processes, plus extensive single-particle samples, all produced with modern next-to-leading order matrix element calculation and showering, realistic per-event pile-up overlay, a validated OpenDataDetector geometry, and standard reconstructions. The release fills a major gap for machine learning (ML) research on detector-level data, provided on the ML-friendly Hugging Face platform. We present physics coverage and the generation, simulation, digitisation and reconstruction pipeline, describe format and access, and initial collider physics benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal analysis of sprays by using Phase Doppler Anemometry data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spray characterization often relies on empirical formulas, statistical distributions, and derived quantities. Deterministic spray behavior originates from physics-governed mechanisms of atomization, \emph{e.g.}, nozzle geometry, boundary conditions, and hydrodynamic instabilities. Due to the stochastic nature of the atomization process, which originates from turbulence, chaotic perturbations, and droplet--droplet interactions, the temporal characteristics of dynamic behavior are seldom investigated. The combination of these processes leads to droplet clustering, which is a spatio-temporal behavior that is the focus of the current paper for an airblast atomizer. The measurement data by Phase Doppler Anemometry include droplet size, velocity, and arrival time. Firstly, the theoretical and experimental interparticle time distributions are compared using a $\chi^2$ hypothesis test, which concluded multimodality. Secondly, \emph{k}-means clustering is applied to determine droplet clusters, whose number was determined by gap statistics. The above analysis was performed using an extensive database of various measurement positions, atomizing pressures, liquid preheating temperatures, and liquid types. It was found that cluster formation affects approximately 30\% of the droplets in a single data set. In conclusion, the unsteadiness in the central region is caused by clustering, while it is caused by mixing and droplet entrainment in the spray periphery. The centroids and the number of cluster values depend on the atomizing pressure and the spray position, and are independent of the liquid temperature. The dynamical behavior of the clusters is compared by their droplet size and velocity distributions, showing no significant difference, suggesting that unsteady spray modeling is necessary if temporal characteristics are critical.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Stochastic Subspaces via the Bootstrap for Characterizing Model Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable forward uncertainty quantification in engineering requires methods that account for aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. In many applications, epistemic effects arising from uncertain parameters and model form dominate prediction error and strongly influence engineering decisions. Because distinguishing and representing each source separately is often infeasible, their combined effect is typically analyzed using a unified model-error framework. Model error directly affects model credibility and predictive reliability; yet its characterization remains challenging. To address this need, we introduce a bootstrap-based stochastic subspace model for characterizing model error in the stochastic reduced-order modeling framework. Given a snapshot matrix of state vectors, the method leverages the empirical data distribution to induce a sampling distribution over principal subspaces for reduced order modeling. The resulting stochastic model enables improved characterization of model error in computational mechanics compared with existing approaches. The method offers several advantages: (1) it is assumption-free and leverages the empirical data distribution; (2) it enforces linear constraints (such as boundary conditions) by construction; (3) it requires only one hyperparameter, significantly simplifying the training process; and (4) its algorithm is straightforward to implement. We evaluate the method's performance against existing approaches using numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Setting the Standard: Recommended Practices for Data Preprocessing in Data-Driven Climate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) - and specifically machine learning (ML) - applications for climate prediction across timescales are proliferating quickly. The emergence of these methods prompts a revisit to the impact of data preprocessing, a topic familiar to the climate community, as more traditional statistical models work with relatively small sample sizes. Indeed, the skill and confidence in the forecasts produced by data-driven models are directly influenced by the quality of the datasets and how they are treated during model development, thus yielding the colloquialism, "garbage in, garbage out." As such, this article establishes protocols for the proper preprocessing of input data for AI/ML models designed for climate prediction (i.e., subseasonal to decadal and longer). The three aims are to: (1) educate researchers, developers, and end users on the effects that preprocessing has on climate predictions; (2) provide recommended practices for data preprocessing for such applications; and (3) empower end users to decipher whether the models they are using are properly designed for their objectives. Specific topics covered in this article include the creation of (standardized) anomalies, dealing with non-stationarity and the spatiotemporally correlated nature of climate data, and handling of extreme values and variables with potentially complex distributions. Case studies will illustrate how using different preprocessing techniques can produce different predictions from the same model, which can create confusion and decrease confidence in the overall process. Ultimately, implementing the recommended practices set forth in this article will enhance the robustness and transparency of AI/ML in climate prediction studies.</description>

      <title>Learning to detect continuous gravitational waves: an open data-analysis competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report results of a public data-analysis challenge, hosted on the open data-science platform Kaggle, to detect simulated continuous gravitational-wave signals (CWs). These are weak signals from rapidly spinning neutron stars that remain undetected despite extensive searches. The competition dataset consisted of a population of CW signals using both simulated and real LIGO detector data matching the conditions of actual CW searches. The competition attracted more than 1,000 participants to develop realistic CW search algorithms. We describe the top 10 approaches and discuss their applicability as a pre-processing step compared to standard CW-search approaches. For the competition's dataset, we find that top approaches can reduce the computing cost by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude at a false-dismissal probability comparable to standard CW searches. Additionally, the competition drove the development of new GPU-accelerated detection pipelines, which facilitated their adoption in other areas of gravitational-wave data analysis. We release the associated dataset, which constitutes the first open standardized benchmark for CW detection, to enable reproducible method comparisons and to encourage further developments toward the first detection of these elusive signals.</description>
