      <title>Fisher information, Cr\'amer-Rao complexity and temperature in logistic map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the dynamics of the logistic map based on a probabilistic characterization in terms of the invariant density. We analyze the relevant regimes of the dynamics (regular, oscillatory, onset chaotic and fully chaotic) in terms of the Fisher information and the Cr\'amer-Rao (CR) complexity. We found that these informational quantifiers allow to distinguish the dynamical regions of the map, by maximizing the Fisher information in the regular behavior and with the CR complexity exhibiting variations and a maximum near to the Pomeau-Maneville scenario. Fisher information as a function of time is examined to the light of the Frieden's informational interpretation of the Thermodynamics Second Law. Finally, we apply the Equipartition Theorem to propose a definition of temperature for the logistic map, thus providing a macroscopic signature of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>An elementary approach to Wehrl-type entropy bounds in quantitative form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of the stability (with sharp exponent) of the Lieb--Solovej inequality for symmetric $SU(N)$ coherent states, which was obtained only recently by the authors. Here, we propose an elementary proof of this result, based on reformulating the Wehrl-type entropy as a function defined on the unit sphere in $\mathbb{C}^d$, for some suitable $d$, and on some explicit (and somewhat surprising) computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a proposal of Kitaev for a microscopic construction of a Hamiltonian intended to describe the edge dynamics of a quantum Hall system. We show that the construction works in the setting of translation-invariant free-fermion Hamiltonians. In this case, the resulting edge Hamiltonian exhibits only edge modes, and these modes have the correct chirality.</description>

      <title>Rotation angles of a rotating disc as the holonomy of the Hopf fibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates a simple kinematical model of a disc (Disc B) rolling on the edge of a fixed disc (Disc A) to study the geometric nature of rotation. The total rotation angle $\Delta$ of Disc B after one cycle is decomposed into a dynamical phase $\Delta_d$ and a geometric phase $\Delta_g$. The paper's main contribution is to demonstrate that this geometric phase can be essentially described as the $U(1)$ holonomy of the Hopf fibration with the canonical connection. By using a Gauss map to represent the disc's motion as a curve on a two-sphere ($S^2$), the work connects the physical rotation to the underlying geometry of the Hopf fiber bundle $S^3 \to S^2$ and clarifies the origin of the geometric phase.</description>

      <title>On the weak solutions to the navier-Stokes equations: a possible gap related to the energy equality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that a Leray-Hopf weak solution enjoys an energy inequality. Here, we investigate the energy equality related to a suitable weak solution to the Navier-Stokes initial boundary value problem. The term suitable is meant in the sense that for our goals we achieve a weak solution whose existence is based as limit of solutions to the mollified Navier-Stokes system. In the case of a weak regularity of the solution, our results justify the possible gap for the energy equality in terms of "kinetic energy". However, if there is a sufficient regularity, e.g., like the continuity of the L2-norm of the weak solution, then the energy equality holds.</description>

      <title>A quantitative Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and the unexpected regularity of density functional theory in one spatial dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the (Kohn-Sham) density-to-potential map in the case of spinless fermions in one spatial dimension, whose existence has been rigorously established by the first author in [arXiv:2504.05501 (2025)]. Here, we focus on the regularity of this map as a function of the density and the coupling constant in front of the interaction term. More precisely, we first prove a quantitative version of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, thereby showing that this map is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the natural Sobolev norms in the space of densities and potentials. In particular, this implies that the inverse (Kohn-Sham) problem is not only well-posed but also Lipschitz stable. Using this result, we then show that the density-to-potential map is in fact real analytic with respect to both the density and the interaction strength. As a consequence, we obtain a holomorphic extension of the universal constrained-search functional to a suitable subset of complex-valued densities. This partially extends the DFT framework to non-self-adjoint Schr\"odinger operators. As further applications of these results, we also establish the existence of an exchange-only part of the exchange-correlation potential, and justify the G\"orling-Levy perturbation expansion for the correlation energy.</description>

      <title>The swap transpose on couplings translates to Petz' recovery map on quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [Ann. Henri Poincar\'e, {\bf 22} (2021), 3199-3234], De Palma and Trevisan described a one-to-one correspondence between quantum couplings and quantum channels realizing transport between states. The aim of this short note is to demonstrate that taking the Petz recovery map for a given channel and initial state is precisely the counterpart of the swap transpose operation on couplings. That is, the swap transpose of the coupling $\Pi_{\Phi}$ corresponding to the channel $\Phi$ and initial state $\rho$ is the coupling $\Pi_{rec}$ corresponding to the Petz recovery map $\Phi_{rec}.$</description>

      <title>AdS$_4$ Boundary Wightman functions in Twistor Space: Factorization, Conformal blocks and a Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study real-time holographic four point Wightman functions involving scalars, photons, gluons and gravitons in the Poincare patch of AdS$_4$. We show that when the momenta of the middle two operators are spacelike, four-point exchange Wightman functions factorize into a product of three-point functions. This expression coincides with a Wightman conformal partial wave corresponding to the operator dual to the exchanged particle in the bulk. Further, we discuss and explicitly show how these results can be analytically continued to obtain Euclidean AdS correlators up to contact diagrams and avoid the need to perform any nested bulk point integrals in contrast to the traditional Witten diagram approach. We then translate our results to twistor space taking first steps towards a twistor space reformulation of four point Wightman functions. For conformally coupled scalars interacting with a cubic potential, we obtain a beautiful form for four and five point functions. For the interesting case of Yang-Mills theory and Einstein gravity, we derive a simple double copy relation. This is easiest to see when correlators are expressed in twistor space using Schwinger parameterization where the graviton correlator is simply the square of its gluon counterpart.</description>

      <title>Persistent-variable thermal compositional simulation of multiphase flow with phase separation in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal compositional multiphase flow in porous media with phase transitions involves complex nonlinear interactions among flow, transport, and phase equilibrium. This paper presents a persistent-variable formulation for thermal compositional flow using enthalpy to formulate the energy balance and the local equilibrium problem. Equilibrium conditions are derived from a thermodynamically consistent minimization problem using a persistent set of variables, allowing for seamless integration of equilibrium calculations into a fully coupled flow and transport model. This formulation does not require phase stability tests and provides a continuous and full mathematical description of the multiphysics system, suitable for challenging non-isothermal scenarios. To tackle the nonlinearities arising from phase transitions, we embed a local solver for the thermodynamic subproblem within a global Newton solver for the fully implicit system. The local solver exploits the locality of the subproblem for parallelization and leverages the modularity of the persistent-variable formulation for both isothermal and isenthalpic equilibrium conditions locally. We demonstrate the capability of our approach to simulate complex high-enthalpy systems, including narrow-boiling phenomena. The impact of the embedded local solver is analyzed through numerical experiments, demonstrating a reduction in global nonlinear iterations of up to 23 \% with increased use of the local solver. The number of local iterations is controlled with a local solver tolerance and no significant impact on the global iteration number was observed for local residual tolerances as high as $1e-3$. The persistent-variable approach using enthalpy and the modularity of the embedded local solver advance the usage of equilibrium calculations in multiphase flow simulations and are suitable for high-enthalpy applications.</description>

      <title>Phase mixing and the Vlasov equation in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Vlasov equation on slowly expanding isotropic homogeneous tori, described by the Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker cosmological spacetimes. For expansion rate $t^q$, with $0&lt; q&lt;\frac{1}{2}$ (excluding certain exceptional values), we show that the spatial density decays at the rate $t^{-6q}$ and that, when the spatial average is removed, the density decays at an enhanced rate due to a phase mixing effect. This enhancement is polynomial for Sobolev initial data and super-polynomial, but sub-exponential, for real analytic initial data. We further show that, when the expansion rate is the borderline $t^{\frac{1}{2}}$ -- the rate which describes a radiation filled universe -- a degenerate phase mixing effect results in a logarithmic enhancement for Sobolev initial data and a super-logarithmic enhancement (in fact, a gain of $\exp(-\mu(\log t)^{\epsilon})$ for some $\mu,\epsilon&gt;0$) for analytic initial data. The proof is based on a collection of commuting vector fields, and certain combinatorial properties of an associated collection of differential operators. The vector fields are not explicit, but are shown to have good properties when $t$ is large with respect to the momentum support of the solution. A physical space dyadic localisation is employed to treat non-compactly supported (in particular, non-trivial real analytic) but suitably decaying solutions.</description>

      <title>The operator layer cake theorem is equivalent to Frenkel's integral formula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The operator layer cake theorem provides an integral representation for the directional derivative of the operator logarithm in terms of a family of projections [arXiv:2507.06232]. Recently, the related work [arXiv:2507.07065] showed that the theorem gives an alternative proof to Frenkel's integral formula for Umegaki's relative entropy [Quantum, 7:1102 (2023)]. In this short note, we find a converse implication, demonstrating that the operator layer cake theorem is equivalent to Frenkel's integral formula.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a two-dimensional nitrogen crystalline structure on silver surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen, the most abundant element in Earth's atmosphere, exists as a diatomic gas under standard temperature and pressure. In the two-dimensional (2D) limit, atomically thin nitrogen, termed nitrogene, has been theoretically predicted to form crystalline materials with various polymorphic configurations, exhibiting diverse chemical and physical properties. However, the synthesis of nitrogene has remained elusive due to the strong nitrogen-nitrogen triple bonds. Here, we report experimental evidence of the formation of nitrogen-based crystalline structures compatible with nitrogene on silver surfaces via ion-beam-assisted epitaxy. Through a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the nitrogene-like structure adopts a puckered honeycomb lattice. Notably, our calculations predict a nitrogene band gap of up to 7.5 eV, positioning it as a promising candidate for ultraviolet optoelectronic devices and high-k dielectric applications.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers for continuous $N$-particle ensembles at fixed temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the Law of Large Numbers of averaged empirical measures of $N$-particle ensembles, in terms of the asymptotics of their Bessel generating functions, in the fixed temperature regime. This settles an open problem posed by Benaych-Georges, Cuenca and Gorin. For one direction, we use the moment method through Dunkl operators, and for the other we employ a special case of the formula of Chapuy--Dolega for the generating function of infinite constellations. As applications, we prove that the LLN for $\theta$-sums and $\theta$-corners of random matrices are given by the free convolution and free projection, respectively, regardless of the value of inverse temperature parameter $\theta$. We also prove the LLN for a time-slice of the $\theta$-Dyson Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Algebras with Two Areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational algebras on spacetimes with two extremal surfaces. In the example of a long wormhole with two asymptotic AdS boundaries and two compact extremal surfaces, we discuss the assignment of gravitational algebras to various regions bounded by the extremal surfaces and/or asymptotic boundaries. Using the split property, we construct type II algebras from the crossed product in the left exterior, right exterior, the middle ``python's lunch'' region, and their complement regions. We also study the case where only the area sum operator or area difference operator is included as part of the gravitational algebra. This can be achieved by picking the appropriate microcanonical ensemble, and these gravitational algebras can either be type II or type III depending on the region. In the case where we include only the area difference mode, the crossed product gives rise to a weight that restricts to a trace on the middle region. Differences of relative entropies with respect to this weight give differences in generalized entropies. This provides an algebraic understanding of the order parameter that controls the phase transitions between entanglement wedges. We emphasize the role of operator-valued weights used in our construction.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous $q$-Whittaker Polynomials I: Duality and Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of symmetric polynomials $\mathfrak{G}^{(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})}_{\lambda}$ arising from exactly solvable lattice models associated with the quantised loop algebra $\mathcal{U}_{q}(\mathfrak{sl}_{2}[z^\pm])$. The polynomials $\mathfrak{G}^{(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})}_{\lambda}$ unify $q$-Whittaker polynomials, inhomogeneous $q$-Whittaker polynomials, Grothendieck polynomials and their duals. Using Yang--Baxter equation, we derive Cauchy identities and combinatorial formulas for the transition coefficients.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility condition and stability of equilibria in the inverse-deformation approach to fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the irreversibility condition in fracture for the inverse-deformation approach using the second law of thermodynamics. We consider the problem of brittle failure in an elastic bar previously solved in (Rosakis et al 2021). Despite the presence of a non-zero interfacial/surface energy, the third derivative of the inverse-deformation map is discontinuous at the crack faces. This is due to the presence of the inequality constraint ensuring the inverse strain is nonnegative and the orientation of matter is preserved. A change in the material location of a crack results in negative entropy production, violating the second law. Consequently, such changes are disallowed giving the irreversibility condition. The inequality constraint and the irreversibility condition limit the space of admissible variations. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for local stability that incorporate these restrictions. Their numerical implementation shows that all broken equilibria found in (Rosakis et al 2021) are locally stable.</description>

      <title>The quantum integrable hierarchy for the Gromov-Witten theory of elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the quantum double ramification hierarchy associated with the Gromov-Witten theory of elliptic curves. We use results of Oberdieck and Pixton on the intersection numbers of the double ramification cycle, the Gromov-Witten classes of the elliptic curve and the Hodge class $\lambda_{g-1}$ together with vanishing results for $\lambda_{g-2}$ to produce a closed, modular expression for the resulting integrable hierarchy. It is the first explicit nontrivial example of a quantum integrable hierarchy from a cohomological field theory containing fermionic fields, which correspond to the odd classes in the cohomology of the elliptic curve.</description>

      <title>Modular Hamiltonian of the massive scalar field on the half line: A numerical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the modular Hamiltonian of an interval for the ground state of a massive free scalar field on the half line with Robin boundary conditions, by employing a numerical method. When the interval is adjacent to the boundary, we find numerical evidence that the modular Hamiltonian is non-local, except for the limiting cases of the massless scalar satisfying either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. When the interval is separated from the boundary, the numerical analysis indicates that the modular Hamiltonian is non-local for all these boundary conditions and any value of the mass.</description>

      <title>Infinity of solutions to initial-boundary value problems for linear constant-coefficient evolution PDEs on semi-infinite intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short communication, we announce an algorithmic procedure for constructing non-uniqueness counter-examples of classical solutions to initial-boundary-value problems for a wide class of linear evolution partial differential equations, of any order and with constant coefficients, formulated in a quarter-plane. Our approach relies on analysis of regularity and asymptotic properties, near the boundary of the spatio-temporal domain, of closed-form integral-representation formulae derived via complex-analytic techniques and rigorous implementation of the modern PDE technique known as Fokas unified transform method. In order to elucidate the novel idea and demonstrate the proposed technique in a self-contained fashion, we explicitly present its application to two concrete examples, namely the heat equation and the linear KdV equation with Dirichlet data. New uniqueness theorems for these two models are also presented herein.</description>

      <title>The initial-to-final-state inverse problem with unbounded potentials and Strichartz estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The initial-to-final-state inverse problem consists in determining a quantum Hamiltonian assuming the knowledge of the state of the system at some fixed time, for every initial state. We formulated this problem to establish a theoretical framework that would explain the viability of data-driven prediction in quantum mechanics. In a previous work, we analysed this inverse problem for Hamiltonians of the form $-\Delta + V$ with an electric potential $V = V({\rm t}, {\rm x})$, and we showed that uniqueness holds whenever the potentials are bounded and decay super-exponentially at infinity. In this paper, we extend this result for unbounded potentials. One of the key steps consists in proving a family of suitable Strichartz estimates -- including the corresponding endpoint of Keel and Tao.
  In the context of the inverse Calder\'on problem this family of inequalities corresponds to the Carleman inequality proved by Kenig, Ruiz and Sogge. Haberman showed that this inequality can be also retrieved as an embedding of a suitable Bourgain space. The corresponding Bourgain space in our context do not capture the mixed-norm Lebesgue spaces of Strichartz inequalities. In this paper, we give a counterexample that justifies this fact, and shows the limitations of Bourgain spaces to address the initial-to-final-state inverse problem.</description>

Abstract: This article concerns time-periodic solutions to a two-dimensional Sellers-type energy balance model coupled to the three-dimensional primitive equations via a dynamic boundary condition. It is shown that the underlying equations admit at least one strong time-periodic solution, provided the forcing term is time-periodic. The forcing term does not need to satisfy a smallness condition and is allowed to be arbitrarily large.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of the canonical Brownian motion in non-simple conformal loop ensemble gaskets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the canonical Brownian motion on the gasket of conformal loop ensembles (CLE$_\kappa$) for $\kappa \in (4,8)$ (which is the range of parameter values in which loops of the CLE$_\kappa$ can intersect themselves, each other, and the domain boundary). More precisely, we show that there is a unique diffusion process on the CLE$_\kappa$ gasket whose law depends locally on the CLE$_\kappa$ and satisfies certain natural properties such as translation-invariance and scale-invariance (modulo time change). We characterize the diffusion process by its resistance form and show in particular that there is a unique resistance form on the CLE$_\kappa$ gasket that is locally determined by the CLE$_\kappa$ and satisfies certain natural properties such as translation-invariance and scale-covariance. We conjecture that the CLE$_\kappa$ Brownian motion describes the scaling limit of simple random walk on statistical mechanics models in two dimensions that converge to CLE$_\kappa$. In future work the results of this paper will be used to show that this is the case with $\kappa=6$ for critical percolation on the triangular lattice.</description>

      <title>A High-Order Discretization Scheme for Surface Integral Equations for Analyzing the Electroencephalography Forward Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Nystrom-based high-order (HO) discretization scheme for surface integral equations (SIEs) for analyzing the electroencephalography (EEG) forward problem is proposed in this work. We use HO surface elements and interpolation functions for the discretization of the interfaces of the head volume and the unknowns on the elements, respectively. The advantage of this work over existing isoparametric HO discretization schemes resides in the fact that the interpolation points are different from the mesh nodes, allowing for the flexible manipulation of the order of the basis functions without regenerating the mesh of the interfaces. Moreover, the interpolation points are chosen from the quadrature rules with the same number of points on the elements simplifying the numerical computation of the surface integrals for the far-interaction case. In this contribution, we extend the implementation of the HO discretization scheme to the double-layer and the adjoint double-layer formulations, as well as to the isolated-skull-approach for the double-layer formulation and to the indirect adjoint double-layer formulation, employed to improve the solution accuracy in case of high conductivity contrast models, which requires the development of different techniques for the singularity treatment. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the accuracy, flexibility, and efficiency of the proposed scheme for the four SIEs for analyzing the EEG forward problem.</description>

      <title>Instantons meet resonances: Unifying two seemingly distinct approaches to quantum tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of quantum-mechanical tunneling processes, numerous approaches have been developed to determine the decay rate of states initially confined within a metastable potential region. Virtually all analytical treatments, however, fall into one of two superficially unrelated conceptual frameworks: the resonant-state approach and the instanton method. Whereas the concept of resonant states and their associated decay widths is grounded in physical reasoning by capturing the regime of uniform probability decay, the instanton method lacks a comparably clear physical interpretation. We demonstrate the equivalence of the two approaches, revealing that the contour-deformation prescription in the functional integral put forward by Callan and Coleman directly corresponds to the outgoing Gamow--Siegert boundary conditions defining resonant states.</description>

      <title>Operator Formalism for Laser-Plasma Wakefield Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an operator-based framework for laser--plasma wakefield acceleration (LPWA) in capillary discharges, providing a compact and systematic description of the coupled dynamics of laser fields and plasma response. The formalism employs key operators: the transverse modal operator $\hat{K}$, the nonlinear plasma operator $\hat{N}[\Psi]$, the plasma oscillation operator $\hat{\Omega}_p^{\,2}$, and the ponderomotive source operator $\hat{\alpha}$, which together describe mode coupling, plasma oscillations, and nonlinear feedback induced by the ponderomotive force. In the linear regime, the system is characterized by invariant subspaces associated with stable modal structures, while nonlinear interactions break these invariances, leading to mode mixing and complex dynamics. The approach establishes a direct connection between LPWA and Hilbert-space operator theory, including the invariant subspace, providing a formal mathematical interpretation of energy transfer and wakefield formation. Furthermore, the operator formalism integrates with neural operator methods, allowing efficient approximation of $\hat{N}$ and $\hat{\alpha}$ for reduced-order modeling and predictive control. This hybrid physics--AI framework offers a robust foundation for modeling, analysis, and optimization of high-intensity laser--plasma interactions in next-generation accelerator experiments.</description>

      <title>Structured Light at the Extreme: Harnessing Spatiotemporal Control for High-Field Laser-Matter Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review charts the emerging paradigm of intelligent structured light for high-field laser-matter interactions, where the precise spatiotemporal and vectorial control of light is a critical degree of freedom. We outline a transformative framework built upon three synergistic pillars. First, we survey the advanced electromagnetic toolkit, moving beyond conventional spatial light modulators to include robust static optics and the promising frontier of plasma light modulators. Second, we detail the optimization engine for this high-dimensional design space, focusing on physics-informed digital twins and AI-driven inverse design to automate the discovery of optimal light structures. Finally, we explore the groundbreaking applications enabled by this integrated approach, including programmable electron beams, orbital-angular-momentum-carrying {\gamma}-rays, compact THz accelerators, and robust communications. The path forward necessitates overcoming grand challenges in material science, real-time adaptive control at MHz rates, and the extension of these principles to the quantum realm. This review serves as a call to action for a coordinated, interdisciplinary effort to command, rather than merely observe, light-matter interactions at the extreme.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Backgrounds and Background Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we describe how the study of backgrounds for general quantum systems can be formulated in terms of the representation theory of abstract $C^*$ algebras. We illustrate our general framework through two example systems: superconductivity and perturbative quantum gravity. In both cases, spontaneously broken symmetries imply the existence of unitarily inequivalent Hilbert spaces that play the role of distinct backgrounds relative to which observables are measured. Background independence can be realized by gauging the broken symmetry; extending the algebra of observables for the theory to include new physical processes that intertwine between these disjoint representations. From the point of view of the background independent theory, different backgrounds have an interpretation as different vacuum expectation values of these intertwining operators. In superconductivity, the intertwiners are intimately related to the Josephson effect. In gravity, they are related to geometric fluctuations. We explain how this framework is connected to recent work on generalized symmetries and algebraic extensions. To this end, we close with some remarks about how the operator algebra of a closed universe may arise from a generalized symmetry associated with the inclusion of the causal wedge inside the entanglement wedge by appealing to subregion-subalgebra duality.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic formalism for continuous-time quantum Markov semigroups: the detailed balance condition, entropy, pressure and equilibrium quantum processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $M_n(\mathbb{C})$ denotes the set of $n$ by $n$ complex matrices. Consider continuous time quantum semigroups $\mathcal{P}_t= e^{t\, \mathcal{L}}$, $t \geq 0$, where $\mathcal{L}:M_n(\mathbb{C}) \to M_n(\mathbb{C})$ is the infinitesimal generator. If we assume that $\mathcal{L}(I)=0$, we will call $e^{t\, \mathcal{L}}$, $t \geq 0$ a quantum Markov semigroup. Given a stationary density matrix $\rho= \rho_{\mathcal{L}}$, for the quantum Markov semigroup $\mathcal{P}_t$, $t \geq 0$, we can define a continuous time stationary quantum Markov process, denoted by $X_t$, $t \geq 0.$ Given an {\it a priori} Laplacian operator $\mathcal{L}_0:M_n(\mathbb{C}) \to M_n(\mathbb{C})$, we will present a natural concept of entropy for a class of density matrices on $M_n(\mathbb{C})$. Given an Hermitian operator $A:\mathbb{C}^n\to \mathbb{C}^n$ (which plays the role of an Hamiltonian), we will study a version of the variational principle of pressure for $A$. A density matrix $\rho_A$ maximizing pressure will be called an equilibrium density matrix. From $\rho_A$ we will derive a new infinitesimal generator $\mathcal{L}_A$. Finally, the continuous time quantum Markov process defined by the semigroup $\mathcal{P}_t= e^{t\, \mathcal{L}_A}$, $t \geq 0$, and an initial stationary density matrix, will be called the continuous time equilibrium quantum Markov process for the Hamiltonian $A$. It corresponds to the quantum thermodynamical equilibrium for the action of the Hamiltonian $A$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is inspired by recent experimental observations in ultracold atomic Bose-Fermi mixtures [DeSalvo et al., Nature 568 (2019)]. These experiments reveal the emergence of an attractive fermion-mediated interaction between bosons, as well as a stability-instability transition. We give the first mathematical demonstration of this transition by studying the low-energy spectrum of a many-body interspecies Hamiltonian. More precisely, we show the convergence of its eigenvalues towards those of an effective Bose Hamiltonian, which includes fermion-mediated effects. Applying this result to a model with short-range potentials, we derive a stability-instability transition in the bosonic subsystem, driven by the Bose-Fermi coupling strength $g$. For small $|g|$, the bosons form a stable Bose-Einstein condensate with the energy per particle uniformly bounded from below. For large $|g|$, the energy per particle is no longer uniformly bounded from below, signaling the collapse of the condensate.</description>

      <title>Thermal boundary conditions in fractional superdiffusion of energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06952v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study heat conduction in a one-dimensional {finite},
  unpinned chain of atoms
  perturbed by stochastic momentum exchange and coupled to Langevin
  heat baths at {possibly} distinct temperatures placed at the
  endpoints of the chain.
  While infinite systems without boundaries are known to exhibit
  superdiffusive energy transport described by a fractional heat
  equation with the generator $-|\Delta|^{3/4}$,
  the corresponding boundary conditions induced by heat baths
  remain less understood.
  We establish the hydrodynamic limit for a finite chain with $n+1$
  atoms connected to thermostats at the endpoints,
  deriving the macroscopic evolution of the averaged energy profile.
  The limiting equation is governed by a non-local L\'evy-type operator,
  with boundary terms determined by explicit interaction kernels
  that encode absorption, reflection, and transmission of long-wavelength
  phonons at the baths. Our results provide the first rigorous identification
  of boundary conditions for fractional superdiffusion arising directly
  from microscopic dynamics with local interactions,
  highlighting their distinction from both diffusive and pinned-chain settings</description>

      <title>An analytic approach to the stress energy tensor in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a framework for quantum fields in curved spacetimes that possess a stress energy tensor as a connection one form on a suitable moduli space of metrics. In generic spacetimes the existence of such a tensor is thought to be a replacement for the existence of symmetries that the Minkowski theory relies on. It is shown that the local time-slice property and the implementability of local isometries is a consequence of the existence of a stress energy tensor that is a local field. We prove that the Klein-Gordon field, in an irreducible Fock representation in which the ground state is Hadamard, is an example. In this example we show that the scattering matrix for compactly supported metric perturbations exists in the Fock space and is smooth on a dense set with respect to the perturbation parameter. This generalises results by Dimock and Wald.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Eisenhart lift is extended to the case of dynamics described by action-dependent Lagrangians. The resulting Brinkmann metric depends on all coordinates. It is shown that the symmetries of the initial dynamics result in the existence of (conformal) Killing vectors of the Brinkmann metric. An example is given of equivalent time- and action-dependent descriptions which result in conformally equivalent metrics. It is also shown how the scaling invariance fits naturally into this scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complete optimal systems of subalgebras of all nonisomorphic three- and four-dimensional real Lie algebras are analyzed by the program SymboLie running in the computer algebra system Wolfram Mathematica\texttrademark. The approach uses the definition of $p$-families of Lie subalgebras whose set can be partitioned by introducing a binary relation (reflexive and transitive, though not necessarily symmetric) induced by inner automorphisms of the Lie algebra. The results, produced in a few minutes by SymboLie, represent a good test for the program; in fact, except for minor differences that are discussed, the results confirm those given in 1977 in a paper by Patera and Winternitz.</description>

Abstract: We extend the notion of regularized integrals introduced by Li-Zhou that aims to assign finite values to divergent integrals on configuration spaces of Riemann surfaces. We then give cohomological formulations for the extended notion using the tools of current cohomology and mixed Hodge structures. We also provide practical ways of constructing representatives of the corresponding cohomology classes in terms of smooth differential forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the ordinary or fractional Laplacian plus a homogeneous, scaling-critical drift term. This operator is non-symmetric but homogeneous, and generates scales of $L^p$-Sobolev spaces which we compare with the ordinary homogeneous Sobolev spaces. Unlike in previous studies concerning Hardy operators, i.e., ordinary or fractional Laplacians plus scaling-critical scalar perturbations, handling the drift term requires an additional, possibly technical, restriction on the range of comparable Sobolev spaces, which is related to the unavailability of gradient bounds for the associated semigroup.</description>

      <title>Constant maps in equivariant topological strings and geometric modeling of fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20444v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the equivariant generalization of topological strings on toric manifolds, focusing in particular on defining the contributions of constant maps in the genus expansion of the partition function. This approach regularizes the integration over non-compact Calabi-Yau spaces, producing finite results at each order in the expansion, as illustrated by a broad set of explicit examples. Our investigation highlights the geometric modeling of flux compactifications and clarifies the link between the effective supergravity framework and the equivariant topological string formalism, building on recent developments by Martelli and Zaffaroni. We conclude that the connection between topological string theory and supergravity/field theory involves switching between geometric moduli and fluxes, shedding light on the role of ensemble averages in string theory. We propose an exact non-perturbative holographic match with the corresponding M2-brane partition functions, which we test perturbatively at all orders in the gauge group rank $N$ in a companion paper. A special case of our proposal for vanishing flux reformulates the Ooguri-Strominger-Vafa conjecture within the equivariant topological string framework.</description>

      <title>Entropy Production in Non-Gaussian Active Matter: A Unified Fluctuation Theorem and Deep Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for deriving entropy production rates (EPRs) in active matter systems driven by non-Gaussian active fluctuations. Employing the probability-flow equivalence technique, we rigorously obtain an entropy production (EP) decomposition formula. We demonstrate that the EP, $\Delta s_\mathrm{tot}$, satisfies a detailed fluctuation theorem, $\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(\Sigma)/\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(-\Sigma)=e^{\Sigma}$, which holds for the distribution $\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(\Sigma)$ defined as the probability of observing a value $\Sigma$ of the quantity $\mathcal{R}\equiv \Delta s_\mathrm{tot}-B_\mathrm{act}$, where $B_\mathrm{act}$ is a path-dependent random variable associated with active fluctuations. Moreover, an integral fluctuation theorem, $\langle e^{- \mathcal{R} } \rangle = 1$, and the generalized second law of thermodynamics, $\langle \Delta s_\mathrm{tot} \rangle \ge \langle B_\mathrm{act} \rangle$, follow directly. Our results hold under steady-state conditions and can be straightforwardly extended to arbitrary initial states. In the limiting case where active fluctuations vanish, these theorems reduce to the established results of stochastic thermodynamics. Building on this theoretical foundation, we introduce a deep-learning-based methodology for efficiently computing the EP, utilizing the L\'{e}vy score we propose. To illustrate the validity of our approach, we apply it to two representative systems: a Brownian particle in a periodic active bath and an active polymer composed of an active Brownian cross-linker interacting with passive Brownian beads. Our work provides a unified framework for analyzing EP in active matter and offers practical computational tools for investigating complex nonequilibrium behavior.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the ergodic behavior of a system of particules, subject to collisions, before it exits a fixed subdomain of its state space. This system is composed of several one-dimensional ordered Brownian particules in interaction with electrostatic repulsions, which is usually referred as the (generalized) Dyson Brownian motion. The starting points of our analysis are the work [E. C{\'e}pa and D. L{\'e}pingle, 1997 Probab. Theory Relat. Fields] which provides existence and uniqueness of such a system subject to collisions via the theory of multivalued SDEs and a Krein-Rutman type theorem derived in [A. Guillin, B. Nectoux, L. Wu, 2020 J. Eur. Math. Soc.].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In supersymmetric theories, protected quantities can be reorganized into holomorphic-topological theories by twisting. Recently, it was observed by Jonsson, Kim and Young that residual super-Poincar\'e symmetries in certain twisted theories can receive higher corrections, turning them into $L_\infty$ algebras with non-strict actions on the twisted fields. In this note, we show that the same phenomenon occurs for the two admissible twists of eleven-dimensional supergravity. Along the way, we discuss in detail the connection between components of physical and twisted fields.</description>

Abstract: We consider a non-exchangeable system of interacting quantum particles with mean-field type interactions, subject to continuous measurement on dense graphs. In the mean-field limit, we derive a graphon-based quantum filtering system, establish its well-posedness, and prove propagation of chaos for multi-class bosonic systems with blockwise interactions. We then discuss applications to quantum state preparation and quantum graphon games.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a novel UV completion of a class of Argyres-Douglas (AD) theories in the $\Omega$-background by its embedding into the renormalisation group flow from five dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories (SCFT) on $S^1$. This is obtained via analysing these theories in the light of ($q$-)Painlev\'e/gauge theory correspondence, which allows to compute the five dimensional BPS partition functions as an expansion in the Wilson loop vev with integer $q$-polynomials coefficients. These are derived formulating the gauge theory on a blown-up geometry and using a five-dimensional lift of (topological) operator/state correspondence. We discuss in detail the phase diagram of the four dimensional limits, pinpointing the special AD loci. Explicit computations are reported for $\tilde E_1$ SCFT and its limit to H$_0=(A_1,A_2)$ AD theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the quantum-mechanics bootstrap to supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM) and to its matrix relative, the Marinari-Parisi model, which is conjectured to describe the worldvolume of unstable $D0$ branes. Using positivity of moment matrices together with Heisenberg, gauge, and (zero-temperature) thermal constraints, we obtain rigorous bounds on ground-state data. In the cases where SUSY is spontaneously broken, we find bounds that apply to the lowest-energy normalizable eigenstate.
  For $N = 1$ SUSY QM with a cubic superpotential, we obtain tight bounds that agree well with available approximation methods. At weak coupling they match well with the semiclassical instanton contribution to SUSY-breaking ground-state energy, while at strong coupling they exhibit the expected scaling and match well with Hamiltonian truncation.
  For the SUSY matrix QM, we construct a $44 \times 44$ bootstrap matrix and obtain bounds at large $N$. At strong coupling, we obtain the expected $E \sim \kappa \ g^{2/3}$ scaling of $E$ with $g$ and extract a lower bound on the coefficient $\kappa &gt; .196$. At small coupling, the theory has a critical point $g_c$ where the two wells merge into one. We find a spurious kink at $g = \sqrt{2} g_c$. We attribute this to truncation error and solver limitations, and discuss possible improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the theory of $R$-brackets, Baxter brackets and Nijenhuis brackets in the Banach setting, in particular in relation with Banach Poisson-Lie groups. The notion of Banach Lie-Poisson space with respect to an arbitrary duality pairing is crucial for the equations of motion to make sense. In the presence of a non-degenerate invariant pairing on a Banach Lie algebra, these equations of motion assume a Lax form. We prove a version of the Adler-Kostant-Symes theorem adapted to $R$-matrices on infinite-dimensional Banach algebras. Applications to the resolution of Lax equations associated to some Banach Manin triples are given. The semi-infinite Toda lattice is also presented as an example of this approach.</description>

      <title>Topological Thermodynamics of Black Holes: Revisiting the methods of winding numbers calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the equivalence between two methods for computing winding numbers is established: the approach of $\phi$-mapping topological current and the residue method. The methods are shown to be equivalent when the condition $M'' S' - S'' M' \neq 0$ holds, while deviations appear when this relation fails, signaling subtle connections between mass $M(r_h)$, entropy $S(r_h)$, and topological structure, with $r_h$ being the horizon radius. We first verify this equivalence to Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr"om black holes, recovering known classifications and confirming the consistency of our approach with respect to the validity of the above condition. We then extend the analysis to four-dimensional black strings, regarded as cylindrically symmetric black hole solutions in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. Our results show that both neutral and charged black strings possess the same global topological number, $W = +1$, implying that electric charge does not influence their topological classification. This insensitivity to charge mirrors earlier findings for BTZ black holes in three dimensions, suggesting that it may represent a universal property of cylindrically symmetric black holes in AdS backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Twisted (co)homology of non-orientable Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quasi-particle excitations in Weyl semimetals, known as Weyl fermions, are usually forced to emerge in charge-conjugate pairs by the Nielsen--Ninomiya theorem. When the Brillouin zone is non-orientable, this constraint is replaced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation, as a result of the chirality becoming ill-defined on such manifolds; this results in configurations with seemingly non-zero total chirality. Here, we set out to explain this behaviour from a purely topological perspective, and provide a classification of non-orientable Weyl semimetal topology in terms of exact sequences of twisted (co)homology groups. This leads to several discoveries of direct physical importance: in particular, we recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation in a coordinate-independent way, allowing meaningful limits to be set on its physical interpretation. A detailed discussion is provided on a specific Klein bottle-like topology induced by a momentum-space glide symmetry, including a full review of the insulating and semimetallic invariants of the system and a classification of the surface states on the non-orientable boundary. Beyond this, we provide a complete survey of all possible non-orientable Brillouin zones and their associated invariants, and extend our formalism into the realm of non-Hermitian topological physics and inversion-symmetric Weyl semimetals. Our work exemplifies the vast potential of fundamental mathematical descriptions to not only aid the corresponding physical intuition, but also predict novel and hitherto overlooked phenomena of great relevance throughout the physics research forefront.</description>
