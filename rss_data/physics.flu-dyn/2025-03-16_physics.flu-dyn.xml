      <title>Formation of a Single Bioconvection Spot in Euglena Suspension Induced by Negative Phototaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microorganisms are known to alter their motility in response to external stimuli. A typical example is the responseknown as taxis, which includes behaviors such as moving toward a light source (positive phototaxis) or away from it(negative phototaxis). In this study, we focused on bioconvection induced by the negative phototaxis of a Euglenasuspension exposed to strong light from the bottom. Recent studies have revealed that Euglena bioconvectioninduced by negative phototaxis exhibits localized structure. In a previous study, we found that a single Euglenabioconvection spot (EBC spot) maintains its structure in a cylindrical container. Such a localized structure is notexclusive to Euglena, but has also reported in red tide algae, suggesting that this is a universal feature ofbioconvection phenomena. In this paper, we investigated the formation conditions of EBC spot phenomena throughexperiments and numerical simulations. In the experiments, we examined the variation in EBC spot formation as afunction of suspension height and average cell density, revealing that the critical average cell density increases withsuspension height. In the numerical simulations, we conducted bioconvection simulations based on a model ofEuglena motility that incorporated three types of behavior: the negative gravitaxis, negative phototaxis, andbehavior of moving toward darker areas. Our model successfully reproduced the localized state of a two-dimensional EBC spot. Furthermore, calculations corresponding to the experimental conditions of suspension heightand average cell density revealed that the critical average cell density for bioconvection decreases as thesuspension height increases.</description>

      <title>Physics-constrained DeepONet for Surrogate CFD models: a curved backward-facing step case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Physics-Constrained DeepONet (PC-DeepONet), an architecture that incorporates fundamental physics knowledge into the data-driven DeepONet model, is presented in this study. This methodology is exemplified through surrogate modeling of fluid dynamics over a curved backward-facing step, a benchmark problem in computational fluid dynamics. The model was trained on computational fluid dynamics data generated for a range of parameterized geometries. The PC-DeepONet was able to learn the mapping from the parameters describing the geometry to the velocity and pressure fields. While the DeepONet is solely data-driven, the PC-DeepONet imposes the divergence constraint from the continuity equation onto the network. The PC-DeepONet demonstrates higher accuracy than the data-driven baseline, especially when trained on sparse data. Both models attain convergence with a small dataset of 50 samples and require only 50 iterations for convergence, highlighting the efficiency of neural operators in learning the dynamics governed by partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>A regional implementation of a mixed finite-element, semi-implicit dynamical core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores how to adapt a new dynamical core to enable its use in one-way nested regional weather and climate models, where lateral boundary conditions (LBCs) are provided by a lower-resolution driving model. The dynamical core has recently been developed by the Met Office and uses an iterated-semi-implicit time discretisation and mixed finite-element spatial discretisation.
  The essential part of the adaptation is the addition of the LBCs to the right-hand-side of the linear system which solves for pressure and momentum simultaneously. The impacts on the associated Helmholtz preconditioner and multigrid techniques are also described.
  The regional version of the dynamical core is validated through big-brother experiments based on idealised dynamical core tests. These experiments demonstrate that the subdomain results are consistent with those from the full domain, confirming the correct application of LBCs. Inconsistencies arise in cases where the LBCs are not perfect, but it is shown that the application of blending can be used to overcome these problems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Manipulation of Multiphase Fluid in Microgravity Using Photoresponsive Surfactant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of bubble motion is essential for improving efficiency and creating new functionalities in electrochemistry, heat transfer, and biomedical systems. Photoresponsive surfactants enable bubble manipulation by creating surface tension gradients, inducing a photo-Marangoni flow under illumination, without needing any engineered substrates, by leveraging a reversible switch in molecular conformation. Although previous studies have demonstrated bubble manipulation using photo-responsive surfactants, a comprehensive understanding of how fluid behavior is affected by critical parameters, such as bubble size, illumination, photo-switching kinetics, concentration, and adsorption desorption kinetics, remains elusive. Advances have been limited by the complex multiphysics processed involved, and by the fact that earth-bound experiments cannot study bubble photo-Marangoni dynamics without interference from bubble buoyancy and photo-thermal convection. We elucidate the factors enabling fast photo-Marangoni-driven bubble motion, by performing microgravity experiments, enabled by a bespoke photo-surfactant, complemented by a detailed modeling framework. We identify an optimal bubble size for migration, since smaller and larger bubbles incur weaker photo-Marangoni stresses and larger drag, respectively. Surfactants that switch rapidly under illumination drive fast migration, provided their reverse switch (in darkness) is much slower, yet not negligible. These foundational results enable the synthesis of next-generation photo-surfactants and photo-Marangoni manipulation across multiphase fluid systems.</description>

      <title>Multimodal nonlinear acoustics in two- and three-dimensional curved ducts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a weakly nonlinear model of duct acoustics in two and three dimensions (without flow). The work extends the previous work of McTavish &amp; Brambley (2019, J. Fluid Mech. 875, pp. 411-447) to three dimensions and significantly improves the numerical efficiency. The model allows for general curvature and width variation in two-dimensional ducts, and general curvature and torsion with radial width variation in three-dimensional ducts. The equations of gas dynamics are perturbed and expanded to second order, allowing for wave steepening and the formation of weak shocks. The resulting equations are then expanded temporally in a Fourier series and spatially in terms of straight duct modes, and a multi-modal method is applied, resulting in an infinite set of coupled ODEs for the modal coefficients. A linear matrix admittance and its weakly-nonlinear generalization to a tensor convolution are first solved throughout the duct, and then used to solve for the acoustic pressures and velocities. The admittance is useful in its own right, as it encodes the acoustic and weakly-nonlinear properties of the duct independently from the specific wave source used. After validation, a number of numerical examples are presented that compare two- and three-dimensional results, the effects of torsion, curvature and width variation, acoustic leakage due to curvature and nonlinearity, and the variation in effective duct length of a curved duct due to varying the acoustic amplitude. The model has potential future applications to sound in brass instruments. Matlab source code is provided in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Surface instabilities in laminar compressible boundary layers with sublimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface patterns on ablating materials are observed in high-speed ground and flight tests, but the mechanisms behind their formation are not known. In this paper, the origin of surface patterns is investigated via a local linear stability analysis of compressible laminar boundary layers over a flat camphor plate. The effects of sublimation and conjugate heat transfer are included both on the baseflow and the linear fluctuations. This framework identifies one mode that fully characterizes the stability of the surface, which becomes unstable when the wall temperature exceeds that of an adiabatic wall, $T_{ad}$. These findings are consistent with experimental observations, where laminar flow conditions at adiabatic wall temperatures are found to be stable. The analysis also reveals that the nature of this surface mode varies as a function of the oblique angle $\psi = \tan^{-1}{\beta/\alpha}$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the streamwise and spanwise wavenumbers. Specifically, for baseflow temperatures below $\approx 1.15~T_{ad}$, the surface mode is most unstable at $\psi = 0$. Conversely, above $\approx 1.15~T_{ad}$ the surface is most unstable near the sonic angle $\psi_s = \cos^{-1}(1/M_e)$, which is the angle at which the normal Mach number equals one. Finally, a critical wavenumber is identified (i.e., one at which the temporal growth rate reaches a maximum) that is in good agreement with available experimental observations of turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Flow-Aware Navigation of Magnetic Micro-Robots in Complex Fluids via PINN-Based Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While magnetic micro-robots have demonstrated significant potential across various applications, including drug delivery and microsurgery, the open issue of precise navigation and control in complex fluid environments is crucial for in vivo implementation. This paper introduces a novel flow-aware navigation and control strategy for magnetic micro-robots that explicitly accounts for the impact of fluid flow on their movement. First, the proposed method employs a Physics-Informed U-Net (PI-UNet) to refine the numerically predicted fluid velocity using local observations. Then, the predicted velocity is incorporated in a flow-aware A* path planning algorithm, ensuring efficient navigation while mitigating flow-induced disturbances. Finally, a control scheme is developed to compensate for the predicted fluid velocity, thereby optimizing the micro-robot's performance. A series of simulation studies and real-world experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach. This method enhances both planning accuracy and control precision, expanding the potential applications of magnetic micro-robots in fluid-affected environments typical of many medical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Wall Shear Stress Generated by a Bernoulli Pad: Experiments and Numerical Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bernoulli pads generate locally large wall shear stresses on workpieces, which can be used for cleaning, but may also damage delicate surfaces. This work presents direct measurements of the wall shear stress using constant temperature anemometry for the first time. A hot-film sensor was calibrated in the laminar and turbulent flow regimes using a purpose-built water flow channel. The calibrated sensor was then flush-mounted onto a smooth surface and a Bernoulli pad was traversed over the sensor and wall shear stress data were acquired. Numerical simulations of the flow field were also performed; they accurately predicted the maximum shear stress near the jet corner but over-predicted at large radii.</description>

      <title>A mesh-constrained discrete point method for incompressible flows with moving boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17542v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle-based methods are a practical tool in computational fluid dynamics, and novel types of methods have been proposed. However, widely developed Lagrangian-type formulations suffer from the nonuniform distribution of particles, which is enhanced over time and result in problems in computational efficiency and parallel computations. To mitigate these problems, a mesh-constrained discrete point (MCD) method was developed for stationary boundary problems (Matsuda et al., 2022). Although the MCD method is a meshless method that uses moving least-squares approximation, the arrangement of particles (or discrete points (DPs)) is specialized so that their positions are constrained in background meshes to obtain a closely uniform distribution. This achieves a reasonable approximation for spatial derivatives with compact stencils without encountering any ill-posed condition and leads to good performance in terms of computational efficiency. In this study, a novel meshless method based on the MCD method for incompressible flows with moving boundaries is proposed. To ensure the mesh constraint of each DP in moving boundary problems, a novel updating algorithm for the DP arrangement is developed so that the position of DPs is not only rearranged but the DPs are also reassigned the role of being on the boundary or not. The proposed method achieved reasonable results in numerical experiments for well-known moving boundary problems.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study on Boiling of Nanofluids in Copper Foam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanofluids are suspensions of nanoscale particles (such as metals and their oxides) in base fluids (such as water, oil, or alcohol), which can significantly enhance the heat transfer performance of the base fluid. However, when nanofluids are applied to heat pipes, it is common for nanoparticles to accumulate within the heat pipe's capillary wick, clogging it and increasing thermal resistance. This paper investigates the phenomenon of boiling of water and nanofluids enhanced by copper foam through experimental methods. When the liquid is injected into copper foam placed on a heating plate, some of the liquid is squeezed out along the boundary of the heated surface of the copper foam during boiling. This phenomenon is independent of gravity but related to the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the heating surface. Based on these properties, we design a device to guide the squeezed-out liquid to other locations, offering a promising solution to the problem of nanoparticle accumulation in the heat pipe's capillary wick.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the hydrodynamic modulation of short surface waves by longer waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic modulation of short ocean surface waves by longer ambient waves significantly influences remote sensing, interpretation of in situ wave measurements, and numerical wave forecasting. This paper revisits the wave crest and action conservation laws and derives steady, nonlinear, analytical solutions for the change of short-wave wavenumber, action, and gravitational acceleration due to the presence of longer waves. We validate the analytical solutions with numerical simulations of the full conservation equations. The nonlinear analytical solutions of short-wave wavenumber, amplitude, and steepness modulation significantly deviate from the linear analytical solutions of Longuet-Higgins &amp; Stewart (1960), and are similar to the nonlinear numerical solutions by Longuet-Higgins (1987) and Zhang &amp; Melville (1990). The short-wave steepness modulation is attributed 5/8 to wavenumber, 1/4 due to wave action, and 1/8 due to effective gravity. Examining the homogeneity and stationarity requirements for the conservation of wave action reveals that stationarity is a stronger requirement and is generally not satisfied for very steep long waves. We examine the results of Peureux et al. (2021) who found through numerical simulations that the short-wave modulation grows unsteadily with each long-wave passage. We show that this unsteady growth only occurs for homogeneous initial conditions as a special case and not generally. The proposed steady solutions are a good approximation of the nonlinear crest-action conservation solutions in long-wave steepness $\lesssim$ 0.2. Except for a subset of initial conditions, the solutions to the non-linearised crest-action conservation equations are mostly steady in the reference frame of the long waves.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic flow field and frictional resistance coefficient of a disk rotating steadily in a compressible fluid layer with odd viscosity on a rigid substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the hydrodynamics of a rotating disk in a two-dimensional compressible fluid layer with odd viscosity. Unlike conventional fluids, odd viscosity introduces a radial flow component that can be directed either inward or outward, depending on its sign. This phenomenon is expected to significantly impact the hydrodynamic interactions between two rotating disks, potentially causing effective attraction or repulsion depending on the sign of the odd viscosity and the direction of rotation. Furthermore, we calculate the rotational resistance coefficient and find that odd viscosity increases this coefficient, regardless of its sign.</description>
