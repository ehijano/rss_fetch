      <title>Ambient IoT towards 6G: Standardization, Potentials, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ambient Internet of Things (A-IoT) has emerged as a critical direction for achieving effective connectivity as the IoT system evolves to 6G. However, the introduction of A-IoT technologies, particularly involving backscatter modulation, poses numerous challenges for system design and network operations. This paper surveys current standardization efforts, highlights potential challenges, and explores future directions for A-IoT. It begins with a comprehensive overview of ongoing standardization initiatives by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) on A-IoT, providing a solid foundation for further technical research in both industry and academia. Building upon this groundwork, the paper conducts an analysis of critical enabling technologies for A-IoT. Moreover, a comprehensive A-IoT demonstration system is designed to showcase the practical viability and efficiency of A-IoT techniques, supported by field experiments. We finally address ongoing challenges associated with A-IoT technologies, providing valuable insights for future research endeavors.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Aided NOMA: Joint Antenna Positioning, Precoding, and Decoding Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates movable antenna (MA) aided non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for multi-user downlink communication, where the base station (BS) is equipped with a fixed-position antenna (FPA) array to serve multiple MA-enabled users. An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the minimum achievable rate among all the users by jointly optimizing the MA positioning of each user, the precoding matrix at the BS, and the successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding indicator matrix at the users, subject to a set of constraints including the limited movement area of the MAs, the maximum transmit power of the BS, and the SIC decoding condition. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose a two-loop iterative optimization algorithm that combines the hippopotamus optimization (HO) method with the alternating optimization (AO) method to obtain a suboptimal solution efficiently. Specifically, in the inner loop, the complex-valued precoding matrix and the binary decoding indicator matrix are optimized alternatively by the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique with customized greedy search to maximize the minimum achievable rate for the given positions of the MAs. In the outer loop, each user's antenna position is updated using the HO algorithm, following a novel nature-inspired intelligent optimization framework. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively avoid local optimum for highly coupled variables and significantly improve the rate performance of the NOMA system compared to the conventional FPA system as well as other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Distributed satellite information networks: Architecture, enabling technologies, and trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the vision of ubiquitous connectivity and wireless intelligence, the evolution of ultra-dense constellation-based satellite-integrated Internet is underway, now taking preliminary shape. Nevertheless, the entrenched institutional silos and limited, nonrenewable heterogeneous network resources leave current satellite systems struggling to accommodate the escalating demands of next-generation intelligent applications. In this context, the distributed satellite information networks (DSIN), exemplified by the cohesive clustered satellites system, have emerged as an innovative architecture, bridging information gaps across diverse satellite systems, such as communication, navigation, and remote sensing, and establishing a unified, open information network paradigm to support resilient space information services. This survey first provides a profound discussion about innovative network architectures of DSIN, encompassing distributed regenerative satellite network architecture, distributed satellite computing network architecture, and reconfigurable satellite formation flying, to enable flexible and scalable communication, computing and control. The DSIN faces challenges from network heterogeneity, unpredictable channel dynamics, sparse resources, and decentralized collaboration frameworks. To address these issues, a series of enabling technologies is identified, including channel modeling and estimation, cloud-native distributed MIMO cooperation, grant-free massive access, network routing, and the proper combination of all these diversity techniques. Furthermore, to heighten the overall resource efficiency, the cross-layer optimization techniques are further developed to meet upper-layer deterministic, adaptive and secure information services requirements. In addition, emerging research directions and new opportunities are highlighted on the way to achieving the DSIN vision.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communications in Downlink FDD MIMO without CSI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a precoding framework for frequency division duplex (FDD) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). Specifically, we aim to maximize ergodic sum spectral efficiency (SE) while satisfying a sensing beam pattern constraint defined by the mean squared error (MSE). Our method reconstructs downlink (DL) channel state information (CSI) from uplink (UL) training signals using partial reciprocity, eliminating the need for CSI feedback. To mitigate interference caused by imperfect DL CSI reconstruction and sensing operations, we adopt rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). We observe that the error covariance matrix of the reconstructed channel effectively compensates for CSI imperfections, affecting both communication and sensing performance. To obtain this, we devise an observed Fisher information-based estimation technique. We then optimize the precoder by solving the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, jointly updating the precoding vector and Lagrange multipliers, and solving the nonlinear eigenvalue problem with eigenvector dependency to maximize SE. The numerical results show that the proposed design achieves precise beam pattern control, maximizes SE, and significantly improves the sensing-communication trade-off compared to the state-of-the-art methods in FDD ISAC scenarios.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid Inference with On-Device Small and Remote Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12687v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a hybrid language model (HLM) architecture that integrates a small language model (SLM) operating on a mobile device with a large language model (LLM) hosted at the base station (BS) of a wireless network. The HLM token generation process follows the speculative inference principle: the SLM's vocabulary distribution is uploaded to the LLM, which either accepts or rejects it, with rejected tokens being resampled by the LLM. While this approach ensures alignment between the vocabulary distributions of the SLM and LLM, it suffers from low token throughput due to uplink transmission and the computation costs of running both language models. To address this, we propose a novel HLM structure coined Uncertainty-aware opportunistic HLM (U-HLM), wherein the SLM locally measures its output uncertainty and skips both uplink transmissions and LLM operations for tokens that are likely to be accepted. This opportunistic skipping is enabled by our empirical finding of a linear correlation between the SLM's uncertainty and the LLM's rejection probability. We analytically derive the uncertainty threshold and evaluate its expected risk of rejection. Simulations show that U-HLM reduces uplink transmissions and LLM computations by 45.93%, while achieving up to 97.54% of the LLM's inference accuracy and 2.54$\times$ faster token throughput than HLM without skipping.</description>

      <title>2D-AoI: Age-of-Information of Distributed Sensors for Spatio-Temporal Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The freshness of sensor data is critical for all types of cyber-physical systems. An established measure for quantifying data freshness is the Age-of-Information (AoI), which has been the subject of extensive research. Recently, there has been increased interest in multi-sensor systems: redundant sensors producing samples of the same physical process, sensors such as cameras producing overlapping views, or distributed sensors producing correlated samples. When the information from a particular sensor is outdated, fresh samples from other correlated sensors can be helpful. To quantify the utility of distant but correlated samples, we put forth a two-dimensional (2D) model of AoI that takes into account the sensor distance in an age-equivalent representation. Since we define 2D-AoI as equivalent to AoI, it can be readily linked to existing AoI research, especially on parallel systems. We consider physical phenomena modeled as spatio-temporal processes and derive the 2D-AoI for different Gaussian correlation kernels. For a basic exponential product kernel, we find that spatial distance causes an additive offset of the AoI, while for other kernels the effects of spatial distance are more complex and vary with time. Using our methodology, we evaluate the 2D-AoI of different spatial topologies and sensor densities.</description>

      <title>Shift-invariant spaces, bandlimited spaces and reproducing kernel spaces with shift-invariant kernels on undirected finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of graph shift-invariant space (GSIS) on an undirected finite graph, which is the linear space of graph signals being invariant under graph shifts, and we study its bandlimiting, kernel reproducing and sampling properties.
  Graph bandlimited spaces have been widely applied where large datasets on networks need to be handled efficiently. In this paper, we show that every GSIS is a bandlimited space, and every bandlimited space is a principal GSIS.
  Functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with shift-invariant kernel could be learnt with significantly low computational cost. In this paper, we demonstrate that every GSIS is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with a shift-invariant kernel.
  Based on the nested Krylov structure of GSISs in the spatial domain, we propose a novel sampling and reconstruction algorithm with finite steps, with its performance tested for well-localized signals on circulant graphs and flight delay dataset of the 50 busiest airports in the USA.</description>

      <title>Model agnostic signal encoding by leaky integrate and fire, performance and uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrate and fire is a resource efficient time-encoding mechanism that summarizes into a signed spike train those time intervals where a signal's charge exceeds a certain threshold. We analyze the IF encoder in terms of a very general notion of approximate bandwidth, which is shared by most commonly-used signal models. This complements results on exact encoding that may be overly adapted to a particular signal model. We take into account, possibly for the first time, the effect of uncertainty in the exact location of the spikes (as may arise by decimation), uncertainty of integration leakage (as may arise in realistic manufacturing), and boundary effects inherent to finite periods of exposure to the measurement device. The analysis is done by means of a concrete bandwidth-based Ansatz that can also be useful to initialize more sophisticated model specific reconstruction algorithms, and uses the earth mover's (Wassertein) distance to measure spike discrepancy.</description>

      <title>The free product of $q$-matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the free product of $q$-matroids, which is the $q$-analogue of the free product of matroids. We study the properties of this noncommutative binary operation, making an extensive use of the theory of cyclic flats. We show that the free product of two $q$-matroids $M_1$ and $M_2$ is maximal with respect to the weak order on $q$-matroids having $M_1$ as a restriction and $M_2$ as the complementary contraction. We characterise $q$-matroids that are irreducible with respect to the free product and we prove that the factorization of a $q$-matroid into a free product of irreducibles is unique up to isomorphism. We discuss the representability of the free product, with a particular focus on rank one uniform $q$-matroids and show that such a product is represented by clubs on the projective line.</description>

      <title>Age of Information Analysis for CR-NOMA Aided Uplink Systems with Randomly Arrived Packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the application of cognitive radio inspired non-orthogonal multiple access (CR-NOMA) to reduce age of information (AoI) for uplink transmission. In particular, a time division multiple access (TDMA) based legacy network is considered, where each user is allocated with a dedicated time slot to transmit its status update information. The CR-NOMA is implemented as an add-on to the TDMA legacy network, which enables each user to have more opportunities to transmit by sharing other user's time slots. A rigorous analytical framework is developed to obtain the expressions for AoIs achieved by CR-NOMA with and without re-transmission, by taking the randomness of the status update generating process into consideration. Numerical results are presented to verify the accuracy of the developed analysis. It is shown that the AoI can be significantly reduced by applying CR-NOMA compared to TDMA. Moreover, the use of re-transmission is helpful to reduce AoI, especially when the status arrival rate is low.</description>

      <title>The Guesswork of Ordered Statistics Decoding: Guesswork Complexity and Decoder Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates guesswork over ordered statistics and formulates the achievable guesswork complexity of ordered statistics decoding (OSD) in binary additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. The achievable guesswork complexity is defined as the number of test error patterns (TEPs) processed by OSD immediately upon finding the correct codeword estimate. The paper first develops a new upper bound for guesswork over independent sequences by partitioning them into Hamming shells and applying H\"older's inequality. This upper bound is then extended to ordered statistics, by constructing the conditionally independent sequences within the ordered statistics sequences. Next, we apply these bounds to characterize the statistical moments of the OSD guesswork complexity. We show that the achievable guesswork complexity of OSD at maximum decoding order can be accurately approximated by the modified Bessel function, which increases exponentially with code dimension. We also identify a guesswork complexity saturation threshold, where increasing the OSD decoding order beyond this threshold improves error performance without further raising the achievable guesswork complexity. Finally, the paper presents insights on applying these findings to enhance the design of OSD decoders.</description>

      <title>Joint Node Selection and Resource Allocation Optimization for Cooperative Sensing with a Shared Wireless Backhaul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a cooperative sensing framework in the context of future multi-functional network with both communication and sensing ability, where one base station (BS) serves as a sensing transmitter and several nearby BSs serve as sensing receivers. Each receiver receives the sensing signal reflected by the target and communicates with the fusion center (FC) through a wireless multiple access channel (MAC) for cooperative target localization. To improve the localization performance, we present a hybrid information-signal domain cooperative sensing (HISDCS) design, where each sensing receiver transmits both the estimated time delay/effective reflecting coefficient and the received sensing signal sampled around the estimated time delay to the FC. Then, we propose to minimize the number of channel uses by utilizing an efficient Karhunen-Lo\'eve transformation (KLT) encoding scheme for signal quantization and proper node selection, under the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) constraint and the capacity limits of MAC. A novel matrix-inequality constrained successive convex approximation (MCSCA) algorithm is proposed to optimize the wireless backhaul resource allocation, together with a greedy strategy for node selection. Despite the high non-convexness of the considered problem, we prove that the proposed MCSCA algorithm is able to converge to the set of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solutions of a relaxed problem obtained by relaxing the discrete variables. Besides, a low-complexity quantization bit reallocation algorithm is designed, which does not perform explicit node selection, and is able to harvest most of the performance gain brought by HISDCS. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to show that the proposed HISDCS design is able to significantly outperform the baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Residual-INR: Communication Efficient On-Device Learning Using Implicit Neural Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that collects and processes data at or near the source of data generation. The on-device learning at edge relies on device-to-device wireless communication to facilitate real-time data sharing and collaborative decision-making among multiple devices. This significantly improves the adaptability of the edge computing system to the changing environments. However, as the scale of the edge computing system is getting larger, communication among devices is becoming the bottleneck because of the limited bandwidth of wireless communication leads to large data transfer latency. To reduce the amount of device-to-device data transmission and accelerate on-device learning, in this paper, we propose Residual-INR, a fog computing-based communication-efficient on-device learning framework by utilizing implicit neural representation (INR) to compress images/videos into neural network weights. Residual-INR enhances data transfer efficiency by collecting JPEG images from edge devices, compressing them into INR format at the fog node, and redistributing them for on-device learning. By using a smaller INR for full image encoding and a separate object INR for high-quality object region reconstruction through residual encoding, our technique can reduce the encoding redundancy while maintaining the object quality. Residual-INR is a promising solution for edge on-device learning because it reduces data transmission by up to 5.16 x across a network of 10 edge devices. It also facilitates CPU-free accelerated on-device learning, achieving up to 2.9 x speedup without sacrificing accuracy. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sharc-lab/Residual-INR.</description>
