      <title>Parametric Instabilities of Correlated Quantum Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly correlated quantum materials exhibit a rich landscape of ordered phases with highly tunable properties, making them an intriguing platform for exploring non-equilibrium phenomena. A key to many of these phases is collective bosonic excitations, encoding fluctuations of the underlying order. In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework for parametric driving of such modes, whereby periodic modulation of microscopic parameters generates resonant two-boson processes. We show that the feasibility and strength of this drive depend sensitively on whether the targeted parameter alters the properties of the bosonic excitations vacuum, linking potential parametric instabilities directly to the fidelity susceptibility of the ground state. The driving facilitates nonthermal melting of the parent orders, as well as stabilization of novel steady states with experimentally distinct signatures. Through microscopic case-studies of correlated electronic systems, we identify promising driving knobs, highlight the role of quantum geometry in the collective modes susceptibility, and propose realistic experimental probes. Collective excitations are a powerful resource for steering correlated phases out of equilibrium, and will likely have several applications in quantum science. Our work provides the toolbox for controlling these excitations.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocal Zone Boundary Magnon Propagation in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering in the chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ reveals strong non-reciprocal effects on magnon propagation at the boundary of the nuclear Brillouin zone. The non-reciprocal response is strongest at a central position between the zone corner and edge mid-point. We explain these results using an effective linear spin-wave model. While directional effects in chiral magnets have so far only been known to exist at low momenta close to the center of the Brillouin zone, the present study shows that non-reciprocity persists at the highest possible reduced momenta. The observed magnons show very little damping within the limits of our experimental resolution, making them of great interest for the fundamental research on compact, high-frequency magnonic applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic structure evolution and magnetoelastic coupling across the spin reorientation transition in TmCrO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the magnetic structure evolution across the spin reorientation transition in orthorhombic (Pnma) TmCrO3. Magnetic susceptibility reveals canted antiferromagnetic (CAFM) ordering at T_N = 125 K, two compensation points (T_comp1 and T_comp2), followed by magnetization reversal with a magnetic susceptibility minimum between T_comp1 and T_comp2. Heat capacity shows a sharp lambda-type transition at T_N, associated with the long-range antiferromagnetic ordering of Cr, followed by a broad feature near 9 K. Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) establishes the Pn'm'a (Gamma2) magnetic structure below T_N. A gradual change in magnetic structure occurs during the spin-reorientation (SRO) transition below 30 K, where the magnetic symmetry transforms from Pn'm'a (Gamma2) to Pn'ma' (Gamma4) phase. However, below the SRO, neither Gamma2 nor Gamma4 alone adequately fit the intensity of magnetic reflections. A satisfactory refinement is achieved using the monoclinic subgroup P21'/c', derived from a combination of Gamma2 and Gamma4. The gradual SRO of Tm and Cr moments across the compensation regime is consistent with the magnetic symmetry P21'/c'. Furthermore, the ordered moments of Cr and Tm in TmCrO3 exhibit a complex, non-monotonic temperature dependence, with the Tm sublattice driving the spin-reorientation transition near the compensation point. Anomalies in the lattice parameters reveal strong magnetoelastic coupling, linking structural distortions to the SRO.</description>

      <title>Hidden symmetry-breaking in a kagome Ising ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome metals can host unconventional electronic phenomena that emerge from their frustrated lattice geometry and associated band topology. Correlated electronic orders, such as charge-density waves and superconductivity, are observed to intertwine with subtle time-reversal symmetry breaking whose microscopic origin is not currently understood. Here, we provide evidence for such time-reversal symmetry breaking in the kagome metal TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ arising from staggered magnetic moments within the kagome layers. TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ consists of metallic V kagome layers separated by Tb triangular layers that host Ising ferromagnetic order. Deep in the ferromagnetic state, the Tb Ising doublet ground state should display a single, dispersionless spin-flip excitation. Instead, inelastic neutron scattering reveals two sharp excitations associated with inequivalent Tb sites, demonstrating that a symmetry-broken phase coexists with Ising ferromagnetism. No additional structural or magnetic phase transitions are detected, and first-principles calculations rule out lattice distortions as the origin of the splitting. We attribute this effect to time-reversal symmetry breaking encoded by small V moments that couple to the Tb sublattice and leave a measurable spectral fingerprint. Our results establish rare-earth local moment spectroscopy as a sensitive probe of subtle broken symmetries and highlight an unexpected interplay between kagome magnetism and rare-earth local moment magnetism.</description>

      <title>Topological Metal-Insulator Transition within the Ferromagnetic state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in condensed matter physics is integrating topological phenomena with correlated electron physics to leverage both types of states for next-generation quantum devices. Metal-insulator transitions (MITs) are central to bridging these two domains while simultaneously serving as 'on-off' switches for electronic states. Here, we demonstrate how the prototypical material of K2Cr8O16 undergoes a ferromagnetic MIT accompanied by a change in band topology. Through inelastic x-ray and neutron scattering experiments combined with first-principles theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that this transition is not driven by a Peierls mechanism, given the lack of phonon softening. Instead, we establish the transition as a topological MIT within the ferromagnetic phase (topological-FM-MIT) with potential axionic properties, where electron correlations play a key role in stabilizing the insulating state. This work pioneers the discovery of a topological-FM-MIT and represents a fundamentally new class of topological phase transitions, revealing a unique pathway through which magnetism, topology, and electronic correlations interact.</description>

      <title>The pseudogap and strange metal states in the square-lattice Hubbard model: a comprehensive study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To clarify the origin of the pseudogap and strange metal states as well as their mutual relationship in cuprate superconductors, a comprehensive study on the spectral function, Fermi surface, resistivity and dynamical spin susceptivity of the Hubbard model on the square lattice has been conducted by means of the ladder dual-fermion approximation with an electron self-energy correction. It is found that the appearance of these two states requires that the characteristic hole concentration below which the Mott-Heisenberg and Slater mechanisms of electron localization occurs $p_{\rm MS}$ nearly coincides with the hole concentration where the Van Hove singularity (VHS) point is placed at the vicinity of the Fermi level. When this condition is met the VHS point is pined at which the nesting condition of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuation is fulfilled almost everywhere on the Fermi surface in wide range of the hole concentration in a metallic state, i.e., the strange metal state. The spin fluctuation of the strange metal state is nearly quantum critical and the dynamical spin susceptivity is well described by overdamped spin wave having the $\omega/T$ scaling with the relaxation rate at the Planckian limit. Because of these distinctive features of the strange metal state, the $k$ dependence of scattering rate of electrons is small and electrons behave as the marginal Fermi liquid, resulting in $T$-linear resistivity. In contrast, the pseudogap state is magnetically in the renormalized classical regime and the pseudogap is formed near the X point where the nesting condition of the short-range AFM order is fulfilled.</description>

      <title>Growth-Controlled Twinning and Magnetic Anisotropy in CeSb$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerium diantimonide (CeSb$_2$) is a layered heavy-fermion Kondo lattice material that hosts complex magnetism and pressure-induced superconductivity. The interpretation of its in-plane anisotropy has remained unsettled due to structural twinning, which superimposes orthogonal magnetic responses. Here we combine controlled crystal growth with magnetization and rotational magnetometry to disentangle the effects of twinning. Nearly untwinned high-quality single crystals reveal the intrinsic in-plane anisotropy: the in-plane easy axis saturates at $M_{\text{easy}}(4~\text{T}) \approx 1.8~\mu_{\text{B}}$/Ce, while the in-plane hard axis magnetization is strongly suppressed, nearly linear, and comparable to the out-of-plane response. These results resolve long-standing discrepancies in reported magnetic measurements, in which in-plane metamagnetic transition fields and saturation magnetization varied significantly across previous studies. Growth experiments demonstrate that avoiding the proposed $\alpha$-$\beta$ structural transition $-$ through Sb-rich flux and slower cooling $-$ systematically reduces twinning. However, powder X-ray diffraction and differential thermal analysis measurements show no clear evidence of a distinct $\beta$ phase. Our results establish a consistent magnetic phase diagram and provide essential constraints for crystal-electric field models, enabling a clearer understanding of the interplay between anisotropic magnetism and unconventional superconductivity in CeSb$_2$.</description>

      <title>Non-linear spin wave theory in the strong easy-axis limit of the triangular XXZ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental studies, we investigate the spectrum of the nearest-neighbour triangular XXZ model within the $1/S$ expansion, in the limit in which the exchange couplings present a strong easy-axis anisotropy $J_{xy}/J_{zz} \ll 1$. We show that in the limit in which $1/S \to 0$ and $J_{xy} \to 0$ at fixed $V = J_{zz}/(S J_{xy})$, the triangular spin model can be reduced to an effective boson model with quartic interactions on the honeycomb lattice. This effective model interpolates between a spin-wave ($V \to 0$) and a strong-coupling limit ($V \to \infty$), and encodes in a simple framework the regimes discussed by Kleine et al. [Z. Phys. B Condens. Matter 86, 405 (1992); 87, 103 (1992)]. For zero field, the classical ground state of the model presents an accidental degeneracy, which has a particularly simple form and which can be expressed in terms of a simple symmetry of the classical energy. The model thus offers a particularly transparent realization of a theory with quantum order-by-disorder and a pseudo-Goldstone mode. We analyze the spectrum at zero magnetic field by calculating the self-energy at one-loop order, using a self-consistent renormalization of the gap and the energy scale. Within the self-consistent approximation considered here, the corrections present a complex evolution as a function of $V$. We discuss the one-loop corrections in comparison with the spectrum observed experimentally in K$_{2}$Co(SeO$_{3}$)$_{2}$.</description>

      <title>Steady-states and response functions of the periodically driven O(N) scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of a relativistic, parametrically driven O($N$)-symmetric theory coupled to a Markovian thermal bath. Our analysis reveals a rich variety of phases, including both uniform and spatially modulated symmetry-broken states, some of which feature an order parameter oscillating at half the drive frequency. When coupled to a background electromagnetic potential, these phases exhibit a Meissner effect, in the sense that the photon acquires a mass term. However, if the order parameter oscillates around a sufficiently small value, a fraction of an externally applied magnetic field can penetrate the sample in the form of a standing wave. We dub this property a \textit{Meissner polariton}, that is, a collective mode resulting from the hybridization of light with order parameter oscillations. Furthermore, near the onset of symmetry breaking, strong fluctuations give rise to a superconducting-like response even in the absence of a Meissner effect or of a Meissner polariton. Our results are relevant to experiments on light-induced orders, particularly superconductivity.</description>

      <title>High-speed antiferromagnetic domain walls driven by coherent spin waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to rapidly manipulate domain walls (DWs) in magnetic materials is key to developing novel high-speed spintronic memory and computing devices. Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials present a particularly promising platform due to their robustness against stray fields and their potential for exceptional DW velocities. Among various proposed driving mechanisms, coherent spin waves could potentially propel AFM DWs to the magnon group velocity while minimizing dissipation from Joule heating. However, experimental realization has remained elusive due to the dual challenges of generating coherent AFM spin waves near isolated mobile AFM DWs and simultaneously measuring high-speed DW dynamics. Here we experimentally realize an approach where ultrafast laser pulses generate coherent spin waves that drive AFM DWs and develop a technique to directly map the spatiotemporal DW dynamics. Using the room-temperature AFM insulator Sr$_2$Cu$_3$O$_4$Cl$_2$, we observe AFM DW motion with record-high velocities up to ~50 km/s. Remarkably, the direction of DW propagation is controllable through both the pump laser helicity and the sign of the DW winding number. This bidirectional control can be theoretically explained, and numerically reproduced, by the DW dynamics induced by coherent spin waves of the in-plane magnon mode - a phenomenon unique to magnets with an easy-plane anisotropy. Our work uncovers a novel DW propulsion mechanism that is generalizable to a wide range of AFM materials, unlocking new opportunities for ultrafast coherent AFM spintronics.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in the two-dimensional Hubbard model revealed by neural quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether the ground state of the square lattice Hubbard model exhibits superconductivity re- mains a major open question, central to understanding high temperature cuprate superconductors and ultra-cold fermions in optical lattices. Numerical studies have found evidence for stripe-ordered states and superconductivity at strong coupling but the phase diagram remains controversial. Here, we show that one can resolve the subtle energetics of metallic, superconducting, and stripe phases using a new class of neural quantum state (NQS) wavefunctions that extend hidden fermion de- terminant states to Pfaffians. We simulate several hundred electrons using fast Pfaffian algorithms allowing us to measure off-diagonal long range order. At strong coupling and low hole-doping, we find that a non-superconducting filled stripe phase prevails, while superconductivity coexisting with partially-filled stripes is stabilized by a negative next neighbor hopping t-prime, with |t-prime| &gt; 0.1. At larger doping levels, we introduce momentum-space correlation functions to mitigate finite size effects that arise from weakly-bound pairs. These provide evidence for uniform d-wave superconductivity at U = 4, even when t-prime = 0. Our results highlight the potential of NQS approaches, and provide a fresh perspective on superconductivity in the square lattice Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Geometric Categories for Continuous Gauging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified categorical framework which encodes gauging of continuous and finite symmetries in arbitrary spacetime dimension. We show that electric symmetry breaking, resulting from the addition of charged matter, is implemented by this gauging procedure, and identify electric and magnetic symmetries expected in $G$-gauge theory. We work with geometric categories, i.e. categories internal to stacks. This allows us to extend (de)equivariantization of fusion categories to continuous groups, construct a functorial SymTFT and boundaries for this theory, and compute the relevant categories of endomorphisms and Drinfeld centers.</description>

      <title>Exact Results for the Spectrum of the Ising Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a semiclassical framework to determine scaling dimensions of neutral composite operators in scalar conformal field theories. For the critical Ising $\lambda\phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\epsilon$, we obtain the full spectrum of composite operators built out of $n$ fields transforming in the traceless-symmetric Lorentz representations to next-to-leading order in the double-scaling limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $\lambda \rightarrow 0$ with $\lambda n$ fixed. At any given order the semiclassical expansion resums an infinite number of Feynman diagrams. Combining our results with existing perturbative computations further yields the complete five-loop scaling dimensions in the $\epsilon$-expansion for the family of $\phi^n$ operators. Finally, in three dimensions the next-to-leading order semiclassical results supersede any other existing methodology for $n \gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10)$.</description>

      <title>Quantum annealing for lattice models with competing long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use superconducting qubit quantum annealing devices to determine the ground state of Ising models with algebraically decaying competing long-range interactions in the thermodynamic limit. This is enabled by a unit-cell-based optimization scheme, in which the finite optimizations on each unit cell are performed using commercial quantum annealing hardware. To demonstrate the capabilities of the approach, we choose three exemplary problems relevant for other quantum simulation platforms and material science: (i) the calculation of devil's staircases of magnetization plateaux of the long-range Ising model in a longitudinal field on the triangular lattice, motivated by atomic and molecular quantum simulators; (ii) the evaluation of the ground state of the same model on the Kagome lattice in the absence of a field, motivated by artificial spin ice metamaterials; (iii) the study of models with additional few-nearest-neighbor interactions relevant for frustrated Ising compounds with potential long-range interactions. The approach discussed in this work provides a useful and realistic application of existing quantum annealing technology, applicable across many research areas in which lattice problems with resummable long-range interactions are relevant.</description>

      <title>Anomaly induced transport from symmetry breaking in holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the transport properties of relativistic fluids induced by quantum anomalies in presence of explicit symmetry breaking. To this end we consider a holographic Einstein-Maxwell model in 5 dimensions with pure gauge and a mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons terms, coupled with a scalar field. To study the chiral vortical effects and the energy transport sector, apart from the chiral magnetic effects, we have considered the full backreaction of the gauge field on the metric. We have studied the anomalous effects by using Kubo formulae involving correlators of the charged currents and the energy current. Our findings reveal that, in the presence of explicit symmetry breaking, anomaly-induced transport phenomena can extend beyond anomalous currents and affect non-anomalous sectors as well. In particular, we find that all the conductivities display a distinct sensitivity to the mass parameter controlling the symmetry breaking, thus reflecting the interplay between anomaly coefficients and explicit symmetry breaking terms. These findings highlight the role played by pure gauge and mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies in holographic transport, and their importance for strongly coupled systems with broken symmetries.</description>

      <title>Stacking and the triviality of invertible phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the superselection sectors of two quantum lattice systems stacked onto each other in the operator algebraic framework. We show in particular that all irreducible sectors of a stacked system are unitarily equivalent to a product of irreducible sectors of the factors. This naturally leads to a faithful functor between the categories for each system and the category of the stacked system. We construct an intermediate `product' category which we then show is equivalent to the stacked system category. As a consequence, the sectors associated with an invertible state are trivial, namely, invertible states support no anyonic quasi-particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Mendon\c{c}a et al. [arXiv:2503.04961] investigated the Dicke-XXZ model and the Dicke-Ising model. For the latter model, their calculated quantum phase diagram contradicts claims about the existence of an intermediate phase with superradiant and antiferromagnetic order and the change in order of some phase transition lines, observed in other studies. In this comment we demonstrate that both features are indeed present in the Dicke-Ising model for the investigated parameter range in [arXiv:2503.04961].</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Euclidean Two-point Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a bootstrap approach to Euclidean two-point correlators, in the thermal or ground state of quantum mechanical systems. We formulate the problem of bounding the two-point correlator as a semidefinite programming problem, subject to the constraints of reflection positivity, the Heisenberg equations of motion, and the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition or ground-state positivity. In the dual formulation, the Heisenberg equations of motion become "inequalities of motion" on the Lagrange multipliers that enforce the constraints. This enables us to derive rigorous bounds on continuous-time two-point correlators using a finite-dimensional semidefinite or polynomial matrix program. We illustrate this method by bootstrapping the two-point correlators of the ungauged one-matrix quantum mechanics, from which we extract the spectrum and matrix elements of the low-lying adjoint states. Along the way, we provide a new derivation of the energy-entropy balance inequality and establish a connection between the high-temperature two-point correlator bootstrap and the matrix integral bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Nature of quantum criticality in the Ising ferromagnet TbV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ is a topological metal where ferromagnetic Tb ions with strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy interact with V kagome layers. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements show that the Tb ions adopt an Ising doublet ground state. Here, we consider whether a transverse magnetic field can drive TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ toward a quantum critical point, providing a rare example of transverse-field Ising criticality in a metallic compound. High-field magnetization measurements reveal a first-order-like spin-reorientation transition at 25.6 T. Our INS-based magnetic model finds that this is caused by an avoided crossing of an excited-state singlet with the ground-state doublet. Surprisingly, our model predicts that quantum critical and tricritical points are accessible within the range of experimentally determined model parameters and may be reached by varying the direction of an applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Generalized symmetry enriched criticality in (3+1)d</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct two classes of continuous phase transitions in 3+1 dimensions between gapped phases that break distinct generalized global symmetries. Our analysis focuses on $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory coupled to $N_f$ flavors of Majorana fermions in the adjoint representation. For $N$ even and sufficiently large odd $N_f$, upon imposing time-reversal symmetry and an $SO(N_f)$ flavor symmetry, the massless theory realizes a quantum critical point between a gapped phase in which a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ one-form symmetry is completely broken and a phase where it is broken to $\mathbb{Z}_2$, leading to $\mathbb{Z}_{N/2}$ topological order. We characterize the possible patterns of symmetry fractionalization in these phases and provide an explicit lattice model that exhibits the transition. The critical point has an enhanced symmetry, which includes non-invertible analogues of time-reversal symmetry. Enforcing a non-invertible time-reversal symmetry and the $SO(N_f)$ flavor symmetry, for $N$ and $N_f$ both odd, we demonstrate that this critical point can appear between a topologically ordered phase and a phase that spontaneously breaks the non-invertible time-reversal symmetry, furnishing an analogue of deconfined quantum criticality for generalized symmetries.</description>

      <title>Proximity-induced flat bands and topological properties in a decorated diamond chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present study, we propose a unique scheme to generate and control multiple flat bands in a decorated diamond chain by using a strain-induced proximity effect between the diagonal sites of each diamond plaquette. This is in complete contrast to the conventional diamond chain, in which the interplay between the lattice topology and an external magnetic flux leads to an extreme localization of the single-particle states, producing the flat bands in the energy spectrum. Such a strain-induced proximity effect will enable us to systematically control one of the diagonal hoppings in the decorated diamond chain, which will lead to the formation of both gapless and gapped flat bands in the energy spectrum. These gapless or gapped flat bands have been corroborated by the computation of the compact localized states amplitude distribution as well as the density of states of the system using a real space calculation. We have also shown that these flat bands are robust against the introduction of small amounts of random onsite disorder in the system. In addition to this, we have also classified the nontrivial topological properties of the system by calculating the winding numbers and edge states for the gapped energy spectrum. These findings could be easily realized experimentally using the laser-induced photonic lattice platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a real-frequency third-order strong-coupling impurity solver which employs quantics tensor cross interpolation (QTCI) for an efficient evaluation of the diagram weights. Applying the method to dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations of the single-band Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice, we clarify the interaction and temperature range in which the third-order approach yields accurate results. Since the calculations are implemented on the real-time/frequency axis, the detailed structure of spectral functions can be obtained without analytical continuation, as we demonstrate with examples for paramagnetic, antiferromagnetic and photo-doped states. Our work establishes a viable path toward high-order, real-frequency impurity solvers for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium DMFT studies.</description>

      <title>Probing Topological Phases in a Strongly Correlated Ladder Model via Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between non-trivial band topology and strong electronic correlations is a central challenge in modern condensed matter physics. We investigate this competition on a two-leg ladder model with a p-wave-like hybridisation between the legs. This model hosts a symmetry-protected topological phase in its non-interacting limit. Using the density-matrix renormalisation group algorithm, we compute the comprehensive quantum phase diagram in the presence of a repulsive inter-leg density-density interaction. Our analysis, based on entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectrum, reveals a fascinating dichotomy in the stability of the topological phase. We find a non-trivial change in the value of the edge entanglement entropy as we include interaction. Furthermore, we find that the phase boundary separating a trivial insulator phase and a topological one with winding number two remains robustly pinned at its non-interacting location, irrespective of the interaction strength. Variation of the effective conformal field theory's central charge near the critical line explains the robustness of the gap. In contrast, the transition to an insulating phase with winding number one is heavily renormalised, with the critical line shifting significantly as the interaction increases. By successfully mapping the phase diagram and identifying the distinct behaviours of the phase boundaries, our work clarifies how interactions can selectively preserve or destroy different aspects of a topological phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterostructures of two-dimensional materials offer a versatile platform to study light-matter interactions of electron and hole gases. By separating electron and hole layers with an insulator long-lived electron-hole bound states known as interlayer excitons can form. We predict that by placing an interlayer exciton in a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking chiral cavity the energy spectrum of an interlayer exciton can be reordered. As a consequence of this reordering the ground state of the interlayer exciton can be driven from an s-orbital to a p-orbital, effectively changing the symmetry of the electron-hole pair. We present a phase diagram showing the couplings and separations required for a p-orbital excitonic ground state where we predict that larger interlayer separations require higher cavity couplings. We expect these results to be relevant for angular-momentum-tunable, single photon emission physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light-matter interaction in frustrated Kagome metals enables access to hidden quantum states, yet the microscopic origin of symmetry breaking under ultrafast excitation remains elusive. Here, we uncover a microscopic mechanism for laser-induced symmetry breaking in RbV3Sb5 through first-principles real-time simulations. Selective excitation of a single-QM phonon mode dynamically breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries within the 2X2X1 charge density wave (CDW) superlattice. The resulting anisotropic lattice distortion lifts geometric frustration and stabilizes a nonequilibrium ferrimagnetic phase, accompanied by a sizable intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Distinct from prior interpretations based on orbital antiferromagnetism or extrinsic perturbations, our findings reveal a spin-driven pathway for symmetry breaking under strong optical fields. These results provide a microscopic foundation for exploring how spin, lattice and charge degrees of freedom are intertwined in nonequilibrium correlated states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Highly disordered NbN thin films exhibit promising superconducting and optical properties. Despite extensive study, discrepancies in its basic electronic properties persist. Analysis of the optical conductivity of disordered ultra-thin NbN films, obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry by standard Drude-Lorentz model, provides inconsistent parameters. We argue that this discrepancy arise from neglecting the presence of quantum corrections to conductivity in the IR range. To resolve this matter, we propose a modification to the Drude-Lorentz model, incorporating quantum corrections. The parameters obtained from the modified model are consistent not only with transport and superconducting measurements but also with ab initio calculations. The revisited values describing conduction electrons, which differ significantly from commonly adopted ones, are the electron relaxation rate $\Gamma\approx1.8~\textrm{eV}/\hbar$, the Fermi velocity $v_F \approx 0.7 \times 10^{6}~\textrm{ms}^{-1}$ and the electron density of states $N(E_F)=2~$states of both spins/eV/$V_{\textrm{f.u.}}$.</description>

      <title>From Light-Cone to Supersonic Propagation of Correlations by Competing Short- and Long-Range Couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.</description>

Abstract: Ultra-pure materials are highly valued as model systems for the study of intrinsic physics. Frequently, however, the crystal growth of such pristine samples requires significant optimization. PtSn$_4$ is a rare example of a material that naturally forms with a very low concentration of crystalline defects. Here, we investigate the origin of its low defect levels using a combination of electrical resistivity measurements, computational modeling, and scanning tunneling microscopy imaging. While typical flux-grown crystals of PtSn$_4$ can have residual resistivity ratios (RRRs) that exceed 1000, we show that even at the most extreme formation speeds, the RRR cannot be suppressed below 100. This aversion to defect formation extends to both the Pt and Sn sublattices, which contribute with equal weight to the conduction properties. Direct local imaging with scanning tunneling microscopy further substantiates the rarity of point defects, while the prohibitive energetic cost of forming a defect is demonstrated through density functional theory calculations. Taken together, our results establish PtSn$_4$ as an intrinsically defect-intolerant material, making it an ideal platform to study other properties of interest, including extreme magnetoresistance and topology.</description>
