      <title>Entanglement: Balancing Punishment and Compensation, Repeated Dilemma Game-Theoretic Analysis of Maximum Compensation Problem for Bypass and Least Cost Paths in Fact-Checking, Case of Fake News with Weak Wallace's Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research note is organized with respect to a novel approach to solving problems related to the spread of fake news and effective fact-checking. Focusing on the least-cost routing problem, the discussion is organized with respect to the use of Metzler functions and Metzler matrices to model the dynamics of information propagation among news providers. With this approach, we designed a strategy to minimize the spread of fake news, which is detrimental to informational health, while at the same time maximizing the spread of credible information. In particular, through the punitive dominance problem and the maximum compensation problem, we developed and examined a path to reassess the incentives of news providers to act and to analyze their impact on the equilibrium of the information market. By applying the concept of entanglement to the context of information propagation, we shed light on the complexity of interactions among news providers and contribute to the formulation of more effective information management strategies. This study provides new theoretical and practical insights into issues related to fake news and fact-checking, and will be examined against improving informational health and public digital health.</description>

      <title>Constitutional Implementation of Affirmative Action Policies in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.01483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: India is home to a comprehensive affirmative action program that reserves a fraction of positions at governmental institutions for various disadvantaged groups. While there is a Supreme Court-endorsed mechanism to implement these reservation policies when all positions are identical, courts have refrained from endorsing explicit mechanisms when positions are heterogeneous. This lacunae has resulted in widespread adoption of unconstitutional mechanisms, countless lawsuits, and inconsistent court rulings. Formulating mandates in the landmark Supreme Court judgment Saurav Yadav (2020) as technical axioms, we show that the 2SMH-DA mechanism is uniquely suited to overcome these challenges.</description>

      <title>On Locally Rationalizable Social Choice Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.05062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a notion of rationalizability, where the rationalizing relation may depend on the set of feasible alternatives. More precisely, we say that a choice function is locally rationalizable if it is rationalized by a family of rationalizing relations such that a strict preference between two alternatives in some feasible set is preserved when removing other alternatives. Tyson (2008) has shown that a choice function is locally rationalizable if and only if it satisfies Sen's $\gamma$. We expand the theory of local rationalizability by proposing a natural strengthening of $\gamma$ that precisely characterizes local rationalizability via PIP-transitive relations and by introducing the $\gamma$-hull of a choice function as its finest coarsening that satisfies $\gamma$. Local rationalizability permits a unified perspective on social choice functions that satisfy $\gamma$, including classic ones such as the top cycle and the uncovered set as well as new ones such as two-stage majoritarian choice and split cycle. We give simple axiomatic characterizations of some of these using local rationalizability and propose systematic procedures to define social choice functions that satisfy $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Robust Regulation of Firms' Access to Consumer Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05822v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper I study how to regulate firms' access to consumer data when the latter is used for price discrimination and the regulator faces non-Bayesian uncertainty about the correlation structure between data and willingness to pay, and hence about the way the monopolist will use the consumers' information to segment the market. I fully characterize all policies that are worst-case optimal when the regulator maximizes consumer surplus: the regulator allows the monopolist to access data if the monopolist cannot use the database to identify a small group of consumers. Furthermore, from the set of policies that achieve the largest worst-case consumer surplus, I identify the ones that are undominated; i.e., there is no alternative policy that never yields lower consumer surplus, and sometimes strictly higher consumer surplus.</description>
