      <title>Application of Large Language Models for Container Throughput Forecasting: Incorporating Contextual Information in Port Logistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated its substantial potential in various fields. However, its application in port logistics remains underexplored. Ports are complex operational environments where diverse types of contextual information coexist, making them a promising domain for the implementation of generative AI and highlighting the urgency of related research. In this study, we applied a large language model (LLM)-a leading generative AI technique-to forecast container throughput, which is a critical challenge in port logistics. To this end, we adopted a state-of-the-art LLM approach and proposed a novel prompt structure designed to incorporate the contextual characteristics of port operations. Extensive experiments confirm the superiority of our method, showing that the proposed approach outperforms competitive benchmark models. Furthermore, additional experiments revealed that LLMs can effectively learn and utilize multiple layers of contextual information for inference in port logistics. Based on these findings, we explore the key constraints affecting LLM adoption in this domain and outline future research directions aimed at addressing them. Accordingly, we offer both technical and practical insights to support the effective deployment of generative AI in port logistics.</description>

      <title>Generative AI and Machine Learning Collaboration for Container Dwell Time Prediction via Data Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Import container dwell time (ICDT) prediction is a key task for improving productivity in container terminals, as accurate predictions enable the reduction of container re-handling operations by yard cranes. Achieving this objective requires accurately predicting the dwell time of individual containers. However, the primary determinants of dwell time-owner information and cargo information-are recorded as unstructured text, which limits their effective use in machine learning models. This study addresses this limitation by proposing a collaborative framework that integrates generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) with machine learning. The proposed framework employs Gen AI to standardize unstructured information into standard international codes, with dynamic re-prediction triggered by electronic data interchange state updates, enabling the machine learning model to predict ICDT accurately. Extensive experiments conducted on real container terminal data demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves a 13.88% improvement in mean absolute error compared to conventional models that do not utilize standardized information. Furthermore, applying the improved predictions to container stacking strategies achieves up to 14.68% reduction in the number of relocations, thereby empirically validating the potential of Gen AI to enhance productivity in container terminal operations. Overall, this study provides both technical and methodological insights into the adoption of Gen AI in port logistics and its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>GA-Field: Geometry-Aware Vehicle Aerodynamic Field Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate aerodynamic field prediction is crucial for vehicle drag evaluation, but the computational cost of high-fidelity CFD hinders its use in iterative design workflows. While learning-based methods enable fast and scalable inference, accurately aerodynamic fields modeling remains challenging, as it demands capturing both long-range geometric effects and fine-scale flow structures. Existing approaches typically encode geometry only once at the input and formulate prediction as a one-shot mapping, which often leads to diluted global shape awareness and insufficient resolution of sharp local flow variations. To address these issues, we propose GA-Field, a Geometry-Aware Field prediction network that introduces two complementary design components: (i) a global geometry injection mechanism that repeatedly conditions the network on a compact 3D geometry embedding at multiple stages to preserve long-range geometric consistency, and (ii) a coarse-to-fine field refinement strategy to recover sharp local aerodynamic details. GA-Field achieves new state-of-the-art performance on ShapeNet-Car and the large-scale DrivAerNet++ benchmark for surface pressure, wall shear stress, and 3D velocity prediction tasks, while exhibiting strong out-of-distribution generalization across different vehicle categories.</description>

      <title>Surrogate impact modelling for crop yield assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the Surrogate Engine for Crop Simulations (SECS) a group of deep-learning models that emulate the process-based ECroPS model using only daily maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation. In this study we emulate grain maize and spring barley. Trained on ERA5-forced ECroPS simulations, SECS reproduces crop growth dynamics and harvest timing with high fidelity. Critically, SECS extremely reduces computational costs enabling ensemble-scale inference suitable for operational pipelines. When driven by seasonal data, SECS captures the interannual and spatial patterns of crop stress across Europe and aligns with independent monitoring, supporting its use as a probabilistic Areas of Concern indicator for early warning. Under CMIP6 SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, SECS consistently identifies the Mediterranean basin as a persistent hotspot of yield risk through mid-century, with central-northern Europe showing mixed signals. These results demonstrate that a streamlined, data-efficient emulator can provide robust seasonal-to-climate risk assessments at continental scale.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Heat Sink Efficiency in MOSFETs using Physics Informed Neural Networks: A Systematic Study on Coolant Velocity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a methodology using Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to determine the required velocity of a coolant, given inlet and outlet temperatures for a given heat flux in a multilayered metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). MOSFETs are integral components of Power Electronic Building Blocks (PEBBs) and experiences the majority of the thermal load. Effective cooling of MOSFETs is therefore essential to prevent overheating and potential burnout. Determining the required velocity for the purpose of effective cooling is of importance but is an ill-posed inverse problem and difficult to solve using traditional methods. MOSFET consists of multiple layers with different thermal conductivities, including aluminum, pyrolytic graphite sheets (PGS), and stainless steel pipes containing flowing water. We propose an algorithm that employs sequential training of the MOSFET layers in PINNs. Mathematically, the sequential training method decouples the optimization of each layer by treating the parameters of other layers as constants during its training phase. This reduces the dimensionality of the optimization landscape, making it easier to find the global minimum for each layer's parameters and avoid poor local minima. Convergence of the PINNs solution to the analytical solution is theoretically analyzed. Finally we show the prediction of our proposed methodology to be in good agreement with experimental results.</description>

      <title>WeirNet: A Large-Scale 3D CFD Benchmark for Geometric Surrogate Modeling of Piano Key Weirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20714v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable prediction of hydraulic performance is challenging for Piano Key Weir (PKW) design because discharge capacity depends on three-dimensional geometry and operating conditions. Surrogate models can accelerate hydraulic-structure design, but progress is limited by scarce large, well-documented datasets that jointly capture geometric variation, operating conditions, and functional performance. This study presents WeirNet, a large 3D CFD benchmark dataset for geometric surrogate modeling of PKWs. WeirNet contains 3,794 parametric, feasibility-constrained rectangular and trapezoidal PKW geometries, each scheduled at 19 discharge conditions using a consistent free-surface OpenFOAM workflow, resulting in 71,387 completed simulations that form the benchmark and with complete discharge coefficient labels. The dataset is released as multiple modalities compact parametric descriptors, watertight surface meshes and high-resolution point clouds together with standardized tasks and in-distribution and out-of-distribution splits. Representative surrogate families are benchmarked for discharge coefficient prediction. Tree-based regressors on parametric descriptors achieve the best overall accuracy, while point- and mesh-based models remain competitive and offer parameterization-agnostic inference. All surrogates evaluate in milliseconds per sample, providing orders-of-magnitude speedups over CFD runtimes. Out-of-distribution results identify geometry shift as the dominant failure mode compared to unseen discharge values, and data-efficiency experiments show diminishing returns beyond roughly 60% of the training data. By publicly releasing the dataset together with simulation setups and evaluation pipelines, WeirNet establishes a reproducible framework for data-driven hydraulic modeling and enables faster exploration of PKW designs during the early stages of hydraulic planning.</description>

      <title>SoK: Agentic Skills -- Beyond Tool Use in LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic systems increasingly rely on reusable procedural capabilities, \textit{a.k.a., agentic skills}, to execute long-horizon workflows reliably. These capabilities are callable modules that package procedural knowledge with explicit applicability conditions, execution policies, termination criteria, and reusable interfaces. Unlike one-off plans or atomic tool calls, skills operate (and often do well) across tasks.
  This paper maps the skill layer across the full lifecycle (discovery, practice, distillation, storage, composition, evaluation, and update) and introduces two complementary taxonomies. The first is a system-level set of \textbf{seven design patterns} capturing how skills are packaged and executed in practice, from metadata-driven progressive disclosure and executable code skills to self-evolving libraries and marketplace distribution. The second is an orthogonal \textbf{representation $\times$ scope} taxonomy describing what skills \emph{are} (natural language, code, policy, hybrid) and what environments they operate over (web, OS, software engineering, robotics).
  We analyze the security and governance implications of skill-based agents, covering supply-chain risks, prompt injection via skill payloads, and trust-tiered execution, grounded by a case study of the ClawHavoc campaign in which nearly 1{,}200 malicious skills infiltrated a major agent marketplace, exfiltrating API keys, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser credentials at scale. We further survey deterministic evaluation approaches, anchored by recent benchmark evidence that curated skills can substantially improve agent success rates while self-generated skills may degrade them. We conclude with open challenges toward robust, verifiable, and certifiable skills for real-world autonomous agents.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Ensemble Topology (GET): A New Explicit and Inherently Smooth Framework for Manufacture-Ready Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Gaussian Ensemble Topology (GET) method, a new explicit and manufacture-ready framework for topology optimization in which design geometries are represented as superpositions of anisotropic Gaussian functions. By combining explicit Gaussian descriptions with a level-set-like Heaviside projection, GET inherently generates smooth, curvature-continuous designs without requiring post-processing steps such as mesh or corner smoothing and feature extraction. The method is validated on standard compliance-minimization and compliant mechanism benchmarks in two and three dimensions. The optimized designs achieve objective values comparable to those obtained with classical Moving Morphable Component (MMC) approaches, but with geometrically consistent, refined boundaries. Numerical examples demonstrate additional advantages of the GET framework, including mesh independence inherent to explicit parameterizations, strong geometric expressiveness, and effective control over smoothness, discreteness, and structural complexity through parameter tuning. As a robust and manufacture-ready approach to explicit topology optimization, GET opens avenues for tackling advanced and complex design problems.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Mapping of 2D Drawing Annotations to 3D CAD Features Using LLM-Assisted Reasoning for Manufacturing Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manufacturing automation in process planning, inspection planning, and digital-thread integration depends on a unified specification that binds the geometric features of a 3D CAD model to the geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&amp;T) callouts, datum definitions, and surface requirements carried by the corresponding 2D engineering drawing. Although Model-Based Definition (MBD) allows such specifications to be embedded directly in 3D models, 2D drawings remain the primary carrier of manufacturing intent in automotive, aerospace, shipbuilding, and heavy-machinery industries. Correctly linking drawing annotations to the corresponding 3D features is difficult because of contextual ambiguity, repeated feature patterns, and the need for transparent and traceable decisions. This paper presents a deterministic-first, context-aware framework that maps 2D drawing entities to 3D CAD features to produce a unified manufacturing specification. Drawing callouts are first semantically enriched and then scored against candidate features using an interpretable metric that combines type compatibility, tolerance-aware dimensional agreement, and conservative context consistency, along with engineering-domain heuristics. When deterministic scoring cannot resolve an ambiguity, the system escalates to multimodal and constrained large-language-model reasoning, followed by a single human-in-the-loop (HITL) review step. Experiments on 20 real CAD-drawing pairs achieve a mean precision of 83.67%, recall of 90.46%, and F1 score of 86.29%. An ablation study shows that each pipeline component contributes to overall accuracy, with the full system outperforming all reduced variants. By prioritizing deterministic rules, clear decision tracking, and retaining unresolved cases for human review, the framework provides a practical foundation for downstream manufacturing automation in real-world industrial environments.</description>
