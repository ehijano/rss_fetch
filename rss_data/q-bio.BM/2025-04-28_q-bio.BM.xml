      <title>Enhanced Sampling, Public Dataset and Generative Model for Drug-Protein Dissociation Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug-protein binding and dissociation dynamics are fundamental to understanding molecular interactions in biological systems. While many tools for drug-protein interaction studies have emerged, especially artificial intelligence (AI)-based generative models, predictive tools on binding/dissociation kinetics and dynamics are still limited. We propose a novel research paradigm that combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, enhanced sampling, and AI generative models to address this issue. We propose an enhanced sampling strategy to efficiently implement the drug-protein dissociation process in MD simulations and estimate the free energy surface (FES). We constructed a program pipeline of MD simulations based on this sampling strategy, thus generating a dataset including 26,612 drug-protein dissociation trajectories containing about 13 million frames. We named this dissociation dynamics dataset DD-13M and used it to train a deep equivariant generative model UnbindingFlow, which can generate collision-free dissociation trajectories. The DD-13M database and UnbindingFlow model represent a significant advancement in computational structural biology, and we anticipate its broad applicability in machine learning studies of drug-protein interactions. Our ongoing efforts focus on expanding this methodology to encompass a broader spectrum of drug-protein complexes and exploring novel applications in pathway prediction.</description>

      <title>Action-Minimization Meets Generative Modeling: Efficient Transition Path Sampling with the Onsager-Machlup Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their ability to benefit from recent advances in atomistic machine learning, such as high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in contrast with bespoke, task-specific TPS models trained in previous work. We demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse, physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability.</description>
