      <title>Rawsamble: Overlapping and Assembling Raw Nanopore Signals using a Hash-based Seeding Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raw nanopore signal analysis is a common approach in genomics to provide fast and resource-efficient analysis without translating the signals to bases (i.e., without basecalling). However, existing solutions cannot interpret raw signals directly if a reference genome is unknown due to a lack of accurate mechanisms to handle increased noise in pairwise raw signal comparison. Our goal is to enable the direct analysis of raw signals without a reference genome. To this end, we propose Rawsamble, the first mechanism that can 1) identify regions of similarity between all raw signal pairs, known as all-vs-all overlapping, using a hash-based search mechanism and 2) use these to construct genomes from scratch, called de novo assembly.
  Our extensive evaluations across multiple genomes of varying sizes show that Rawsamble provides a significant speedup (on average by 16.36x and up to 41.59x) and reduces peak memory usage (on average by 11.73x and up to by 41.99x) compared to a conventional genome assembly pipeline using the state-of-the-art tools for basecalling (Dorado's fastest mode) and overlapping (minimap2) on a CPU. We find that 36.57% of overlapping pairs generated by Rawsamble are identical to those generated by minimap2. Using the overlaps from Rawsamble, we construct the first de novo assemblies directly from raw signals without basecalling. We show that we can construct contiguous assembly segments (unitigs) up to 2.7 million bases in length (half the genome length of E. coli). We identify previously unexplored directions that can be enabled by finding overlaps and constructing de novo assemblies. Rawsamble is available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/RawHash. We also provide the scripts to fully reproduce our results on our GitHub page.</description>

      <title>Proteome-wide prediction of mode of inheritance and molecular mechanism underlying genetic diseases using structural interactomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genetic diseases can be classified according to their modes of inheritance and their underlying molecular mechanisms. Autosomal dominant disorders often result from DNA variants that cause loss-of-function, gain-of-function, or dominant-negative effects, while autosomal recessive diseases are primarily linked to loss-of-function variants. In this study, we introduce a graph-of-graphs approach that leverages protein-protein interaction networks and high-resolution protein structures to predict the mode of inheritance of diseases caused by variants in autosomal genes, and to classify dominant-associated proteins based on their functional effect. Our approach integrates graph neural networks, structural interactomics and topological network features to provide proteome-wide predictions, thus offering a scalable method for understanding genetic disease mechanisms.</description>

      <title>TargetCall: Eliminating the Wasted Computation in Basecalling via Pre-Basecalling Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Basecalling is an essential step in nanopore sequencing analysis where the raw signals of nanopore sequencers are converted into nucleotide sequences, i.e., reads. State-of-the-art basecallers employ complex deep learning models to achieve high basecalling accuracy. This makes basecalling computationally inefficient and memory-hungry, bottlenecking the entire genome analysis pipeline. However, for many applications, the majority of reads do no match the reference genome of interest (i.e., target reference) and thus are discarded in later steps in the genomics pipeline, wasting the basecalling computation. To overcome this issue, we propose TargetCall, the first pre-basecalling filter to eliminate the wasted computation in basecalling. TargetCall's key idea is to discard reads that will not match the target reference (i.e., off-target reads) prior to basecalling. TargetCall consists of two main components: (1) LightCall, a lightweight neural network basecaller that produces noisy reads; and (2) Similarity Check, which labels each of these noisy reads as on-target or off-target by matching them to the target reference. Our thorough experimental evaluations show that TargetCall 1) improves the end-to-end basecalling runtime performance of the state-of-the-art basecaller by 3.31x while maintaining high (98.88%) recall in keeping on-target reads, 2) maintains high accuracy in downstream analysis, and 3) achieves better runtime performance, throughput, recall, precision, and generality compared to prior works. TargetCall is available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/TargetCall.</description>

      <title>RawAlign: Accurate, Fast, and Scalable Raw Nanopore Signal Mapping via Combining Seeding and Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanopore sequencers generate raw electrical signals representing the contents of a biological sequence molecule passing through the nanopore. These signals can be analyzed directly, avoiding basecalling entirely. We observe that while existing proposals for raw signal analysis typically do well in all metrics for small genomes (e.g., viral genomes), they all perform poorly for large genomes (e.g., the human genome). Our goal is to analyze raw nanopore signals in an accurate, fast, and scalable manner. To this end, we propose RawAlign, the first work to integrate fine-grained signal alignment into the state-of-the-art raw signal mapper. To enable accurate, fast, and scalable mapping with alignment, RawAlign implements three algorithmic improvements and hardware acceleration via a vectorized implementation of fine-grained alignment. Together, these significantly reduce the overhead of typically computationally expensive fine-grained alignment. Our extensive evaluations on different use cases and various datasets show RawAlign provides 1) the most accurate mapping for large genomes and 2) and on-par performance compared to RawHash (between 0.80x-1.08x), while achieving better performance than UNCALLED and Sigmap by on average (geo. mean) 2.83x and 2.06x, respectively.

      <title>Variational Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating an individual's potential outcomes under counterfactual treatments is a challenging task for traditional causal inference and supervised learning approaches when the outcome is high-dimensional (e.g. gene expressions, impulse responses, human faces) and covariates are relatively limited. In this case, to construct one's outcome under a counterfactual treatment, it is crucial to leverage individual information contained in its observed factual outcome on top of the covariates. We propose a deep variational Bayesian framework that rigorously integrates two main sources of information for outcome construction under a counterfactual treatment: one source is the individual features embedded in the high-dimensional factual outcome; the other source is the response distribution of similar subjects (subjects with the same covariates) that factually received this treatment of interest.</description>
