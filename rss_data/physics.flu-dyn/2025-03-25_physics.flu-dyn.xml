      <title>Challenges and Advancements in Modeling Shock Fronts with Physics-Informed Neural Networks: A Review and Benchmarking Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with discontinuous solutions , such as shock waves in multiphase viscous flow in porous media , is critical for a wide range of scientific and engineering applications, as they represent sudden changes in physical quantities. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), an approach proposed for solving PDEs, encounter significant challenges when applied to such systems. Accurately solving PDEs with discontinuities using PINNs requires specialized techniques to ensure effective solution accuracy and numerical stability. A benchmarking study was conducted on two multiphase flow problems in porous media: the classic Buckley-Leverett (BL) problem and a fully coupled system of equations involving shock waves but with varying levels of solution complexity. The findings show that PM and LM approaches can provide accurate solutions for the BL problem by effectively addressing the infinite gradients associated with shock occurrences. In contrast, AM methods failed to effectively resolve the shock waves. When applied to fully coupled PDEs (with more complex loss landscape), the generalization error in the solutions quickly increased, highlighting the need for ongoing innovation. This study provides a comprehensive review of existing techniques for managing PDE discontinuities using PINNs, offering information on their strengths and limitations. The results underscore the necessity for further research to improve PINNs ability to handle complex discontinuities, particularly in more challenging problems with complex loss landscapes. This includes problems involving higher dimensions or multiphysics systems, where current methods often struggle to maintain accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>TripNet: Learning Large-scale High-fidelity 3D Car Aerodynamics with Triplane Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are essential in product design, providing insights into fluid behavior around complex geometries in aerospace and automotive applications. However, high-fidelity CFD simulations are computationally expensive, making rapid design iterations challenging. To address this, we propose TripNet, Triplane CFD Network, a machine learning-based framework leveraging triplane representations to predict the outcomes of large-scale, high-fidelity CFD simulations with significantly reduced computation cost. Our method encodes 3D geometry into compact yet information-rich triplane features, maintaining full geometry fidelity and enabling accurate aerodynamic predictions. Unlike graph- and point cloud-based models, which are inherently discrete and provide solutions only at the mesh nodes, TripNet allows the solution to be queried at any point in the 3D space. Validated on high-fidelity DrivAerNet and DrivAerNet++ car aerodynamics datasets, TripNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in drag coefficient prediction, surface field estimation, and full 3D flow field simulations of industry-standard car designs. By utilizing a shared triplane backbone across multiple tasks, our approach offers a scalable, accurate, and efficient alternative to traditional CFD solvers.</description>

      <title>Vector Laplacian in Spherical Coordinates: An Unnoticed Typo in Landau and Lifshitz's Fluid Mechanics Course</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A previously unaccounted fundamental typo has been discovered in Course of Theoretical Physics, vol. 6, by Landau and Lifshitz Fluid Mechanics, 1987, Pergamon, which corresponds to the same typo in the Russian original of this book. This concerns the first of the Navier-Stokes equations in spherical coordinates, which includes the radial component of the vector Laplacian, namely, an extra square in the denominator of the sine. This error migrates to secondary publications and can complicate theoretical studies related to the application of the Navier-Stokes equations, which the author of this note has encountered first-hand. This typo is not present in An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics by Batchelor. The present short article makes a detailed derivation of the radial component of the vector Laplacian from general principles to show what the corresponding Navier-Stokes equation should look like, and that the typo is indeed present.</description>

      <title>A model for Reynolds-dependent linear instability in wall-bounded shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work demonstrated that alternative models to the "no-slip" boundary condition for incipient flow perturbations can produce linear instabilities that do not arise in the classical formulation. The present study introduces a Robin-type boundary condition with explicit Reynolds-number dependence, which leads to a more physically realistic transition to instability in wall-bounded shear flows. The results show that instability occurs within a Reynolds number range consistent with empirical observations. A physical interpretation of the modified boundary condition in terms of near-wall vorticity dynamics is discussed.</description>

      <title>PT-PINNs: A Parametric Engineering Turbulence Solver based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) demonstrate promising potential in parameterized engineering turbulence optimization problems but face challenges, such as high data requirements and low computational accuracy when applied to engineering turbulence problems. This study proposes a framework that enhances the ability of PINNs to solve parametric turbulence problems without training datasets from experiments or CFD-Parametric Turbulence PINNs (PT-PINNs)). Two key methods are introduced to improve the accuracy and robustness of this framework. The first is a soft constraint method for turbulent viscosity calculation. The second is a pre-training method based on the conservation of flow rate in the flow field. The effectiveness of PT-PINNs is validated using a three-dimensional backward-facing step (BFS) turbulence problem with two varying parameters (Re = 3000-200000, ER = 1.1-1.5). PT-PINNs produce predictions that closely match experimental data and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results across various conditions. Moreover, PT-PINNs offer a computational efficiency advantage over traditional CFD methods. The total time required to construct the parametric BFS turbulence model is 39 hours, one-sixteenth of the time required by traditional numerical methods. The inference time for a single-condition prediction is just 40 seconds-only 0.5% of a single CFD computation. These findings highlight the potential of PT-PINNs for future applications in engineering turbulence optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Volumetric density measurement in buoyant plumes using Tomographic Background Oriented Schlieren (TBOS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Buoyant plumes are encountered in both natural and artificial scenarios, ranging from volcanic ash clouds and wildfires to smoke from chimneys and industrial pollutant discharge to rivers and lakes. These plumes are driven by the buoyancy forces arising from the density differences between the plume and the ambient fluids. Measurements of three dimensional density field is limited in literature and not available for buoyant plumes. Such data can lead to better understanding of the pollutant dispersion as well as fundamental nature of concentration dispersion in three-dimensional and turbulent flow. We present the three-dimensional density field measurement in buoyant plumes, particularly for forced and lazy plumes, using an in-house developed experimental rig and associated processing software. The density field reconstruction has been obtained using the tomographic background-oriented Schlieren (TBOS) technique. The experimental rig consists of eight cameras, facing random dot backgrounds placed diametrically opposite, mounted circumferentially around the buoyant plume. For the dot displacement calculation, we use a cross-correlation method. A finite difference-based Poisson solver is employed to calculate projected integrated density. The reconstruction has been performed using the Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (SART). The three-dimensional density field data, thus obtained is validated using existing theoretical models in the literature. We demonstrate that the 3D density field can serve as valuable data for validating and improving theoretical models of plume dynamics e.g. for the lazy plumes the measured density field is effectively used to show the puffing phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Jet-noise reduction via streak generation in the nozzle boundary layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic and acoustic fields of turbulent jets issuing from nozzles modified with the addition of cylindrical tabs on the inner surface, one diameter upstream of the exit. The tabs were designed to promote significant growth of steady streaks in the nozzle turbulent boundary layer. A baseline smooth nozzle is also studied for comparison. Acoustic measurements are made using an azimuthal array for Mach numbers in the range 0.4 $\leq M_j \leq$ 0.9. The tabs are found to reduce the emitted sound levels by up to 3 dB/St. In terms of overall sound pressure levels (OASPL) reductions of up to 3 dB are observed at all measured polar angles in the range 20 deg $\leq \theta \leq$ 90 deg. Time-resolved particle image velocimetry (TR-PIV) experiments are conducted to measure the three components of velocity for a series of cross-stream planes at $M_j =$ 0.7. A Floquet-based Fourier decomposition is taken for the azimuthally periodic flow field, and spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) is then employed to extract coherent structures. Comparison of the structures obtained for nozzles with and without tabs shows an enhancement of the streaky structures by the tabs and a damping of Kelvin--Helmholtz (K--H) wavepackets. A linear model based on the one-way Navier--Stokes equations (OWNS) is employed to explore the underlying amplification mechanisms and how these are impacted by the tabs. The model reproduces the growth-attenuation mechanism observed in the data, showing that the changes in the mean flow induced by the streaks work to reduce the amplification of the noise-generating coherent structures associated with linear spatial growth mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Premixed flame quenching distance between cold walls: effects of flow and Lewis number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the critical conditions for flame propagation in channels with cold walls. We analyze the impact of the Lewis number and flow amplitude ($A$) on the minimum channel width required to sustain a premixed flame. Our results span a wide range of Lewis numbers, encompassing both aiding and opposing flow conditions. Results are presented for both variable and constant density models. A combined numerical approach, involving stationary and time-dependent simulations, is employed to determine quenching distances and solution stability. We find that smaller Lewis numbers and aiding flows ($A &lt; 0$) facilitate flame propagation in narrower channels, while opposing flows ($A &gt; 0$) tend to destabilize the flame, promoting asymmetric solutions. For sufficiently large positive values of $A$, the quenching distance is determined by asymmetric solutions, rather than the typical symmetric ones.</description>

      <title>Physics-Guided Multi-Fidelity DeepONet for Data-Efficient Flow Field Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an enhanced multi-fidelity deep operator network (DeepONet) framework for efficient spatio-temporal flow field prediction, with particular emphasis on practical scenarios where high-fidelity data is scarce. We introduce several key innovations to improve the framework's efficiency and accuracy. First, we enhance the DeepONet architecture by incorporating a merge network that enables more complex feature interactions between operator and coordinate spaces, achieving a 50.4% reduction in prediction error compared to traditional dot-product operations. We further optimize the architecture through temporal positional encoding and point-based sampling strategies, achieving a 7.57% improvement in prediction accuracy while reducing training time by 96% through efficient sampling and automatic mixed precision training. Building upon this foundation, we develop a transfer learning-based multi-fidelity framework that leverages knowledge from pre-trained low-fidelity models to guide high-fidelity predictions. Our approach freezes the pre-trained branch and trunk networks while making only the merge network trainable during high-fidelity training, preserving valuable low-fidelity representations while efficiently adapting to high-fidelity features. Through systematic investigation, we demonstrate that this fine-tuning strategy not only significantly outperforms linear probing and full-tuning alternatives but also surpasses conventional multi-fidelity frameworks by up to 76%, while achieving up to 43.7% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to single-fidelity training. The core contribution lies in our novel time-derivative guided sampling approach: it maintains prediction accuracy equivalent to models trained with the full dataset while requiring only 60% of the original high-fidelity samples.</description>

      <title>Cost-effective multi-fidelity strategy for the optimization of high-Reynolds number turbine flows guided by LES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cost-effective multi-objective shape optimization strategy is proposed for high-Reynolds number flows involving complex phenomena such as boundary layer transition, shock-wave interactions, and turbulent wakes. These processes are poorly captured by Reynolds-Averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) models, necessitating higher-fidelity approaches like Large Eddy Simulation (LES). However, LES is computationally prohibitive at high Reynolds numbers, making its direct use in optimization impractical. To address this, we introduce a low-dimensional design space representation using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and construct a multi-fidelity co-Kriging (MFK) surrogate model combining wall-resolved LES (WRLES) and RANS. Adaptive infill criteria are employed to strategically enrich the surrogate model within a limited computational budget (fewer than 10 LES samples). The methodology is applied to optimize a supersonic turbine vane for Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC), operating at Reynolds numbers of $\sim 10^6$. While RANS-LES correlation weakens near the optimal region, the MFK model outperforms single-fidelity Kriging (SFK) trained on the same LES data, effectively leveraging both abundant low-fidelity and scarce high-fidelity data. RANS accurately predicts global objective function trends but fails to resolve key flow features, whereas the MFK model captures fine-detail geometry trends from LES. Loss analysis reveals that LES is essential for identifying performance-detrimental mechanisms, while RANS-only optimization yields sub-optimal designs.</description>

      <title>On the ventilation of surface-piercing hydrofoils under steady-state conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study experimentally investigates the onset of ventilation of surface-piercing hydrofoils. Under steady-state conditions, the depth-based Froude number $Fr$ and the angle of attack $\alpha$ define regions where distinct flow regimes are either locally or globally stable. To map the boundary between these stability regions, the parameter space $(\alpha,Fr)$ was systematically surveyed by increasing $\alpha$ until the onset of ventilation, while maintaining a constant $Fr$. Two simplified model hydrofoils were examined: a semi-ogive profile with a blunt trailing edge and a modified NACA 0010-34. Tests were conducted in a towing tank under quasi-steady-state conditions for aspect ratios of $1.0$ and $1.5$, and $Fr$ ranging from $0.5$ to $2.5$. Ventilation occurred spontaneously for all test conditions as $\alpha$ increased. Three distinct trigger mechanisms were identified: nose, tail, and base ventilation. Nose ventilation is prevalent at $Fr&lt;1.0$ and $Fr&lt;1.25$ for aspect ratios of $1.0$ and $1.5$, respectively, and is associated with an increase in the inception angle of attack. Tail ventilation becomes prevalent at higher $Fr$, where the inception angle of attack takes a negative trend. Base ventilation was observed only for the semi-ogive profile but did not lead to the development of a stable ventilated cavity. Notably, the measurements indicate that the boundary between bistable and globally stable regions is not uniform and extends to significantly higher $\alpha$ than previously estimated. A revised stability map is proposed to reconcile previously published and current data, demonstrating how two alternative paths to a steady-state condition can lead to different flow regimes.</description>

      <title>On-the-fly Reduced-Order Modeling of the Filter Density Function with Time-Dependent Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dynamical low-rank approximation is developed for reduced-order modeling (ROM) of the filtered density function (FDF) transport equation, which is utilized for large eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent reacting flows. In this methodology, the evolution of the composition matrix describing the FDF transport via a set of Langevin equations is constrained to a low-rank matrix manifold. The composition matrix is approximated using a low-rank factorization, which consists of two thin, time-dependent matrices representing spatial and composition bases, along with a small time-dependent coefficient matrix. The evolution equations for spatial and composition subspaces are derived by projecting the composition transport equation onto the tangent space of the low-rank matrix manifold. Unlike conventional ROMs, such as those based on principal component analysis, both subspaces are time-dependent and the ROM does not require any prior data to extract the low-dimensional subspaces. As a result, the constructed ROM adapts on the fly to changes in the dynamics. For demonstration, LES via the time-dependent bases (TDB) is conducted of the canonical configuration of a temporally developing planar CO/H2 jet flame. The flame is rich with strong flame-turbulence interactions resulting in local extinction followed by re-ignition. The combustion chemistry is modeled via the skeletal kinetics, containing 11 species with 21 reaction steps. It is shown that the FDF-TDB yields excellent predictions of various statistics of the thermo-chemistry variables, as compared to the full-order model (FOM).</description>

      <title>Role of acoustic metasurface in the nonlinear mode-mode interaction and breakdown of hypersonic boundary layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundary-layer instability and transition control have drawn extensive attention from the hypersonic community. The acoustic metasurface has become a promising passive control method. Currently, the effects of the acoustic metasurface on the early and late transitional stages remain evidently less understood than the linear instability stage. In this study, the transitional stage of a flat-plate boundary layer at Mach 6 is investigated, with a particular emphasis on the nonlinear mode-mode interaction. The acoustic metasurface is modelled by the well-validated time domain impedance boundary condition (TDIBC). First, the resolvent analysis is performed to obtain the optimal disturbances, which reports two peaks corresponding to the oblique first mode and the planar Mack second mode. Subsequently, both optimal forcings are introduced upstream in the direct numerical simulation, which leads to pronounced detuned modes before breakdown. The takeaway is that the location of the acoustic metasurface is significant in minimizing skin friction and delaying transition onset simultaneously. The placement of the metasurface in the linearly unstable region of the second mode delays the transition, which is due to the suppressed streak in the oblique breakdown scenario. However, in the late stage of the transition, the acoustic metasurface induces an undesirable increment of skin friction overshoot due to the augmented shear-induced dissipation work, which mainly arises from reinforced detuned modes related to the combination resonance. Meanwhile, by restricting the location of the metasurface upstream of the overshoot region, this undesirable augment of skin friction can be eliminated. As a result, the reasonable placement of metasurface is crucial to damping the early instability while causing less negative impacts on the late transitional stage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of interpretability and generalisability in data-driven turbulence modelling remains a fundamental challenge for computational fluid dynamics applications. This study yields a generalisable advancement of the $k$-$\omega$ Shear Stress Transport (SST) model through a progressive data-augmented framework, combining Bayesian optimisation with physics-guided corrections to improve the predictions of anisotropy-induced secondary flows and flow separation simultaneously. Two interpretable modifications are systematically embedded: 1) a non-linear Reynolds stress anisotropy correction to enhance secondary flow predictions, and 2) an activation-based separation correction in the $omega$-equation, regulated by an optimised power-law function to locally adjust turbulent viscosity under adverse pressure gradients. The model is trained using a multi-case computational fluid dynamics-driven \textit{a posteriori} approach, incorporating periodic hills, duct flow, and channel flow to balance correction efficacy with baseline consistency. Validation across multiple unseen cases -- spanning flat-plate boundary layers, high-Reynolds-number periodic hills, and flow over diverse obstacle configurations -- demonstrates enhanced accuracy in velocity profiles, recirculation zones, streamwise vorticity, and skin friction distributions while retaining the robustness of the original $k$-$\omega$ SST in attached flows. Sparsity-enforced regression ensures reduced parametric complexity, preserving computational efficiency and physical transparency. Results underscore the framework's ability to generalise across geometries and Reynolds numbers without destabilising corrections, offering a validated framework toward deployable, data-augmented turbulence models for numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Parametric Dynamic Mode Decomposition with multi-linear interpolation for prediction of thermal fields of Al2O3-water nanofluid flows at unseen parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study proposes a data-driven model which combines the Dynamic Mode Decomposition with multi-linear interpolation to predict the thermal fields of nanofluid flows at unseen Reynolds numbers (Re) and particle volume concentrations ($\epsilon$). The flow, considered for the study, is laminar and incompressible. The study employs an in-house Fortran-based solver to predict the thermal fields of Al$_2$O$_3$-water nanofluid flow through a two-dimensional rectangular channel, with the bottom wall subjected to a uniform heat flux. The performance of two models operating in one- and two-dimensional parametric spaces are investigated. Initially, a DMD with linear interpolation (DMD-LI) based solver is used for prediction of temperature of the nanofluid at any Re $&gt;$ 100. The DMD-LI based model, predicts temperature fields with a maximum percentage difference of just 0.0273\%, in comparison with the CFD-based solver at Re =960, and $\epsilon$ = 1.0\%. The corresponding difference in the average Nusselt numbers is only 0.39\%. Following that a DMD with bi-linear interpolation (DMD-BLI) based solver is used for prediction of temperature of the nanofluid at any Re $&gt;$ 100 and $\epsilon$ $&gt;$ 0.5\%. The performance of two different ways of stacking the data are also examined. When compared to the CFD-based model, the DMD-BLI-based model predicts the temperature fields with a maximum percentage difference of 0.21 \%, at Re = 800 and $\epsilon$ = 1.35\%. And the corresponding percentage difference in the average Nusselt number prediction is only 6.08\%. All the results are reported in detail. Along side the important conclusions, the future scope of the study is also listed.</description>

      <title>Predicting airfoil pressure distribution using boundary graph neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surrogate models are essential for fast and accurate surface pressure and friction predictions during design optimization of complex lifting surfaces. This study focuses on predicting pressure distribution over two-dimensional airfoils using graph neural networks (GNNs), leveraging their ability to process non-parametric geometries. We introduce boundary graph neural networks (B-GNNs) that operate exclusively on surface meshes and compare these to previous work on volumetric GNNs operating on volume meshes. All of the training and evaluation is done using the airfRANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) database. We demonstrate the importance of all-to-all communication in GNNs to enforce the global incompressible flow constraint and ensure accurate predictions. We show that supplying the B-GNNs with local physics-based input-features, such as an approximate local Reynolds number $\mathrm{Re}_x$ and the inviscid pressure distribution from a panel method code, enables a $83\%$ reduction of model size and $87\%$ of training set size relative to models using purely geometric inputs to achieve the same in-distribution prediction accuracy. We investigate the generalization capabilities of the B-GNNs to out-of-distribution predictions on the S809/27 wind turbine blade section and find that incorporating inviscid pressure distribution as a feature reduces error by up to $88\%$ relative to purely geometry-based inputs. Finally, we find that the physics-based model reduces error by $85\%$ compared to the state-of-the-art volumetric model INFINITY.</description>

      <title>Scatterless interferences: Delay of laminar-to-turbulent flow transition by a lattice of subsurface phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent flows in boundary layers generate significantly higher surface friction drag compared to laminar flows. Avoidance or delay of laminar-to-turbulent flow transition is therefore critical for efficient operation of air vehicles and water vessels. Here we present a passive phonons-based solution that is based on engineered intervention with the unstable flow fluctuations that trigger the transition. The intervention is introduced by a tailored frequency- and wavevector-dependent interaction between the flow and the bounding surface. The surface is homogenous and smooth with all the engineered constituents buried in the subsurface. The subsurface configuration comprises a wall-parallel lattice of wall-normal phononic structural units. Each discrete phononic subsurface unit is designed to respond to the flow in a negative phase as to inhibit the flow instabilities at the point of contact. The collective effect of the lattice formation of these units, in turn, offers a form of interferences that causes the kinetic energy of the flow instabilities to decay downstream to the location of the intervention, thus delaying the transition. This concept presents a new paradigm for the design of aircrafts and ships beyond the prevailing paradigm of streamlined shaping of the surfaces.</description>

      <title>Model reduction of convection-dominated viscous conservation laws using implicit feature tracking and landmark image registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) remain generally unreliable for convection-dominated problems, such as those encountered in hypersonic flows, due to the slowly decaying Kolmogorov $n$-width of linear subspace approximations, known as the Kolmogorov barrier. This limitation hinders the accuracy of traditional ROMs and necessitates impractical amounts of training data during the offline phase. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel landmark-based registration procedure tailored for ROMs of convection-dominated problems. Our approach leverages limited training data and incorporates a nonlinear transformation of the data using a landmark-based registration technique combined with radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. During the offline phase, we align dominant convective features in a reference domain, resulting in a rapid decay of error relative to the reduced space dimension. Landmarks are generated through a three-step process: (1) detecting shocks via edge detection techniques, (2) sampling using Monte Carlo methods, and (3) domain partitioning with $k$-means clustering, where cluster centroids serve as landmarks. Accurate landmark correspondence is achieved by minimizing pairing distances for similar features. The online phase integrates standard minimum-residual ROM methodologies, extending the optimization space to include admissible domain mappings. We validate our approach on two test cases: a space-time Burgers' equation parameterized by the initial condition, and a hypersonic viscous flow over a cylinder parameterized by the Mach number. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in overcoming the Kolmogorov barrier and enhancing the reliability of ROMs for convection-dominated problems.</description>

      <title>Resonance frequency of different interfacial modes of a slug trapped in a milli-channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.09067v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several Lab on chip applications such as cell lysis, micromixing and micropumping are based on flows induced by acoustically excited oscillatory bubbles. For high efficiency, the system must be operated at its resonant frequency. In most systems the bubbles are present in a confined geometry where the resonant frequency is determined by the nature of confinement and its coupling with liquid flow. In this work, we determine the resonant frequencies corresponding to surface modes of oscillation of a rectangular gas slug confined at one end of a milli channel using perturbation techniques and matched asymptotic expansions. These are verified using simulations in Ansys Fluent and experimental results in similar geometry.</description>

      <title>Understanding the instability-wave selectivity of hypersonic compression ramp laminar flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hypersonic flow stability over a two-dimensional compression corner is studied using resolvent analysis, linear stability theory (LST) and parabolised stability equation (PSE). The authors find that the interaction between upstream convective-type disturbances and the laminar separation bubble can be divided into two regimes, whose behaviour can be well explained by comparative research. First, two-dimensional (2-D) high-frequency Mack modes neutrally oscillate with the presence of alternating stable and unstable regions inside the separation bubble. These discontinuous unstable regions are generated by repeated synchronisations between discrete modes with evolving branches. Through a modal sychronisation analysis, we report that the second modes upstream and downstream of the separation bubble can be essentially different from each other, since they originate from different branches of discrete modes due to flow separation. Second, the 2-D low-frequency `shear-layer mode' is found to be stable in the separation bubble by LST, whereas multiple unstable three-dimensional (3-D) eigenmodes are identified by LST. In general, three significant modes are dominant successively near the separation point, in the separation bubble and near the reattachment point. These modes are found to be sensitive to the streamline curvature effect. The locally dominant modes agree with the resolvent response in terms of the disturbance shape and the growth rate of energy. Thus, a combination of global and local analyses demonstrates that the separation bubble tends to selectively amplify low-frequency 3-D disturbances and `freeze' high-frequency Mack-mode disturbances in an explainable manner. These findings facilitate the understanding of the early evolution of low- and high-frequency instabilities in hypersonic separated flows.</description>

      <title>Unifying theory of scaling in drop impact: Forces &amp; maximum spreading diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of drop impact on a rigid surface -- omnipresent in nature and technology -- strongly depends on the droplet's velocity, its size, and its material properties. The main characteristics are the droplet's force exerted on the surface and its maximal spreading radius. The crucial question is: How do they depend on the (dimensionless) control parameters, which are the Weber number $We$ (non-dimensionalized kinetic energy) and the Ohnesorge number $Oh$ (dimensionless viscosity)? Here we perform direct numerical simulations over the huge parameter range $1\le We \le 10^3$ and $10^{-3}\le Oh \le 10^2$ and in particular develop a unifying theoretical approach, which is inspired by the Grossmann-Lohse theory for wall-bounded turbulence [J. Fluid Mech. 407, 27 (2000); PRL 86, 3316 (2001)]. The key idea is to split the energy dissipation rate into the different phases of the impact process, in which different physical mechanisms dominate. The theory can consistently and quantitatively account for the $We$ and $Oh$ dependences of the maximal impact force and the maximal spreading diameter over the huge parameter space. It also clarifies why viscous dissipation plays a significant role during impact, even for low-viscosity droplets (low $Oh$), in contrast to what had been assumed in prior theories.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic data-driven turbulence closure modeling by assimilating statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A framework for deriving probabilistic data-driven closure models is proposed for coarse-grained numerical simulations of turbulence in statistically stationary state. The approach unites the ideal large-eddy simulation model and data assimilation methods. The method requires a posteriori measured data to define stochastic flow perturbations, which are combined with a Bayesian statistical correction enforcing user-specified statistics extracted from high-fidelity flow snapshots. Thus, it enables computationally cheap ensemble simulations by combining knowledge of the local integration error and knowledge of desired flow statistics. A model example is given for two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection at Rayleigh number $\mathit{Ra}=10^{10}$, incorporating stochastic perturbations and an ensemble Kalman filtering step in a non-intrusive way. Physical flow dynamics are obtained, whilst kinetic energy spectra and heat flux are accurately reproduced in long-time ensemble forecasts on coarse grids. The model is shown to produce accurate results with as few as 20 high-fidelity flow snapshots as input data.</description>

      <title>Experimental validation of a linear momentum and bluff-body model for high-blockage cross-flow turbine arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a confined flow, the performance of a turbine and its near-wake fluid dynamics depend on the blockage ratio, defined as the ratio of the turbine projected area to the channel cross-sectional area. While blockage is understood to increase the power coefficient for turbine "fences" spanning a channel, most investigations at the upper range of practically-achievable blockage ratios have been theoretical or numerical in nature. Furthermore, while linear momentum actuator disk theory is frequently used to model turbines in confined flows, as confinement increases, the ability of this idealized model to describe performance and flow fields has not been established. In this work, the performance and near-wake flow field of a pair of cross-flow turbines are experimentally evaluated at blockage ratios from 30% to 55%. The fluid velocity measured in the bypass region is found to be well-predicted by the open-channel linear momentum model developed by Houlsby et al. (2008), while the wake velocity is not. Additionally, self-similar power and thrust coefficients are identified across this range of blockage ratios when array performance is scaled by the modeled bypass velocity following Whelan et al.'s (2009) adaptation of the bluff-body theory of Maskell (1963). This result demonstrates that, despite multiple non-idealities, relatively simple models can quantitatively describe highly confined turbines. From this, an analytical method for predicting array performance as a function of blockage is presented. Overall, this work illustrates turbine performance at relatively high confinement and demonstrates the suitability of analytical models for predicting and interpreting their hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>The effective use of BLAS interface for implementation of finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical methods of the ADER family, in particular finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods, are among the most accurate numerical methods for solving quasilinear hyperbolic PDE systems. The internal structure of ADER-DG and ADER-WENO numerical methods contains a large number of basic linear algebra operations related to matrix multiplications. The main interface of software libraries for matrix multiplications for high-performance computing is BLAS. An effective method for integration the standard functions of the BLAS interface into the implementation of these numerical methods is presented. The calculated matrices are small matrices; and this allows to use effectively JIT technologies. The proposed approach immediately operates on AoS, which allows to efficiently calculate flux, source and non-conservative terms without transposition. The obtained computational costs demonstrated that the effective implementation, based on the use of the JIT functions of the BLAS, outperformed both the implementation based on the general BLAS functions and the vanilla implementations by several orders of magnitude. The complexity of developing an implementation based on the proposed approach does not exceed the complexity of developing a vanilla implementation. Performance analysis using roofline partly explains the observed features of the decreasing of computational costs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing machine learning turbulence model generalizability via tensor basis normalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques, the development and study of machine learning turbulence models have become increasingly prevalent. As a critical component of turbulence modeling, the constitutive relationship between the Reynolds stress tensor and the mean flow quantities, modeled using machine learning methods, faces a pressing challenge: the lack of generalizability. To address this issue, we propose a novel tensor basis normalization technique to improve machine learning turbulence models, grounded in the general effective-viscosity hypothesis. In this study, we utilize direct numerical simulation (DNS) results of periodic hill flows as training data to develop a symbolic regression-based turbulence model based on the general effective-viscosity hypothesis. Furthermore, we construct a systematic validation dataset to evaluate the generalizability of our symbolic regression-based turbulence model. This validation set includes periodic hills with different aspect ratios from the training dataset, zero pressure gradient flat plate flows, three-dimensional incompressible flows over a NACA0012 airfoil, and transonic axial compressor rotor flows. These validation cases exhibit significant flow characteristics and geometrical variations, progressively increasing their differences from the training dataset. Such a diverse validation set is a robust benchmark to assess the generalizability of the proposed turbulence model. Finally, we demonstrate that our symbolic regression-based turbulence model performs effectively across validation cases, encompassing various separation features, geometries, and Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Investigation of pressure balance in proximity of sidewalls in deterministic lateral displacement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) is a popular technique for size-based separation of particles. One of the challenges in design of DLD chips is to eliminate the disturbance of fluid flow patterns caused by channel sidewalls intersecting with the pillars matrix. While there are numerous reports in the literature attempting to mitigate this issue by adjusting the gaps between pillars on the sidewalls and the closest ones residing on the bulk grid of DLD array, there are only few works that also configure the axial gap of pillars adjacent to accumulation sidewall to maintain a desired local pressure field. In this work, we study various designs numerically to investigate the effects of geometrical configurations of sidewalls on critical diameter and first stream flux fraction variations across channel. Our results show that regardless of the model used for boundary gap profile, applying a pressure balance scheme can improve the separation performance by reducing the critical diameter variations. In particular, we found that for a given boundary gap distribution, there can be two desired parameter sets with relatively low critical diameter variations. One is related to sufficiently low lateral resistance of interface unit cells next to accumulation sidewall, while the other one emerges by reducing the axial resistance of the interface unit cells to an appropriate extent. We believe that this work can pave the way for designing DLD systems with improved performance, which can be critically important for applications such as separation of rare cells, among others, wherein target species need to be concentrated into as narrow a stream as possible downstream of device to enhance purity and recovery rate simultaneously.</description>

Abstract: We present an exact analytic solution for decaying incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Our solution reveals a dual formulation in terms of two interacting Euler ensembles--one for hydrodynamic and another for magnetic circulation. This replaces empirical scaling laws with an infinite set of power terms with calculable decay exponents, some of which appear as complex-conjugate pairs related to the Riemann zeta function. A key result of our analysis is the explicit dependence of the solution on the Prandtl number ($\mathrm{Pr} = \nu/\eta$), leading to a phase transition at $\mathrm{Pr} = 1$. In the $\mathrm{Pr}&lt;1$ regime, turbulence is dominated by hydrodynamic fluctuations, while for $\mathrm{Pr}&gt;1$, two distinct solutions emerge: a metastable one in which magnetic fluctuations grow with $\mathrm{Pr}$ and a stable one where they remain balanced with hydrodynamic fluctuations. We compare our theoretical predictions with recent direct numerical simulations (DNS) and discuss their implications for astrophysical plasmas, fusion devices, and laboratory MHD experiments. Our results provide a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding MHD turbulence and its dependence on fundamental parameters, offering a new perspective on turbulence in highly conducting fluids.</description>

Abstract: When a water drop falls from a faucet, the drop is created with the formation of an axisymmetric constriction region, which thins down to breakup. Near the singularity of the breakup the physics at small scales becomes important, which could lead to universal dynamics independent of the scales setting the initial boundary conditions, as if memories were lost. This is true in the drop breakup surrounded by air or less viscous fluid, but not in the bubble breakup surrounded by more viscous fluid, under no geometrical confinement. Recently, it has been reported that the axisymmetry at the constriction region can be broken when a system of bubble breakup is confined. Here, we focus on the confined and non-axisymmetric breakup and find its dynamics self-similar: shapes of the liquid-air interface at different times collapsing onto a master curve. Unexpectedly, the master curve depends on the smallest among the length scales setting the initial boundary conditions but not on the other scales: The system retains partial memory, acquiring an incomplete universality by broken symmetry. Furthermore, we find the collapse is space-time dependent: the collapse onto the linear region of the master curve near the breakup tip persists for long time after breakup, while the parabolic region away from the tip is observed only for short time. We elucidate the physics in our findings, including the space-time dependent collapse, exploiting analogy with critical phenomena, which has guided recent developments across physics.</description>
