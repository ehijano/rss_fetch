      <title>Conjugacy languages and conjugacy growth relative to subsets of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore conjugacy languages when the base problem is the generalized conjugacy problem (with constraints): given $g\in G$ and $U\subset G$, does $g$ have a conjugate in $U$ (with conjugators in a certain subset)? To do so, for subsets $U,V\subseteq G$, we define the corresponding languages $\text{ConjGeo(U,V)}$, $\text{CycGeo(U)}$, $\text{ConjSL(U)}$ and $\text{ConjMinLenSL(U,V)}$, following the previously studied cases where $U=V=G$. Our results cover several classes of groups: for free groups, we prove that $\text{ConjGeo(U,V)}$ and $\text{ConjMinLenSL(U,V)}$ are regular if $U$ and $V$ are rational subsets; for hyperbolic groups, we show that if $L$ is a regular language of geodesics and $U$ is the subsets represented by it, then $\text{ConjGeo(U)}$ and $\text{ConjMinLenSL(U)}$ are regular; for virtually cyclic groups, we show that $\text{ConjSL(U)}$ is regular if $U$ is rational; and, for virtually abelian groups, we prove that $\text{ConjGeo(U)}$ belongs to a certain class of languages $\C$ when the language of words representing elements of $U$ also belongs to $\C$. We also define relative conjugacy growth and show that its behavior can be heavily dependent on the choice of subset.</description>

      <title>$L^2$-torsion of automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of $L^2$-torsion of an automorphism of a group and compute it for every automorphism of a group which is hyperbolic and one-ended relative to a finite collection of virtually polycyclic groups. We also prove a combination formula for the $L^2$-torsion of a group in terms of the $L^2$-torsion of its stabilisers of a sufficiently nice action on a contractible space. We apply it to compute the $L^2$-torsion of a selection of CAT(0) lattices, of many relatively hyperbolic groups and their automorphisms, of higher dimensional graph manifolds, and of handlebody groups.</description>

      <title>Effects of semigroup properties on local embeddability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether semigroups with a given property which are also locally embeddable into finite semigroups can be locally embedded into finite semigroups with the same property, obtaining a positive answer for completely simple and Clifford semigroups (similarly to group and inverse semigroup cases studied previously) and a negative answer for $\J$-trivial semigroups (similarly to cancellative semigroups). Additionally, we resolve the standing question on the differences between local embeddability in and local wrappability by finite structures, providing a novel construction of $\J$-trivial semigroups which satisfy the latter, but not the former.</description>

      <title>Residual Finiteness Growth in Minimax Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $g\in G$ is a non-trivial element in a residually finite group, then there exists by definition a finite group $Q$ and a homomorphism $\varphi: G \to Q$ such that $\varphi(g) \neq e$. The residual finiteness growth $\text{RF}_G$ of a finitely generated residually finite group $G$ estimates the size of $Q$ in terms of the word norm $\|g\|$ of the element $g\in G$. This function has been studied for several classes of groups, including free groups, lamplighter groups and nilpotent groups.
  For finitely generated linear groups $G\leq \text{GL}(m, \mathbb{C})$ this function is known to be bounded by $\text{RF}_G(r) \preceq r^{m^2+1}$, which is quadratic in $m$. This paper establishes an improved bound of the form $\text{RF}_G(r) \preceq r^{4k}$ with $k$ the Pr\"ufer rank of $G$ for certain virtually solvable linear groups, namely minimax groups, a class which includes virtually polycyclic and Baumslag-Solitar groups. Moreover, the upper bound is invariant under taking finite extensions, and also establishes an improved polylogarithmic version for virtually nilpotent groups, generalizing the known exact bound for virtually abelian groups. If the group is not virtually nilpotent, we prove that $\text{RF}_G(r)$ is at least linear, improving a recent result.</description>

      <title>Twisted homological stability for handlebody mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove twisted homological stability for handlebody mapping class groups. Using the categorical framework developed by Randal-Williams and Wahl, we establish that the homology of the handlebody groups stabilises with respect to both genus and the number of marked boundary discs, for all coefficient systems of finite degree. Our first main theorem refines and extends the twisted stability result for handlebodies outlined by Randal-Williams and Wahl, allowing any number of marked discs and boundary points. We then introduce the notion of coefficient bisystem to treat stability under variation of boundary markings. As an application, we deduce homological stability for moduli spaces of 3-dimensional handlebodies equipped with tangential structures.</description>

      <title>Introducing GRAFHEN: Group-based Fully Homomorphic Encryption without Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present GRAFHEN, a new cryptographic scheme which offers Fully Homomorphic Encryption without the need for bootstrapping (or in other words, without noise). Building on the work of Nuida and others, we achieve this using encodings in groups.
  The groups are represented on a machine using rewriting systems. In this way the subgroup membership problem, which an attacker would have to solve in order to break the scheme, becomes maximally hard, while performance is preserved. In fact we include a simple benchmark demonstrating that our implementation runs several orders of magnitude faster than existing standards.
  We review many possible attacks against our protocol and explain how to protect the scheme in each case.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on the essential dimension of reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a technique for proving lower bounds on the essential dimension of split reductive groups. As an application, we strengthen the best previously known lower bounds for various split simple algebraic groups, most notably for the exceptional group $E_8$. In the case of the projective linear group $\operatorname{PGL}_n$, we recover A. Merkurjev's celebrated lower bound with a simplified proof. Our technique relies on decompositions of loop torsors over valued fields due to P. Gille and A. Pianzola.</description>

      <title>Amenability and skew-amenability of actions of topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and study notions of amenability and skew-amenability of continuous actions of topological groups on compact topological spaces. Our main motivation is the question under what conditions amenability of a topological group passes to a closed subgroup. Other applications include the understanding of the universal minimal flow of various non-amenable groups.</description>

      <title>Random permutations acting on $k$--tuples have near--optimal spectral gap for $k=\mathrm{poly}(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Friedman's theorem to show that, for any fixed $r&gt;1$, a random $2r$--regular Schreier graph associated with the action of $r$ uniformly random permutations of $[n]$ on $k_{n}$--tuples of distinct elements in $[n]$ has a near--optimal spectral gap with high probability, provided $k_{n}\leq n^{\frac{1}{20}-\epsilon}.$ Previously this was known only for $k$--tuples where $k$ is fixed. In fact, we prove the stronger result of strong convergence of random permutations in irreducible representations of quasi--exponential dimension.
  Along the way, we give a new bound for the expected stable irreducible character of a random permutation obtained via a word map, showing that $\mathbb{E}\left[\chi^{\mu}\left(w(\sigma_{1},\dots,\sigma_{r})\right)\right]=O\left(\frac{1}{\dim\chi^{\mu}}\right)=O\left(n^{-k}\right)$, where $k$ is the number of boxes outside the first row of the Young diagram $\mu,$ solving one aspect of a conjecture of Hanany and Puder. We obtain this bound using an extension of Wise's $w$--cycle conjecture.</description>
