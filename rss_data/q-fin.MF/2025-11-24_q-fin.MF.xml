      <title>Relative Arbitrage Opportunities in an Extended Mean Field System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies relative arbitrage opportunities in a market with competitive investors through stochastic differential games in the limit as the number of players tends to infinity. With common noises introduced by the stock capitalization processes, we establish a conditional McKean-Vlasov system to study the market dynamics coupled to the expected trading volume of investors. We show that optimal arbitrage can be characterized as a solution of a Cauchy PDE constructed by the volatility terms in the market model. The structure of the market dynamics can be relaxed, and we provide a theoretical framework to study a general mean-field system, where the interaction is characterized by a joint distribution of wealth and strategies. In this setting, the optimal relative arbitrage constitutes the strong equilibrium of an extended mean-field game. We provide conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the mean-field equilibrium. We further prove the propagation of chaos result for the finite-player game counterpart, and demonstrate that the Nash equilibrium converges to the mean field equilibrium when the population grows to infinity.</description>

      <title>Joint Pricing in SPX and VIX Derivative Markets with Composite Change of Time Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16295v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) is calculated from SPX options and derivatives of VIX are also traded in market, which leads to the so-called ``consistent modeling" problem. This paper proposes a time-changed L\'evy model for log price with a composite change of time structure to capture both features of the implied SPX volatility and the implied volatility of volatility. Consistent modeling is achieved naturally via flexible choices of jumps and leverage effects, as well as the composition of time changes. Many celebrated models are covered as special cases. From this model, we derive an explicit form of the characteristic function for the asset price (SPX) and the pricing formula for European options as well as VIX options. The empirical results indicate great competence of the proposed model in the problem of joint calibration of the SPX/VIX Markets.</description>
