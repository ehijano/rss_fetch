      <title>Electrostatics in semiconducting devices I : The Pure Electrostatics Self Consistent Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum nanoelectronics devices, the electrostatic energy is the largest energy scale at play and, to a large extend, it determines the charge distribution inside the devices. Here, we introduce the Pure Electrostatic Self consistent Approximation (PESCA) that provides a minimum model that describes how to include a semiconductor in an electrostatic calculation to properly account for both screening and partial depletion due to e.g. field effect. We show how PESCA may be used to reconstruct the charge distribution from the measurement of pinch-off phase diagrams in the gate voltages space. PESCA can also be extended to account for magnetic field and calculate the edge reconstruction in the quantum Hall regime. The validity of PESCA is controlled by a small parameter $\kappa = C_g/C_q$, the ratio of the geometrical capacitance to the quantum capacitance, which is, in many common situations, of the order of 1%, making PESCA a quantitative technique for the calculation of the charge distribution inside devices.</description>

      <title>Photo-assisted shot noise probes multiple charge carriers in quantum Hall edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional charges in the fractional quantum Hall effect were first observed via DC shot noise measurements of anyons tunneling at a quantum point contact (QPC). However, in scenarios with simultaneous tunneling of different types of charges at the QPC, the connection between DC shot noise and tunneling charge is less transparent. Photo-assisted shot noise (PASN), induced by periodic AC voltage, offers a promising alternative. Here, we investigate PASN in the hierarchical states of the fractional quantum Hall effect, where different types of charges are expected to tunnel concurrently at QPCs. In the particular case of the fractional quantum Hall state $\nu = 2/3$, our analysis demonstrates that PASN can be employed as a robust tool to detect different tunneling charges, even when the tunneling amplitude of one type is significantly smaller compared to the other. We show that the features predicted by our calculations are still visible for typical values of temperature and frequency achieved in state-of-the-art experiments. Our general formalism can be used to compute PASN for general Abelian quantum Hall systems with multiple edge modes and charge types.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile Electric Control of Antiferromagnet CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: van der Waals magnets are emerging as a promising material platform for electric field control of magnetism, offering a pathway towards the elimination of external magnetic fields from spintronic devices. A further step is the integration of such magnets with electrical gating components which would enable nonvolatile control of magnetic states. However, this approach remains unexplored for antiferromagnets, despite their growing significance in spintronics. Here, we demonstrate nonvolatile electric field control of magnetoelectric characteristics in van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr. We integrate a CrSBr channel in a flash-memory architecture featuring charge trapping graphene multilayers. The electrical gate operation triggers a nonvolatile 200 % change in the antiferromagnetic state of CrSBr resistance by manipulating electron accumulation/depletion. Moreover, the nonvolatile gate modulates the metamagnetic transition field of CrSBr and the magnitude of magnetoresistance. Our findings highlight the potential of manipulating magnetic properties of antiferromagnetic semiconductors in a nonvolatile way.</description>

      <title>Topological Computation by non-Abelian Braiding in Classical Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a realization of the one-dimensional Kitaev topological superconductor in classical mechanical metamaterials. By designing appropriate braiding protocols, we demonstrate that the system's mid-gap vibrational modes, termed classical Majorana zero modes (MZMs), accurately reproduce the braiding statistics predicted by quantum theory. Encoding four MZMs as a classical analog of a qubit, we implement all single-qubit Clifford gates through braiding, enabling the simulation of topological quantum computation in a classical system. Furthermore, we establish the system's topological protection by demonstrating its robustness against mechanical defects. This work provides a novel framework for exploring topological quantum computation using classical metamaterials and offers a pathway to realizing stable vibrational systems protected by topology.</description>

      <title>$d$-Wave Polarization-Spin Locking in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the emergence of an uncharted phenomenon, termed $d$-wave polarization-spin locking (PSL), in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets. This phenomenon arises from nontrivial Berry connections, resulting in perpendicular electronic polarizations in the spin-up and spin-down channels. Symmetry-protected $d$-wave PSL occurs exclusively in $d$-wave altermagnets with tetragonal layer groups. To identify 2D altermagnets capable of exhibiting this phenomenon, we propose a symmetry-eigenvalue-based criterion, and a rapid method by observing the spin-momentum locking. Using first-principles calculations, monolayer Cr$_2$X$_2$O (X = Se, Te) characterizes promising candidates for $d$-wave PSL, driven by the unusual charge order in these monolayers. This unique polarization-spin interplay leads to spin-up and spin-down electrons accumulating at orthogonal edges, enabling potential applications as spin filters or splitters in spintronics. Furthermore, $d$-wave PSL introduces an unexpected spin-driven ferroelectricity in conventional antiferromagnets. Such magnetoelectric coupling positions $d$-wave PSL as an ideal platform for fast antiferromagnetic memory devices. Our findings not only expand the landscape of altermagnets, complementing conventional collinear ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, but also highlight tantalizing functionalities in altermagnetic materials, potentially revolutionizing information technology.</description>

      <title>Klein Tunneling and Fabry-P\'erot Resonances in Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper discusses the Klein tunneling and Fabry-P\'erot resonances of charge carriers through a rectangular potential barrier in twisted bilayer graphene. Within the framework of the low-energy excitations, the transmission probability and the conductance are obtained depending on the parameters of the problem. Owing to the different chirality in twisted bilayer graphene, the propagation of charge carriers exhibits an anisotropic behavior in transmission probability and Fabry-P\'erot resonances. Moreover, we show that the anisotropy of the charge carriers induces asymmetry and deflection in the Fabry-P\'erot resonances and Klein tunneling, and they are extremely sensitive to the height of the potential applied. Additionally, we found that the conductance is strongly sensitive to the barrier height but weakly sensitive to the barrier width. Therefore, it is possible to control the maxima and minima of the conductance of charge carriers in twisted bilayer graphene. With our results, we gain an in-depth understanding of tunneling properties in twisted bilayer graphene, which may help in the development and designing of novel electronic nanodevices based on anisotropic 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Nonlinearity to Tame Wave Dynamics in Nonreciprocal Active Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mechanism to generate unidirectional pulse-shaped propagating waves, tamed to exponential growth and dispersion, in active systems with nonreciprocal and nonlinear couplings. In particular, when all bulk modes are exponentially localized at one side of the lattice (skin effect), it is expected that wave dynamics is governed by amplification or decay until reaching the boundaries, even in the presence of dissipation. Our analytical results, and experimental demonstrations in an active electrical transmission line metamaterial, reveal that nonlinearity is a crucial tuning parameter in mediating a delicate interplay between nonreciprocity, dispersion, and dissipation. Consequently, undistorted unidirectional solitonic pulses are supported both for low and high nonreciprocity and pulse amplitude strength. The proposed mechanism facilitates robust pulse propagation in signal processing and energy transmission applications.</description>

      <title>Correlated Dephasing in a Piezoelectrically Transduced Silicon Phononic Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanomechanical waveguides offer a multitude of applications in quantum and classical technologies. Here, we design, fabricate, and characterize a compact silicon single-mode phononic waveguide actuated by a thin-film lithium niobate piezoelectric element. Our device directly transduces between microwave frequency photons and phonons propagating in the silicon waveguide, providing a route for coupling to superconducting circuits. We probe the device at millikelvin temperatures through a superconducting microwave resonant matching cavity to reveal harmonics of the silicon waveguide and extract a piezoelectric coupling rate $g/2\pi= 1.1$ megahertz and a mechanical coupling rate $f/2\pi=5$ megahertz. Through time-domain measurements of the silicon mechanical modes, we observe energy relaxation timescales of $T_{1,\text{in}} \approx 500$ microseconds, pure dephasing timescales of $T_\phi \approx {60}$ microseconds and dephasing dynamics that indicate the presence of an underlying frequency noise process with a non-uniform spectral distribution. We measure phase noise cross-correlations between silicon mechanical modes and observe detuning-dependent positively-correlated frequency fluctuations. Our measurements provide valuable insights into the dynamics and decoherence characteristics of hybrid piezoelectric-silicon acoustic devices, and suggest approaches for mitigating and circumventing noise processes for emerging quantum acoustic systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable electron-electron interaction and anomalous enhancement of large-momentum scattering in moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a microscopic model, we show that the electron-electron interaction of flat bands deviates significantly from the Coulomb interaction. In particular, we find that large-momentum scattering is enhanced at $\theta\lesssim4^\circ$, with a non-monotonic momentum dependence appearing near the magic angle. For $\theta \gtrsim 1.2^\circ$, the enhanced large-momentum scattering can be attributed to the compact Wannier function. On the other hand, for $\theta\lesssim1.2^\circ$, the nonmonotonic momentum dependence of the interaction matrix cannot be explained by a simple Wannier orbital, indicating a nontrivial modification to the el-el interaction. Notably, the range of angles $\theta$ where the large-momentum scattering is enhanced differs from the magic angles at which nearly-flat bands emerge, suggesting that the angle dependence of material properties provides information about the effect of interaction. The results highlight unusual features of the interaction in moir\'e graphene.</description>

      <title>Callan-Rubakov effects in topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Callan-Rubakov effect describes monopole-catalyzed proton decay. While this effect is fundamental for quantum field theories, its experimental observation has remained far from reality. Here, we reveal a similar, but experimentally reachable, defect-catalysis of the quantum anomaly in topological materials. In particular, surface Dirac fermions on topological insulators develop a distinct localized state at the position of dislocations or $\pi$-fluxes, which mediates spin-flip time-reversal breaking scattering or absorption of electrons. Despite the Hermiticity of topological insulators, a non-Hermitian topological number guarantees the robust existence of the localized state. Our finding implies that non-magnetic defects may behave like magnetic impurities on surfaces of topological insulators. Using the K-theory classification, we generalize this condensed-matter version of the Callan-Rubakov effect to other classes of topological materials.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking effects on spin-orbit torque switching in ferromagnetic semiconductors with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the mechanisms of spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching in ferromagnetic semiconductors (FMS) with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), emphasizing the impact of symmetry-breaking. Using micromagnetic simulations based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, we examine several symmetry-breaking factors, including bias field misalignment, interlayer exchange coupling, out-of-plane spin polarization, and tilted magnetic anisotropy. The results reveal that bias field misalignment relative to the film plane significantly distorts the SOT switching hysteresis. Additionally, intrinsic symmetry-breaking effects, such as internal coupling fields, out-of-plane spin polarization, and tilted anisotropy, facilitate field-free SOT (FF-SOT) switching without external bias fields. Each type of FF-SOT switching exhibits distinct characteristics, including hysteresis shifts, switching ratios, and saturated magnetization. This work emphasizes the role of symmetry-breaking in FF-SOT switching and offers fundamental information for interpreting FF-SOT switching observed from FMS films in experiments, contributing to the optimization of SOT efficiency and the advancement of spintronics technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum dot-based device for high-performance magnetic microscopy and spin filtering in the Kondo regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a nanoscale device consisting of a double quantum dot with a full exchange and pair hopping interaction. In this design, the current can only flow through the upper dot, but is sensitive to the spin state of the lower dot. The system is immersed in a highly inhomogeneous magnetic field, and only the bottom dot feels a substantial magnetic field, while the top dot experiences only a residual one.
  We show that our device exhibits very interesting magnetic field-dependent transport properties at low temperatures. The Kondo effect partially survives the presence of the magnetic field and allows to obtain conductances that differ by several orders of magnitude for the two spin types across the top dot.
  Interestingly, as a function of the magnetic field, our two-dot device changes from a spin singlet state to a spin triplet state, in which the amplitudes of the spin-dependent conductances are reversed.
  Our device is able to discriminate between positive and negative magnetic fields with a high sensitivity and is therefore particularly interesting for imaging the surface of anti-ferromagnetic (AF) insulating materials with alternated surface magnetic field, as well as for spin filtering applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a numerical study of graphene heterostructures comprised of three individual layers twisted by either the magic angle of $\sim$1.1$^\circ$, or $\sim$$30^\circ$, corresponding to the graphene quasicrystal. The heterostack is modeled using realistic structural and tight-binding models, while transport properties are calculated in both clean and disordered systems containing up to $\sim$8 million atoms. The weak interaction between different layers allows us to scrutinize the electronic mixing of flat bands and quasicrystalline states, which are altered differently in the low- and high-energy regimes and provide a new type of hybrid physics to be explored.</description>

      <title>Theory of Nonlocal Transport from Nonlinear Valley Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory for the nonlocal measurement of nonlinear valley Hall effect. Different from the linear case where the direct and the inverse processes are reciprocal, we unveil that the nonlinear inverse valley Hall effect needed to generate nonlocal voltage signal must have a distinct symmetry character and involve distinct mechanisms compared to the nonlinear valley Hall response it probes. Particularly, it must be valley-even, in contrast to both linear and nonlinear valley Hall effects which are valley-odd. Layer groups that permit such nonlocal valley responses are obtained via symmetry analysis, and formulas for the nonlocal signals are derived. In the presence of both linear and nonlinear valley responses, we show that the different responses can be distinguished by their distinct scaling behaviors in the different harmonic components, under a low-frequency ac driving. Combined with first-principles calculations, we predict sizable nonlocal transport signals from nonlinear valley responses in bilayer $T_{d}$-WTe$_{2}$. Our work lays a foundation for nonlocal transport studies on the emerging nonlinear valleytronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a microscopic theory of the viscous electron fluid in the quantum Hall state based on the nonequilibrium Green's function method and the von Neumann lattice representation. This approach permits the formulation of hydrodynamic equations in the strong field regime that accommodates arbitrary boundary conditions. We demonstrate nonreciprocal transport resulting from the interplay between magnetic field-induced viscosity and device geometry in a notched system. Our results will offer a powerful tool for studying the nonperturbative effects of magnetic fields on electron viscous fluids.</description>

      <title>Spin noise reveals spin dynamics and recharging of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lead halide perovskite nanocrystals embedded into a glass matrix exhibit strong interaction with light and demonstrate exceptional optical and spin related features along with long-term chemical and physical stability. We apply the spin noise spectroscopy technique which offers a number of specific opportunities to study the spin system of CsPbI$_3$ nanocrystals in a fluorophosphate glass matrix. A pronounced spin precession peak with an isotropic $g$-factor absolute value of 2.7 and record dephasing time of T$_{2\text{,e}}$ = 2.7 ns is ascribed to resident electrons in the perovskite nanocrystals. The experimentally observed Faraday rotation noise with no noise of ellipticity is explained by saturation of the inhomogeneously broadened optical transition. Increasing the probe intensity, we went beyond the non-perturbative regime and observed a number of light-induced effects. In particular, the illumination with shorter wavelength light gives rise to a persistent recharging of the quantum dots by holes ($|g|=0.17$ and T$^*_{2\text{,h}}$ = 1.4 ns, T$^*_{1\text{,h}}$ $\geq$ 30 ns), which remains stable over multiple cycles of heating to the room temperature and cooling. In addition, elliptically polarized light induced an "optical" magnetic field on the system due to the AC Stark effect. It is confirmed using a new modification of polarization noise spectroscopy with a small degree of circular polarization of the probe light added with different frequencies.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescence efficiency of MBE-grown MoSe$_2$ monolayers featuring sharp excitonic lines and diverse grain structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that using h-BN as a substrate for the growth of transition metal dichalcogenides can significantly reduce excitonic linewidths. However, many other optical parameters still require optimization. In this work, we present a detailed study of the low-temperature photoluminescence efficiency of MBE-grown MoSe$_2$ monolayers on h-BN substrates, comparing them to state-of-the-art exfoliated monolayers encapsulated in h-BN. We demonstrate that a quantitative comparison between samples requires accounting for interference effects and Purcell enhancement or suppression of the emission. By accounting for these effects in both photoluminescence and Raman signals, we show that the overall intrinsic luminescence efficiency is proportional to the sample coverage. Consequently, we find that exciton diffusion and edge effects are negligible in spectroscopy of MBE-grown samples, even for nanometer-sized crystals.</description>

      <title>Fractional topological states in rhombohedral multilayer graphene modulated by kagome superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects realized in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and multilayer-graphene-based moir\'e heterostructures have captured a tremendous growth of interest. In this work, we propose that rhombohedral multilayer graphene coupled with an artificial kagome superlattice potential is a new platform to realize various fractional topological phases. Taking Bernal bilayer graphene as the simplest example, when it is placed on top of a prepatterned SiO$_2$ substrate with periodic arrays of holes arranged into kagome lattice, the system would be subject to a tunable kagome superlattice potential once an electrostatic voltage drop between the top and bottom gates is applied. Then, we theoretically study the electronic band structures, topological properties, and quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states of Bernal bilayer graphene coupled with a realistic kagome superlattice potential, which is benchmarked by transport measurements in the weak superlattice-potential and large filling factor regime. We find that the system may exhibit nearly ideal topological flat bands in a substantial region of the parameter space spanned by superlattice constant and electrostatic potential strength. When these topological flat bands are fractionally filled, exact diagonalization calculations suggest that the system would exhibit rich fractional topological phases at 1/3, 2/3, 2/5, 3/5 and 1/2 fillings including both fractional Chern insulators and anomalous composite Fermi liquids under zero magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of simple, scalable, and cost-effective methods to prepare Van der Waals materials for thermoelectric applications is a timely research field, whose potential and possibilities are still largely unexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ink-jet printing and drop-casting deposition of 2H-phase SnSe2 and WSe2 nanoflake assemblies, obtained by liquid phase exfoliation, and their characterization in terms of electronic and thermoelectric properties. The choice of optimal annealing temperature and time is crucial for preserving phase purity and stoichiometry and for removing dry residues of ink solvents at inter-flake boundaries, while maximizing the sintering of nanoflakes. An additional pressing is beneficial to improve nanoflake orientation and packing, thus enhancing electric conductivity. In nanoflake assemblies deposited by drop casting and pressed at 1 GPa, we obtained thermoelectric power factors at room temperature up to 2.2x10^-4 mW m^-1 K^-2 for SnSe2 and up to 3.0x10^-4 mW m^-1 K^-2 for WSe2.</description>

      <title>Finite-bias Coulomb blockade thermometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coulomb blockade thermometers (CBTs) are versatile and, in principle, primary thermometers operating down to the micro-Kelvin range but bias heating spoils the thermometry and the primary mode. Here, we introduce a method to extract the CBT electron temperature in the presence of heat created by an arbitrary bias voltage, and without assumptions on the heat flow mechanisms. The charging energy is extracted with high precision and without any other knowledge, thus making true primary thermometry possible. The experiment also reveals a subtle dependence of the charging energy on phonon temperature below 100 mK likely due to the amorphous AlO$_x$ tunnel junctions.</description>

      <title>Co-Designing Eigen- and Singular-value Transformation Oracles: From Algorithmic Applications to Hardware Compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We co-design a family of quantum eigenvalue transformation oracles that can be efficiently implemented on hybrid discrete/continuous-variable (qubit/qumode) hardware. To showcase the oracle's representation-theoretic power, and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time evolution spectral filter. In doing so, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancilla qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of eigenstate preparation in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation -- applicable in both near-term and large-scale quantum processors -- expressing high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture. Our algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system, and we provide details for 1D and 2D examples. Finally, we examine the leading-order effects of physical errors and highlight open research directions.</description>

      <title>Valley resolved dynamics of phonon bottleneck in semiconductor molybdenum ditelluride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor molybdenum ditelluride (2H-MoTe2) possess multiple valleys in the band structure, enriching its physical properties and potentials in applications. The understanding of its multivalley nature of fundamental processes involving population and relaxation of carriers and phonons is still evolving; particularly, the possible phonon bottleneck has not yet been addressed. Here, we investigate the carrier intra- and intervalley scattering and the phonon dynamics in different valleys in photoexcited few-layer 2H-MoTe2, by using the time resolved measurements of optical absorption and electron diffraction, together with the density functional theory calculation and molecular dynamics simulation. The pathways and timescales of carrier relaxation, accompanied with the emissions of optical phonons at the Brillouin zone center and acoustic phonons at the zone border are revealed. We present a couple of approaches to estimate the population of different phonon modes based on the results of optical and electron diffraction measurements, hence quantitatively identify the occurrences of phonon bottleneck located in different valleys. Our findings make possible to construct a comprehensive picture of the complex interactions between carriers and phonons in 2H-MoTe2 with the valley degree of freedom resolved.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Theory of Plasmon-Induced Hot-carriers in Al Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot electrons generated from the decay of localized surface plasmon (LSP) in metallic nanostructures have significant potential for applications in photocatalysis, photodetection, and other optoelectronic devices. Aluminum nanoparticles are promising for hot-carrier devices since aluminum is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust. However, a comprehensive understanding of hot-carrier generation in practical nanoparticles is still missing. In this study, we present theoretical predictions of hot-carrier generation rates in spherical aluminum nanoparticles with up to 315,75 atoms in different dielectric environments. These predictions are obtained from an approach, which combines a solution of Maxwell equation with large-scale atomistic tight-binding models. By changing the environmental dielectric constants, the LSP frequency can be adjusted over a wide range from deep ultraviolet at 9 eV to the visible spectrum at 2-2.75 eV. Meanwhile, by varying the sizes of nanoparticles, we observed that as the nanoparticle size increases to 10 nm, discrete hot-carrier energy level transitions converge to the continuous energy transitions of bulk metals, and no intraband transitions are observed, unlike in noble metal nanoparticles such as gold and silver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the appearance of an inversion-asymmetric antiferromagnetism due to an itinerant mechanism in nonsymmorphic systems with magnetic ions at Wyckoff position of multiplicity 2. The key symmetries which underpin the existence of such phases are established, and we derive a Landau free energy from a general microscopic electronic Hamiltonian. Our analysis reveals that the stable antiferromagnetic order is largely determined by the symmetries of Wyckoff position, the nature of the nesting between electronic bands, and the presence of anisotropy or nesting in high-symmetry planes of the Brillouin zone. We illustrate our conclusions with specific microscopic models.</description>

Abstract: Thermal emission is naturally spatially incoherent and lacks directionality. Here, we demonstrate that by precisely controlling the spatial temperature distribution within a solid, directional thermal emission can be achieved across a broad spectral range. These anisothermal sources open new avenues for manipulating radiative heat flux at the microscale and hold promise for applications in thermal management and energy conversion, enabling more efficient and targeted thermal control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although metallic elements favor three-dimensional (3D) geometries due to their isotropic, metallic bonding, experiments have reported metals also with two-dimensional (2D) allotropes, the so-called metallenes. And while bulk metals' electronic and structural properties are well known, the corresponding knowledge for atomically thin metallenes remains scattered. Therefore, in this work, we use density-functional theory to investigate the electronic and structural properties of 45 elemental metals with honeycomb, square, and hexagonal lattices, along with their buckled counterparts, resulting in a comprehensive catalog of 270 metallenes with their properties. We systematically present their structural, energetic, and electronic structure properties and discuss similarities and differences compared to their 3D counterparts. As a result, simple and noble metals exhibit similar characteristics and lack buckled hexagonal lattice. Apart from scattered exceptions, the trends in several properties, such as bond lengths, cohesion energies, and projected densities of states, are governed by coordination numbers and exhibit systematic patterns. This systematic reporting provides a necessary reference for the selection and categorization of metallenes for further experimental efforts to develop them for catalytic, sensing, plasmonic, and nanoelectronics applications.</description>

      <title>Topology-induced symmetry breaking demonstrated in antiferromagnetic magnons on a M\"obius strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07846v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of topology-induced symmetry breaking, where certain local symmetry preserved by the Hamiltonian is explicitly broken in the eigenmodes of excitation due to topologically nontrivial boundary conditions. We demonstrate this phenomenon by studying magnonic excitations on a M\"obius strip comprising of two antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains. Even with a simple Hamiltonian respecting local rotational symmetry and all local curvature effects ignored, magnons exhibit linear polarization of the N\'eel vector devoid of chirality, forming two non-degenerate branches that cannot be smoothly connected to or be decomposed by the circularly-polarized magnons. Correspondingly, one branch undergoes a spectral shift and only admits standing waves of half-integer wavelength, whereas the other only affords standing waves of integer wavelength. The suppression of chirality in the order parameter dynamics, hence the pattern of standing waves, can be generalized to other elementary excitations on non-orientable surfaces. Under the M\"obius boundary condition, we further identify an exotic phase hosting spontaneous antiferromagnetic order whilst all exchange couplings are ferromagnetic. Our findings showcase the profound influence of real-space topology on the physical nature of not just the ground state but also the quasiparticles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11979v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that a high-quality flat interface or boundary can serve as a long-range skew scatterer for charged quasiparticles in a metal. When an electric current flows parallel to the interface, the balance between clockwise and counterclockwise reflections is disrupted, leading to a net orbital magnetization. This magnetization is maximized at the interface and varies linearly in the direction perpendicular to it. We suggest that this effect can be detected using spatially resolved Kerr effect measurements at distances up to the electron phase coherence length from the interface. Unlike the orbital Hall and orbital Edelstein effects, the proposed phenomenon does not require inversion symmetry breaking in the bulk of the sample and is unrelated to Hall effect physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments have measured flux dependent capacitance at radio frequencies leading to the potential for a fast parity read-out of a Majorana qubit. In this work we argue that the quantum dot used in the capacitance measurement can be reasonably approximated by a non-interacting weakly coupled orbital. We then predict the measured flux and parity dependent capacitance for several parameter regimes of the disordered Majorana nanowire model that are both topological and trivial. Following this we study how such a fast capacitance read-out can be used to characterize the quantum coherence of a Majorana nanowire-based qubit using Rabi oscillations. We additionally show that such measurements, if made possible by coherent inter-wire tunneling, would provide a valuable way of characterizing the low energy states in the frequency domain.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Stable Tunneling Current in Serial Double Quantum Dots: Insights from Nonequilibrium Green Functions and Pauli Spin Blockade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10173v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate charge transport through serial double quantum dots (SDQDs) with strong electron correlations using nonequilibrium Green's function techniques. In the linear response regime, we compute the charge stability diagram and analyze the Coulomb oscillatory tunneling current, revealing both thermal and nonthermal broadening effects on the current spectra in relation to two gate voltages. In the nonlinear response regime, we focus on tunneling currents in SDQDs under the Pauli spin blockade (PSB) scenario. We find that current rectification with negative differential conductance is significantly degraded as temperature increases, making it challenging to distinguish between the inter-site spin triplet and singlet states. Notably, we observe a robust reversed tunneling current that remains stable against temperature variations, provided the resonant channel in the PSB scenario is coupled to the states of the right (left) electrode, which is fully occupied (unoccupied) by particles. This characteristic provides valuable insights for designing transistors capable of operating over a wide temperature range.</description>

      <title>Spin flip locking by the tunneling and relaxation in a driven double quantum dot with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupled spin evolution and tunneling together with the relaxation and decoherence effects are studied for the double quantum dot formed in a semiconductor nanowire and driven by the periodic electric field. Such system represents a model of the spin and charge qubits interacting via the strong spin-orbit coupling. It is found that at certain regimes the combination of fast relaxation in the coordinate channel with the slower relaxation in the spin channel leads to the promising combination of fast spin manipulation and slow spin relaxation, locking the flipped spin in an excited state in one of the dots for a sufficiently long time. The predicted effect is maintained for a wide range of the relaxation times and the driving amplitude both for the coordinate and the spin channels and is also observed on higher subharmonic which requires lower driving frequencies.</description>

      <title>Density of states and differential entropy in Dirac materials in crossed magnetic and in-plane electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The density of states and differential entropy per particle are analyzed for Dirac-like electrons in graphene subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field and an in-plane electric field. For comparison, the derived density of states is contrasted with the well-known case of nonrelativistic electrons in crossed magnetic and electric fields. The study considers ballistic electrons and also includes the effect of small impurity scattering. In the latter case, the limit of zero magnetic field and the so-called collapse of Landau levels in graphene are examined analytically. By comparing the results with numerical calculations on graphene ribbons, we demonstrate that the Landau state counting procedure must be modified for Dirac-like electrons, leading to a fields-dependent Landau level degeneracy factor. Additionally, it is shown that peaks in the differential entropy arise from the dispersionless surface mode localized at the zigzag edges of the ribbon.</description>

      <title>Higher Landau-Level Analogs and Signatures of Non-Abelian States in Twisted Bilayer MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental discovery of fractional Chern insulators at zero magnetic field in moir\'e superlattices has sparked intense interests in bringing Landau level physics to flat Chern bands. In twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers (tMoTe$_2$), recent theoretical and experimental studies have found three consecutive flat Chern bands at twist angle $\sim 2^\circ$. In this work, we investigate whether higher Landau level physics can be found in these consecutive Chern bands. At twist angles $2.00^\circ$ and $1.89^\circ$, we identify four consecutive $C = 1$ bands for the $K$ valley in tMoTe$_2$. By constructing Wannier functions directly from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a six-orbital model is developed to describe the consecutive Chern bands, with the orbitals forming a honeycomb lattice. Exact diagonalization on top of Hartree-Fock calculations are carried out with the Wannier functions. Especially, when the second moir\'e miniband is half-filled, signatures of non-Abelian states are found. Our Wannier-based approach in modelling moir\'e superlattices is faithful to DFT wave functions and can serve as benchmarks for continuum models. The possibility of realizing non-Abelian anyons at zero magnetic field also opens up a new pathway for fault-tolerant quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Topological edge states in all-dielectric square-lattice arrays of bianisotropic microwave resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a bianisotropic response associated with a broken mirror symmetry of a dielectric resonator allows opening a band gap in simple square lattice arrays of such resonators. Realizing the proposed system as an array of high-index ceramic resonators working at GHz frequencies, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the presence of topological edge states at the interface between two domains with opposite orientations of the bianisotropic resonators, as well as at the boundary between a single domain and free space. For both cases, we experimentally characterize the dispersion of edge states, and we examine their propagation along sharp bends, their resilience to various types of geometrical defects, and a spin-momentum-locked unidirectional propagation in the case of circularly polarized excitation. Also, we develop a theoretical model based on a Green's function approach that describes the square lattice of resonators and features quadratic degeneracies in the vicinity of $\Gamma$ and $M$ high-symmetry points that are removed upon the introduction of bianisotropy, and apply this model to evaluate Berry curvature. The considered design opens possibilities in the construction of optical and microwave structures simultaneously featuring topological edge states at the interfaces between distinct resonator domains or a resonator domain and free space.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism in Heavy Fermion Systems: Mean-Field study on Kondo Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a novel collinear magnet, i.e. the altermagnet (AM), with spin-splitting energy band and zero net magnetization have attracted great interest due to its potential spintronic applications. Here, we demonstrate AM-like phases in a microscopic Kondo lattice (KL) model with an alternating next-nearest-neighbor-hopping (NNNH). Such alternating NNNH take nonmagnetic atoms, neglected in usual antiferromagnetism study, into account when encountering real-life candidate AM materials. With the framework of fermionic parton mean-field theory, we find three different ground-states for the half-filling KL: 1) a $d$-wave AM state; 2) a coexistent phase with both $d$-wave AM and intrinsic Kondo screening effect; 3) a Kondo insulator. The AM-like states are characterized by their spin-splitting quasiparticle bands, Fermi surface, spin-resolved distribution function and conductivity. It is suggested that the magnetic quantum oscillation, scanning tunneling microscopy and charge transport measurement can detect those AM-like phases. We hope the present work may be useful for exploring AM-like phases in $f$-electron compounds such as CeNiAsO and Ce$_{4}$X$_{3}$(X=As,Sb,Bi).</description>

      <title>Efficiency of band edge optical transitions of 2D monolayer materials: A high-throughput computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We performed high-throughput density functional theory calculations of optical matrix elements between band edges across a diverse set of non-magnetic two-dimensional monolayers with direct band gaps. Materials were ranked as potential optical emitters, leading to the identification of transition-metal nitrogen halides (ZrNCl, TiNBr, TiNCl) and bismuth chalcohalides (BiTeCl) with optical coupling comparable to or exceeding MoS$_2$. Despite strong in-plane dipole transitions, most two-dimensional materials underperform bulk semiconductors due to the absence of out-of-plane components. To elucidate interband transitions, we introduced the orbital overlap tensor and established a correlation between anomalous Born effective charges and optical coupling, linking charge redistribution to transition strength. We also identified chalcogen-mediated $d$-$d$ transition as a key mechanism enabling optical responses in transition-metal dichalcogenides. We derived an analytical radiative recombination model incorporating multi-valley effects and found that excitonic corrections are essential for accurate lifetime predictions. Some direct-gap materials exhibit dark excitons as their lowest-energy states, classifying them as quasi-direct band gap semiconductors, which is critical for tuning excitonic recombination dynamics.</description>

      <title>Majorana edge and end states in planar Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the localization properties of Majorana states (MSs) in proximitized, planar Josephson Junctions (JJs) oriented along different crystallographic orientations and in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field and Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. We show that two types of MSs may emerge when the junction transits into the topological superconducting state. In one case, referred to as end-like MSs, the Majorana quasiparticles are mainly localized inside the normal region at the opposite ends of the junction. In contrast, edge-like MSs extend along the opposite edges of the system, perpendicular to the junction channel. We show how the MSs can transit from end-like to edge-like and vice versa by tuning the magnetic field strength and/or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. In the case of phase-unbiased JJs the transition may occur as the ground state phase difference self-adjusts its value when the Zeeman field is varied.</description>

      <title>Optimizing attosecond pulse generation in solids by modulating electronic dynamics with monochromatic laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A practical approach is proposed for efficiently generating ultrashort attosecond pulses (APs) from realistic solid-state materials, aiming to optimize pulse width effectively. By adjusting the photon energy while maintaining a constant peak electric field, this strategy modulates the peak vector potential and laser field period, thereby controlling the high harmonic cutoff energy and the time-domain emission characteristics of the harmonics. The field-driven electronic dynamics lead to a non-monotonic variation in both the intensity and duration of the generated attosecond pulses. The light field frequency can be adjusted to yield the optimal pulse. Beyond the primary demonstration with hexagonal boron nitride as a prototypical material, significant pulse width optimization has been achieved across a range of different materials. This straightforward and versatile strategy shows promise for application in solid-state materials, offering new pathways to promote high harmonic performance.</description>

      <title>Comparison of NiFeCr and NiFe in ferromagnetic Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic materials are under consideration for applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. Some memory applications rely on the ability to reverse the magnetization direction of a "soft" magnetic layer within the junction using a small local magnetic field generated on the chip. It is crucial, therefore, to find a suitable soft magnetic material with a low switching field and low switching energy. A popular magnetic material for such applications is Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$, also known as Permalloy, however Permalloy has a rather large magnetization, leading to large magnetic switching energies. In this work we explore Cr-doped Permalloy, specifically Ni$_{73}$Fe$_{18}$Cr$_{9}$, which has a saturation magnetization just under two-thirds that of Permalloy. Josephson junctions containing this NiFeCr alloy undergo a 0-$\pi$ transition at a NiFeCr thickness of 2.3 nm, and the critical supercurrent decays in the alloy over a short characteristic length of 0.36 nm. Switching fields of a few millitesla are promising, but the short decay length and overall small values of the critical current in the Josephson junctions may preclude the use of NiFeCr in current cryogenic memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate the features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the scale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic fluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic fluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the size of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical analysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and incorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of the cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity.</description>
