      <title>Ionic photofragmentation cross sections of the HS+ H2S+ and HCl+ molecular ions near the 2p threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absolute cross sections for the production of X2+ and X3+ ions following absorption of monochromatized SOLEIL synchrotron radiation by the HX+ hydride molecular ions (X = S,Cl) are presented as a function of photon energy in the region of the X 2p ionisation thresholds (180 eV and 220 eV for sulphur and chlorine, respectively). The experimental results are interpreted with the help of extensive ab initio density functional theory (DFT) and post-Hartree-Fock configuration interaction calculations including spin-orbit coupling to compute the absorption oscillator strengths of the X 2p core excitations to valence and Rydberg states. In order to account for all the experimental features,the calculations must include vibrational dynamics and spin-orbit coupling. Similar experimental data are also presented for the sulfanyumil H2S+ molecular ion.</description>

      <title>Super-Enhanced Absorption of Gravitons in Atomic Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for detecting gravitons using an atomic gas supported by laser fields. Despite the coupling strength of gravitons to atomic transitions being orders of magnitude weaker than that of photons to atomic transitions, the rate of graviton-absorbed atomic transitions can be substantially elevated to a practically observable level. This enhancement is facilitated by an exceptionally potent amplification effect, stemming from a collective quantum electrodynamics phenomenon that encompasses a simultaneous multiphoton-multiatom process.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Contact Forces with Resonant Range Control in Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method to engineer sharply peaked, distance-selective interactions between neutral atoms by exploiting interaction-induced resonances within a resonantly driven Rydberg ladder system. By tuning laser parameters, a subsystem eigenstate twist rapidly and brought into degeneracy with the atomic ground state at precisely defined interatomic separations, resulting in an effective potential sharply localized around this resonance distance. Unlike previous off-resonant macrodimer-based schemes, our approach significantly enhances interaction sharpness and strength, reaching MHz scales, and provides straightforward experimental tunability without requiring sub-wavelength positional control. Analytic expressions, validated through comprehensive master-equation simulations, detail the interaction profile's amplitude, width, and resonant distance. This precise control facilitates parallel entangling gates crucial for measurement-based quantum computing and enables simulation of complex lattice Hamiltonians with customizable connectivity. Additionally, our scheme opens possibilities for novel studies in molecular physics through micrometer-scale bond-length diatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>Single-photon loading of polar molecules into an optical trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to transfer molecules from a slow beam into an optical trap using only a single photon absorption and emission cycle. The efficiency of such a scheme is numerically explored for BaF using realistic experimental parameters. The technique makes use of the state-dependent potential in an external electric field to trap molecules from an initial velocity of order 10m/s. A rapid optical transition at the point where the molecules come to a standstill in the electric field potential irreversibly transfers them into a ~7mK optical dipole trap. For a pulsed Stark decelerated beam, we estimated the per-shot efficiency to be ~0.04% or up to ~103 molecules, with a potential factor 20 improvement when the fields are synchronously modulated with the arriving velocity components. The irreversibility of the scheme allows for larger numbers to be built up over time. Since this scheme does not rely on a closed cycling transition for laser cooling, it broadens the range of molecules that can be used for research on cold molecular chemistry, quantum information, and fundamental interactions in optical traps.</description>

      <title>Scattering Angle Dependence of Fano Resonance Profiles in Cold Atomic Collisions Analyzed with the Complex Valued $w$ Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering angle dependence of Fano resonance profiles in cold atomic collisions has been theoretically studied. A complex-valued parameter $ w $ with an analytical formula describing the asymmetry of the resonance profile is proposed as a new development from previous work on electron resonance scattering from atoms [F. Koike, J. Phys. $\mathbf{B10}$, 2883 (1977)]. It serves as the general formulation which leads to the angle-dependence of Fano's $ q $ parameter. Calculations for the case of cold elastic collisions of hydrogen atoms with krypton atoms have been accomplished. The strong angle dependence of the resonance profile asymmetry in the differential scattering cross section due to the interference with non-resonant partial waves is demonstrated. The scattering angle dependence of the resonance profile and thus the newly proposed asymmetry parameter is highly sensitive to the inter-atomic interaction potentials. This is likely to prove useful for the study of interaction potentials themselves.</description>

      <title>Trapped-ion laser cooling in structured light fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser cooling is fundamental to quantum computation and metrology with trapped ions, and can occupy a majority of runtime in current systems. A key limitation to cooling arises from unwanted carrier excitation, which in typically used running wave (RW) fields invariably accompanies the sideband transitions effecting cooling. We consider laser cooling in structured light profiles enabling selective sideband excitation with nulled carrier drive; motivated by integrated photonic approaches' passive phase and amplitude stability, we propose simple configurations realizable with waveguide addressing using either standing wave (SW) or first-order Hermite-Gauss (HG) modes. We quantify performance of Doppler cooling from beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime (LDR), and ground-state (GS) cooling using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) leveraging these field profiles. Carrier-free EIT offers significant benefits simultaneously in cooling rate, motional frequency bandwidth, and final phonon number. Carrier-free Doppler cooling's advantage is significantly compromised beyond the LDR but continues to hold, indicating such configurations are applicable for highly excited ions. Our simulations focus on level structure relevant to $^{40}$Ca$^+$, though the carrier-free configurations can be generally applied to other species. We also quantify performance limitations due to polarization and modal impurities relevant to experimental implementation. Our results indicate potential for simple structured light profiles to alleviate bottlenecks in laser cooling, and for scalable photonic devices to improve basic operation quality in trapped-ion systems.</description>

      <title>Lorentz and CPT violation and the (anti-)hydrogen molecular ion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extremely narrow natural linewidths of rovibrational energy levels in the molecular hydrogen ion $\textrm{H}_2^{\,+}$, and the prospect of synthesising its antimatter counterpart $\overline{\textrm{H}}_2^{\,-}$, make it a promising candidate for high-precision tests of fundamental symmetries such as Lorentz and CPT invariance. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the rovibrational spectrum of the (anti-)hydrogen molecular ion in a low-energy effective theory incorporating Lorentz and CPT violation. The focus is on the spin-independent couplings in this theory, for which the best current bounds come from measurements of the 1S-2S transition in atomic hydrogen and antihydrogen. We show that in addition to the improvement in these bounds from the increased precision of the transition frequencies, potentially reaching 1 part in $10^{17}$, rovibrational transitions have an enhanced sensitivity to Lorentz and CPT violation of $O(m_p/m_e)$ in the proton (hadron) sector compared to atomic transitions.</description>

      <title>Bremsstrahlung induced atomic processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observed spectra in the collisions of neon (Ne) projectiles of 1.8 and 2.1 MeV with an aluminum target (Al) have been successfully segregated from strong bremsstrahlung backgrounds and then analyzed by comparing the transition energies and rates with the theoretical predictions of the flexible atomic structure code and the general purpose relativistic atomic structure package. The spectra contain K{\alpha}, Kh{\alpha} , and K{\alpha}{\alpha} lines. The K{\alpha}{\alpha} emissions are due to two-electron one-photon transitions. Interestingly, the K{\alpha}{\alpha} lines in projectile ions are only seen with 1.8 MeV energy. In contrast, the K{\alpha}{\alpha} lines in the target ions are also well observed with 2.1 MeV energy. Surprisingly, the Al K x-ray line intensities are strongly suppressed, and the K{\alpha}{\alpha} line intensities are unexpectedly enhanced. The underlying physical process is found to be the photoionization caused by intense bremsstrahlung radiation. This photoionization process converts most of the singly ionized K shell states (\approx 82\% at 2.1 MeV) to doubly ionized K shell states. This phenomenon is silently present on many occasions. We take some of such events to validate this remarkable finding. This bremsstrahlung radiation induced secondary ionization process stands as an eye opening incidence to the plasma physics, astronomy and astrophysics communities; may revolutionize these fields of research.</description>

      <title>Clarifying Self Seed in 391-nm N$_2^{+}$ Air Lasing by Vectorially Structured Light Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A single intense near-infrared femtosecond laser beam can remotely generate ultraviolet N$_2^{+}$ lasing in the air, offering a promising light source in the atmosphere. One of the key debates regarding its mechanism is whether it is seeded by a self-generated spectral component, such as the second harmonic, which is inevitably produced by the charge gradient in the laser plasma filament. In this study, we generated both radially and azimuthally polarized N$_2^{+}$ lasing at 391 nm driven by a single 800-nm cylindrical vector beam. Subsequently, the same vector beam was employed to drive argon for the second harmonic generation. The radially polarized pump beam can produce radially polarized second harmonics with higher radial order, while the azimuthally polarized pump beam yields no second harmonic generation, owing to the special mechanism of the ponderomotive effect. The absence of azimuthally polarized second harmonic strongly ruled out the hypothesis of self-seeding by the second harmonic because radially and azimuthally polarized N$_2^{+}$ lasing signals show comparable intensities. By characterizing the spatial phase distribution of the vector 391-nm lasing, we concluded that the phase of the 391-nm lasing is synchronized with the driving field. The experimental results suggest that amplified spontaneous emissions are the origin of N$_2^+$ air lasing, which was effectively demonstrated by theoretical simulations. Our work also provides a promising method for remotely generating vectorially structured ultraviolet light fields.</description>

Abstract: The results of a study of the dynamics of atomic moments alignment in cesium under optical pumping by linearly polarized resonant light in ultra-weak magnetic field are presented. It is shown that there are alignment components whose relaxation does not depend on spin-exchange broadening. The effect of suppression of spin-exchange relaxation in zero magnetic fields is detected, which is similar in its manifestations to the SERF (Spin-Exchange Relaxation Free) effect observed in orientation signals. This observation is interesting from the standpoint of general theory, since the law of conservation of angular momentum responsible for maintaining orientation in the SERF mode should not guarantee the preservation of alignment under the same conditions. A comparison with theoretically calculated parameters of SERF resonances in orientation is given. A qualitative explanation of the observed effect is presented.</description>

Abstract: We report a two-color magneto-optical trap that continuously operates on the $\mathrm{(5s^2)\:^1S_0-(5s5p)\:^1P_1}$ and $\mathrm{(5s5p)\:^3P_2-(5s5d)\:^3D_3}$ transitions in $\mathrm{^{88}Sr}$. Owing to the sub-Doppler cooling from the metastable $\mathrm{(5s5p)\:^3P_2}$ state, a bimodal momentum distribution is observed, with the cold part of the ensemble reaching a temperature of 105 $\mathrm{\mu}$K. A detailed simulation is established to explain the data. The absolute frequency of the $\mathrm{(5s5p)\:^3P_2-(5s5d)\:^3D_3}$ transition is measured to be 603 976 473 ${\pm}$ 2 MHz using a frequency comb, improving the literature value. The accompanying magnetic trap is characterized, and is shown to contribute to the sequential production of ensembles with temperatures down to 45 $\mathrm{\mu}$K.</description>

Abstract: Precision measurements of molecules offer an unparalleled paradigm to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. The rich internal structure within these molecules makes them exquisite sensors for detecting fundamental symmetry violations, local position invariance, and dark matter. While trapping and control of diatomic and a few very simple polyatomic molecules have been experimentally demonstrated, leveraging the complex rovibrational structure of more general polyatomics demands the development of robust and efficient quantum control schemes. In this study, we present reinforcement-learning quantum-logic spectroscopy (RL-QLS), a general, reinforcement-learning-designed, quantum logic approach to prepare molecular ions in single, pure quantum states. The reinforcement learning agent optimizes the pulse sequence, each followed by a projective measurement, and probabilistically manipulates the collapse of the quantum system to a single state. The performance of the control algorithm is numerically demonstrated for the polyatomic molecule H$_3$O$^+$ with 130 thermally populated eigenstates and degenerate transitions within inversion doublets, where quantum Markov decision process modeling and a physics-informed reward function play a key role, as well as for CaH$^+$ under the disturbance of environmental thermal radiation. The developed theoretical framework cohesively integrates techniques from quantum chemistry, AMO physics, and artificial intelligence, and we expect that the results can be readily implemented for quantum control of polyatomic molecular ions with densely populated structures, thereby enabling new experimental tests of fundamental theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ordered atomic arrays feature an enhanced collective optical response compared to random atomic ensembles due to constructive interference in resonant dipole-dipole interactions. One consequence is the existence of a large shift of the transition with respect to the bare atomic frequency. In the linear optics regime (low light intensity), one observes a spectroscopic shift of the Lorentzian atomic line often called the collective Lamb shift. For stronger driving, many excitations are present in the system rendering the calculation of this shift theoretically challenging, but its understanding is important for instance when performing Ramsey spectroscopy in optical clocks. Here we report on the study of the collective optical response of a one-dimensional array of 30 dysprosium atoms. We drive the atoms on the narrow intercombination transition isolating a 2-level system, and measure the atomic state with single-shot state readout using a broad transition. In the linear optics regime, we measure the shift of the resonance in steady state due to dipole interactions, and measure how this shift depends on the interatomic distance. We further resolve at the single atom level how the excitation is distributed over the array. Then, on the same transition we perform Ramsey spectroscopy \emph{i.\,e.}~away from the linear regime. We observe a time-dependent shift, that allows us to draw the connection between the collective Lamb shift observed in the linear optics regime and in the large-excitation case.</description>

      <title>Mutual friction and vortex Hall angle in a strongly interacting Fermi superfluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motion of a quantized vortex is intimately connected with its microscopic structure and the elementary excitations of the surrounding fluid. In this work, we investigate the two-dimensional motion of a single vortex orbiting a pinned anti-vortex in a unitary Fermi superfluid at varying temperature. By analyzing its trajectory, we measure the yet-unknown longitudinal and transverse mutual friction coefficients, which quantify the vortex-mediated coupling between the normal and superfluid components. Both coefficients increase while approaching the superfluid transition. They provide access to the vortex Hall angle, which is linked to the relaxation time of the localized quasiparticles occupying Andreev bound states within the vortex core, as well as the intrinsic superfluid parameter associated with the transition from laminar to quantum turbulent flows. We compare our results with numerical simulations and an analytic model originally formulated for superfluid $^3$He in the low-temperature limit, finding good agreement. Our work highlights the interplay between vortex-bound quasiparticles and delocalized thermal excitations in shaping vortex dynamics in unitary Fermi superfluids. Further, it provides a novel testbed for studying out-of-equilibrium vortex matter at finite temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Fundamental principles of quantum field theory such as Lorentz invariance, CPT symmetry and locality may be tested to extremely high precision in atomic and molecular spectroscopy. The narrow natural linewidth of rovibrational states in the hydrogen molecular ion $H_2^+$ and its antimatter counterpart $\bar{H}_2^-$, make these ideal candidates, and give $O(m_p/m_e)$ increased sensitivity to Lorentz and CPT violation in the proton sector compared to $H$ and $\bar{H}$ atoms. In a previous paper, we presented a detailed analysis of the rovibrational spectrum of $H_2^+$ and $\bar{H}_2^-$ in an effective QFT encoding Lorentz and CPT violation, focusing on spin-independent effects. Here, we extend this analysis to include the full hyperfine-Zeeman spectrum and include spin-dependent Lorentz and CPT violating operators in the effective theory. The results demonstrate how constraints on these symmetry-violating couplings may be extracted from specific rovibrational transitions between hyperfine-Zeeman states in the presence of an applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Cooling of an optically levitated nanoparticle via measurement-free coherent feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent, measurement-free optical feedback control of a levitated nanoparticle, achieving phonon occupations down to a few hundred phonons. Unlike measurement-based feedback, this all-optical scheme preserves the correlations between mechanical motion and the feedback signal. Adjustment of the feedback phase and delay provides precise and tunable control over the system dynamics. The ultimate cooling performance is currently limited by phase noise, which we analyze within a theoretical framework that outlines the constraints and prospects for reaching the motional ground state. Our results establish coherent feedback as a powerful tool for quantum control of levitated systems, extending beyond center-of-mass cooling.</description>
