      <title>Plasma fibre using bright-core helicon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports an innovative concept of ``plasma fibre" using bright-core helicon plasma, inspired by its spatial and spectral similarities to the well-known optical fibre. Theoretical analyses are presented for both ideal case of step-like density profile and the realistic case of Gaussian density profile in radius. The total reflection of electromagnetic waves near the sharp plasma density gradient and consequently the wave-guide feature could indeed happen if the incident angle is larger than a threshold value. Numerical computations using electromagnetic solver that based on Maxwell's equations and cold-plasma dielectric tensor yield consistent results. The experimental verification and prospective applications are also suggested. The ``plasma fibre" could be functional component that embedded into existing communication systems for special purpose based on its capability of dynamic reconfiguration.</description>

      <title>Synchronized Catastrophic Collapse and Extreme Intensity Amplification of Ultra-Intense Pulses in Near-Resonance Magnetized Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving ultra-high field intensities is paramount for advancing compact plasma accelerators and high-energy-density physics, yet it is fundamentally limited by the constraints of focusing distance and nonlinear efficiency. We report a theoretical model demonstrating a highly efficient, magnetically-assisted pathway for extreme laser energy concentration in under-dense plasma. By tuning an external magnetic field near the cyclotron resonance (Ce=0.7), we show a fundamental, nonlinear enhancement of the relativistic self-focusing (RSF) mechanism. This magnetic enhancement drives the pulse into a catastrophic, coupled collapse over an exceptionally short distance of 1.25 Rayleigh lengths. The dynamics result in simultaneous spatial confinement (fr=0.05) and significant temporal self-compression (ft=0.60 ). Crucially, this combined confinement yields a localized peak intensity amplification factor exceeding 103 compared to the initial state. This work confirms a robust and compact method for generating petawatt-scale power densities and provides a direct, actionable blueprint for next-generation laser-plasma experiments.</description>

      <title>Modeling partially-ionized dense plasma using wavepacket molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a wave packet molecular dynamics framework for modeling the structural properties of partially-ionized dense plasmas, based on a chemical model that explicitly includes bound state wavefunctions. Using hydrogen as a representative system, we compute self-consistent charge state distributions through free energy minimization, following the approach of Plummer et al. [Phys. Rev. E 111, 015204 (2025)]. This enables a direct comparison of static equilibrium properties with path integral Monte Carlo data, facilitating an evaluation of the model's underlying approximations and its ability to capture the complex interplay between ionization and structure in dense plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate calculation of the bootstrap current and radial neoclassical transport in low collisionality stellarator plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this PhD thesis, a method for solving fast and accurately the monoenergetic drift-kinetic equation at low collisionality is presented. The algorithm is based on the analytical properties of the drift-kinetic equation when its dependence on the pitch-angle cosine is represented employing Legendre polynomials as basis functions. The Legendre representation of the monoenergetic drift-kinetic equation possesses a tridiagonal structure, which is exploited by the algorithm presented. The monoenergetic drift-kinetic equation can be solved fast and accurately at low collisionality by employing the standard block tridiagonal algorithm for block tridiagonal matrices. The implementation of the aforementioned algorithm leads to the main result of this thesis: the new neoclassical code MONKES (MONoenergetic Kinetic Equation Solver), conceived to satisfy the necessity of fast and accurate calculations of the bootstrap current for stellarators and in particular for stellarator optimization. MONKES is a new neoclassical code for the evaluation of monoenergetic transport coefficients in stellarators. By means of a convergence study and benchmarks with other codes, it is shown that MONKES is accurate and efficient. The combination of spectral discretization in spatial and velocity coordinates with block sparsity allows MONKES to compute monoenergetic coefficients at low collisionality, in a single core, in approximately one minute. MONKES is sufficiently fast to be integrated into stellarator optimization codes for direct optimization of the bootstrap current (and radial neoclassical transport) and to be included in predictive transport suites.</description>

      <title>The Rayleigh-Taylor instability with foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the behaviour of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) in the presence of a foam. Such a problem may be relevant, for example, to some inertial confinement fusion (ICF) scenarios such as foams within the capsule or lining the inner hohlraum wall. The foam displays 3 different phases: by order of increasing stress, it is first elastic, then plastic, and then fractures. Only the elastic and plastic phases can be subject to a linear analysis of the instability. The growth rate is analytically computed in these 2 phases, in terms of the micro-structure of the foam. In the first, elastic, phase, the RTI can be stabilized for some wavelengths. In this elastic phase, a homogenous foam model overestimates the growth because it ignores the elastic nature of the foam. Although this result is derived for a simplified foam model, it is likely valid for most of them. Besides the ICF context considered here, our results could be relevant for many fields of science.</description>

      <title>Stellarator divertor design by optimizing coils for surfaces with sharp corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In stellarators, achieving effective divertor configurations is challenging due to the three-dimensional nature of the magnetic fields, which often leads to chaotic field lines and fuzzy separatrices. This work presents a novel approach to directly optimize modular stellarator coils for a sharp X-point divertor topology akin to the Large Helical Device's (LHD) helical divertor using a target plasma surface with sharp corners. By minimizing the normal magnetic field component on this surface, we target a clean separatrix with minimal chaos. Notably, this approach demonstrates the first LHD-like helical divertor design using optimized modular coils instead of helical coils. Separatrices are produced with significantly lower chaos than in LHD, demonstrating that a wide chaotic layer is not intrinsic to the helical divertor. Additional optimization methods are implemented to improve engineering feasibility of the coils and reduce chaos, including weighted quadrature and manifold optimization, a method which does not rely on normal field minimization. The results outline several new strategies for divertor design in stellarators, though it remains to achieve these edge divertor features at the same time as internal field qualities like quasisymmetry.</description>

      <title>Path-integral Monte Carlo estimator for the dipole polarizability of quantum plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a path-integral Monte Carlo estimator for calculating the dipole polarizability of interacting Coulomb plasma in the long-wavelength limit, i.e., the optical region. Unlike the conventional dynamic structure factor in reciprocal space, our approach is based on the real-space dipole autocorrelation function and is suited for long wavelengths and small cell sizes, including finite clusters. The simulation of thermal equilibrium in imaginary time has exact Coulomb interactions and Boltzmann quantum statistics. For reference, we demonstrate analytic continuation of the Drude model into the imaginary time and Matsubara series, showing perfect agreement with our data within ranges of finite temperatures and densities. Method parameters, such as the finite time-step and finite-size effects prove only modestly significant. Our method, here carefully validated against an exactly solvable reference, remains amenable to more interesting domains in higher-order optical response, quantum confinements and quantum statistical effects, and applications in plasmonics, heterogeneous plasmas and nonlinear optics, such as epsilon-near-zero materials.</description>

      <title>MRX: A differentiable 3D MHD equilibrium solver without nested flux surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a new 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium solver, based on the concept of admissible variations of B, p that allows for magnetic relaxation of a magnetic field in a perturbed/non-minimum energy state to a lower energy state. We describe the mathematical theory behind this method, including ensuring certain bounds on the magnetic energy, and the differential geometry behind transforming to and from a logical domain and physical domain. Our code is designed to address a number of traditional challenges to 3D MHD equilibrium solvers, e.g. exactly enforcing physical constraints such as divergence-free magnetic field, exhibiting high levels of numerical convergence, dealing with complex geometries, and modeling stochastic field lines or chaotic behavior. By using differentiable Python, our numerical method comes with the additional benefits of computational efficiency on modern computing architectures, high code accessibility, and differentiability at each step. The proposed magnetic relaxation solver is robustly benchmarked and tested with standard examples, including solving 2D toroidal equilibria at high-beta, and a rotating ellipse stellarator. Future work will address the integration of this code for 3D equilibrium optimization for modeling magnetic islands and chaos in stellarator fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Comparing the magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability dynamics in two- and three-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability (MRTI) governs plasma mixing and transport in a wide range of astrophysical and laboratory systems. Owing to computational constraints, MRTI is often studied using two-dimensional (2D) simulations, but the extent to which 2D captures the true three-dimensional (3D) dynamics remains unclear. In this work, we perform direct numerical simulations of non-ideal, incompressible MRTI in both 2D and 3D, systematically varying the magnetic field strength from weakly to strongly magnetized regimes. We find that the 3D system exhibits richer mode interactions due to the coexistence of interchange, undular, and mixed modes structures that are inherently absent in 2D. The mixing layer in 3D has enhanced small-scale mixing and reduced fluid dispersion compared to 2D, which is characterized by large-scale plumes. Energy diagnostics reveal that the gravitational potential energy released is higher in 2D, primarily because of inefficient mixing and significant fluid dispersion. In contrast, 3D systems display greater energy dissipation and anisotropy, driven by small-scale vortical motions. The non-linear growth of the instability increases monotonically with magnetic field strength in 3D but shows a non-monotonic trend in 2D. Despite these broad differences, the rate of magnetic-to-kinetic energy conversion remains remarkably similar across dimensions, indicating that 2D simulations can meaningfully capture reconnection-driven processes but not the full turbulent evolution. Overall, our results demonstrate that 2D MRTI simulations cannot reliably represent 3D mixing, energy dynamics, or nonlinear growth, highlighting the fundamental importance of three-dimensionality in magnetized plasma instabilities.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Nature of a Solar Flare with Parallel and Semi-Circular Ribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flare ribbons with parallel and circular morphologies are typically associated with different magnetic reconnection models, and the simultaneous observation of both types in a single event remains rare. Using multi-wavelength observations from a tandem of instruments, we present an M8.2-class flare that occurred on 2023 September 20, which produced quasi-parallel and semi-circular ribbons. The complex evolution of the flare includes two distinct brightening episodes in the quasi-parallel ribbons, corresponding to the two major peaks in the hard X-ray (HXR) light curve. In contrast, the brightening of semi-circular ribbons temporally coincides with the local minimum between the two peaks. Using potential field extrapolation, we reconstruct an incomplete dome-like magnetic structure with a negative polarity embedded within the northwestern part of the semi-circular positive polarity. Consequently, the magnetic configuration comprises two sets of field lines with distinct magnetic connectivities. We suggest that the standard flare reconnection accounts for the two-stage brightening of quasi-parallel ribbons associated with the two HXR peaks. Between the two stages, this process is constrained by the interaction of eruptive structures with the dome. The interaction drives the quasi-separatrix layer reconnection, leading to the brightening of semi-circular ribbons. It also suppresses the standard flare reconnection, resulting in a delayed second HXR peak.</description>

      <title>Ionospheric responses over the Antarctic region to Intense Space Weather events: Plasma Convection vs. Auroral Precipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present investigation is directed at exploring southern polar ionospheric responses to intense space weather events and their correlations with plasma convection and auroral precipitation. The main phases of six geomagnetic storms occurring in the year 2023 (ascending phase of the present solar cycle) are considered for this study. The ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements derived from GPS receivers covering the Antarctic region are used for probing the electron density perturbations during these events. Auroral precipitation maps are shown to illustrate the locations of the GPS stations relative to particle precipitation. SuperDARN maps are shown to understand the effects of plasma convection over these locations. Correlation between the enhanced TEC observations with the auroral precipitation (R $\sim$ 0.31) and the plasma convection (R $\sim$ 0.88) reveals that the latter is more responsible for causing significant enhancements in the diurnal maximum values of TEC over the Antarctic region in comparison to the former. Therefore, this work shows correlation studies between two physical processes and ionospheric density enhancements over the under-explored south polar region under strong levels of geomagnetic activity during 2023.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma processing of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities has been an active research effort at Jefferson Lab (JLab) since 2019, aimed at enhancing cavity performance by removing hydrocarbon contaminants and reducing field emission. In this experiment, processing using argon-oxygen and helium-oxygen gas mixtures to find minimum ignition power at different cavity pressure was investigated. Ongoing simulations are contributing to a better understanding of the plasma surface interactions and the fundamental physics behind the process. These simulations, combined with experimental studies, guide the optimization of key parameters such as gas type, RF power, and pressure to ignite plasma using selected higher-order mode (HOM) frequencies. This paper presents experimental data from argon-oxygen and helium-oxygen gas mixture C75 and C100 cavity plasma ignition studies, as well as simulation results for the C100-type cavity based on the COMSOL model previously applied to the C75 cavity.</description>

      <title>High Gain Fusion Target Design using Generative Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By returning to the topological basics of fusion target design, Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) is used to specify how to initially configure and drive the optimally entangled topological state, and stabilize that topological state from disruption. This can be applied to all methods; including tokamaks, laser-driven schemes, and pulsed-power driven schemes. The result is practical, room temperature targets that can yield up to 10 GJ of energy, driven by as little as 3 MJ of absorbed energy. The genAI is based on the concept of Ubuntu that replaces the Deep Convolutional Neural Network approximation of a functional, with the formula for the generating functional of a canonical transformation from the domain of the canonical field momentums and fields, to the domain of the canonical momentums and coordinates, that is the Reduced Order Model. This formula is a logical process of renormalization, enabling Heisenberg's canonical approach to field theory, via calculation of the S-matrix, given observation of the fields. This can be viewed as topological characterization and control of collective, that is complex, systems.</description>
