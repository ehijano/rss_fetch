      <title>Debate-Feedback: A Multi-Agent Framework for Efficient Legal Judgment Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of AI in legal analysis and prediction (LegalAI) has gained widespread attention, with past research focusing on retrieval-based methods and fine-tuning large models. However, these approaches often require large datasets and underutilize the capabilities of modern large language models (LLMs). In this paper, inspired by the debate phase of real courtroom trials, we propose a novel legal judgment prediction model based on the Debate-Feedback architecture, which integrates LLM multi-agent debate and reliability evaluation models. Unlike traditional methods, our model achieves significant improvements in efficiency by minimizing the need for large historical datasets, thus offering a lightweight yet robust solution. Comparative experiments show that it outperforms several general-purpose and domain-specific legal models, offering a dynamic reasoning process and a promising direction for future LegalAI research.</description>

      <title>Real-Time LaCAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vast majority of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) methods with completeness guarantees require planning full horizon paths. However, planning full horizon paths can take too long and be impractical in real-world applications. Instead, real-time planning and execution, which only allows the planner a finite amount of time before executing and replanning, is more practical for real world multi-agent systems. Several methods utilize real-time planning schemes but none are provably complete, which leads to livelock or deadlock. Our main contribution is to show the first Real-Time MAPF method with provable completeness guarantees. We do this by leveraging LaCAM (Okumura 2023) in an incremental fashion. Our results show how we can iteratively plan for congested environments with a cutoff time of milliseconds while still maintaining the same success rate as full horizon LaCAM. We also show how it can be used with a single-step learned MAPF policy. The proposed Real-Time LaCAM also provides us with a general mechanism for using iterative constraints for completeness in future real-time MAPF algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Nature-Inspired Colony of Artificial Intelligence System with Fast, Detailed, and Organized Learner Agents for Enhancing Diversity and Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concepts of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and multi-agent systems are two important areas of research in artificial intelligence (AI). In this paper, we present an approach that builds a CNN-based colony of AI agents to serve as a single system and perform multiple tasks (e.g., predictions or classifications) in an environment. The proposed system impersonates the natural environment of a biological system, like an ant colony or a human colony. The proposed colony of AI that is defined as a role-based system uniquely contributes to accomplish tasks in an environment by incorporating AI agents that are fast learners, detailed learners, and organized learners. These learners can enhance their localized learning and their collective decisions as a single system of colony of AI agents. This approach also enhances the diversity and quality of the colony of AI with the help of Genetic Algorithms and their crossover and mutation mechanisms. The evolution of fast, detailed, and organized learners in the colony of AI is achieved by introducing a unique one-to-one mapping between these learners and the pretrained VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 models, respectively. This role-based approach creates two parent-AI agents using the AI models through the processes, called the intra- and inter-marriage of AI, so that they can share their learned knowledge (weights and biases) based on a probabilistic rule and produce diversified child-AI agents to perform new tasks. This process will form a colony of AI that consists of families of multi-model and mixture-model AI agents to improve diversity and quality. Simulations show that the colony of AI, built using the VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 models, can provide a single system that generates child-AI agents of excellent predictive performance, ranging between 82% and 95% of F1-scores, to make diversified collective and quality decisions on a task.</description>

      <title>Cross-Document Contextual Coreference Resolution in Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coreference resolution across multiple documents poses a significant challenge in natural language processing, particularly within the domain of knowledge graphs. This study introduces an innovative method aimed at identifying and resolving references to the same entities that appear across differing texts, thus enhancing the coherence and collaboration of information. Our method employs a dynamic linking mechanism that associates entities in the knowledge graph with their corresponding textual mentions. By utilizing contextual embeddings along with graph-based inference strategies, we effectively capture the relationships and interactions among entities, thereby improving the accuracy of coreference resolution. Rigorous evaluations on various benchmark datasets highlight notable advancements in our approach over traditional methodologies. The results showcase how the contextual information derived from knowledge graphs enhances the understanding of complex relationships across documents, leading to better entity linking and information extraction capabilities in applications driven by knowledge. Our technique demonstrates substantial improvements in both precision and recall, underscoring its effectiveness in the area of cross-document coreference resolution.</description>

      <title>Decentralizing AI Memory: SHIMI, a Semantic Hierarchical Memory Index for Scalable Agent Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and vector-based search have become foundational tools for memory in AI systems, yet they struggle with abstraction, scalability, and semantic precision - especially in decentralized environments. We present SHIMI (Semantic Hierarchical Memory Index), a unified architecture that models knowledge as a dynamically structured hierarchy of concepts, enabling agents to retrieve information based on meaning rather than surface similarity. SHIMI organizes memory into layered semantic nodes and supports top-down traversal from abstract intent to specific entities, offering more precise and explainable retrieval. Critically, SHIMI is natively designed for decentralized ecosystems, where agents maintain local memory trees and synchronize them asynchronously across networks. We introduce a lightweight sync protocol that leverages Merkle-DAG summaries, Bloom filters, and CRDT-style conflict resolution to enable partial synchronization with minimal overhead. Through benchmark experiments and use cases involving decentralized agent collaboration, we demonstrate SHIMI's advantages in retrieval accuracy, semantic fidelity, and scalability - positioning it as a core infrastructure layer for decentralized cognitive systems.</description>

      <title>SkillFlow: Efficient Skill and Code Transfer Through Communication in Adapting AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI agents are autonomous systems that can execute specific tasks based on predefined programming. Here, we present SkillFlow, a modular, technology-agnostic framework that allows agents to expand their functionality in an ad-hoc fashion by acquiring new skills from their environment or other agents. We present a theoretical model that examines under which conditions this framework would be beneficial, and we then explore SkillFlow's ability to accelerate task completion and lead to lower cumulative costs in a real-world application, namely scheduling agents for calendar events. We demonstrate that within a few iterations, SkillFlow leads to considerable (24.8%, p-value = $6.4\times10^{-3}$) gains in time and cost, especially when the communication cost is high. Finally, we draw analogies from well-studied biological systems and compare this framework to that of lateral gene transfer, a significant process of adaptation and evolution in novel environments.</description>

      <title>MAPF-GPT: Imitation Learning for Multi-Agent Pathfinding at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00134v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a problem that generally requires finding collision-free paths for multiple agents in a shared environment. Solving MAPF optimally, even under restrictive assumptions, is NP-hard, yet efficient solutions for this problem are critical for numerous applications, such as automated warehouses and transportation systems. Recently, learning-based approaches to MAPF have gained attention, particularly those leveraging deep reinforcement learning. Typically, such learning-based MAPF solvers are augmented with additional components like single-agent planning or communication. Orthogonally, in this work we rely solely on imitation learning that leverages a large dataset of expert MAPF solutions and transformer-based neural network to create a foundation model for MAPF called MAPF-GPT. The latter is capable of generating actions without additional heuristics or communication. MAPF-GPT demonstrates zero-shot learning abilities when solving the MAPF problems that are not present in the training dataset. We show that MAPF-GPT notably outperforms the current best-performing learnable MAPF solvers on a diverse range of problem instances and is computationally efficient during inference.</description>

      <title>Augmenting the action space with conventions to improve multi-agent cooperation in Hanabi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The card game Hanabi is considered a strong medium for the testing and development of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, due to its cooperative nature, hidden information, limited communication and remarkable complexity. Previous research efforts have explored the capabilities of MARL algorithms within Hanabi, focusing largely on advanced architecture design and algorithmic manipulations to achieve state-of-the-art performance for a various number of cooperators. However, this often leads to complex solution strategies with high computational cost and requiring large amounts of training data. For humans to solve the Hanabi game effectively, they require the use of conventions, which often allows for a means to implicitly convey ideas or knowledge based on a predefined, and mutually agreed upon, set of ``rules''. Multi-agent problems containing partial observability, especially when limited communication is present, can benefit greatly from the use of implicit knowledge sharing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to augmenting the action space using conventions, which act as special cooperative actions that span over multiple time steps and multiple agents, requiring agents to actively opt in for it to reach fruition. These conventions are based on existing human conventions, and result in a significant improvement on the performance of existing techniques for self-play and cross-play across a various number of cooperators within Hanabi.</description>

      <title>Drawing a Map of Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our main contribution is the introduction of the map of elections framework. A map of elections consists of three main elements: (1) a dataset of elections (i.e., collections of ordinal votes over given sets of candidates), (2) a way of measuring similarities between these elections, and (3) a representation of the elections in the 2D Euclidean space as points, so that the more similar two elections are, the closer are their points. In our maps, we mostly focus on datasets of synthetic elections, but we also show an example of a map over real-life ones. To measure similarities, we would have preferred to use, e.g., the isomorphic swap distance, but this is infeasible due to its high computational complexity. Hence, we propose polynomial-time computable positionwise distance and use it instead. Regarding the representations in 2D Euclidean space, we mostly use the Kamada-Kawai algorithm, but we also show two alternatives. We develop the necessary theoretical results to form our maps and argue experimentally that they are accurate and credible. Further, we show how coloring the elections in a map according to various criteria helps in analyzing results of a number of experiments. In particular, we show colorings according to the scores of winning candidates or committees, running times of ILP-based winner determination algorithms, and approximation ratios achieved by particular algorithms.</description>

      <title>Autono: A ReAct-Based Highly Robust Autonomous Agent Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a highly robust autonomous agent framework based on the ReAct paradigm, designed to solve complex tasks through adaptive decision making and multi-agent collaboration. Unlike traditional frameworks that rely on fixed workflows generated by LLM-based planners, this framework dynamically generates next actions during agent execution based on prior trajectories, thereby enhancing its robustness. To address potential termination issues caused by adaptive execution paths, I propose a timely abandonment strategy incorporating a probabilistic penalty mechanism. For multi-agent collaboration, I introduce a memory transfer mechanism that enables shared and dynamically updated memory among agents. The framework's innovative timely abandonment strategy dynamically adjusts the probability of task abandonment via probabilistic penalties, allowing developers to balance conservative and exploratory tendencies in agent execution strategies by tuning hyperparameters. This significantly improves adaptability and task execution efficiency in complex environments. Additionally, agents can be extended through external tool integration, supported by modular design and MCP protocol compatibility, which enables flexible action space expansion. Through explicit division of labor, the multi-agent collaboration mechanism enables agents to focus on specific task components, thereby significantly improving execution efficiency and quality.</description>

      <title>POGEMA: A Benchmark Platform for Cooperative Multi-Agent Pathfinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has recently excelled in solving challenging cooperative and competitive multi-agent problems in various environments, typically involving a small number of agents and full observability. Moreover, a range of crucial robotics-related tasks, such as multi-robot pathfinding, which have traditionally been approached with classical non-learnable methods (e.g., heuristic search), are now being suggested for solution using learning-based or hybrid methods. However, in this domain, it remains difficult, if not impossible, to conduct a fair comparison between classical, learning-based, and hybrid approaches due to the lack of a unified framework that supports both learning and evaluation. To address this, we introduce POGEMA, a comprehensive set of tools that includes a fast environment for learning, a problem instance generator, a collection of predefined problem instances, a visualization toolkit, and a benchmarking tool for automated evaluation. We also introduce and define an evaluation protocol that specifies a range of domain-related metrics, computed based on primary evaluation indicators (such as success rate and path length), enabling a fair multi-fold comparison. The results of this comparison, which involves a variety of state-of-the-art MARL, search-based, and hybrid methods, are presented.</description>

      <title>Inverse Attention Agents for Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge for Multi-Agent Systems is enabling agents to adapt dynamically to diverse environments in which opponents and teammates may continually change. Agents trained using conventional methods tend to excel only within the confines of their training cohorts; their performance drops significantly when confronting unfamiliar agents. To address this shortcoming, we introduce Inverse Attention Agents that adopt concepts from the Theory of Mind (ToM) implemented algorithmically using an attention mechanism trained in an end-to-end manner. Crucial to determining the final actions of these agents, the weights in their attention model explicitly represent attention to different goals. We furthermore propose an inverse attention network that deduces the ToM of agents based on observations and prior actions. The network infers the attentional states of other agents, thereby refining the attention weights to adjust the agent's final action. We conduct experiments in a continuous environment, tackling demanding tasks encompassing cooperation, competition, and a blend of both. They demonstrate that the inverse attention network successfully infers the attention of other agents, and that this information improves agent performance. Additional human experiments show that, compared to baseline agent models, our inverse attention agents exhibit superior cooperation with humans and better emulate human behaviors.</description>

      <title>Improving Mixed-Criticality Scheduling with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach to scheduling mixed-criticality (MC) systems on processors with varying speeds. Building upon the foundation laid by [1], we extend their work to address the non-preemptive scheduling problem, which is known to be NP-hard. By modeling this scheduling challenge as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we develop an RL agent capable of generating near-optimal schedules for real-time MC systems. Our RL-based scheduler prioritizes high-critical tasks while maintaining overall system performance.
  Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach. The RL scheduler significantly improves task completion rates, achieving around 80% overall and 85% for high-criticality tasks across 100,000 instances of synthetic data and real data under varying system conditions. Moreover, under stable conditions without degradation, the scheduler achieves 94% overall task completion and 93% for high-criticality tasks. These results highlight the potential of RL-based schedulers in real-time and safety-critical applications, offering substantial improvements in handling complex and dynamic scheduling scenarios.</description>

      <title>Attention-Augmented Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Graph Convolutions for Multi-Agent Task Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent task allocation (MATA) plays a vital role in cooperative multi-agent systems, with significant implications for applications such as logistics, search and rescue, and robotic coordination. Although traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been shown to be promising, their effectiveness is hindered by a reliance on manually designed reward functions and inefficiencies in dynamic environments. In this paper, an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)-based framework is proposed, in which multi-head self-attention (MHSA) and graph attention mechanisms are incorporated to enhance reward function learning and task execution efficiency. Expert demonstrations are utilized to infer optimal reward densities, allowing dependence on handcrafted designs to be reduced and adaptability to be improved. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method over widely used multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms in terms of both cumulative rewards and task execution efficiency.</description>
