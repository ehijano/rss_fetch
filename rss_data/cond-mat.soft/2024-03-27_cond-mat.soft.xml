      <title>On the Lattice Ground State of Densely Packed Hard Ellipses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among lattice configurations of densely packed hard ellipses, Monte Carlo simulations are used to identify the so-called parallel and diagonal lattices as the two favourable states. The free energies of these two states are computed for several system sizes employing the Einstein Crystal method. An accurate calculation of the free energy difference between the two states reveals the parallel lattice as the state with lowest free energy. The origin of the entropic difference between the two states is further elucidated by assessing the roles of the translational and rotational degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Synthetic active liquid crystals powered by acoustic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active nematics are materials composed of mobile, elongated particles that can transform energy from the environment into a mechanical motion. Current experimental realizations of the active nematics are of biological origin and include cell layers, suspensions of elongated bacteria in liquid crystal, and combinations of bio-filaments with molecular motors. Here, we report the realization of a fully synthetic active nematic system comprised of a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal energized by ultrasonic waves. This artificial active liquid crystal is free from biological degradation and variability, exhibits stable material properties, and enables precise and rapid activity control over a significantly extended range. We demonstrate that the energy of the acoustic field is converted into microscopic extensile stresses disrupting long-range nematic order and giving rise to an undulation instability, development of active turbulence, and proliferation of topological defects. We reveal the emergence of unconventional free-standing persistent vortices in the nematic director field at high activity levels. The results provide a foundation for the design of externally energized active nematic fluids with stable material properties and tunable topological defects dynamics crucial for the realization of reconfigurable microfluidic systems.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale Polymer Arrays: High Aspect Ratio Surface Structures and Their Digital Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by adhesive bio-filamentous structure, such as bacterial pili, this work details the methods used to fabricate and characterize a surface-anchored array of thin, flexible and shape-responsive mesoscale polymer ribbons with a length-to-thickness aspect ratio of up to 100,000. The resulting structures exhibit geometrically complex and dynamic morphologies consistent with elastocapillary bending that experience an increase in curvature over hours of aging due to creep. We develop a computational image analysis framework to generate 3D reconstructions of these densely crowded geometries and extract quantitative descriptors to demonstrate morphological changes due to aging. We demonstrate the robustness of this quantitative method by characterizing the creep-induced change in an aging ribbon array's shape and develop a scaling relationship to describe the importance of ribbon thickness for shape and dynamical observations. These methods demonstrate an essential baseline to probe morphology-property relationships of mesoscale polymer ribbon arrays fabricated from a variety of materials in numerous environments. Through the introduction of perfluorodecalin droplets, we illustrate the potential of these ribbon arrays towards applications in adhesive, microrobotic, and biomedical devices.</description>

      <title>Active drive towards elastic spinodals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active renewable matter, a distinctive feature of adaptive living materials, can exhibit highly unusual mechanical responses by actively navigating the space of material parameters. In particular, it can self-drive towards elastic spinodals where the presence of inhomogeneous floppy modes, makes the matter elastically degenerate. The main effect of the implied marginality is stress localization leading to the emergence of force chains which can be actively assembled and disassembled. In this Letter we formalize the concept of spinodal states for general elastic solids and show how such extreme mechanical regimes can be actively navigated.</description>

      <title>A Brief Survey of Fluctuation-induced Interactions in Micro- and Nano-systems and One Exactly Solvable Model as Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations exist in any material object $A$. If $A$ has non-zero temperature $T$, one speaks about thermal fluctuations. If $A$ is at very low $T$, the fluctuations are of quantum origin. Interesting effects appear if two bodies $A$ and $B$ are separated by a fluctuating medium $C$ (say a vacuum, or a fluid close to its {\it critical point}) when the fluctuations are long-ranged, i.e., they decay according to a power-law with the distance. Then the changes of fluctuations in $C$ due to the surfaces and constituents of $A$ are also felt by $B$, and \textit{vice versa}, which leads to a fluctuation induced force (FIF) between them. This force persists in addition to the direct influence of $A$ on $B$ (say, via gravity or Coulomb's force). These FIF's can be of attractive or repulsive character. They may play crucially important role on phenomena involving objects with length scale comparative with the Universe, as well as to the tiny objects relevant for MEMS and NEMS. In the current article we present some basic facts for the FIF and their diversity. Then on the example of one dimensional Ising model with a defect bond we present some new analytical results for such forces.</description>

      <title>Facet formation in slow three-dimensional fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cracks develop various surface patterns as they propagate in three-dimensional (3D) materials. Facet formation in nominally tensile (mode-I) fracture emerge in the slow, non-inertial regime and oftentimes takes the form of surface steps. We show that the same phase-field framework that recently shed basic light on dynamic (inertial) tensile fracture in 3D, also gives rise to crack surface steps. Step formation is shown to be an intrinsically nonlinear phenomenon that involves two essential physical ingredients: finite-strength quenched disorder and a small, mesoscopic anti-plane shear (mode-III) loading component (on top of the dominant tensile, mode-I loading component). We quantify the interplay between disorder (both its strength and spatial correlation length) and mesoscopic mode I+III mixity in controlling step formation. Finally, we show that surface steps grow out of the small-scale, background surface roughness and are composed of two overlapping crack segments connected by a bridging crack, in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Pairing-induced motion of source and inert particles driven by surface tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.11753v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally and theoretically investigate systems with a pair of source and inert particles that interacts through the concentration field. The experimental system comprises a camphor disk as the source particle and a metal washer as the inert particle. Both are floated on a red aqueous solution at various concentrations, where the glycerol modifies the viscosity of the aqueous phase. The particles form a pair owing to the attractive lateral capillary force. As the camphor disk spreads surface-active molecules at the aqueous surface, the camphor disk and metal washer move together, driven by the surface tension gradient. The washer is situated in the front of the camphor disk, keeping the distance constant during their motion, which we call a pairing-induced motion. The pairing-induced motion exhibited a transition between circular and straight motions as the glycerol concentration in the aqueous phase changed. Numerical calculations using a model that considers forces caused by the surface tension gradient and lateral capillary interaction reproduced the observed transition in the pairing-induced motion. Moreover, this transition agrees with the result of the linear stability analysis on the reduced dynamical system obtained by the expansion with respect to the particle velocity. Our results reveal that the effect of the particle velocity cannot be overlooked to describe the interaction through the concentration field.</description>

      <title>A large deformation theory for coupled swelling and growth with application to growing tumors and bacterial biofilms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is significant interest in modelling the mechanics and physics of growth of soft biological systems such as tumors and bacterial biofilms. Solid tumors account for more than 85% of cancer mortality and bacterial biofilms account for a significant part of all human microbial infections.These growing biological systems are a mixture of fluid and solid components and increase their mass by intake of diffusing species such as fluids and nutrients (swelling) and subsequent conversion of some of the diffusing species into solid material (growth). Experiments indicate that these systems swell by large amounts and that the swelling and growth are intrinsically coupled. However, many existing theories for swelling coupled growth employ linear poroelasticity, which is limited to small swelling deformations, and employ phenomenological prescriptions for the dependence of growth rate on concentration of diffusing species and the stress-state in the system. In particular, the termination of growth is enforced through the prescription of a critical concentration of diffusing species and a homeostatic stress. In contrast, by developing a fully coupled swelling-growth theory that accounts for large swelling through nonlinear poroelasticity, we show that the emergent driving stress for growth automatically captures all the above phenomena. Further, we show that for the soft growing systems considered here, the effects of the homeostatic stress and critical concentration can be encapsulated under a single notion of a critical swelling ratio. The applicability of the theory is shown by its ability to capture experimental observations of growing tumors and biofilms under various mechanical and diffusion-consumption constraints. Additionally, compared to generalized mixture theories, our theory is amenable to relatively easy numerical implementation with a minimal physically motivated parameter space.</description>

      <title>Similarity solutions in elastohydrodynamic bouncing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically and numerically the impact of an elastic sphere on a rigid wall in a viscous fluid. Our focus is on the dynamics of the contact, employing the soft lubrication model in which the sphere is separated from the wall by a thin liquid film. In the limit of large sphere inertia, the sphere bounces and the dynamics is close to the Hertz theory. Remarkably, the film thickness separating the sphere from the wall exhibits non-trivial self-similar properties that vary during the spreading and retraction phases. Leveraging these self-similar properties, we establish the energy budget and predict the coefficient of restitution for the sphere. The general framework derived here opens many perspectives to study the lubrication film in impact problems.</description>

      <title>The role of the nucleus for cell mechanics: an elastic phase field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nucleus of eukaryotic cells typically makes up around 30% of the cell volume and has significantly different mechanics, which can make it effectively up to ten times stiffer than the surrounding cytoplasm. Therefore it is an important element for cell mechanics, but a quantitative understanding of its mechanical role during whole cell dynamics is largely missing. Here we demonstrate that elastic phase fields can be used to describe dynamical cell processes in adhesive or confining environments in which the nucleus acts as a stiff inclusion. We first introduce and verify our computational method and then study several applications of large relevance. For cells on adhesive patterns, we find that nuclear stress is shielded by the adhesive pattern. For cell compression between two parallel plates, we obtain force-compression curves that allow us to extract an effective modulus for the cell-nucleus composite. For micropipette aspiration, the effect of the nucleus on the effective modulus is found to be much weaker, highlighting the complicated interplay between extracellular geometry and cell mechanics that is captured by our approach. We also show that our phase field approach can be used to investigate the effects of viscoelasticity and cortical tension.</description>

      <title>Force Propagation in Active Cytoskeletal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04217v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In biological systems, molecular-scale forces and motions are pivotal for enabling processes like motility, shape change, and replication. These forces and motions are organized, amplified, and transmitted across macroscopic scales by active materials such as the cytoskeleton, which drives micron-scale cellular movement and re-organization. Despite the integral role of active materials, understanding how molecular-scale interactions alter macroscopic structure and force propagation remains elusive. This knowledge gap presents challenges to the harnessing and regulation of such dynamics across diverse length scales. Here, we demonstrate how mediating the bundling of microtubules can shift active matter between a global force-transmitting phase and a local force-dissipating phase. A fivefold increase in microtubule effective length results in the transition from local to global phase with a hundredfold increase in velocity autocorrelation. Through theory and simulation, we identify signatures of a percolation-driven transition between the two phases. This provides evidence for how force propagation can be generated when local molecular interactions reach a sufficient length scale. We show that force propagation in the active matter system enables material transport. Consequently, we demonstrate that the global phase is capable of facilitating millimeter-scale human cell transport and manipulation, as well as powering the movement of aqueous droplets. These findings underscore the potential for designing active materials capable of force organization and transmission. Our results lay the foundation for further exploration into the organization and propagation of forces/stresses in biological systems, thereby paving the way for the engineering of active materials in synthetic biology and soft robotics.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Scientific Discovery with Generative Knowledge Extraction, Graph-Based Representation, and Multimodal Intelligent Graph Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), we have transformed a dataset comprising 1,000 scientific papers into an ontological knowledge graph. Through an in-depth structural analysis, we have calculated node degrees, identified communities and connectivities, and evaluated clustering coefficients and betweenness centrality of pivotal nodes, uncovering fascinating knowledge architectures. The graph has an inherently scale-free nature, is highly connected, and can be used for graph reasoning by taking advantage of transitive and isomorphic properties that reveal unprecedented interdisciplinary relationships that can be used to answer queries, identify gaps in knowledge, propose never-before-seen material designs, and predict material behaviors. We compute deep node embeddings for combinatorial node similarity ranking for use in a path sampling strategy links dissimilar concepts that have previously not been related. One comparison revealed structural parallels between biological materials and Beethoven's 9th Symphony, highlighting shared patterns of complexity through isomorphic mapping. In another example, the algorithm proposed a hierarchical mycelium-based composite based on integrating path sampling with principles extracted from Kandinsky's 'Composition VII' painting. The resulting material integrates an innovative set of concepts that include a balance of chaos/order, adjustable porosity, mechanical strength, and complex patterned chemical functionalization. We uncover other isomorphisms across science, technology and art, revealing a nuanced ontology of immanence that reveal a context-dependent heterarchical interplay of constituents. Graph-based generative AI achieves a far higher degree of novelty, explorative capacity, and technical detail, than conventional approaches and establishes a widely useful framework for innovation by revealing hidden connections.</description>
