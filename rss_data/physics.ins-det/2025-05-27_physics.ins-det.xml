      <title>The Under-Water Dark-Room Experimental Facility at the University of Winnipeg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A completely new under-water dark-room test facility (UWDTF) has been built at the University of Winnipeg during 2021-2023, for the testing of the equipments, optical components and detectors before they might be used in different underwater experiments, like the Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K), and others. The Facility is designed for Research and Development activities primarily related to the different calibration systems, which are/will be used in the Water Cherenkov Test Experiment (WCTE) at CERN, the Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector (IWCD) at Tokai, Japan and the Hyper-Kamiokande Far Detector at Kamioka, Japan. The facility houses a large tank of water (1000 gallons) in an optically isolated room, and is equipped with a gantry that provides for the 3D motion of a maximum of 50 lbs of load inside the tank. A customized pan-tilt system has also been devised to accommodate further degrees of freedom of motion to the payload in the polar and azimuthal direction. The facility is primarily used for testing of the under-water camera housings designed for the Hyper-K experiment, besides many other research and development activities. The preliminary results of the camera calibration done in this multi-purpose underwater-darkroom facility are presented here, starting with the description of the vital features of this facility.</description>

      <title>Muon Imaging for Illicit Cargo Detection: A Simulation-Based Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the potential of muon tomography as a non-invasive technique for detecting concealed illicit drugs in cargo, based on detailed simulations performed using the GEANT4 toolkit. A combined analysis of muon scattering and absorption data was employed to enhance material discrimination, with a focus on realistic smuggling scenarios involving cocaine hidden within legitimate cargo. A two-stage inspection protocol is proposed to balance detection speed and resolution. In the first stage, a rapid scan lasting 60 seconds is used to identify anomalous scattering and absorption rates, without requiring full tomographic reconstruction. Upon detection of anomalies, an extended scan ~30 minutes is initiated to enable high-resolution three-dimensional imaging for accurate localization and identification of hidden materials. Simulation results demonstrate that, with a detector spatial resolution of 1 mm (FWHM), concealed contraband such as cocaine can be detected with approximately 3 sigma statistical significance during the rapid scan phase. In extended scans, cocaine packages concealed within banana boxes were successfully visualized and automatically identified using clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN applied to the tomographic reconstruction. These findings confirm the feasibility of cosmic-ray muon tomography as a passive, safe, and effective approach for contraband detection in real-world cargo inspection applications.</description>

      <title>MuGrid-v2: A novel scintillator detector for multidisciplinary applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muography, traditionally recognized as a potent instrument for imaging the internal structure of gigantic objects, has initialized various interdisciplinary applications. As the financial and labor costs of muography detector development hinder their massive applications, we develop a novel muon detector called MuGrid by coupling a monolithic plastic scintillator with the light guide array in order to achieve competitive spatial resolution while substantially reducing production costs. For a prototype detector in 30 cm $\times$ 30 cm, the intrinsic spatial resolution has been optimized toward a millimeter scale. An outdoor field muography experiment was conducted to monitor two buildings for validation purposes. The test successfully resolved the geometric influence of architectural features based on the attenuation of muon flux in a good agreement between experimental results and the simulation prediction.</description>

      <title>Measurement and Calibration Approaches for Full Two-Port Scattering Parameters at mK Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the developed set-up and the characterization approaches to realize full two-port, calibrated scattering parameters measurements at cryogenic temperatures, providing a complete uncertainty budget. The system developed at the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRiM, Italy), exploits the Short-Open-Load-Reciprocal technique, to realize error corrected cryogenic measurements with single cooling cycle. The system operates at temperatures down to the mK range, in the band 4-12 GHz in coaxial line. Calibration standards are referred to traceable room temperature measurements, while a numerical approach is used to evaluate the artifact response shift from room temperature values, and derive key information to enable full measurement uncertainty budget. Moreover, relevant measurement uncertainty contributions are evaluated according to internationally agreed procedures, and a comprehensive uncertainty budget is presented. Test measurements on a 20 dB attenuator are shown as an example. An attenuation value of 20.70 +/- 0.08 dB (95% confidence interval) was obtained at 6 GHz.</description>

      <title>Hybrid RIS-Enhanced ISAC Secure Systems: Joint Optimization in the Presence of an Extended Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike the conventional fully-passive and fully-active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), a hybrid RIS consisting of active and passive reflection units has recently been concerned, which can exploit their integrated advantages to alleviate the RIS-induced path loss. In this paper, we investigate a novel security strategy where the multiple hybrid RIS-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system communicates with downlink users and senses an extended target synchronously. Assuming imperfectly known target location (TL), we consider the joint design of the transmit signal and receive filter bank of the base station (BS), the receive beamformers of all users and the weights of the hybrid RIS. An optimization problem is formulated for maximizing the worst-case sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) subject to secure communication and system power budget constraints. To address this non-convex problem, we leverage generalized fractional programming (GFP) and penalty-dual-decomposition (PDD), and propose a security solution that efficiently optimizes all variables by employing convex optimization approaches. Simulation results show that by incorporating the multiple hybrid RIS into the optimization design, the extended target detection and secure transmission performance of ISAC systems are improved over the state-of-the-art RIS-aided ISAC approaches.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Memory Effects in the Dynamics of Two-Level System Defect Ensembles Using Broadband, Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-level system defects (TLSs) in dielectrics are believed to be the primary source of decoherence in superconducting circuits. However, the precise origin of these defects, including their atomistic morphology, frequency distributions, and dipole moments, remains relatively unexplored. A significant reason for this lack of understanding is that TLS defects are currently probed with resonators or qubits that require complex multi-stage fabrication processes. These probes are packaged, cooled in a dilution refrigerator, and measured to infer their corresponding coherence times. However, even frequency-tunable probes only gather information about TLS defects within their mode volume and a narrow bandwidth around their resonance frequency. As a result, a detailed understanding of the atomistic origins of TLS defects in isolated materials and interfaces is currently lacking, making it challenging to design the next generation of superconducting devices and dielectric materials from first principles. Here, we introduce a novel approach that enables probing the cryogenic dielectric response of TLS defect ensembles using a broadband 3D waveguide. This technique provides evidence of memory effects in the dynamics of TLS defect ensembles that may enable the extraction of critical information about the origins of the underlying TLS defects and their interactions. Importantly, this novel spectroscopy technique can be used at all stages of fabrication and ultimately inform mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of TLS defects on superconducting circuits. As a result, this technique will help usher in a new understanding of the atomistic origin of TLS defects, which will have profound consequences for quantum information science and the broader materials science community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fourth observing run (O4) of Advanced LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA has started in May 2023 and is planned to continue until October 2025. On behalf of the LVK Collaboration, I will cover two topics: Status of the O4 run and latest non-CBC results. Status of the O4 run. The focus will be on detectors' performance and online searches/alerts, drawing on publicly available sources provided by the collaboration. Additionally, I will give an overview of removing noise techniques, including AI approaches that help gain sensitivity at a small cost. Latest non-CBC results. Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) is just one of the potential GW sources: Continuous Waves, Bursts, and Stochastic are still being hunted down. Here, O4 public results of searches will be presented, or the latest O3 will be discussed when the former are not yet available. So far, no GW detections have been associated with these non-CBC sources in any of the searches conducted.</description>

      <title>Ground Calibration Result of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) onboard the Einstein Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on results of the on-ground X-ray calibration of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) built from novel lobster-eye micro-pore optics, onboard the Einstein Probe (EP) satellite. To fully characterize the instrumental performance and properties, a series of tests and calibrations have been carried out at different levels of devices, assemblies and the complete module before the launch of EP. In this paper, we present the calibration results of three flight model modules (FM1, FM5 and FM11) obtained during their end-to-end module calibration experiments carried out at the 100-m X-ray Test Facility (100XF) of IHEP, CAS. Measurements of the Point Spread Function (PSF), effective area, and energy response were performed for multiple incident directions and several characteristic X-ray emission line energies. Specifically, the distributions of the PSF and effective areas are found to be roughly uniform across the FoV, in large agreement with the prediction of lobster-eye optics. Their energy dependence behavior aligns well with theoretical predictions and Monte Carlo simulations. At 1.25 keV, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the focal spot is in range of 3-7 arcmin (a median of 4.2) and the effective area in range of 2-3 $cm^2$. Noticeably, the flight model instruments demonstrate a $\sim1.5$ arcmin spatial resolution improvement over the previously launched Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy. The properties of the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors were also calibrated. The gain coefficients are in range of 6.4-6.9 eV/DN. The energy resolutions are in range of 120-140 eV at 1.25 keV, meeting design requirements. These calibration results have been ingested into the first version of calibration database (CALDB) and applied to the analysis of the scientific data acquired by WXT after the launch of EP.</description>

      <title>Extension of the particle x-ray coincidence technique: The lifetimes and branching ratios apparatus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The particle x-ray coincidence technique (PXCT) was originally developed to measure average lifetimes in the $10^{-17}-10^{-15}$~s range for proton-unbound states populated by electron capture (EC). We have designed and built the Lifetimes and Branching Ratios Apparatus (LIBRA) to be used in the stopped-beam area at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams that extends PXCT to measure lifetimes and decay branching ratios of resonances populated by EC/$\beta^+$ decay. The first application of LIBRA aims to obtain essential nuclear data from $^{60}$Ga EC/$\beta^+$ decay to constrain the thermonuclear rates of the $^{59}$Cu$(p,\gamma)^{60}$Zn and $^{59}$Cu$(p,\alpha)^{56}$Ni reactions, and in turn, the strength of the NiCu nucleosynthesis cycle, which is predicted to significantly impact the modeling of type I x-ray burst light curves and the composition of the burst ashes. Detailed theoretical calculations, Monte Carlo simulations, and performance tests with radioactive sources have been conducted to validate the feasibility of employing LIBRA for the $^{60}$Ga experiment. LIBRA can be utilized to measure most essential ingredients needed for charged-particle reaction rate calculations in a single experiment, in the absence of direct measurements, which are often impractical for radioactive reactants.</description>

      <title>Drift time calibration of the ultra-low material budget GEM-based TPC for MIXE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Muon-Induced X-ray Emission (MIXE) is a non-destructive analytical technique that leverages negative muons to probe elemental and isotopic compositions by detecting characteristic muonic X-rays emitted during atomic cascades and gamma rays from nuclear capture processes. By controlling the muon beam momentum, MIXE enables depth-resolved analysis, spanning microns to centimeters, making it ideal for studying compositional variations in fragile, valuable, or operando samples. To enhance its capabilities, we integrated a twin Time Projection Chamber (TPC) tracker with Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) amplification stages, allowing precise measurement of muon trajectories. A custom-built fiber detector with scintillating fibers and a Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) provides permille-level accuracy in drift velocity calibration, essential for accurate spatial reconstruction. This advanced setup correlates muon stopping points with X-ray emissions, paving the way towards element-sensitive imaging and establishing MIXE as a unique tool for high-resolution, depth-specific elemental analysis across diverse scientific applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A series of beam tests were conducted at the KEK AR test beamline in ordet to investigate the performance of a prototype detector for instrumentation in the low-E beamline at the CERN H2 line. For the silicon strip detector, the simultaneous readout of all strips of the X-Y detector was evaluated, in addition to the detection efficiency being assessed through coincidences with the trigger scintillators. The results demonstrated the successful acquisition of data with full strip readout and the reconstruction of the two-dimensional beam profile. Furthermore, we are contemplating the incorporation of GAGG crystals, an inorganic scintillator characterized by a high light yield ($\sim$$5 \times 10^{4}$ photons/MeV) and a brief time constant ($\sim$60 ns), within the newly developed time-of-flight detector. We assessed the resolution of time-of-flight based on the data, with the objective of achieving the required performance benchmarks through future improvements to the time-of-tlight detector.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Optimization of Modular Neutron Shielding Based on Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel design methodology for neutron beam shutters that integrates Monte Carlo simulations (MCNP) with machine learning techniques to enhance shielding performance and accelerate the design process. The target facility is a compact neutron science platform where neutrons are produced by proton beams from a cyclotron striking a neutron production target. The system includes both thermal and fast neutron beamlines. A beam shutter is installed on the thermal neutron line to reduce occupational radiation exposure during maintenance activities.
  In this work, 200 neutron shutter configurations with varying material sequences were simulated using MCNP. The resulting dataset was used to train a fully connected neural network to predict the neutron flux downstream of the shielding. The trained model was subsequently applied to 1,000 randomly generated shielding configurations for rapid flux prediction and performance ranking. The 20 designs with the lowest predicted flux were selected and further validated via MCNP simulations.
  Results show that the optimal design reduces the neutron flux from 5.61 x 10^9 n/cm2*s at the shutter entrance to 4.96 x 10^5 n/cm2*s at the exit, achieving a reduction of four orders of magnitude. These findings confirm that the integration of machine learning techniques can effectively reduce simulation costs and assist in identifying high-performance shielding configurations, demonstrating the strong potential of data driven approaches in neutron system design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The testing and quality assurance of cryogenic superconducting detectors is a time- and labor-intensive process. As experiments deploy increasingly larger arrays of detectors, new methods are needed for performing this testing quickly. Here, we propose a process for flagging under-performing detector wafers before they are ever tested cryogenically. Detectors are imaged under an optical microscope, and computer vision techniques are used to analyze the images, searching for visual defects and other predictors of poor performance. Pipeline performance is verified via a suite of images with simulated defects, yielding a detection accuracy of 98.6%. Lastly, results from running the pipeline on prototype microwave kinetic inductance detectors from the planned SPT-3G+ experiment are presented.</description>

      <title>First Axion-Like Particle Results from a Broadband Search for Wave-Like Dark Matter in the 44 to 52 $\mu$eV Range with a Coaxial Dish Antenna</title>

Abstract: We present the results from the first axion-like particle search conducted using a dish antenna. The experiment was conducted at room temperature and sensitive to axion-like particles in the $44-52\,\mu\mathrm{eV}$ range ($10.7 - 12.5\,\mathrm{GHz}$). The novel dish antenna geometry was proposed by the BREAD collaboration and previously used to conduct a dark photon search in the same mass range. To allow for axion-like particle sensitivity, the BREAD dish antenna was placed in a $3.9\,\mathrm{T}$ solenoid magnet at Argonne National Laboratory. In the presence of a magnetic field, axion-like dark matter converts to photons at the conductive surface of the reflector. The signal is focused onto a custom coaxial horn antenna and read out with a low-noise radio-frequency receiver. No evidence of axion-like dark matter was observed in this mass range and we place the most stringent laboratory constraints on the axion-photon coupling strength, $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$, in this mass range at 90\% confidence.</description>

      <title>Markov chain Monte Carlo Detector Tomography applied to a NbTiN nanobridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of a flexible and highly accurate Markov chain Monte Carlo Quantum Detector Tomography method as a minimization algorithm to best describe the response of an efficient $120 nm$ wide NbTiN superconducting nanobridge single photon detector. Separation of the internal quantum efficiency and external quantum efficiency is possible due to the difference in saturation behavior of an ideal 1-photon threshold detector as compared to a detector with non-unity 1-photon internal quantum efficiency. From a statistical analysis of our measurements (at $T=4.23\pm0.01K$, $I=29.4\pm0.1\mu A$, $I/I_\text{switch}=0.90\pm0.01$) we find an external quantum efficiency $\eta=(1.60\pm0.05)\cdot10^{-6}$, a 1-photon internal quantum efficiency $p_1=0.568\pm0.008$ and unity multi-photon (2 or more) internal quantum efficiency.</description>

      <title>Error-Free Demodulation of Pixelated Interferograms: Updated review and circumstantial evidence of plagiarism by 4D Technology Corporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the historical development that led to error-free phase demodulation of pixelated spatial-carrier interferograms between 2004 and 2010. It also evaluates evidence suggesting that 4D Technology Corporation (4DTC), in their SPIE 7790 publication [18], may have adopted key concepts from a manuscript submitted by Servin and collaborators, which at that time was still under peer review [17]. We analyze 4DTC algorithms based on 2x2 and 3x3 spatial convolution phase shifting algorithms (SC-PSA), developed from 2004 to 2009 [9-15], and show that they were fundamentally limited to narrow bandwidth fringe demodulation. Notably, only one 4DTC's paper [13] acknowledged major phase errors when these methods were applied to wideband pixelated fringes, but the problem remained unsolved. In 2010, the team at Centro de Investigaciones en Optica (CIO), led by Servin, entered the field [16,17]. At that point, CIO and 4DTC were the only two known groups pursuing error free demodulation of wideband pixelated interferograms. In June 2010, Servin et al submitted to Optics Express [17] a definitive error-free solution introducing a new method: the complex fringe-carrier product followed by step-edge low-pass Fourier filtering. This approach fully superseded the 2x2 and 3x3 kernels used by 4DTC [9-15], reaching the theoretical slope limit for pixelated sensors. Given the notable phase demodulation similarities between papers [17] and [18], and that the presentation of [18] was just seven weeks after Servin submission [17], it is plausible that 4DTC or an affiliate had early access to the submission. The circumstantial evidence suggests that core ideas from [17] were incorporated into 4DTC August presentation [18]. This paper retraces that scientific path and examines the ethical implications of uncredited appropriation in optical research.</description>
