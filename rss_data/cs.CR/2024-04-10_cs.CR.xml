      <title>Exploiting CPU Clock Modulation for Covert Communication Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covert channel attacks represent a significant threat to system security, leveraging shared resources to clandestinely transmit information from highly secure systems, thereby violating the system's security policies. These attacks exploit shared resources as communication channels, necessitating resource partitioning and isolation techniques as countermeasures. However, mitigating attacks exploiting modern processors' hardware features to leak information is challenging because successful attacks can conceal the channel's existence. In this paper, we unveil a novel covert channel exploiting the duty cycle modulation feature of modern x86 processors. Specifically, we illustrate how two collaborating processes, a sender and a receiver can manipulate this feature to transmit sensitive information surreptitiously. Our live system implementation demonstrates that this covert channel can achieve a data transfer rate of up to 55.24 bits per second.</description>

      <title>Privacy and Security of Women's Reproductive Health Apps in a Changing Legal Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FemTech, a rising trend in mobile apps, empowers women to digitally manage their health and family planning. However, privacy and security vulnerabilities in period-tracking and fertility-monitoring apps present significant risks, such as unintended pregnancies and legal consequences. Our approach involves manual observations of privacy policies and app permissions, along with dynamic and static analysis using multiple evaluation frameworks. Our research reveals that many of these apps gather personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive healthcare data. Furthermore, our analysis identifies that 61% of the code vulnerabilities found in the apps are classified under the top-ten Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) vulnerabilities. Our research emphasizes the significance of tackling the privacy and security vulnerabilities present in period-tracking and fertility-monitoring mobile apps. By highlighting these crucial risks, we aim to initiate a vital discussion and advocate for increased accountability and transparency of digital tools for women's health. We encourage the industry to prioritize user privacy and security, ultimately promoting a safer and more secure environment for women's health management.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Out-of-distribution Source Code Data Identification: How Far We Have Gone?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software vulnerabilities (SVs) have become a common, serious, and crucial concern to safety-critical security systems. That leads to significant progress in the use of AI-based methods for software vulnerability detection (SVD). In practice, although AI-based methods have been achieving promising performances in SVD and other domain applications (e.g., computer vision), they are well-known to fail in detecting the ground-truth label of input data (referred to as out-of-distribution, OOD, data) lying far away from the training data distribution (i.e., in-distribution, ID). This drawback leads to serious issues where the models fail to indicate when they are likely mistaken. To address this problem, OOD detectors (i.e., determining whether an input is ID or OOD) have been applied before feeding the input data to the downstream AI-based modules. While OOD detection has been widely designed for computer vision and medical diagnosis applications, automated AI-based techniques for OOD source code data detection have not yet been well-studied and explored. To this end, in this paper, we propose an innovative deep learning-based approach addressing the OOD source code data identification problem. Our method is derived from an information-theoretic perspective with the use of innovative cluster-contrastive learning to effectively learn and leverage source code characteristics, enhancing data representation learning for solving the problem. The rigorous and comprehensive experiments on real-world source code datasets show the effectiveness and advancement of our approach compared to state-of-the-art baselines by a wide margin. In short, on average, our method achieves a significantly higher performance from around 15.27%, 7.39%, and 4.93% on the FPR, AUROC, and AUPR measures, respectively, in comparison with the baselines.</description>

      <title>Boosting Digital Safeguards: Blending Cryptography and Steganography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's digital age, the internet is essential for communication and the sharing of information, creating a critical need for sophisticated data security measures to prevent unauthorized access and exploitation. Cryptography encrypts messages into a cipher text that is incomprehensible to unauthorized readers, thus safeguarding data during its transmission. Steganography, on the other hand, originates from the Greek term for "covered writing" and involves the art of hiding data within another medium, thereby facilitating covert communication by making the message invisible. This proposed approach takes advantage of the latest advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL), especially through the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to improve upon traditional steganographic methods. By embedding encrypted data within another medium, our method ensures that the communication remains hidden from prying eyes. The application of GANs enables a smart, secure system that utilizes the inherent sensitivity of neural networks to slight alterations in data, enhancing the protection against detection. By merging the encryption techniques of cryptography with the hiding capabilities of steganography, and augmenting these with the strengths of AI, we introduce a comprehensive security system designed to maintain both the privacy and integrity of information. This system is crafted not just to prevent unauthorized access or modification of data, but also to keep the existence of the data hidden. This fusion of technologies tackles the core challenges of data security in the current era of open digital communication, presenting an advanced solution with the potential to transform the landscape of information security.</description>

      <title>Is Your AI Truly Yours? Leveraging Blockchain for Copyrights, Provenance, and Lineage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrates into diverse areas, particularly in content generation, ensuring rightful ownership and ethical use becomes paramount. AI service providers are expected to prioritize responsibly sourcing training data and obtaining licenses from data owners. However, existing studies primarily center on safeguarding static copyrights, which simply treats metadata/datasets as non-fungible items with transferable/trading capabilities, neglecting the dynamic nature of training procedures that can shape an ongoing trajectory.
  In this paper, we present \textsc{IBis}, a blockchain-based framework tailored for AI model training workflows. \textsc{IBis} integrates on-chain registries for datasets, licenses and models, alongside off-chain signing services to facilitate collaboration among multiple participants. Our framework addresses concerns regarding data and model provenance and copyright compliance. \textsc{IBis} enables iterative model retraining and fine-tuning, and offers flexible license checks and renewals. Further, \textsc{IBis} provides APIs designed for seamless integration with existing contract management software, minimizing disruptions to established model training processes. We implement \textsc{IBis} using Daml on the Canton blockchain. Evaluation results showcase the feasibility and scalability of \textsc{IBis} across varying numbers of users, datasets, models, and licenses.</description>

      <title>S-box Security Analysis of NIST Lightweight Cryptography Candidates: A Critical Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the resource-constrained world of the digital landscape, lightweight cryptography plays a critical role in safeguarding information and ensuring the security of various systems, devices, and communication channels. Its efficient and resource-friendly nature makes it the ideal solution for applications where computational power is limited. In response to the growing need for platform-specific implementations, NIST issued a call for standardization of Lightweight cryptography algorithms in 2018. Ascon emerged as the winner of this competition. NIST initially established general evaluation criteria for a standard lightweight scheme including security strength, mitigation against side-channel and fault-injection attacks, and implementation efficiency. To verify the security claims, evaluating the individual components used in any cryptographic algorithm is a crucial step. The quality of a substitution box (S-box) significantly impacts the overall security of a cryptographic primitive. This paper analyzes the S-boxes of six finalists in the NIST Lightweight Cryptography (LWC) standardization process. We evaluate them based on well-established cryptographic properties. Our analysis explores how these properties influence the S-boxes' resistance against known cryptanalytic attacks and potential implementation-specific vulnerabilities, thus reflecting on their compliance with NIST's security requirements.</description>

      <title>Privacy-preserving Scanpath Comparison for Pervasive Eye Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As eye tracking becomes pervasive with screen-based devices and head-mounted displays, privacy concerns regarding eye-tracking data have escalated. While state-of-the-art approaches for privacy-preserving eye tracking mostly involve differential privacy and empirical data manipulations, previous research has not focused on methods for scanpaths. We introduce a novel privacy-preserving scanpath comparison protocol designed for the widely used Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, a generalized version of the edit distance algorithm. Particularly, by incorporating the Paillier homomorphic encryption scheme, our protocol ensures that no private information is revealed. Furthermore, we introduce a random processing strategy and a multi-layered masking method to obfuscate the values while preserving the original order of encrypted editing operation costs. This minimizes communication overhead, requiring a single communication round for each iteration of the Needleman-Wunsch process. We demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of our protocol on three publicly available datasets with comprehensive computational performance analyses and make our source code publicly accessible.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Domain Generation Algorithm Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study on the robustness of domain generation algorithm (DGA) classifiers. We implement 32 white-box attacks, 19 of which are very effective and induce a false-negative rate (FNR) of $\approx$ 100\% on unhardened classifiers. To defend the classifiers, we evaluate different hardening approaches and propose a novel training scheme that leverages adversarial latent space vectors and discretized adversarial domains to significantly improve robustness. In our study, we highlight a pitfall to avoid when hardening classifiers and uncover training biases that can be easily exploited by attackers to bypass detection, but which can be mitigated by adversarial training (AT). In our study, we do not observe any trade-off between robustness and performance, on the contrary, hardening improves a classifier's detection performance for known and unknown DGAs. We implement all attacks and defenses discussed in this paper as a standalone library, which we make publicly available to facilitate hardening of DGA classifiers: https://gitlab.com/rwth-itsec/robust-dga-detection</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, ensuring secure communications has become imperative. Due to their low cost and embedded nature, many of these devices operate with computational and energy constraints, neglecting the potential security vulnerabilities that they may bring. This work-in-progress is focused on designing secure communication among remote servers and embedded IoT devices to balance security robustness and energy efficiency. The proposed approach uses lightweight cryptography, optimizing device performance and security without overburdening their limited resources. Our architecture stands out for integrating Edge servers and a central Name Server, allowing secure and decentralized authentication and efficient connection transitions between different Edge servers. This architecture enhances the scalability of the IoT network and reduces the load on each server, distributing the responsibility for authentication and key management.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that hybrid quantum classifiers based on quantum kernel methods and support vector machines are vulnerable against adversarial attacks, namely small engineered perturbations of the input data can deceive the classifier into predicting the wrong result. Nonetheless, we also show that simple defence strategies based on data augmentation with a few crafted perturbations can make the classifier robust against new attacks. Our results find applications in security-critical learning problems and in mitigating the effect of some forms of quantum noise, since the attacker can also be understood as part of the surrounding environment.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning Using Deformable Operators for Secure Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of cloud computing and data-driven applications, it is crucial to protect sensitive information to maintain data privacy, ensuring truly reliable systems. As a result, preserving privacy in deep learning systems has become a critical concern. Existing methods for privacy preservation rely on image encryption or perceptual transformation approaches. However, they often suffer from reduced task performance and high computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Privacy-Preserving framework that uses a set of deformable operators for secure task learning. Our method involves shuffling pixels during the analog-to-digital conversion process to generate visually protected data. Those are then fed into a well-known network enhanced with deformable operators. Using our approach, users can achieve equivalent performance to original images without additional training using a secret key. Moreover, our method enables access control against unauthorized users. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing its potential in cloud-based scenarios and privacy-sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>Aggressive or Imperceptible, or Both: Network Pruning Assisted Hybrid Byzantines in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been introduced to enable a large number of clients, possibly mobile devices, to collaborate on generating a generalized machine learning model thanks to utilizing a larger number of local samples without sharing to offer certain privacy to collaborating clients. However, due to the participation of a large number of clients, it is often difficult to profile and verify each client, which leads to a security threat that malicious participants may hamper the accuracy of the trained model by conveying poisoned models during the training. Hence, the aggregation framework at the parameter server also needs to minimize the detrimental effects of these malicious clients. A plethora of attack and defence strategies have been analyzed in the literature. However, often the Byzantine problem is analyzed solely from the outlier detection perspective, being oblivious to the topology of neural networks (NNs).
  In the scope of this work, we argue that by extracting certain side information specific to the NN topology, one can design stronger attacks. Hence, inspired by the sparse neural networks, we introduce a hybrid sparse Byzantine attack that is composed of two parts: one exhibiting a sparse nature and attacking only certain NN locations with higher sensitivity, and the other being more silent but accumulating over time, where each ideally targets a different type of defence mechanism, and together they form a strong but imperceptible attack. Finally, we show through extensive simulations that the proposed hybrid Byzantine attack is effective against 8 different defence methods.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Understandability and Acceptance of Attack-Defense Trees for Modelling Security Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context and Motivation Attack-Defense Trees (ADTs) are a graphical notation used to model and assess security requirements. ADTs are widely popular, as they can facilitate communication between different stakeholders involved in system security evaluation, and they are formal enough to be verified, e.g., with model checkers. Question/Problem While the quality of this notation has been primarily assessed quantitatively, its understandability has never been evaluated despite being mentioned as a key factor for its success. Principal idea/Results In this paper, we conduct an experiment with 25 human subjects to assess the understandability and user acceptance of the ADT notation. The study focuses on performance-based variables and perception-based variables, with the aim of evaluating the relationship between these measures and how they might impact the practical use of the notation. The results confirm a good level of understandability of ADTs. Participants consider them useful, and they show intention to use them. Contribution This is the first study empirically supporting the understandability of ADTs, thereby contributing to the theory of security requirements engineering.</description>

      <title>Take a Look at it! Rethinking How to Evaluate Language Model Jailbreak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly integrated with various applications. To ensure that LLMs do not generate unsafe responses, they are aligned with safeguards that specify what content is restricted. However, such alignment can be bypassed to produce prohibited content using a technique commonly referred to as jailbreak. Different systems have been proposed to perform the jailbreak automatically. These systems rely on evaluation methods to determine whether a jailbreak attempt is successful. However, our analysis reveals that current jailbreak evaluation methods have two limitations. (1) Their objectives lack clarity and do not align with the goal of identifying unsafe responses. (2) They oversimplify the jailbreak result as a binary outcome, successful or not.
  In this paper, we propose three metrics, safeguard violation, informativeness, and relative truthfulness, to evaluate language model jailbreak. Additionally, we demonstrate how these metrics correlate with the goal of different malicious actors. To compute these metrics, we introduce a multifaceted approach that extends the natural language generation evaluation method after preprocessing the response. We evaluate our metrics on a benchmark dataset produced from three malicious intent datasets and three jailbreak systems. The benchmark dataset is labeled by three annotators. We compare our multifaceted approach with three existing jailbreak evaluation methods. Experiments demonstrate that our multifaceted evaluation outperforms existing methods, with F1 scores improving on average by 17% compared to existing baselines. Our findings motivate the need to move away from the binary view of the jailbreak problem and incorporate a more comprehensive evaluation to ensure the safety of the language model.</description>

      <title>pfl-research: simulation framework for accelerating research in Private Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning (ML) training paradigm where clients own their data and collaborate to train a global model, without revealing any data to the server and other participants. Researchers commonly perform experiments in a simulation environment to quickly iterate on ideas. However, existing open-source tools do not offer the efficiency required to simulate FL on larger and more realistic FL datasets. We introduce pfl-research, a fast, modular, and easy-to-use Python framework for simulating FL. It supports TensorFlow, PyTorch, and non-neural network models, and is tightly integrated with state-of-the-art privacy algorithms. We study the speed of open-source FL frameworks and show that pfl-research is 7-72$\times$ faster than alternative open-source frameworks on common cross-device setups. Such speedup will significantly boost the productivity of the FL research community and enable testing hypotheses on realistic FL datasets that were previously too resource intensive. We release a suite of benchmarks that evaluates an algorithm's overall performance on a diverse set of realistic scenarios. The code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/apple/pfl-research.</description>

      <title>Resource-aware Cyber Deception for Microservice-based Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03151v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyber deception can be a valuable addition to traditional cyber defense mechanisms, especially for modern cloud-native environments with a fading security perimeter. However, pre-built decoys used in classical computer networks are not effective in detecting and mitigating malicious actors due to their inability to blend with the variety of applications in such environments. On the other hand, decoys cloning the deployed microservices of an application can offer a high-fidelity deception mechanism to intercept ongoing attacks within production environments. However, to fully benefit from this approach, it is essential to use a limited amount of decoy resources and devise a suitable cloning strategy to minimize the impact on legitimate services performance. Following this observation, we formulate a non-linear integer optimization problem that maximizes the number of attack paths intercepted by the allocated decoys within a fixed resource budget. Attack paths represent the attacker's movements within the infrastructure as a sequence of violated microservices. We also design a heuristic decoy placement algorithm to approximate the optimal solution and overcome the computational complexity of the proposed formulation. We evaluate the performance of the optimal and heuristic solutions against other schemes that use local vulnerability metrics to select which microservices to clone as decoys. Our results show that the proposed allocation strategy achieves a higher number of intercepted attack paths compared to these schemes while requiring approximately the same number of decoys.</description>

      <title>The Still Secret Ballot: The Limited Privacy Cost of Transparent Election Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After an election, should officials release an electronic record of each ballot? The release of ballots could bolster the legitimacy of the result. But it may also facilitate vote revelation, where an analyst unravels the secret ballot by uniquely linking votes on an anonymous ballot to the voter's name and address in the public voter file. We first provide a theoretical model of how vote revelation could occur under various election-reporting regimes. Perhaps counterintuitively, releasing ballot records is no more revelatory than the typical practice of releasing aggregate vote tallies by precinct and method. We then present the first empirical evaluation of vote revelation, using the 2020 election in Maricopa County, Arizona, as a case study. For 99.8% of voters, the release of ballot records led to no revelation of any vote choice. We conclude the ballot can be both public and still as secret as it is under typical reporting practices.</description>

      <title>Attesting Distributional Properties of Training Data for Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09552v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of machine learning (ML) has been accompanied by increased concerns about its trustworthiness. Several jurisdictions are preparing ML regulatory frameworks. One such concern is ensuring that model training data has desirable distributional properties for certain sensitive attributes. For example, draft regulations indicate that model trainers are required to show that training datasets have specific distributional properties, such as reflecting diversity of the population. We propose the notion of property attestation allowing a prover (e.g., model trainer) to demonstrate relevant distributional properties of training data to a verifier (e.g., a customer) without revealing the data. We present an effective hybrid property attestation combining property inference with cryptographic mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Trustworthiness in ML-Based Network Intrusion Detection with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of Internet and its related communication technologies have consistently increased the risk of cyber-attacks. In this context, a crucial role is played by Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), which are security devices designed to identify and mitigate attacks to modern networks. Data-driven approaches based on Machine Learning (ML) have gained more and more popularity for executing the classification tasks required by signature-based IDSs. However, typical ML models adopted for this purpose do not properly take into account the uncertainty associated with their prediction. This poses significant challenges, as they tend to produce misleadingly high classification scores for both misclassified inputs and inputs belonging to unknown classes (e.g. novel attacks), limiting the trustworthiness of existing ML-based solutions. In this paper, we argue that ML-based IDSs should always provide accurate uncertainty quantification to avoid overconfident predictions. In fact, an uncertainty-aware classification would be beneficial to enhance closed-set classification performance, would make it possible to carry out Active Learning, and would help recognize inputs of unknown classes as truly unknowns, unlocking open-set classification capabilities and Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection. To verify it, we compare various ML-based methods for uncertainty quantification and for open-set classification, either specifically designed for or tailored to the domain of network intrusion detection. Moreover, we develop a custom model based on Bayesian Neural Networks to ensure reliable uncertainty estimates and improve the OoD detection capabilities, thus showing how proper uncertainty quantification can be exploited to significantly enhance the trustworthiness of ML-based IDSs.</description>

      <title>FedQV: Leveraging Quadratic Voting in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) permits different parties to collaboratively train a global model without disclosing their respective local labels. A crucial step of FL, that of aggregating local models to produce the global one, shares many similarities with public decision-making, and elections in particular. In that context, a major weakness of FL, namely its vulnerability to poisoning attacks, can be interpreted as a consequence of the one person one vote (henceforth 1p1v) principle underpinning most contemporary aggregation rules. In this paper, we propose FedQV, a novel aggregation algorithm built upon the quadratic voting scheme, recently proposed as a better alternative to 1p1v-based elections. Our theoretical analysis establishes that FedQV is a truthful mechanism in which bidding according to one's true valuation is a dominant strategy that achieves a convergence rate that matches those of state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our empirical analysis using multiple real-world datasets validates the superior performance of FedQV against poisoning attacks. It also shows that combining FedQV with unequal voting ``budgets'' according to a reputation score increases its performance benefits even further. Finally, we show that FedQV can be easily combined with Byzantine-robust privacy-preserving mechanisms to enhance its robustness against both poisoning and privacy attacks.</description>

      <title>Vulnerabilities of smart contracts and mitigation schemes: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ethereum smart contracts are highly powerful, immutable, and able to retain massive amounts of tokens. However, smart contracts keep attracting attackers to benefit from smart contract flaws and Ethereum unexpected behavior. Thus, methodologies and tools have been proposed to help implement secure smart contracts and to evaluate the security of smart contracts already deployed. Most related surveys focus on tools without discussing the logic behind them. in addition, they assess the tools based on papers rather than testing the tools and collecting community feedback. Other surveys lack guidelines on how to use tools specific to smart contract functionalities. This paper presents a literature review combined with an experimental report that aims to assist developers in developing secure smarts, with a novel emphasis on the challenges and vulnerabilities introduced by NFT fractionalization by addressing the unique risks of dividing NFT ownership into tradeable units called fractions. It provides a list of frequent vulnerabilities and corresponding mitigation solutions. In addition, it evaluates the community most widely used tools by executing and testing them on sample smart contracts. Finally, a comprehensive guide on implementing secure smart contracts is presented.</description>

      <title>Improving the Accuracy-Robustness Trade-Off of Classifiers via Adaptive Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12554v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While prior research has proposed a plethora of methods that build neural classifiers robust against adversarial robustness, practitioners are still reluctant to adopt them due to their unacceptably severe clean accuracy penalties. This paper significantly alleviates this accuracy-robustness trade-off by mixing the output probabilities of a standard classifier and a robust classifier, where the standard network is optimized for clean accuracy and is not robust in general. We show that the robust base classifier's confidence difference for correct and incorrect examples is the key to this improvement. In addition to providing intuitions and empirical evidence, we theoretically certify the robustness of the mixed classifier under realistic assumptions. Furthermore, we adapt an adversarial input detector into a mixing network that adaptively adjusts the mixture of the two base models, further reducing the accuracy penalty of achieving robustness. The proposed flexible method, termed "adaptive smoothing", can work in conjunction with existing or even future methods that improve clean accuracy, robustness, or adversary detection. Our empirical evaluation considers strong attack methods, including AutoAttack and adaptive attack. On the CIFAR-100 dataset, our method achieves an 85.21% clean accuracy while maintaining a 38.72% $\ell_\infty$-AutoAttacked ($\epsilon = 8/255$) accuracy, becoming the second most robust method on the RobustBench CIFAR-100 benchmark as of submission, while improving the clean accuracy by ten percentage points compared with all listed models. The code that implements our method is available at https://github.com/Bai-YT/AdaptiveSmoothing.</description>

      <title>DIAGNOSIS: Detecting Unauthorized Data Usages in Text-to-image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have shown surprising performance in generating high-quality images. However, concerns have arisen regarding the unauthorized data usage during the training or fine-tuning process. One example is when a model trainer collects a set of images created by a particular artist and attempts to train a model capable of generating similar images without obtaining permission and giving credit to the artist. To address this issue, we propose a method for detecting such unauthorized data usage by planting the injected memorization into the text-to-image diffusion models trained on the protected dataset. Specifically, we modify the protected images by adding unique contents on these images using stealthy image warping functions that are nearly imperceptible to humans but can be captured and memorized by diffusion models. By analyzing whether the model has memorized the injected content (i.e., whether the generated images are processed by the injected post-processing function), we can detect models that had illegally utilized the unauthorized data. Experiments on Stable Diffusion and VQ Diffusion with different model training or fine-tuning methods (i.e, LoRA, DreamBooth, and standard training) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in detecting unauthorized data usages.

      <title>Inferentialist Resource Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09217v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In systems modelling, a system typically comprises located resources relative to which processes execute. One important use of logic in informatics is in modelling such systems for the purpose of reasoning (perhaps automated) about their behaviour and properties. To this end, one requires an interpretation of logical formulae in terms of the resources and states of the system; such an interpretation is called a resource semantics of the logic. This paper shows how inferentialism -- the view that meaning is given in terms of inferential behaviour -- enables a versatile and expressive framework for resource semantics. Specifically, how inferentialism seamlessly incorporates the assertion-based approach of the logic of Bunched Implications, foundational in program verification (e.g., as the basis of Separation Logic), and the renowned number-of-uses reading of Linear Logic. This integration enables reasoning about shared and separated resources in intuitive and familiar ways, as well as about the composition and interfacing of system components.</description>

      <title>Federated Transfer Learning with Differential Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning is gaining increasing popularity, with data heterogeneity and privacy being two prominent challenges. In this paper, we address both issues within a federated transfer learning framework, aiming to enhance learning on a target data set by leveraging information from multiple heterogeneous source data sets while adhering to privacy constraints. We rigorously formulate the notion of \textit{federated differential privacy}, which offers privacy guarantees for each data set without assuming a trusted central server. Under this privacy constraint, we study three classical statistical problems, namely univariate mean estimation, low-dimensional linear regression, and high-dimensional linear regression. By investigating the minimax rates and identifying the costs of privacy for these problems, we show that federated differential privacy is an intermediate privacy model between the well-established local and central models of differential privacy. Our analyses incorporate data heterogeneity and privacy, highlighting the fundamental costs of both in federated learning and underscoring the benefit of knowledge transfer across data sets.</description>
