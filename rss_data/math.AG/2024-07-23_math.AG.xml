      <title>Newton-Okounkov bodies and toric degenerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent times, a wide variety of combinatorics has been introduced in order to solve problems from algebraic geometry. Newton-Okounkov bodies and tropical geometry are two such combinatorial theories. As shown by Kaveh and Manon, there is a certain correspondence between these two. Building on this correspondence, and exploiting the link of both theories to toric degenerations, Harada and Escobar obtained their wall-crossing result for prime cones. This result states that moving between two adjacent prime maximal cones in a tropical variety corresponds to a mutation between the associated Newton-Okounkov bodies of these cones.  In this thesis, we provide a method for applying the wall-crossing result to non-prime cones. Our approach uses a procedure developed by Bossinger, Lamboglia, Mincheva and Mohammadi in order to compute an embedding which changes a tropical variety in such a way that a non-prime cone becomes prime. Assuming that adjacent cones stay adjacent, the wall-crossing result can then be applied in this new embedding.  Building on computations by Clarke, Mohammadi and Zaffalon, we show that for Gr(3,6), this approach works. We compute the new embedding and its tropicalization in this case, and study the relation between cones in the new embedding and the original embedding.</description>

      <title>Equivariant cohomology and rings of functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This submission is a PhD dissertation. It constitutes the summary of the author's work concerning the relations between cohomology rings of algebraic varieties and rings of functions on zero schemes and fixed point schemes. It includes the results from the co-authored article arXiv:2212.11836. They are complemented by: an introduction to the theory of group actions on algebraic varieties, with particular focus on vector fields; a historical overview of the field; a few newer results of the author.
  The fundamental theorem from arXiv:2212.11836 says that if the principal nilpotent has a unique zero, then the zero scheme over the Kostant section is isomorphic to the spectrum of the equivariant cohomology ring, remembering the grading in terms of a $\mathbb{C}$ action. In this thesis, we also tackle the case of a singular variety. As long as it is embedded in a smooth variety with regular action, we are able to study its cohomology as well by means of the zero scheme. In largest generality, this allows us to see geometrically a subring of the cohomology ring. We also show that the cohomology ring of spherical varieties appears as the ring of functions on the zero scheme. Lastly, the K-theory conjecture is studied, with some results attained for GKM spaces.</description>

      <title>On a fibre bundle version of the Caporaso-Harris formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Caporaso-Harris formula gives a recursive algorithm to enumerate delta nodal degree d curves in P^2. The recursion is obtained in terms of curves of lower degree that are tangent to a given divisor. This paper presents two generalizations of this method. The first result is on enumeration of one cuspidal curves on P^2, and the second result is an extension to the fiber bundle setting. We solve the question of counting the characteristic number planar nodal cubics in P^3 by extending the idea of Caporaso-Harris.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\rm k}$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 and $G$ a connect, reductive group over it. Let $X$ be a projective $G$-variety of complexity 1. We classify $G$-equivariant normal test configurations of $X$ with integral central fibre via the combinatorial data. We also give a formula of anti-canonical divisors on $X$. Based on this formula, when $X$ is $\mathbb Q$-Fano, we give an expression of the Futaki invariant, and derive a criterion of uniform K-stability in terms of the combinatorial data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the (crystalline) prismatic crystals on a scheme $\mathfrak{X}$. We classify the crystals by $p$-connections on a certain ring and prove a cohomological comparison theorem. This equivalence is more general than the Ogus' equivalence. Moreover, we will prove the equivalence between the crystalline crystals and prismatic crystals by gluing local Ogus-Vologodsky correspondence.</description>

      <title>Approximation of maps between real algebraic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonsingular real algebraic variety Y is said to have the approximation property if for every real algebraic variety X the following holds: if f:X--&gt;Y is a C^inf map that is homotopic to a regular map, then f can be approximated in the C^inf topology by regular maps. In this paper, we characterize the varieties Y with the approximation property. We also characterize the varieties Y with the approximation property combined with a suitable interpolation condition. Some of our results have variants concerning the regular approximation of continuous maps defined on (possibly singular) real algebraic varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic distribution of Galois orbits of algebraic points with small height in a projective variety over a number field. Our main result is a generalization of Yuan's equidistribution theorem that does not require Zhang's lower bound for the essential minimum to be attained. It extends to all projective varieties a theorem of Burgos Gil, Philippon, Rivera-Letelier and the second author for toric varieties, and implies the semiabelian equidistribution theorem of K\"uhne. We also generalize previous work of Chambert-Loir and Thuillier to prove new logarithmic equidistribution results. In the last section, we extend our main theorem to the quasi-projective setting recently introduced by Yuan and Zhang.</description>

      <title>Fast computation of 2-isogenies in dimension 4 and cryptographic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dimension 4 isogenies have first been introduced in cryptography for the cryptanalysis of Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) and have been used constructively in several schemes, including SQIsignHD, a derivative of SQIsign isogeny based signature scheme. Unlike in dimensions 2 and 3, we can no longer rely on the Jacobian model and its derivatives to compute isogenies. In dimension 4 (and higher), we can only use theta-models. Previous works by Romain Cosset, David Lubicz and Damien Robert have focused on the computation of $\ell$-isogenies in theta-models of level $n$ coprime to $\ell$ (which requires to use $n^g$ coordinates in dimension $g$). For cryptographic applications, we need to compute chains of $2$-isogenies, requiring to use $\geq 3^g$ coordinates in dimension $g$ with state of the art algorithms.
  In this paper, we present algorithms to compute chains of $2$-isogenies between abelian varieties of dimension $g\geq 1$ with theta-coordinates of level $n=2$, generalizing a previous work by Pierrick Dartois, Luciano Maino, Giacomo Pope and Damien Robert in dimension $g=2$. We propose an implementation of these algorithms in dimension $g=4$ to compute endomorphisms of elliptic curve products derived from Kani's lemma with applications to SQIsignHD and SIDH cryptanalysis. We are now able to run a complete key recovery attack on SIDH when the endomorphism ring of the starting curve is unknown within a few seconds on a laptop for all NIST SIKE parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized complex geometry was classically formulated by the language of differential geometry. In this paper, we reformulated a generalized complex manifold as a holomorphic symplectic differentiable formal stack in a homotopical sense. Meanwhile, by developing the machinery for shifted symplectic formal stack, we prove that the coisotropic intersection inherits shifted Poisson structure. Generalized complex branes are also studied.</description>

      <title>$K$-Positivity Preservers and their Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $K$-positivity preservers with given closed $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, i.e., linear maps $T:\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ such that $T\mathrm{Pos}(K)\subseteq\mathrm{Pos}(K)$ holds, and their generators $A:\mathrm{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to\mathrm{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, i.e., $e^{tA}\mathrm{Pos}(K)\subseteq\mathrm{Pos}(K)$ holds for all $t\geq 0$. We characterize these maps $T$ for any closed $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ in Theorem 4.5. We characterize the maps $A$ in Theorem 5.8 for $K=\mathbb{R}^n$ and give partial results for general $K$. In Example 5.10 we give a map $A$ such that $e^{tA}$ is a positivity preserver for all $t\geq \tau$ for some $\tau&gt;0$ but not for $t\in (0,\tau)$, i.e., we have an eventually positive semi-group.</description>

      <title>The syzygy distinguisher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new distinguisher for alternant and Goppa codes, whose complexity is subexponential in the code length. It does not suffer from the strong regime limitations of the previous distinguishers or structure recovery algorithms: in particular, it applies to the codes used in the Classic McEliece candidate for postquantum cryptography standardization. The invariants that allow us to distinguish are graded Betti numbers of the homogeneous coordinate ring of a shortening of the dual code.
  Since its introduction in 1978, this is the first time an analysis of the McEliece cryptosystem breaks the exponential barrier.</description>

      <title>Tautological families of cyclic covers of projective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the existence of tautological families on a Zariski open set of the coarse moduli space parametrizing certain Galois covers over projective spaces. More specifically, let ($1$) $\mathscr{H}_{n.r.d}$ (resp. $M_{n,r,d}$) be the stack (resp. coarse moduli) parametrizing smooth simple cyclic covers of degree $r$ over the projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$ branched along a divisor of degree $rd \geq 4$, and ($2$) $\mathscr{H}_{1,3,d_1,d_2}$ (resp. $M_{1,3,d_1,d_2}$) be the stack (resp. coarse moduli) of smooth cyclic triple covers over $\mathbb{P}^1$ with $2d_1-d_2 \geq 4$ and $2d_2-d_1 \geq 4$. In the former case, we show that such a family exists if and only if $\textrm{gcd}(rd, n+1) \mid d$ while in the latter case, we show that it always exists. We further show that even when such a family exists, often it cannot be extended to the open locus of objects without extra automorphisms. The existence of tautological families on a Zariski open set of its coarse moduli can be interpreted in terms of rationality of the stack if the coarse moduli space is rational. Combining our results with known results on the rationality of the coarse moduli of points on $\mathbb{P}^1$ and the coarse moduli of plane curves, we determine the rationality of $\mathscr{H}_{1,r,d}$ (resp. $\mathscr{H}_{2,r,d}$) for $rd \geq 4$ (resp. $rd\geq 49$). On the other hand $\mathscr{H}_{1,3,d_{1},d_{2}}$ is unirational, and we show that its coarse moduli $M_{1,3,d_1,d_2}$ is unirational and fibred over a rational base by homogeneous varieties which are rational if $\textrm{char}(\mathbb{k}) = 0$. Our study is motivated by the work of Gorchinskiy and Viviani on the moduli of hyperelliptic curves.</description>

      <title>$\ell$-adic local systems and Higgs bundles: the generic case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a projective smooth geometrically connected curve defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ of cardinality $q$. Let $S$ be a finite set of closed points of $X$. Let $\bar{X}$ and $\bar{S}$ be the base change of $X$, $S$ to an algebraic closure. We consider the set of $\ell$-adic ($\ell\nmid q$) local systems of rank $n$ over $\bar{X}-\bar{S}$ with prescribed tame regular semisimple and generic ramifications in $\bar{S}$. The genericity ensures that such an $\ell$-adic local system is automatically irreducible. We show that the number of these $\ell$-adic local systems fixed by Frobenius endomorphism equals the number of stable logarithmic Higgs bundles of rank $n$ and degree $e$ coprime to $n$, with a fixed residue, up to a power of $q$. In the split case, this number is equal to the number of stable parabolic Higgs bundles (with full flag structures) fixed by $\mathbb{G}_m$-action with generic parabolic weights.</description>

Abstract: We prove the integrality and finiteness of open BPS invariants of toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds relative to Aganagic-Vafa outer branes, defined from open Gromov-Witten invariants by the Labastida-Mari\~no-Ooguri-Vafa formula. Specializing to disk invariants, we extend the open/closed correspondence of Gromov-Witten invariants to BPS invariants and prove the integrality of a class of genus-zero BPS invariants of toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds, thereby providing additional examples for the conjecture of Klemm-Pandharipande.</description>

      <title>On Zariski multiplicity conjecture for quasihomogeneous surfaces with non-isolated singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a finitely determined map germ $f$ from $(\mathbb{C}^2,0)$ to $(\mathbb{C}^3,0)$. In this case, the double point curve $D(f)$ plays a fundamental role in studying the topology of the image of $f$. When $f$ is quasihomogeneous and has corank $1$, we present a characterization of the fold components of the double point curve $D(f)$. In our setting, we also consider Zariski multiplicity question for a pair of germs of (parametrized) quasihomogeneous surfaces $(\textbf{X},0)$ and $(\textbf{Y},0)$ in $(\mathbb{C}^3,0)$ with one dimensional singular set. Finally, we characterize Whitney equisingularity of an unfolding $\mathcal{F} =(f_t,t)$ of $f$ through the constancy of the Milnor number of a single plane curve in the source. This gives in some sense an answer to a question by Ruas in $1994$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the cancellation and splitting of the symplectic modules. The symplectic cancellation result presented here can be thought of as an analog of the Projective module cancellation result of Fasel. The symplectic splitting is similar to Murthy's splitting theorem. To prove the cancellation and splitting, we carefully analyze the Postnikov towers in the $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy category. Then we prove the vanishing of top cohomology with coefficients in some homotopy sheaf. As another application of the vanishing results, we answer partially a question of Mrinal Das about the isomorphism of $(d-1)$-th Euler class group and $(d-1)$-th Chow group, where $d$ is the dimension of the underlying smooth affine variety.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on the genus of Albanese fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a minimal irregular surface of general type, whose Albanese map induces a hyperelliptic fibration $f:\,S \to B$ of genus $g$.We prove a quadratic upper bound on the genus $g$, i.e., $g\leq h\big(\chi(\mathcal{O}_S)\big)$, where $h$ is a quadratic function. We also construct examples showing that the quadratic upper bounds can not be improved to the linear ones. In the special case when $p_g(S)=q(S)=1$, we show that $g\leq 14$.</description>

      <title>Degenerations and Fibrations of K3 Surfaces: Lattice Polarisations and Mirror Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tyurin degenerations of K3 surfaces are degenerations whose central fibre consists of a pair of rational surfaces glued along a smooth elliptic curve. We study the lattice theory of such Tyurin degenerations, establishing a notion of lattice polarisation that is compatible with existing definitions for the general fibre and the rational surfaces comprising the central fibre. We separately consider elliptically fibred K3 surfaces, where the base of the fibration admits a splitting into a pair of discs with specified monodromy around the boundary. In this setting we establish a notion of lattice polarisation for the induced elliptic fibrations over discs, which is compatible with the existing definition for K3 surfaces. Finally, we discuss the mirror symmetric correspondence between these two settings.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we explain how mirror symmetry for basic local models in the Gross-Siebert program can be understood through the non-toric blowup construction described by Gross-Hacking-Keel. This is part of a program to understand the symplectic geometry of affine cluster varieties through their SYZ fibrations.</description>

      <title>The tropical critical points of an affine matroid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the number of tropical critical points of an affine matroid (M,e) is equal to the beta invariant of M. Motivated by the computation of maximum likelihood degrees, this number is defined to be the degree of the intersection of the Bergman fan of (M,e) and the inverted Bergman fan of N=(M/e)*, where e is an element of M that is neither a loop nor a coloop. Equivalently, for a generic weight vector w on E-e, this is the number of ways to find weights (0,x) on M and y on N with x+y=w such that on each circuit of M (resp. N), the minimum x-weight (resp. y-weight) occurs at least twice. This answers a question of Sturmfels.</description>

      <title>Tame maximal weights, relative types and valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we obtain a class of tame maximal weights (Zhou weights). Using Tian functions (the function of jumping numbers with respect to the exponents of a holomorphic function or the multiples of a plurisubharmonic function) as a main tool, we establish an expression of relative types (Zhou numbers) to these tame maximal weights in integral form, which shows that the relative types satisfy tropical multiplicativity and tropical additivity. Thus, the relative types to Zhou weights are valuations (Zhou valuations) on the ring of germs of holomorphic functions. We use Tian functions and Zhou numbers to measure the singularities of plurisubharmonic functions, involving jumping numbers and multiplier ideal sheaves. Especially, the relative types to Zhou weights characterize the division relations of the ring of germs of holomorphic functions. Finally, we consider a global version of Zhou weights on domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$, which is a generalization of the pluricomplex Green functions, and we obtain some properties of them, including continuity and some approximation results.</description>

      <title>Black hole thermodynamic free energy as $A$-discriminants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the free energy $\mathcal{F}$ and temperature $T$ of black holes, considered as a thermodynamic system, can be viewed as an $A$-discriminant of an appropriately-defined polynomial. As such, mathematical results about $A$-discriminants may lead to implications about black hole thermodynamics. In particular, for static spacetimes with spherical, planar, or hyperbolic symmetry, the number of distinct thermodynamic phases depend on the number of distinct terms in the metric component $g_{tt}$. We prove that if $g_{tt}$ consists of $N_f$ distinct terms, then the $\mathcal{F}$-$T$ curve consists of $N_f-2$ cusps, which in turn leads to $N_f-1$ distinct thermodynamic phases. This result is applied to explicit examples of the Schwarzschild-AdS, Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m, power-law Maxwell, and Euler--Heisenberg black holes.</description>

      <title>Semistable reduction of covers of degree $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a local field of residue characteristic $p&gt;0$. We explain how to compute the semistable reduction of $K$-curves $Y$ equipped with a degree-$p$ morphism from $Y$ to the projective line. This includes the reduction at $p$ of superelliptic curves of degree $p$, but our approach is not limited to Galois covers. We give particular attention to the reduction of plane quartics at $p=3$, which case is implemented in SageMath. We use the language of non-archimedean analytic geometry in the sense of Berkovich. A key tool is the different function of Cohen, Temkin, and Trushin.</description>

      <title>SL(2,Z)-matrixizations of generalized Markov numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $k\geq 0$, a $k$-generalized Markov number is an integer which appears in some positive integer solution to the $k$-generalized Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k(yz + zx + xy) = (3 + 3k)xyz$. In this paper, we discuss a combinatorial structure of generalized Markov numbers. To investigate this structure in detail, we use two families of matrices: the $k$-generalized Cohn matrices and the $k$-Markov-monodromy matrices, which are elements of $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ whose $(1,2)$-entries are $k$-generalized Markov numbers. We show that these two families of matrices recover the tree structure of the positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation, and we give geometric interpretations and a combinatorial interpretation of $k$-generalized Markov numbers. As an application, we provide a computation algorithm of classical Markov number from a one-dimensional dynamical viewpoint. Moreover, we clarify a relation between $k$-generalized Markov numbers and toric surface singularities via continued fractions.</description>
