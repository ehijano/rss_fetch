      <title>Energy Costs and Neural Complexity Evolution in Changing Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cognitive Buffer Hypothesis (CBH) posits that larger brains evolved to enhance survival in changing conditions. However, larger brains also carry higher energy demands, imposing additional metabolic burdens. Alongside brain size, brain organization plays a key role in cognitive ability and, with suitable architectures, may help mitigate energy challenges. This study evolves Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) used by Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to investigate how environmental variability and energy costs influence the evolution of neural complexity, defined in terms of ANN size and structure. Results indicate that under energy constraints, increasing seasonality led to smaller ANNs. This challenges CBH and supports the Expensive Brain Hypothesis (EBH), as highly seasonal environments reduced net energy intake and thereby constrained brain size. ANN structural complexity primarily emerged as a byproduct of size, where energy costs promoted the evolution of more efficient networks. These results highlight the role of energy constraints in shaping neural complexity, offering in silico support for biological theory and energy-efficient robotic design.</description>

      <title>Modeling Bioelectric State Transitions in Glial Cells: An ASAL-Inspired Computational Approach to Glioblastoma Initiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how glioblastoma (GBM) emerges from initially healthy glial tissue requires models that integrate bioelectrical, metabolic, and multicellular dynamics. This work introduces an ASAL-inspired agent-based framework that simulates bioelectric state transitions in glial cells as a function of mitochondrial efficiency (Meff), ion-channel conductances, gap-junction coupling, and ROS dynamics. Using a 64x64 multicellular grid over 60,000 simulation steps, we show that reducing Meff below a critical threshold (~0.6) drives sustained depolarization, ATP collapse, and elevated ROS, reproducing key electrophysiological signatures associated with GBM. We further apply evolutionary optimization (genetic algorithms and MAP-Elites) to explore resilience, parameter sensitivity, and the emergence of tumor-like attractors. Early evolutionary runs converge toward depolarized, ROS-dominated regimes characterized by weakened electrical coupling and altered ionic transport. These results highlight mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupted bioelectric signaling as sufficient drivers of malignant-like transitions and provide a computational basis for probing the bioelectrical origins of oncogenesis.</description>

      <title>NNGPT: Rethinking AutoML with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building self-improving AI systems remains a fundamental challenge in the AI domain. We present NNGPT, an open-source framework that turns a large language model (LLM) into a self-improving AutoML engine for neural network development, primarily for computer vision. Unlike previous frameworks, NNGPT extends the dataset of neural networks by generating new models, enabling continuous fine-tuning of LLMs based on closed-loop system of generation, assessment, and self-improvement. It integrates within one unified workflow five synergistic LLM-based pipelines: zero-shot architecture synthesis, hyperparameter optimization (HPO), code-aware accuracy/early-stop prediction, retrieval-augmented synthesis of scope-closed PyTorch blocks (NN-RAG), and reinforcement learning. Built on the LEMUR dataset as an audited corpus with reproducible metrics, NNGPT emits from a single prompt and validates network architecture, preprocessing code, and hyperparameters, executes them end-to-end, and learns from result. The PyTorch adapter makes NNGPT framework-agnostic, enabling strong performance: NN-RAG achieves 73% executability on 1,289 targets, 3-shot prompting boosts accuracy on common datasets, and hash-based deduplication saves hundreds of runs. One-shot prediction matches search-based AutoML, reducing the need for numerous trials. HPO on LEMUR achieves RMSE 0.60, outperforming Optuna (0.64), while the code-aware predictor reaches RMSE 0.14 with Pearson r=0.78. The system has already generated over 5K validated models, proving NNGPT as an autonomous AutoML engine. Upon acceptance, the code, prompts, and checkpoints will be released for public access to enable reproducibility and facilitate community usage.</description>

      <title>Ranking-Enhanced Anomaly Detection Using Active Learning-Assisted Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a significant challenge in cybersecurity due to their stealthy and long-term nature. Modern supervised learning methods require extensive labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world cybersecurity environments. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach that leverages AutoEncoders for unsupervised anomaly detection, augmented by active learning to iteratively improve the detection of APT anomalies. By selectively querying an oracle for labels on uncertain or ambiguous samples, we minimize labeling costs while improving detection rates, enabling the model to improve its detection accuracy with minimal data while reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. We provide a detailed formulation of the proposed Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder-based anomaly detection framework and show how the active learning loop iteratively enhances the model. The framework is evaluated on real-world imbalanced provenance trace databases produced by the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like attacks constitute as little as 0.004\% of the data. The datasets span multiple operating systems, including Android, Linux, BSD, and Windows, and cover two attack scenarios. The results have shown significant improvements in detection rates during active learning and better performance compared to other existing approaches.</description>

      <title>From One Attack Domain to Another: Contrastive Transfer Learning with Siamese Networks for APT Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) pose a major cybersecurity challenge due to their stealth, persistence, and adaptability. Traditional machine learning detectors struggle with class imbalance, high dimensional features, and scarce real world traces. They often lack transferability-performing well in the training domain but degrading in novel attack scenarios. We propose a hybrid transfer framework that integrates Transfer Learning, Explainable AI (XAI), contrastive learning, and Siamese networks to improve cross-domain generalization. An attention-based autoencoder supports knowledge transfer across domains, while Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) select stable, informative features to reduce dimensionality and computational cost. A Siamese encoder trained with a contrastive objective aligns source and target representations, increasing anomaly separability and mitigating feature drift. We evaluate on real-world traces from the DARPA Transparent Computing (TC) program and augment with synthetic attack scenarios to test robustness. Across source to target transfers, the approach delivers improved detection scores with classical and deep baselines, demonstrating a scalable, explainable, and transferable solution for APT detection.</description>

      <title>Walking the Weight Manifold: a Topological Approach to Conditioning Inspired by Neuromodulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One frequently wishes to learn a range of similar tasks as efficiently as possible, re-using knowledge across tasks. In artificial neural networks, this is typically accomplished by conditioning a network upon task context by injecting context as input. Brains have a different strategy: the parameters themselves are modulated as a function of various neuromodulators such as serotonin. Here, we take inspiration from neuromodulation and propose to learn weights which are smoothly parameterized functions of task context variables. Rather than optimize a weight vector, i.e. a single point in weight space, we optimize a smooth manifold in weight space with a predefined topology. To accomplish this, we derive a formal treatment of optimization of manifolds as the minimization of a loss functional subject to a constraint on volumetric movement, analogous to gradient descent. During inference, conditioning selects a single point on this manifold which serves as the effective weight matrix for a particular sub-task. This strategy for conditioning has two main advantages. First, the topology of the manifold (whether a line, circle, or torus) is a convenient lever for inductive biases about the relationship between tasks. Second, learning in one state smoothly affects the entire manifold, encouraging generalization across states. To verify this, we train manifolds with several topologies, including straight lines in weight space (for conditioning on e.g. noise level in input data) and ellipses (for rotated images). Despite their simplicity, these parameterizations outperform conditioning identical networks by input concatenation and better generalize to out-of-distribution samples. These results suggest that modulating weights over low-dimensional manifolds offers a principled and effective alternative to traditional conditioning.</description>

      <title>Nauplius Optimisation for Autonomous Hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Underwater vehicles must operate in strong currents, limited acoustic bandwidth, and persistent sensing requirements where conventional swarm optimisation methods are unreliable. This paper formulates an irreversible hydrodynamic deployment problem for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) swarms and presents Nauplius Optimisation for Autonomous Hydrodynamics (NOAH), a novel nature-inspired swarm optimisation algorithm that combines current-aware drift, irreversible settlement in persistent sensing nodes, and colony-based communication. Drawing inspiration from the behaviour of barnacle nauplii, NOAH addresses the critical limitations of existing swarm algorithms by providing hydrodynamic awareness, irreversible anchoring mechanisms, and colony-based communication capabilities essential for underwater exploration missions. The algorithm establishes a comprehensive foundation for scalable and energy-efficient underwater swarm robotics with validated performance analysis. Validation studies demonstrate an 86% success rate for permanent anchoring scenarios, providing a unified formulation for hydrodynamic constraints and irreversible settlement behaviours with an empirical study under flow.</description>

      <title>Self-Organization and Spectral Mechanism of Attractor Landscapes in High-Capacity Kernel Hopfield Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13053v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based learning methods can dramatically increase the storage capacity of Hopfield networks, yet the dynamical mechanism behind this enhancement remains poorly understood. We address this gap by unifying the geometric analysis of the attractor landscape with the spectral theory of kernel machines. Using a novel metric, "Pinnacle Sharpness," we first uncover a rich phase diagram of attractor stability, identifying a "Ridge of Optimization" where the network achieves maximal robustness under high-load conditions. Phenomenologically, this ridge is characterized by a "Force Antagonism," where a strong driving force is balanced by a collective feedback force. Theoretically, we reveal that this phenomenon arises from a specific reorganization of the weight spectrum, which we term \textit{Spectral Concentration}. Unlike a simple rank-1 collapse, our analysis shows that the network on the ridge self-organizes into a critical state: the leading eigenvalue is amplified to maximize global stability (Direct Force), while the trailing eigenvalues are preserved to maintain high memory capacity (Indirect Force). These findings provide a complete physical picture of how high-capacity associative memories are formed, demonstrating that optimal performance is achieved by tuning the system to a spectral "Goldilocks zone" between rank collapse and diffusion.</description>
