      <title>StochasticBarrier.jl: A Toolbox for Stochastic Barrier Function Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present StochasticBarrier.jl, an open-source Julia-based toolbox for generating Stochastic Barrier Functions (SBFs) for safety verification of discrete-time stochastic systems with additive Gaussian noise. StochasticBarrier.jl certifies linear, polynomial, and piecewise affine (PWA) systems. The latter enables verification for a wide range of system dynamics, including general nonlinear types. The toolbox implements a Sum-of-Squares (SOS) optimization approach, as well as methods based on piecewise constant (PWC) functions. For SOS-based SBFs, StochasticBarrier.jl leverages semi-definite programming solvers, while for PWC SBFs, it offers three engines: two using linear programming (LP) and one based on gradient descent (GD). Benchmarking StochasticBarrier.jl against the state-of-the-art shows that the tool outperforms existing tools in computation time, safety probability bounds, and scalability across over 30 case studies. Compared to its closest competitor, StochasticBarrier.jl is up to four orders of magnitude faster, achieves significant safety probability improvements, and supports higher-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>IoT-Driven Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS) for Net Zero Energy Buildings: Concept, Integration and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Construction and operating of buildings is one of the major contributors to global greenhouse emissions. With the inefficient usage of energy due to human behavior and manual operation, the energy consumption of buildings is further increased. These challenges highlight the need for improved Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS) integrated with Internet of Things (IoT) and data driven intelligence to enhance energy-efficiency in a building and contribute to Net-Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) targets. This paper offers four keys contributions: i) a systematic review of IoT enabled BEMS including components, network architecture and functional capabilities, ii) an evaluation of real-world BEMS datasets to support Artificial Intelligence (AI) based predictive control, iii) an analysis of integration challenges related to interoperability, smart grids and net-zero energy strategies, and iv) a case study highlighting global best practices, performances outcomes, and lesson learned for scaling advanced BEMS solutions.</description>

      <title>Grid-Mind: An LLM-Orchestrated Multi-Fidelity Agent for Automated Connection Impact Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable tool-use capabilities, yet their application to power system operations remains largely unexplored. This paper presents Grid-Mind, a domain-specific LLM agent that interprets natural-language interconnection requests and autonomously orchestrates multi-fidelity power system simulations. The LLM-first architecture positions the language model as the central decision-making entity, employing an eleven-tool registry to execute Connection Impact Assessment (CIA) studies spanning steadystate power flow, N-1 contingency analysis, transient stability, and electromagnetic transient screening. A violation inspector grounds every decision in quantitative simulation outputs, while a three-layer anti-hallucination defence mitigates numerical fabrication risk through forced capacity-tool routing and post-response grounding validation. A prompt-level self-correction mechanism extracts distilled lessons from agent failures, yielding progressive accuracy improvements without model retraining. End-to-end evaluation on 50 IEEE 118-bus scenarios (DeepSeek-V3, 2026-02-23) achieved 84.0% tool-selection accuracy and 100% parsing accuracy. A separate 56-scenario self-correction suite passed 49 of 56 cases (87.5%) with a mean score of 89.3. These results establish a reproducible baseline for continued refinement while maintaining auditable, simulation-grounded decision support.</description>

      <title>Fast-Response Balancing Capacity of Alkaline Electrolyzers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy transition requires flexible technologies to maintain grid stability, and electrolyzers are playing an increasingly important role in meeting this need. While previous studies often question the dynamic capabilities of large-scale alkaline electrolyzer systems, we assess their potential to provide balancing services using real manufacturer data. Unlike common approaches, we propose the decoupling between the total electrolyzer power and a smaller fractions of power actually offered on balancing markets. Adapting an existing methodology, we analyze alkaline electrolyzer systems and extend the assessment to Germany and Europe. Our results show that large-scale electrolyzers are technically capable of delivering fast-response balancing services, with significantly lower dynamic requirements than previously assumed. The planned electrolyzers in Germany could cover the entire balancing capacity market, potentially saving around 13 % of their electricity costs, excluding energy balancing revenues. The decoupling also resolves part of the trade-off for electrolyzer manufacturers, enabling the design of less dynamic but more stable systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey discusses recent advancements in SYCL compiler implementations, one of the crucial aspects of compiler construction for heterogeneous computing systems. We explore the transition from traditional compiler construction, from Single-Source Multiple Compiler Passes (SMCP) to a more advanced approach to Single-Source Single Compiler Pass (SSCP). The survey analyzes multiple papers that researched the different developments of SYCL implementation based on SSCP and their approach to enhancing performance and addressing separate challenges.</description>

      <title>KAN-Koopman Based Rapid Detection Of Battery Thermal Anomalies With Diagnostics Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early diagnosis of battery thermal anomalies is crucial to ensure safe and reliable battery operation by preventing catastrophic thermal failures. Battery diagnostics primarily rely on battery surface temperature measurements and/or estimation of core temperatures. However, aging-induced changes in the battery model and limited training data remain major challenges for model-based and machine-learning based battery state estimation and diagnostics. To address these issues, we propose a Kolomogorov-Arnold network (KAN) in conjunction with a Koopman-based detection algorithm that leverages the unique advantages of both methods. Firstly, the lightweight KAN provides a model-free estimation of the core temperature to ensure rapid detection of battery thermal anomalies. Secondly, the Koopman operator is learned in real time using the estimated core temperature from KAN and the measured surface temperature of the battery to provide a prediction for diagnostic residual generation. This online learning approach overcomes the challenges of model changes, while the integrated structure reduces the dependence on large datasets. Furthermore, we derive analytical conditions that provide diagnostic guarantees on our KAN-Koopman detection scheme. Our simulation results illustrate a significant reduction in detection time with the proposed algorithm compared to the baseline Koopman-only algorithm.</description>

      <title>Hawkes Identification with a Prescribed Causal Basis: Closed-Form Estimators and Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by the recent surge in neural-inspired modeling, point processes have gained significant traction in systems and control. While the Hawkes process is the standard model for characterizing random event sequences with memory, identifying its unknown kernels is often hindered by nonlinearity. Approaches using prescribed basis kernels have emerged to enable linear parameterization, yet they typically rely on iterative likelihood methods and lack rigorous analysis under model misspecification. This paper justifies a closed-form Least Squares identification framework for Hawkes processes with prescribed kernels. We guarantee estimator existence via the almost-sure positive definiteness of the empirical Gram matrix and prove convergence to the true parameters under correct specification, or to well-defined pseudo-true parameters under misspecification. Furthermore, we derive explicit Central Limit Theorems for both regimes, providing a complete and interpretable asymptotic theory. We demonstrate these theoretical findings through comparative numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Robustness certificates in data-driven non-convex optimization with additively-uncertain constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider decision-making problems that are formulated as non-convex optimization programs where uncertainty enters the constraints through an additive term, independent of the decision variables, and robustness is imposed using a finite data-set, according to the scenario robust optimization paradigm. By exploiting the structure of the constraints, we show that both a priori and a posteriori distribution-free probabilistic robustness certificates for a possibly sub-optimal solution to the resulting data-driven optimization problem can be obtained with minimal computational effort. Building on these results, we also discuss a one-shot and an incremental procedure to determine the size of the data-set so as to guarantee a user-chosen robustness level. Notably, both the a posteriori robustness assessment and incremental data-set sizing do not require to solve the non-convex scenario program. A comparative analysis performed on the unit commitment problem using real data reveals a limited increase in conservativeness with a significant computational saving with respect to the application of scenario theory results for general, non necessarily structured, non-convex problems.</description>

      <title>Disturbance-Adaptive Data-Driven Predictive Control: Trading Comfort Violations for Savings in Building Climate Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09238v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) has demonstrated significant potential in improving energy efficiency in building climate control, outperforming traditional controllers commonly used in modern building management systems. Among MPC variants, Data-driven Predictive Control (DPC) offers the advantage of modeling building dynamics directly from data, thereby substantially reducing commissioning efforts. However, inevitable model uncertainties and measurement noise can result in comfort violations, even with dedicated MPC setups. This paper introduces a Disturbance-Adaptive DPC (DAD-DPC) framework that ensures asymptotic satisfaction of predefined violation bounds without knowing the uncertainty and noise distributions. The framework employs a data-driven pipeline based on Willems' Fundamental Lemma and conformal prediction for application in building climate control. The proposed DAD-DPC framework was validated through four building cases using the high-fidelity BOPTEST simulation platform and an occupied campus building, Polydome. DAD-DPC successfully regulated the average comfort violations to meet pre-defined bounds. Notably, the 5%-violation DAD-DPC setup achieved 30.1%/11.2%/27.1%/20.5% energy savings compared to default controllers across four cases. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in balancing energy consumption and comfort violations, offering a practical solution for building climate control applications.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Aware Model Predictive Decision-Making for Socially-Compliant Autonomous Driving in Mixed Urban Traffic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must negotiate with pedestrians in ways that are both safe and socially compliant. We present an interaction-aware model predictive decision-making (IAMPDM) framework that integrates a gap-acceptance-inspired intention model with MPC to jointly reason about human intent and vehicle control in real time. The pedestrian module produces a continuous crossing-propensity signal - driven by time-to-collision (TTC) with an intention discounting mechanism - that modulates MPC safety terms and minimum-distance constraints. We implement IAMPDM in a projection-based, motion-tracked simulator and compare it against a rule-based intention-aware controller (RBDM) and a conservative non-interactive baseline (NIA). In a human-in-the-decision-loop study with 25 participants, intention-aware methods shortened negotiation and completion time relative to NIA across scenarios, at the expense of tighter TTC/DST margins, with no significant difference between IAMPDM and RBDM except for TTC in one scenario. Results indicate that intention-aware decision-making algorithms reduce pedestrian crossing time and improve subjective ratings of comfort, safety, and trust relative to a non-cooperative decision-making algorithm. We discuss implications for real-world deployment of interaction-aware autonomous vehicles. We detail decision-making calibration and real-time implementation (CasADi/IPOPT) and propose deployment guardrails - minimum surrogate-safety margins, deadlock prevention - to balance efficiency with safety.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Multi-Agent MCTS for Safety-Critical Coordination in Mixed-Autonomy Roundabouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01856v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigating unsignalized roundabouts in mixed-autonomy traffic presents significant challenges due to dense vehicle interactions, lane-changing complexities, and behavioral uncertainties of human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This paper proposes a safety-critical decision-making framework for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) navigating dual-lane roundabouts alongside HDVs. We formulate the problem as a multi-agent Markov Decision Process and develop a hierarchical safety assessment mechanism that evaluates three critical interaction types: CAV-to-CAV (C2C), CAV-to-HDV (C2H), and CAV-to-Boundary (C2B). A key contribution is our lane-specific uncertainty model for HDVs, which captures distinct behavioral patterns between inner and outer lanes, with outer-lane vehicles exhibiting $2.3\times$ higher uncertainty due to less constrained movements. We integrate this safety framework with a multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm that employs safety-aware pruning to eliminate high-risk trajectories while maintaining computational efficiency. The reward function incorporates Shapley value-based credit assignment to balance individual performance with group coordination. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under both fully autonomous (100% AVs) and mixed traffic (50% AVs + 50% HDVs) conditions. Compared to benchmark methods, our framework consistently reduces trajectory deviations across all AVs and significantly lowers the rate of Post-Encroachment Time (PET) violations, achieving only 1.0% in the fully autonomous scenario and 3.2% in the mixed traffic setting.</description>

      <title>Integrating Conductor Health into Dynamic Line Rating and Unit Commitment under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic line rating (DLR) enables greater utilization of existing transmission lines by leveraging real-time weather data. However, the elevated temperature operation (ETO) of conductors under DLR is often overlooked, despite its long-term impact on conductor health. This paper addresses this issue by 1) quantifying risk-based depreciation costs associated with ETO and 2) proposing a Conductor Health-Aware Unit Commitment (CHA-UC) that internalizes these costs in operational decisions. CHA-UC incorporates a robust linear approximation of conductor temperature and integration of expected depreciation costs due to hourly ETO into the objective function. Case studies on the Texas 123-bus backbone test system using NOAA weather data demonstrate that the proposed CHA-UC model reduces the total cost by 0.74\% and renewable curtailment by 85\% compared to static line rating (SLR) and outperforms quantile regression forest-based methods, while conventional DLR operation without risk consideration resulted in higher costs due to excessive ETO. Further analysis of the commitment decisions and the line temperature statistics confirms that the CHA-UC achieves safer line flows by shifting generator commitments. Finally, we examine the emergent correlation behaviors arising between wind generation and DLR forecast errors, and show that CHA-UC adaptively manages this effect by relaxing flows for risk-hedging conditions while tightening flows for risk-amplifying ones.</description>

      <title>An Exact Solution Algorithm for the Bi-Level Optimization Problem of Electric Vehicles Charging Station Placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses electric vehicle (EV) charging station placement through a bi-level optimization model, where the upper-level planner maximizes net revenue by selecting station locations under budget constraints, while EV users at the lower level choose routes and charging stations to minimize travel and charging costs. To account for range anxiety, we construct a battery-expanded network and apply a shortest path algorithm with Frank-Wolfe traffic assignment. Our primary contribution is developing the first exact solution algorithm for large scale EV charging station placement problems. We propose a Branch-and-Price-and-Cut algorithm enhanced with value function cuts and column generation. While existing research relies on heuristic methods that provide no optimality guarantees or exact algorithms that require prohibitively long runtimes, our exact algorithm delivers globally optimal solutions with mathematical certainty under a reasonable runtime. Computational experiments on the Eastern Massachusetts network (74 nodes, 248 links), the Anaheim network (416 nodes, 914 links), and the Barcelona network (110 zones, 1,020 nodes, and 2,512 links) demonstrate exceptional performance. Our algorithm terminates within minutes rather than hours, while achieving optimality gaps below 1% across all instances. This result represents a computational speedup of over two orders of magnitude compared to existing methods. The algorithm successfully handles problems with over 300,000 feasible combinations, which transform EV charging infrastructure planning from a computationally prohibitive problem into a tractable optimization task suitable for practical decision making problem for real world networks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport-Based Decentralized Multi-Agent Distribution Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized control framework for distribution matching in multi-agent systems (MAS), where agents collectively achieve a prescribed terminal spatial distribution. The problem is formulated using optimal transport (Wasserstein distance), which provides a principled measure of distributional discrepancy and serves as the basis for the control design. To avoid solving the global optimal transport problem directly, the distribution-matching objective is reformulated into a tractable per-agent decision process, enabling each agent to identify its desired terminal locations using only locally available information. A sequential weight-update rule is introduced to construct feasible local transport plans, and a memory-based correction mechanism is incorporated to maintain reliable operation under intermittent and range-limited communication. Convergence guarantees are established, showing cycle-wise improvement of a surrogate transport cost under both linear and nonlinear agent dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves effective and scalable distribution matching while operating fully in a decentralized manner.</description>

      <title>Usability Study of Security Features in Programmable Logic Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) drive industrial processes critical to society, for example, water treatment and distribution, electricity and fuel networks. Search engines, e.g., Shodan, have highlighted that PLCs are often left exposed to the Internet, one of the main reasons being the misconfigurations of security settings. This leads to the question - why do these misconfigurations occur and, specifically, whether usability of security controls plays a part. To date, the usability of configuring PLC security mechanisms has not been studied. We present the first investigation through a task based study and subsequent semi-structured interviews (N=19). We explore the usability of PLC connection configurations and two key security mechanisms (i.e., access levels and user administration). We find that the use of unfamiliar labels, layouts and misleading terminology exacerbates an already complex process of configuring security mechanisms. Our results uncover various misperceptions about the security controls and how design constraints, e.g., safety and lack of regular updates due to the long-term nature of such systems, provide significant challenges to the realization of modern HCI and usability principles. Based on these findings, we provide design recommendations to bring usable security in industrial settings at par with its IT counterpart.</description>

      <title>Learning to Control Unknown Strongly Monotone Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a strongly monotone game where the players' utility functions include a reward function and a linear term for each dimension, with coefficients that are controlled by the manager. Gradient play converges to a unique Nash equilibrium (NE) that does not optimize the global objective. The global performance at NE can be improved by imposing linear constraints on the NE, also known as a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE). We therefore want the manager to control the coefficients such that they impose the desired constraint on the NE. However, this requires knowing the players' rewards and action sets. Obtaining this game information is infeasible in a large-scale network and violates user privacy. To overcome this, we propose a simple algorithm that learns to shift the NE to meet the linear constraints by adjusting the controlled coefficients online. Our algorithm only requires the linear constraints violation as feedback and does not need to know the reward functions or the action sets. We prove that our algorithm converges with probability 1 to the set of GNE given by coupled linear constraints. We then prove an L2 convergence rate of near-$O(t^{-1/4})$.</description>

      <title>Qubit-Efficient Quantum Annealing for Stochastic Unit Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Unit Commitment (SUC) has been proposed to manage the uncertainties driven by renewable integration, but it leads to significant computational complexity. When accelerated by Benders Decomposition (BD), the master problem becomes binary integer programming, which is still NP-hard and computationally demanding for classical methods. Quantum Annealing (QA), known for efficiently solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, presents a potential solution. However, existing quantum algorithms rely on slack variables to handle linear binary inequality constraints, leading to increased qubit consumption and reduced computational efficiency. To solve the problem, this paper introduces the Powell-Hestenes-Rockafellar Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier (PHR-ALM) method to eliminate the need for slack variables, making qubit consumption independent of the increasing number of Benders cuts. To further reduce the qubit overhead, quantum ADMM is applied to break large-scale SUC into smaller blocks for sequential solutions, which does not scale with the number of generators. Finally, the simulation results on both 4-generator and the IEEE bus-118 systems demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the proposed algorithm, indicating its superior qubit and runtime efficiency over classical and baseline quantum approaches on the D-Wave QPU platform.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10167v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.</description>

      <title>Characterizing State Space Model and Hybrid Language Model Performance with Long Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emerging applications such as AR are driving demands for machine intelligence capable of processing continuous and/or long-context inputs on local devices. However, currently dominant models based on Transformer architecture suffers from the quadratic computational and memory overhead, which hinders applications required to process long contexts. This has spurred a paradigm shift towards new architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) and SSM-Transformer hybrid models, which provide near-linear scaling. The near-linear scaling enabled efficient handling of millions of tokens while delivering high performance in recent studies. Although such works present promising results, their workload characteristics in terms of computational performance and hardware resource requirements are not yet thoroughly explored, which limits our understanding of their implications to the system level optimizations. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, compara-ive benchmarking of carefully selected Transformers, SSMs, and hybrid models specifically for long-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs. Our analysis shows that SSMs are well-suited for on-device AI on consumer and embedded GPUs for long context inferences. While Transformers are up to 1.9x faster at short sequences (&lt;8K tokens), SSMs demonstrate a dramatic performance inversion, becoming up to 4x faster at very long contexts (~57K tokens), thanks to their linear computational complexity and ~64% reduced memory footrprint. Our operator-level analysis reveals that custom SSM kernels like selective scan despite being hardware-aware to minimize memory IO, dominate the inference runtime on edge platforms, accounting for over 55% of latency due to their sequential, element-wise nature. To foster further research, we will open-source our characterization framework.</description>

      <title>Human-Exoskeleton Kinematic Calibration to Improve Hand Tracking for Dexterous Teleoperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hand exoskeletons are critical tools for dexterous teleoperation and immersive manipulation interfaces, but achieving accurate hand tracking remains a challenge due to user-specific anatomical variability and donning inconsistencies. These issues lead to kinematic misalignments that degrade tracking performance and limit applicability in precision tasks. We propose a subject-specific calibration framework for exoskeleton-based hand tracking that estimates virtual link parameters through residual-weighted optimization. A data-driven approach is introduced to empirically tune cost function weights using motion capture ground truth, enabling accurate and consistent calibration across users. Implemented on the Maestro hand exoskeleton with seven healthy participants, the method achieved substantial reductions in joint and fingertip tracking errors across diverse hand geometries. Qualitative visualizations using a Unity-based virtual hand further demonstrate improved motion fidelity. The proposed framework generalizes to exoskeletons with closed-loop kinematics and minimal sensing, laying the foundation for high-fidelity teleoperation and robot learning applications.</description>
