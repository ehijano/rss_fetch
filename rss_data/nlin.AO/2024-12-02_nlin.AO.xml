      <title>A strategy to control synchronized dynamics in swarmalator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization forms the basis of many coordination phenomena in natural systems, enabling them to function cohesively and support their fundamental operations. However, there are scenarios where synchronization disrupts a system's proper functioning, necessitating mechanisms to control or suppress it. While several methods exist for controlling synchronization in non-spatially embedded oscillators, to the best of our knowledge no such strategies have been developed for swarmalators (oscillators that simultaneously move in space and synchronize in time). In this work, we address this gap by introducing a novel control strategy based on Hamiltonian control theory to suppress synchronization in a system of swarmalators confined to a one-dimensional space. The numerical investigations we performed, demonstrate that the proposed control strategy effectively suppresses synchronized dynamics within the swarmalator population. We studied the impact of the number of controlled swarmalators as well as the strength of the control term, in its original form and in a simplified one.</description>

      <title>Collective decision-making with heterogeneous biases: Role of network topology and susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of groups to make accurate collective decisions depends on a complex interplay of various factors, such as prior information, biases, social influence, and the structure of the interaction network. Here, we investigate a spin model that accounts for heterogeneous preferences and enables control over the non-linearity of social interactions. Building on previous results for complete graphs and regular 2D lattices, we investigate how the modification of network topology towards (sparse) random graphs can affect collective decision-making. We use two different measures of susceptibility to assess the responsiveness of the system to internal and external perturbations. In particular, we investigate how the maximum of susceptibility depends on network connectivity. Based on our findings, we discuss how collective systems might adapt to changes in environmental fluctuations by adjusting their network structure or the nature of their social interactions in order to remain in the region of maximal susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Stability of equilibria of the spatially inhomogeneous Vicsek-BGK equation across a bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Vicsek-BGK equation is a kinetic model for alignment of particles moving with constant speed between stochastic reorientation events with sampling from a von Mises distribution. The spatially homogeneous model shows a steady state bifurcation with exchange of stability. The main result of this work is an extension of the bifurcation result to the spatially inhomogeneous problem under the additional assumption of a sufficiently large Knudsen number. The mathematical core is the proof of linearized stability, which employs a new hypocoercivity approach based on Laplace-Fourier transformation. The bifurcation result includes global existence of smooth solutions for close-to-equilibrium initial data. For large data smooth solutions might blow up in finite time whereas weak solutions with bounded Boltzmann entropy are shown to exist globally.</description>
