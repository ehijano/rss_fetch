      <title>Self-Similar Mass Accretion History in Scale-Free Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a scale-free $N$-body simulation generated with the ABACUS $N$-body code, we test the robustness of halo mass accretion histories via their convergence to self-similarity. We compare two halo finders, ROCKSTAR and COMPASO. We find superior self-similarity in halo mass accretion histories determined using ROCKSTAR, with convergence to 5% or better between $\sim10^2$ to $10^5$ particles. For COMPASO we find weaker convergence over a similar region, with at least 10% between $\sim10^2$ to $10^4$ particles. Furthermore, we find the convergence to self-similarity improves as the simulation evolves, with the largest and deepest regions of convergence appearing after the scale factor quadrupled from the time at which non-linear structures begin to form. With sufficient time evolution, halo mass accretion histories are converged to self-similarity within 5% with as few as $\sim70$ particles for COMPASO and within 2% for as few as $\sim30$ particles for ROCKSTAR.</description>

      <title>Power spectrum multipoles and clustering wedges during the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the viability of using power spectrum clustering wedges as summary statistics of 21cm surveys during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). For observations along a large lightcone $z\sim 7-9$, the power spectrum is subject to large anisotropic effects due to the evolution along the light-of-sight. Information on the physics of reionization can be extracted from the anisotropy using the power spectrum multipoles. Signals of the power spectrum monopole are highly correlated at scales smaller than the typical ionization bubble, which can be disentangled by including higher-order multipoles. By simulating observations of the low frequency part of the SKA Observatory, we find that the sampling of the cylindrical wavenumber $k$-space is highly non-uniform due to the baseline distribution. Measurements in clustering wedges can be used for isolating parts of $k$-space with relatively uniform sampling, allowing for more precise parameter inference. Using Fisher Matrix forecasts, we find that the reionization model can be inferred with per-cent level precision with $\sim 120$hrs of integration time using SKA-Low. Comparing to using only the power spectrum monopole above the foreground wedge, model inference using multipole power spectra in clustering wedges yields a factor of $\sim 3$ improvement on parameter constraints.</description>

      <title>Denoising Diffusion Delensing Delight: Reconstructing the Non-Gaussian CMB Lensing Potential with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal extraction of cosmological information from observations of the Cosmic Microwave Back- ground critically relies on our ability to accurately undo the distortions caused by weak gravitational lensing. In this work, we demonstrate the use of denoising diffusion models in performing Bayesian lensing reconstruction. We show that score-based generative models can produce accurate, uncor- related samples from the CMB lensing convergence map posterior, given noisy CMB observations. To validate our approach, we compare the samples of our model to those obtained using established Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods, which assume a Gaussian lensing potential. We then go beyond this assumption of Gaussianity, and train and validate our model on non-Gaussian lensing data, obtained by ray-tracing N-body simulations. We demonstrate that in this case, samples from our model have accurate non-Gaussian statistics beyond the power spectrum. The method provides an avenue towards more efficient and accurate lensing reconstruction, that does not rely on an approx- imate analytic description of the posterior probability. The reconstructed lensing maps can be used as an unbiased tracer of the matter distribution, and to improve delensing of the CMB, resulting in more precise cosmological parameter inference.</description>

      <title>Development of realistic simulations for the polarization of the cosmic microwave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can help probe cosmic inflation (via primordial $B$ modes) and test parity-violating physics (via cosmic birefringence), but realizing the potential of these opportunities requires precise control and mitigation of systematic effects. To this end, some experiments (including LiteBIRD) will use rotating half-wave plates (HWPs) as polarization modulators. Ideally, this choice should remove the $1/f$ noise component in the observed polarization and reduce intensity-to-polarization leakage, but any real HWP is characterized by non-idealities that, if not properly treated in the analysis, can lead to new systematics. In this thesis, after briefly introducing the science case, we discuss the macro steps that make up any CMB experiment, introduce the HWP, and present a new time-ordered data (TOD) simulation pipeline tailored to a LiteBIRD-like experiment that returns TOD and binned maps for realistic beams and HWPs. We show that the simulation framework can be used to study how the HWP non-idealities affect the measured cosmic birefringence angle, resulting in a few degrees bias for a realistic choice of HWP. We also derive analytical formulae to model the observed temperature and polarization maps and test them against the simulations. Finally, we present a simple, semi-analytical end-to-end model to propagate the non-idealities through the macro-steps that make up any CMB experiment (observation of multi-frequency maps, foreground cleaning, and power spectra estimation) and compute the HWP-induced bias on the estimated tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, finding that the HWP leads to underestimating $r$. We also show how gain calibration of the CMB temperature can be used to partially mitigate the non-idealities' effect and present a set of recommendations for the HWP design that can help maximize the benefits of gain calibration.

      <title>Constraints on primordial black holes from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH) can efficiently form black hole binaries in the early universe. We update the resulting constraints on PBH abundance using data from the third observational run (O3) of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. To capture a wide range of PBH scenarios, we consider a variety of mass functions, including critical collapse in the QCD epoch in the presence of non-Gaussianities. Applying hierarchical Bayesian analysis to a population binaries consisting of primordial and astrophysical black holes, we find that, in every scenario, the PBHs can make up at most $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-3}$ of dark matter in the mass range $1-200~M_\odot$. The shape and strength of the constraints are insensitive to the type of non-Gaussianities, the modifications to the mass function during the QCD epoch, or the modelling of the astrophysical PBH population.</description>

      <title>A PAge-like Unified Dark Fluid Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unified dark fluid model unifies dark matter and dark energy into a single component, providing an alternative and more concise framework for interpreting cosmological observations. We introduce a PAge-like Unified Dark Fluid (PUDF) model based on the PAge approximation (Huang 2020), which is parameterized by the age of the universe and an $\eta$ parameter indicating the deviation from Einstein-De Sitter Universe. The PUDF model shares many similar features of the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and can effectively describe the large-scale structure formation and late-time cosmic acceleration. We constrain the PUDF model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillation measurements including those from the most recent DESI 2024, the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae, and the Cosmic Chronometers compilation. Although the PUDF performs well in fitting all the cosmological datasets, the joint analysis of the data still favors the $\Lambda$CDM model over the PUDF model, according to the Bayesian evidence of model comparison.</description>

      <title>FREmu: Power Spectrum Emulator for $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate gravity in the non-linear regime of cosmic structure using measurements from Stage-IV surveys, it is imperative to accurately compute large-scale structure observables, such as non-linear matter power spectra, for gravity models that extend beyond general relativity. However, the theoretical predictions of non-linear observables are typically derived from N-body simulations, which demand substantial computational resources. In this study, we introduce a novel public emulator, termed FREmu, designed to provide rapid and precise forecasts of non-linear power spectra specifically for the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model across scales $0.0089 h \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}&lt;k&lt;0.5 h \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and redshifts $0&lt;z&lt;3$. FREmu leverages Principal Component Analysis and Artificial Neural Networks to establish a mapping from parameters to power spectra, utilizing training data derived from the Quijote-MG simulation suite. With a parameter space encompassing 7 dimensions, including $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_b$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sigma_8$, $M_{\nu}$ and $f_{R_0}$, the emulator achieves an accuracy exceeding 95% for the majority of cases, thus proving to be highly efficient for constraining parameters.</description>

      <title>Alleviating $H_0$ and $S_8$ Tensions Simultaneously in K-essence Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work begins by examining the early-Universe inflationary epoch of a special K-essence model, which incorporates a linear coupling term between the scalar field potential and the canonical Lagrangian. For the power law potential, we both numerically and analytically prove that the inflationary parameters such as the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are compatible with the recent BICEP/Keck observations. Continuing this work, our analysis based on comparing early-Universe observations with late-Universe measurements indicates that the tension on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the growth of structure parameter $S_8$ can be alleviated simultaneously. More precisely, compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, our model can reduce $H_0$ tension to roughly $2.2 \sigma$ and the $S_8$ discrepancy diminishes to $0.82\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Swampland Conjectures Constraints on Dark Energy from a Highly Curved Field Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay of the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture (TCC) and the swampland distance conjecture (SDC) in the context of multifield dark energy in a curved field space. In this scenario, the phase of accelerated expansion is realized as non-geodesic motion in a highly-curved field space, reminiscent of models developed in the context of inflation. The model features a stable attractor solution with near constant equation of state $w\simeq -1$, and predicts that the current era of accelerated expansion is eternal. The latter implies an eventual conflict with the TCC, which holds that the duration of any epoch of cosmic acceleration is bounded by the requirement that the large-scale observable universe is blind to Planck-scale early universe physics. This tension can be resolved by an interplay with the distance conjecture: for suitable parameter values, the apparent violation of the TCC occurs well after the fields have traversed a Planckian distance. The SDC then predicts a breakdown of the effective field theory (EFT) before the TCC can be violated. We derive the constraints on the model arising from the SDC+TCC and the de Sitter conjecture. We demonstrate that the model can be consistent with both swampland conjectures and observational data from Planck 2018 and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the decametre sky at subarcminute resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The largely unexplored decameter radio band (10-30 MHz) provides a unique window for studying a range of astronomical topics, such as auroral emission from exoplanets, inefficient cosmic ray acceleration mechanisms, fossil radio plasma, and free-free absorption. The scarcity of low-frequency studies is mainly due to the severe perturbing effects of the ionosphere. Here we present a calibration strategy that can correct for the ionosphere in the decameter band. We apply this to an observation from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) between 16 to 30 MHz . The resulting image covers 330 square degrees of sky at a resolution of 45", reaching a sensitivity of 12 mJy/beam. Residual ionospheric effects cause additional blurring ranging between 60 to 100". This represents an order of magnitude improvement in terms of sensitivity and resolution compared to previous decameter band observations. In the region we surveyed, we have identified four fossil plasma sources. These rare sources are believed to contain old, possibly re-energised, radio plasma originating from previous outbursts of active galactic nuclei. At least three of them are situated near the center of low-mass galaxy clusters. Notably, two of these sources display the steepest radio spectral index among all the sources detected at 23 MHz. This indicates that fossil plasma sources constitute the primary population of steep-spectrum sources at these frequencies, emphasising the large discovery potential of ground-based decameter observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Simons Observatory (SO) is a cosmic microwave background (CMB) survey experiment that includes small-aperture telescopes (SATs) observing from an altitude of 5,200 m in the Atacama Desert in Chile. The SO SATs will cover six spectral bands between 27 and 280 GHz to search for primordial B-modes to a sensitivity of $\sigma(r)=0.002$, with quantified systematic errors well below this value. Each SAT is a self-contained cryogenic telescope with a 35$^\circ$ field of view, 42 cm diameter optical aperture, 40 K half-wave plate, 1 K refractive optics, and $&lt;0.1$ K focal plane that holds $&gt;12,000$ TES detectors. We describe the nominal design of the SATs and present details about the integration and testing for one operating at 93 and 145 GHz.</description>

      <title>Learned harmonic mean estimation of the Bayesian evidence with normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the learned harmonic mean estimator with normalizing flows - a robust, scalable and flexible estimator of the Bayesian evidence for model comparison. Since the estimator is agnostic to sampling strategy and simply requires posterior samples, it can be applied to compute the evidence using any Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique, including saved down MCMC chains, or any variational inference approach. The learned harmonic mean estimator was recently introduced, where machine learning techniques were developed to learn a suitable internal importance sampling target distribution to solve the issue of exploding variance of the original harmonic mean estimator. In this article we present the use of normalizing flows as the internal machine learning technique within the learned harmonic mean estimator. Normalizing flows can be elegantly coupled with the learned harmonic mean to provide an approach that is more robust, flexible and scalable than the machine learning models considered previously. We perform a series of numerical experiments, applying our method to benchmark problems and to a cosmological example in up to 21 dimensions. We find the learned harmonic mean estimator is in agreement with ground truth values and nested sampling estimates. The open-source harmonic Python package implementing the learned harmonic mean, now with normalizing flows included, is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Relic Gravitational Waves from the Chiral Plasma Instability in the Standard Cosmological Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the primordial plasma, at temperatures above the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking, the presence of chiral asymmetries is expected to induce the development of helical hypermagnetic fields through the phenomenon of chiral plasma instability. It results in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence due to the high conductivity and low viscosity and sources gravitational waves that survive in the universe today as a stochastic polarized gravitational wave background. In this article, we show that this scenario only relies on Standard Model physics, and therefore the observable signatures, namely the relic magnetic field and gravitational background, are linked to a single parameter controlling the initial chiral asymmetry. We estimate the magnetic field and gravitational wave spectra, and validate these estimates with 3D numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark matter and astrophysics from tomographic $\gamma$-ray cross-correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cross-correlation between maps of the unresolved $\gamma$-ray background constructed from the 12-year data release of the Fermi Large-Area Telescope, and the overdensity of galaxies in the redshift range $z\lesssim0.4$ as measured by the 2MASS Photometric Redshift survey and the WISE-SuperCOSMOS photometric survey. A signal is detected at the $8-10\sigma$ level, which we interpret in terms of both astrophysical $\gamma$-ray sources, and WIMP dark matter decay and annihilation. The sensitivity achieved allows us to characterise the energy and redshift dependence of the signal, and we show that the latter is incompatible with a pure dark matter origin. We thus use our measurement to place an upper bound on the WIMP decay rate and the annihilation cross-section, finding constraints that are competitive with those found in other analyses. Our analysis is based on the extraction of clean model-independent observables that can then be used to constrain arbitrary astrophysical and particle physics models. In this sense we produce measurements of the $\gamma$-ray emissivity as a function of redshift and rest-frame energy $\epsilon$, and of a quantity $F(\epsilon)$ encapsulating all WIMP parameters relevant for dark matter decay or annihilation. We make these measurements, together with a full account of their statistical uncertainties, publicly available.</description>

      <title>B-modes from galaxy cluster alignments in future surveys</title>

Abstract: Intrinsic alignment (IA) of source galaxies represents an important contaminant for upcoming cosmic shear surveys. In particular, it is expected on general grounds that IA contains a B-mode while the weak lensing signal does not. Thus, a detection of B-modes offers the possibility to study directly the IA signal of the sources. Galaxy clusters exhibit strong IA and are therefore a natural candidate to look for a B-mode signal. We forecast the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for B-modes from IA of galaxy clusters in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We use a perturbative model for the IA multipoles based on the Effective Field Theory of Intrinsic Alignments (EFT of IA), which has recently been validated against N-body simulations. We forecast SNR $\approx 12$ and find that this detectability is not significantly impacted by different analysis choices. Lastly, we also apply our forecast to clusters in the redMaPPer SDSS and DESY1 samples. We find SNR $\approx 5$ and SNR $\approx 3$, respectively, suggesting a detection is within reach, provided accurate redshift information is available.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cosmology With the CMB $\times$ LIM-Nulling Convergence</title>

Abstract: Lensing reconstruction maps from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide direct observations of the matter distribution of the universe without the use of a biased tracer. Such maps, however, constitute projected observables along the line of sight that are dominated by their low-redshift contributions. To cleanly access high-redshift information, Maniyar et al. showed that a linear combination of lensing maps from both CMB and line intensity mapping (LIM) observations can exactly null the low-redshift contribution to CMB lensing convergence. In this paper we explore the scientific returns of this nulling technique. We show that LIM-nulling estimators can place constraints on standard $\Lambda$CDM plus neutrino mass parameters that are competitive with traditional CMB lensing. Additionally, we demonstrate that as a clean probe of the high-redshift universe, LIM-nulling can be used for model-independent tests of cosmology beyond $\Lambda$CDM and as a probe of the high-redshift matter power spectrum.</description>

      <title>A New Probe of the High-z BAO scale: BAO tomography With CMB $\times$ LIM-Nulling Convergence</title>

Abstract: Standard rulers such as the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale serve as workhorses for precision tests of cosmology, enabling distance measurements that probe the geometry and expansion history of our Universe. Aside from BAO measurements from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), most standard ruler techniques operate at relatively low redshifts and depend on biased tracers of the matter density field. In a companion paper, we explored the scientific reach of nulling estimators, where CMB lensing convergence maps are cross-correlated with linear combinations of similar maps from line intensity mapping (LIM) to precisely null out the low-redshift contributions to CMB lensing. We showed that nulling estimators can be used to constrain the high redshift matter power spectrum and showed that this spectrum exhibits discernible BAO features. Here we propose using these features as a standard ruler at high redshifts that does not rely on biased tracers. Forecasting such a measurement at $z \sim 5$, we find that next-generation instruments will be able to constrain the BAO scale to percent-level precision at $7.2 \%$, while our futuristic observing scenario can constrain the BAO scale to $4\%$ precision. This constitutes a fundamentally new kind of BAO measurement during early epochs in our cosmic history.</description>

      <title>Scalar perturbations from inflation in the presence of gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how Abelian-gauge-field production during inflation affects scalar perturbations in the case when the gauge field interacts with the inflaton directly (by means of generic kinetic and axial couplings) and via gravity. The homogeneous background solution is defined by self-consistently taking into account the backreaction of the gauge field on the evolution of the inflaton and the scale factor. For the perturbations on top of this background, all possible scalar contributions coming from the inflaton, the metric, and the gauge field are considered. We derive a second-order differential equation for the curvature perturbation, $\zeta$, capturing the impact of the gauge field, both on the background dynamics and on the evolution of scalar perturbations. The latter is described by a source term in the $\zeta$-equation, which is quadratic in the gauge-field operators and leads to non-Gaussianities in the curvature perturbations. We derive general expressions for the induced scalar power spectrum and bispectrum. Finally, we apply our formalism to the well-known case of axion inflation without backreaction. Numerical results show that, in this example, the effect of including metric perturbations is small for values of the gauge-field production parameter $\xi&gt; 3$. This is in agreement with the previous results in the literature. However, in the region of smaller values, $\xi\lesssim 2$, our new results exhibit order-of-unity deviations when compared to previous results.</description>

      <title>Binary Supermassive Black Holes Orbiting Dark Matter Solitons: From the Dual AGN in UGC4211 to NanoHertz Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore orbital implications of the Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) binary in UGC4211 for the energy spectrum of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), measured with pulsar timing. The SMBH binary in UGC4211 has a projected separation of $\sim 230\,$pc and relative velocity of $\sim 150\,$km/s along the line of sight. It orbits with a disk of gas and stars, with a total mass $\sim 1.7 \times 10^9 M_\odot$ that is several times larger than the combined SMBHs plus the observed gas and stars. The unseen mass can be naturally explained by a soliton of wave dark matter present within the SMBH orbit. Such a scenario is encouraging as during galaxy merger, the two precursor galactic solitons are expected to combine to generate a new soliton and hence bind the two initial SMBHs efficiently. Generalizing this scenario to the cosmological population of SMBH binaries, we show the SGWB spectrum produced by late-stage inspiraling is modified preferentially at low frequency by the presence of soliton. Finally, we demonstrate that the NANOGrav and EPTA data can be well-fit in this scenario, favoring $\{m_a, f_a\} \sim \{10^{-21.7} {\rm eV}, 10^{15.5} {\rm GeV}\}$ and $\{10^{-20.5} {\rm eV}, 10^{16.8} {\rm GeV}\}$ respectively when the UGC4211 data and the constraints from dwarf galaxies are also combined.</description>

      <title>On the minimal mass of thermal dark matter and the viability of millicharged particles affecting 21cm cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal freeze-out offers an attractive explanation of the dark matter density free from fine-tuning of initial conditions. For dark matter with a mass below tens of MeV, photons, electrons, and neutrinos are the only available direct Standard Model annihilation products. Using a full three-sector abundance calculation, we determine the minimal mass of dark matter, allowing for an arbitrary branching into electrons/photons and neutrinos that is compatible with current cosmological observations. The analysis takes into account the heat transfer between the various sectors from annihilation and elastic scattering, representing the first fully self-consistent analysis that tracks the respective sectors' temperatures. We thereby provide accurate thermal annihilation cross sections, particularly for velocity-dependent cases, and deduce the sensitivity of current and upcoming CMB experiments to MeV thermal dark matter. In the latter context, we also establish the fine-tuned parameter region where a tiny admixture of neutrinos in the final states rules in MeV-scale $p$-wave annihilating DM into electrons. Finally, we show that a sub-% millicharged dark matter with an interaction strength that interferes with 21 cm cosmology is still allowed when freeze-out is supplemented with annihilation into neutrinos. For all cases considered, we provide concrete particle physics models and supplement our findings with a discussion of other relevant experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit gravitational wave (GW) memory as the key to measuring spacetime symmetries, extending beyond its traditional role in GW searches. In particular, we show how these symmetries may be probed via displacement and spin memory observations, respectively. We further find that the Einstein Telescope's (ET) sensitivity enables constraining the strain amplitude of a displacement memory to 2% and that of spin memory to 22%. Finally, we point out that neglecting memory could lead to an overestimation of measurement uncertainties for parameters of binary black hole (BBH) mergers by about 10% in ET.</description>

      <title>Simulating Electromagnetic Cascades with Lorentz Invariance Violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) is a phenomenon featuring in various quantum gravity models whereby Lorentz symmetry is broken at high energies, potentially impacting the behaviour of particles and their interactions. Here we investigate the phenomenology of LIV within the context of gamma-ray-induced electromagnetic cascades. We conduct detailed numerical simulations to explore the expected manifestations of LIV on gamma-ray fluxes, taking into account relevant effects such as pair production and inverse Compton scattering. Additionally, we consider processes forbidden in the Standard Model, namely vacuum Cherenkov emission and photon decay. Our analysis reveals that these modifications result in distinct characteristics within the measured particle fluxes at Earth, which have the potential to be observed in high-energy gamma-ray observations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Primordial Black Hole Capture by Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A sub-solar mass primordial black hole (PBH) passing through a neutron star, can lose enough energy through interactions with the dense stellar medium to become gravitationally bound to the star. Once captured, the PBH would sink to the core of the neutron star, and completely consume it from the inside. In this paper, we improve previous energy-loss calculations by considering a realistic solution for the neutron star interior, and refine the treatment of the interaction dynamics and collapse likelihood. We then consider the effect of a sub-solar PBH population on neutron stars near the Galactic center. We find that it is not possible to explain the lack of observed pulsars near the galactic center through dynamical capture of PBHs, as the velocity dispersion is too high. We then show that future observations of old neutron stars close to Sgr A* could set stringent constraints on the PBHs abundance. These cannot however be extended in the currently unconstrained asteroid-mass range, since PBHs of smaller mass would lose less energy in their interaction with the neutron star and end up in orbits that are too loosely bound and likely to be disrupted by other stars in the Galactic center.</description>

      <title>Feedback mechanisms stopping the star formation in a pair of massive galaxies in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feedback is the key physical mechanism regulating galaxy formation. Stars in galaxies form when baryons radiatively cool down and fall into gravitational wells. Eventually, star formation quenches as gas is depleted and/or perturbed by feedback processes, no longer being able to collapse and condense. For massive galaxies, astronomers identify feedback from accreting supermassive black holes (active galactic nuclei, AGN) as the main agent responsible for quenching. We report the first spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of a massive, completely quiescent galaxy at $z=3.714$ (Jekyll) and its neighborhood. Jekyll is part of a galaxy pair with a compact, dusty, massive star-forming companion (Hyde). We find large amounts of ionized and neutral gas in the intergalactic medium around the pair, yet Jekyll has remained quiescent for more than 500~Myr. The emitting gas is consistent with AGN photoionization, but no AGN is observed in Jekyll. We find that, in contrast to standard scenarios, AGN in satellite galaxies can be critical contributors for keeping massive galaxies quiescent in the early Universe. After the accelerated formation and quenching of the massive central galaxy, tidally induced gas stripping additionally contributes to the star-formation regulation on subsequent satellite galaxy generations.</description>
