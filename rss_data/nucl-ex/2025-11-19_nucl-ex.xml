      <title>Search for Double Beta Decays of $^{134}$Xe with EXO-200 Phase II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EXO-200 was a leading double beta decay experiment consisting of a single-phase, enriched liquid xenon time projection chamber filled with an admixture of 80.672% $^{136}$Xe and 19.098% $^{134}$Xe. The detector operated at WIPP between 2010 and 2018 and was designed to search for double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe. Data was acquired in two phases separated by a period of detector upgrades. We report on the search for $0\nu\beta\beta$ and $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{134}$Xe with Phase II EXO-200 data, with median 90% C.L. exclusion sensitivity $T_{1/2}^{0\nu} \geq 3.7\times 10^{23}$ yr and $T_{1/2}^{2\nu} \geq 2.6 \times 10^{21}$ yr, respectively. No statistically significant signal is observed for either decay mode. We set a world-leading lower limit on the half-life of the neutrinoless decay mode of $^{134}$Xe of $T_{1/2}^{0\nu} \geq 8.7\times10^{23}$ (90% C.L.) and the second strongest constraint on the two-neutrino decay of $T_{1/2}^{2\nu} \geq 2.9\times10^{21}$ (90% C.L.), a 3-fold improvement over the EXO-200 Phase I measurement. New constraints are also set for the $2\nu\beta\beta$ and $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays of $^{134}$Xe to the lowest excited state of $^{134}$Ba.</description>

      <title>Light-Front Transverse Nucleon Charge and Magnetisation Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors obtained using both the three-body and quark + fully-interacting-diquark pictures of nucleon structure are employed to calculate an array of light-front transverse densities for the proton and neutron and their dressed valence-quark constituents, viz. flavour separations of the proton and neutron results. These two complementary descriptions of nucleon structure deliver mutually compatible predictions, which match expectations based on modern parametrisations of available data, where such are available. Amongst other things, it is found that transverse-plane valence $u$- and $d$-quark Dirac radii are practically indistinguishable; but regarding kindred Pauli radii, the $d$ quark value is roughly 10% greater than that of the $u$-quark. Moreover, magnetically, the valence $d$ quark is far more active than the valence $u$ quark, probably because it has much greater orbital angular momentum. Both pictures of nucleon structure agree in predicting that, in a polarised nucleon, the transverse-plane charge densities are no longer rotationally invariant. Instead, for a $+\hat x$ polarised nucleon, positive charge is displaced in the $-\hat y$ direction, with the opposite effect for negative charge.</description>

      <title>Cluster phenomena using few-body and Lattice QCD theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of first-principles calculations for baryon-baryon interactions, it becomes possible to obtain reliable hyperon-nucleon potentials by lattice QCD simulations with the HAL QCD method. High-precision few-body methods, such as the Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM), are applicable to solve quantum few-body systems up to four- and five-body systems. By combining the HAL QCD potentials with the GEM, one can predict the level structure of novel hypernuclei prior to experimental observation. In this review, we utilize the lattice QCD $N\Xi$ potential obtained by the HAL QCD method to investigate the few-body systems $NN\Xi$ and $NNN\Xi$. Our analysis indicates that the lightest bound $\Xi$ hypernucleus is the $NNN\Xi$ system. To extract detailed information on the isospin and spin components of the $N\Xi$ interaction, we perform a four-body calculation for the $\alpha\alpha N\Xi$ system with the total isospin $T = 0$ and $T = 1$. We demonstrate that the level structure of this system is sensitive to the isospin and spin dependencies of the $N\Xi$ interaction. Furthermore, we propose experimental investigations to produce the $NNN\Xi$ and $\alpha\alpha N\Xi$ systems via the $(K^-, K^+)$ and $(K^-, K^0)$ reactions on $^4$He and $^{10}$B targets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Direct Neutron Detectors based on Carborane Containing Conjugated Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal neutron detectors are crucial to a wide range of applications, including nuclear safety and security, cancer treatment, space research, non-destructive testing, and more. However, neutrons are notoriously difficult to capture due to their absence of charge, and only a handful of isotopes have a sufficient neutron cross-section. Meanwhile, commercially available $^3$He gas filled proportional counters suffer from depleting $^3$He feedstocks and complex device structures. In this work, we explore the potential of a carborane containing conjugated polymer ($o$CbT$_2$-NDI) as a thermal neutron detector. The natural abundance of $^{10}$B in such a polymer enables intrinsic thermal neutron capture of the material, making it the first demonstration of an organic semiconductor with such capabilities. In addition, we show that thermal neutron detection can be achieved also by adding a $^{10}$B$_4$C sensitiser additive to the analogous carborane-free polymer PNDI(2OD)2T, whereas unsensitised PNDI(2OD)2T control devices only respond to the fast neutron component of the radiation field. This approach allows us to disentangle the fast and thermal neutron responses of the devices tested and compare the relative performance of the two approaches to thermal neutron detection. Both the carborane containing and the $^{10}$B$_4$C sensitised devices displayed enhancement due to thermal neutrons, above that of the unsensitised polymer. The detector response is found to be linear with flux up to $1.796\,\times\,10^7\,$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ n$_{th}\bar{v}$ and saturates at high drive biases. This study demonstrates the viability of carboranyl polymers as neutron detectors, highlights the inherent chemical tuneability of organic semiconductors, and opens the possibility of their application to a number of different low-cost, scalable, and easily processable detector technologies.</description>

      <title>Deviations from the Isobaric Multiplet Mass Equation due to threshold states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have completed the A=16 isospin quintets for states with spin/parity J{\pi} =0+ and 2+. The dependence of their masses as a function of isospin projection shows evidence for deviations from quadratic behavior indicating isospin violation beyond the expectation from two- body forces. The deviation is most pronounced for the 2+ states. Predictions from the Shell Model Embedded in the Continuum (SMEC) allow us to explain that this isospin violation is associated with a modification of the nuclear structure due to the open-quantum-system nature of the proton- rich members of the quintet. In particular, the 0+ and 2+ states in 16Ne and the 2+ state in 16F are threshold resonances located just above a proton-decay threshold where s-wave coupling to the continuum is expected. The measured deviations of these threshold states from the quadratic behavior of the remaining members of the multiplets makes it possible to obtain information on the magnitude and the energy dependence of the continuum-coupling energy correction. Continuum coupling is also indicated for the ground state of 8C, but this time through p-wave coupling.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of triaxiality in the charge radii of neutron-rich Ruthenium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first measurements with a new collinear laser spectroscopy setup at the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System utilizing its unique capability to deliver neutron-rich refractory metal isotopes produced by the spontaneous fission of 252Cf. We measured isotope shifts from optical spectra for nine radioactive ruthenium isotopes 106-114Ru, reaching deep into the mid-shell region. The extracted charge radii are in excellent agreement with predictions from the Brussels-Skyrme-on-a-Grid models that account for the triaxial deformation of nuclear ground states in this region. We show that triaxial deformation impacts charge radii in models that feature shell effects, in contrast to what could be concluded from a liquid drop analysis. This indicates that this exotic type of deformation should not be neglected in regions where it is known to occur, even if its presence cannot be unambiguously inferred through laser spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Experimental review on the chiral magnetic effect in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) refers to a predicted phenomena in quantum chromodynamics that manifests as a charge separation along an external magnetic field, driven by an imbalance of quark chirality. Searches for the CME has been carried out by azimuthal particle correlations in relativistic heavy ion collisions where such a chirality imbalance is anticipated and a strong magnetic field is created in the initial stage. No conclusive experimental evidence on the CME has been established so far because of large background contributions to azimuthal correlation observables. We review the status of the experimental search for the CME, covering the observables used, the techniques to mitigate backgrounds, and the strengths and limitations of various experimental approaches, and outline a future prospect of the CME search in high-energy nuclear collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) are calculated in the interacting boson model (IBM), which is based on the nuclear energy density functional (EDF) theory. The Hamiltonian of the IBM that gives rise to the energies and wave functions of the ground and excited states of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay emitting isotopes and corresponding final nuclei is determined by mapping the self-consistent mean-field deformation-energy surface obtained with a given EDF onto the corresponding bosonic energy surface. The transition operators are formulated using the generalized seniority scheme, and the pair structure constants are determined by the inputs provided by the self-consistent calculations. The predicted values of the $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay NMEs with the nonrelativistic and relativistic EDFs are compared with those resulting from different many-body methods. Sensitivities of the predicted NMEs to the model parameters and assumptions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Understanding baryon stopping at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider top energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nucleon exhibits a rich internal structure governed by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), where its electric charge arises from valence quarks, while its spin and mass emerge from complex interactions among valence quarks, sea (anti-)quarks, and gluons. At the advent of QCD, an alternative hypothesis emerged suggesting, at high energies, the transport of a nucleon's baryon number could be traced by a non-perturbative configuration of gluon fields connecting its three valence quarks, forming a $Y$-shaped topology known as the gluon junction. Recent measurements by the STAR experiment are compatible with this scenario. In light of these measurements, this study aims to explore the mechanisms of baryon transport in high-energy nuclear collisions using the PYTHIA-8 framework, which incorporates a state-of-the-art hadronization model with advanced Color Flow (CF) and Color Reconnection (CR) mechanisms that mimic signatures of a baryon junction. Within this model setup, we investigate (i) the rapidity slope of the net-baryon distributions in photon-included processes ($\gamma$+p) and (ii) baryon over charge transport in the isobaric (Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr) collisions. Our study highlights the importance of the CF and CR mechanisms in PYTHIA-8, which play a crucial role in baryon transport. The results show that the CF and CR schemes significantly affect the isobaric baryon-to-charge ratio, leading to different predictions for baryon stopping and underscoring the need to account for CF and CR effects in comparisons with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Discrimination of neutron-$\gamma$ in the low energy regime using machine learning for an EJ-276D plastic scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present results for discrimination of neutron and $\gamma$ events using a plastic scintillator detector with pulse shape discrimination capabilities. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are used to improve the discriminatory power between neutron and $\gamma$ events at lower energy ranges which otherwise are not addressed by the conventional pulse shape discrimination techniques. The use of a multilayer perceptron with Bayesian inference (MLPBNN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are studied using the recorded waveforms from the detector. Input variables are constructed for the ML algorithms, which captures the essence of the differences in the head and tail part of the neutron and $\gamma$ waveforms. A new variable, which utilizes the product of kurtosis and variance calculated from the waveform gives better ranking in terms of separation of neutron and $\gamma$ events. The training and the testing of the ML algorithms are done using an AmBe neutron source. In the lower energy region, the results obtained from the ML predictions are compared with the results obtained from a time of flight (ToF) technique to benchmark the overall performance of the ML algorithms. A reasonable agreement is observed between the results obtained from ML algorithm and the ToF experiment in the studied energy range. The MLPBNN gives better discriminatory power for the neutron and $\gamma$ events than the SVM algorithm.</description>
