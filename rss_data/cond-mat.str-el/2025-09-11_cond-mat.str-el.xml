      <title>Critical Majorana fermion at a topological quantum Hall bilayer transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Hall bilayers are a uniquely tunable platform that can realize continuous transitions between distinct topological phases of matter. One prominent example is the transition between the Halperin state and the Moore--Read Pfaffian, long predicted to host a critical theory of Majorana fermions but so far not verified in unbiased microscopic simulations. Using the fuzzy sphere regularization, we identify the low-energy spectrum at this transition with the 3D gauged Majorana conformal field theory. We show that the transition is driven by the closing of the neutral fermion gap, and we directly extract the operator content in both integer and half-integer spin sectors. Our results resolve the long-standing question of the nature of a topological phase transition in a setting relevant to quantum Hall experiments, while also providing the first realization of a fermionic theory on the fuzzy sphere, previously limited to bosonic theories.</description>

      <title>Hidden frustration in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet NdCd3P3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a study of the magnetic ground state and crystal electric field (CEF) scheme in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet NdCd$_3$P$_3$. Combined neutron scattering, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements demonstrate that the Nd$^{3+}$ moments occupying the triangular lattice in this material harbor hidden signs of frustration not detected in typical Curie-Weiss-based parameterization of the frustration index ($f=\Theta_{CW} / T_N$). This is evidenced by a zero-field splitting of the Kramers' ground state and first excited state doublets at temperatures far in excess of $T_N$ as well as signatures of low-energy fluctuations for $T&gt;&gt;T_N$. A suppression of the zero-field ordered moment relative to its field saturation value is observed, and the impacts of this magnetic frustration as well as the coexisting bond frustration in the CdP honeycomb network on the physical properties of NdCd$_3$P$_3$ are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase with spontaneous translational symmetry breaking in an extended diamond chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the experimental realization of a spin-1/2 extended diamond chain in a verdazyl-Cu complex, where competing interactions and lattice distortions give rise to exotic quantum phases. The magnetic properties exhibit a zero-field energy gap and 1/2 magnetization plateau, which is explained by a dimer-monomer model. Considering the effective interactions between the monomers, three types of dimer-dimer phases are expected to appear as the ground state, depending on the magnitude of the lattice distortions. By mapping to the nonlinear sigma model, three phases are distinguished topologically, and a symmetry-protected topological phase equivalent to the Haldane phase is identified. Furthermore, a nontrivial magnetization is observed above the 1/2 plateau region, suggesting a gapped dimer phase accompanied by a spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry. The discovery of this rare quantum state has broad implications for strongly correlated systems, topological matter, and quantum information science, where symmetry and topology play crucial roles.</description>

      <title>Terahertz nonlinear response in cuprate superconductors and the Higgs field in doped Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A puzzling phenomenon has been recently revealed in terahertz nonlinear optical response experiments: A third harmonic generation (THG) signal, identified only in the superconducting (SC) phase in a conventional BCS superconductor, is found to persist into a wide pseudogap regime in the underdoped cuprate, accompanied by a $\pi$ phase shift in the THG signal across the SC transition. In this paper, we offer a consistent understanding of such an unconventional phenomenon based on an emergent Higgs mode of the condensed holons in the doped Mott insulator. Specifically, in the lower pseudogap phase (LPP) where, although the holons still remain Bose condensed, the SC phase coherence gets disordered by excited spinons, which induce vortex-like responses from the holon condensate. By coupling to such internal fluctuations described by a mutual Chern-Simons gauge theory, we show that an external electromagnetic field can indeed produce the optical THG response in both the SC and LPP states, which are distinguished by a $\pi$ phase shift with a substantial suppression of the THG signal in the latter regime at higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Approximation in Lattice Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an approximation to the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the collective Coulomb field of the large $N$ homogeneous electron fluid. The large $N$ approximation transforms the infinite SD hierarchy is into a set of closed, equations for 1 and 2-pt correlators. In this paper, the dynamics of a toy model - a small square Euclidean lattice with periodic boundary conditions - are considered. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method evaluated the 1 and 2-pt correlation functions on a $2 \times 2$ and $3 \times 3$ lattice. The derived equations are checked with the correlator values, and an agreement at $N \sim 10^3$ to order $10^{-3}$ was found. The agreement can be further strengthened by increasing runs in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature transport in the gapped spin-1/2 XXZ chain and one-dimensional lattice spinless fermion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we consider a class of energy eigenstates of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain that exist both for anisotropies 1 and larger than 1. We show that at the isotropic point their contributions are behind the diffusion constant being infinite, spin transport being anomalous superdiffusive for temperatures T&gt;0. That for anisotropy larger than 1 such states do not contribute to the diffusion constant is shown to imply it is finite, spin transport being normal diffusive for T&gt;0. By combining the connection through a Jordan-Wigner transformation of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain to the one-dimensional (1D) lattice spinless fermion model at zero chemical potential for V/J larger or equal to 1 with its Bethe-ansatz solution, where V is the nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion and J is twice the hopping integrai, in this paper we also address the issue of the T&gt;0 charge transport of that model at zero chemical potential. It is found to be anomalous superdiffusive for V/J=1 and normal diffusive for V/J&gt;1.</description>

      <title>Kitaev-derived Gapless Spin Liquid in the $K$-$J$-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ Quantum Magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of quantum spin liquids (QSLs) in Kitaev magnets represents an intriguing topic in frustrated quantum magnetism. Despite prediction in the pure Kitaev honeycomb model, realization of QSLs in realistic systems and materials remain scarce. The recent discovery of cobalt-based compound Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ has raised significant research interest. By establishing a realistic $K$-$J$-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model for Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ -- with a dominant antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev interaction ($K&gt;0$) that quantitatively explains its thermodynamics measurements -- we reveal an intermediate gapless QSL phase under [111] magnetic fields with tensor-network calculations. We confirm the QSL nature of this phase by demonstrating its adiabatic connection to the intensively studied intermediate QSL of the pure AFM Kitaev model under out-of-plane fields. Our results show excellent agreement with recent high-field experiments, thereby explaining the intermediate-field phase in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. These findings bridge the gap between theoretical proposals for a Kitaev-derived QSL and experimental realization, opening new avenues for exploring exotic quantum states of matter in realistic Kitaev materials.</description>

      <title>Machine learning applications in cold atom quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As ultracold atom experiments become highly controlled and scalable quantum simulators, they require sophisticated control over high-dimensional parameter spaces and generate increasingly complex measurement data that need to be analyzed and interpreted efficiently. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been established as versatile tools for addressing these challenges, offering strategies for data interpretation, experimental control, and theoretical modeling. In this review, we provide a perspective on how machine learning is being applied across various aspects of quantum simulation, with a focus on cold atomic systems. Emphasis is placed on practical use cases -- from classifying many-body phases to optimizing experimental protocols and representing quantum states -- highlighting the specific contexts in which different ML approaches prove effective. Rather than presenting algorithmic details, we focus on the physical insights enabled by ML and the kinds of problems in quantum simulation where these methods offer tangible benefits.</description>

      <title>Free Majorana Fermion Meets Gauged Ising Conformal Field Theory on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fuzzy sphere regularisation is a powerful tool to study conformal field theories (CFT) in three spacetime dimensions. In this paper, we extend its scope to CFTs with local fermionic operators. We realise the free Majorana fermion CFT on a setup with one flavour of bosons and one flavour of fermions on the lowest Landau level with a $1/2$ angular momentum mismatch. We allow conversion between two bosons and two fermions, and use a relative chemical potential as the tuning parameter. On the phase diagram, we find three gapped phases, viz. a fermionic integer quantum Hall phase, an $f$-wave chiral topological superconductor, and a bosonic Pfaffian phase. They are separated by two continuous transitions described respectively by a free Majorana fermion and a gauged Ising CFT. We numerically confirm their emergent conformal symmetry through the operator spectrum. We also study the two-point correlation function of the Majorana fermion, and the topological Wilson line defect of the gauged Ising CFT. Our work represents a step towards studying interacting fermionic CFTs and regularising quantum field theories on the fuzzy sphere.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity of topological phases. Or lack thereof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phases are expected to carry enhanced computational power, stemming from the long-range entanglement that characterizes them. Here we investigate whether this advantage is reflected in quantum magic, quantified through stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs). We analyze one-dimensional models with an exact duality between a symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial one. Surprisingly, a finite (parameters dependent) asymmetry appears only when boundary conditions break the duality, and emerges as well in the transverse-field Ising chain, which lacks topological order. These results show that magic is unable to detect topological phases, indicating that either an additional resource is required to capture their unique quantum contribution, or that not all forms of long-range entanglement constitute a genuine computational resource.</description>

      <title>Disordered Charged Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct fully backreacted charged black brane solutions with a spatially disordered chemical potential in asymptotically AdS$_3$ and AdS$_4$, providing holographic duals of strongly coupled disordered systems. At intermediate temperatures these geometries display highly inhomogeneous horizons, though their geometric averages reproduce the clean BTZ and Reissner-Nordstr\"om solutions. The low temperature behavior, however, differs sharply between dimensions. In AdS$_3$, inhomogeneities decay and the horizon flows to the clean charged BTZ fixed point, rendering disorder irrelevant in the infrared. In AdS$_4$, horizon inhomogeneities persist: while the averaged geometry flows to the clean AdS$_2\times \mathbb{R}^2$ throat, the disordered horizon induces a finite residual resistivity. These results show that disorder can qualitatively alter the IR physics of holographic metals and indicate violations of the Harris criterion in strongly coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Weakly superconducting anisotropy in 4Hb-Nb0.95Ti0.05Se2 with 1T/1H heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures of layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) exhibit rich physical properties by the combination of strong electronic correlation effects in 1T layer and superconductivity in 1H layer. But the limited number of bulk TMD materials with such heterostructures impedes the in-depth understanding of the physical mechanisms behind these properties, as well as research on tuning of these properties. Here, we report a systematic study on physical properties of the 4Hb-Nb0.95Ti0.05Se2 single crystals with 1T/1H heterostructure. It exhibits a superconducting transition at temperature below 3.3 K. Further analysis indicates that 4Hb-Nb0.95Ti0.05Se2 is an intermediately coupled type-II superconductor. Moreover, 4Hb-Nb0.95Ti0.05Se2 shows a rather weak superconducting anisotropy (~ 2), distinctly different from other known TMD superconductors with 4Hb heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Absence of two-orbital superconductivity in cuprate family: A DFT+DMFT perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has spurred intense interest in exploring analogous mechanisms in other transition metal oxides. This raises a pivotal question: can cuprates, as neighbors to nickelates in the periodic table, host similar two-orbital superconductivity? Here, we systematically investigate the electronic structure of a series of designed Ruddlesden-Popper cuprates. Our calculations reveal that the parent compound La$_3$Cu$_2$O$_7$ is a weakly correlated metal, and hole-doping fails to induce strong correlation. We find that the actual valence of the copper cations becomes strikingly pinned around +2.3, far away from the targeted $d^8$ configuration. This valence pinning is attributed to the inherent charge-transfer nature of cuprates. We propose this mechanism as a general principle explaining the robust single-orbital physics consistently observed in the cuprate family, holding true even in materials like the high-$T_c$ superconductor Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\delta}$ that appear structurally primed for two-orbital activity. Our results therefore conclude that the route towards two-orbital superconductivity is fundamentally obstructed in cuprates, providing a crucial constraint for the future design of high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1907.00761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the role of electronic correlations in different kinds of band insulators by using the two-orbital Hubbard model within the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). An intriguing finding is that electronic correlations turn a metal into a band insulator when ionicity and covalency are equal in ratio.We conclude that the electronic correlations favour metallicity when the covalency is smaller than the ionicity, while they favour insulating behaviour when the covalency is greater than ionicity.</description>

Abstract: We consider the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid fixed point in a two-dimensional metal, at the onset of a quantum phase transition from a Fermi liquid state to an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) ordered phase. The momentum of the CDW boson is centred at the wavevector $ \boldsymbol{ \mathcal Q} $, which connects a single pair of antipodal points on the Fermi surface with antiparallel tangent vectors. We employ the dimensional regularization technique in which the co-dimension of the Fermi surface is extended to a generic value, while keeping the dimension of the Fermi surface itself fixed at one. Although the system is strongly coupled at dimension $d=2$, the interactions become marginal at the upper critical dimension $d=d_c$, whose value is found to be $ 5/2$. Using a controlled perturbative expansion in the parameter $\epsilon = d_c - d $, we compute the critical exponents of the stable infrared fixed point characterizing the quantum critical point. The scalings of the original theory are determined by setting $\epsilon =1/2$, where the fermion self-energy is seen to scale with the frequency with a fractional power law of $2/3$, which is the telltale signature of a typical non-Fermi liquid phase.</description>

      <title>Possible Sliding Regimes in Twisted Bilayer WTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the observation of increasingly one-dimensional (1D) behavior with decreasing temperature in small-angle twisted bilayers of WTe$_2$ (tWTe$_2$), we theoretically explore the exotic sliding regimes that could be realized in tWTe$_2$. At zero displacement field, while hole-doped tWTe$_2$ can be thought of as an array of weakly coupled conventional two-flavor 1D electron gases (1DEGs), the electron-doped regime is equivalent to coupled four-flavor 1DEGs , due to the presence of an additional "valley'' degree of freedom. In the decoupled limit, the electron-doped system can thus realize phases with a range of interesting ordering tendencies, including $4k_F$ charge-density-wave and charge-$4e$ superconductivity. Dimensional crossovers and cross-wire transport due to inter-wire couplings of various kinds are also discussed. We find that a sliding Luther-Emery liquid with small inter-wire couplings is probably most consistent with current experiments on hole-doped tWTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Strange metal at the Lifshitz transition</title>

Abstract: Strange metals are ubiquitously observed in a variety of strongly correlated materials, among which high temperature cuprates\cite{Greene2020} and twisted bilayer graphenes\cite{Cao2020} are the most prominent examples. The prevailing consensus is that the strange metal emerges within a finite temperature fan, mediated by a quantum critical point(QCP) where the pseudogap phase terminates\cite{keimer2015quantum,Michon2019}. A growing number of experiments\cite{Benhabib2015,DoironLeyraud2017,Horio2018} suggests that, in most cuprates, the QCP nearly coincides with a Lifshitz transition point. However, the nature of the QCP\cite{Zhu2022} and the significance of van Hove singularity(VHS) in driving quantum critical phenomena remain largely unexplored\cite{Horio2018,Shen2022}. Here we investigate quantum critical transport at Lifshitz transition in two dimensions(2D), where the Fermi surface geometry undergoes a convex-to-concave transition. The VHS saddle points is coupled to critical bosons via spatially uniform Yukawa interactions. At zero temperature, the interplay between extra scattering channel at Lifshitz transition and the impurity scattering gives rise to a linear-in-$\omega$ optical conductivity. At finite temperatures, we demonstrate a persistant linear-in-$T$ \emph{dc} resistivity in the quantum-critical temperature range down to $T\rightarrow 0$, which gives in to the saturation in non-universal higher temperature regime. For the spatially random Yukawa interaction, we show that the linear-in-$T$ resistivity unexpectedly extends even into the non-universal high-$T$ regime.</description>

      <title>C-R-T Fractionalization in the First Quantized Hamiltonian Theory</title>

Abstract: Recent research has revealed that the CRT symmetry for fermions exhibits a fractionalization distinct from the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{C}}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{R}}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{T}}$ for scalar bosons. In fact, the CRT symmetry for fermions can be extended by internal symmetries such as fermion parity, thereby forming a group extension of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ direct product. Conventionally, a Majorana fermion is defined by one Dirac fermion with trivial charge conjugation. However, when the spacetime dimension $d+1=5,6,7\bmod8$, the real dimension of Majorana fermion (dim$_{\mathbb{R}}\chi_{\mathcal{C}\ell(d,0)}$) aligns with the real dimension of Dirac fermion (dim$_{\mathbb{R}}\psi_{\mathcal{C}\ell(d)}$), rather than being half, which necessitates the introduction of a symplectic Majorana fermion, defined by two Dirac fermions with trivial charge conjugation. To include these two types of Majorana fermions, we embed the theory in $n_{\mathbb{R}}$ and define the Majorana fermion field as a representation of the real Clifford algebra with 8-fold periodicity. Within the Hamiltonian formalism, we identify the 8-fold CRT-internal symmetry groups across general dimensions. Similarly, Dirac fermion field is defined as a representation of the complex Clifford algebra with 2-fold periodicity. Interestingly, we discover that the CRT-internal symmetry groups exhibit an 8-fold periodicity that is distinct from that of the complex Clifford algebra. In certain dimensions where distinct mass terms can span a mass manifold, the CRT-internal symmetries can act non-trivially upon this mass manifold. Employing domain wall reduction method, we are able to elucidate the relationships between symmetries across different dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Lattice C-R-T Symmetry: Fractionalization, Anomaly, and Symmetric Mass Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charge conjugation (C), mirror reflection (R), and time reversal (T) symmetries, along with internal symmetries, are essential for massless Majorana and Dirac fermions. These symmetries are sufficient to rule out potential fermion bilinear mass terms, thereby establishing a gapless free fermion fixed point phase, pivotal for symmetric mass generation (SMG) transition. In this work, we systematically study the anomaly of C-R-T-internal symmetry in all spacetime dimensions by analyzing the projective representation (i.e. the fractionalization) of the C-R-T-internal symmetry group in the quantum many-body Hilbert space on the lattice. By discovering the fermion-flavor-number-dependent C-R-T-internal symmetry's anomaly structure, we demonstrate an alternative way to derive the minimal flavor number for SMG, which shows consistency with known results from K\"ahler-Dirac fermion or cobordism classification. Our findings reveal that, in general spatial dimensions, either 8 copies of staggered Majorana fermions or 4 copies of staggered Dirac fermions admit SMG. By directly searching for 4-fermion interactions that form commuting stabilizers respecting all symmetry constraints, we can prove the explicit SMG gapping retained a unique ground state in the codespace. Furthermore, we establish the correspondence between the symmetry operators of staggered fermions and free fermions, which is instrumental in facilitating the analysis of symmetry fractionalization at the field theory level.</description>

      <title>Symmetric tensor scars with tunable entanglement from volume to area law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Teleportation of quantum information over long distances requires robust entanglement on the macroscopic scale. The construction of highly energetic eigenstates with tunable long-range entanglement can provide a new medium for information transmission. Using a symmetric superposition of the antipodal triplet states, we construct polynomially many exact zero-energy eigenstates for a class of non-integrable spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with two-body interactions. These states exhibit non-thermal correlations, hence, are genuine quantum many-body scars. By tuning the distribution of triplets we induce extensive, logarithmic, or area-law entanglement, and can observe a second-order entanglement phase transition. Quasiparticle excitations in this manifold converge to be exact quantum many-body scars in the thermodynamic limit. This framework has a natural extension to higher dimensions, where entangled states controlled by lattice geometry and internal symmetries can result in new classes of correlated out-of-equilibrium quantum matter. Our results provide a new avenue for entanglement control and quantum state constructions.</description>

Abstract: We propose twisted homobilayer of a carbon allotrope, C$_{568}$, to be a promising platform to realize controllable square lattice single-band extended Hubbard model. This setup has the advantage of a widely tunable $t'/t$ ratio without adding external fields, and the intermediate temperature $t\ll T\ll U$ regime can be easily achieved. We first analyze the continuum model obtained from symmetry analysis and first-principle calculations, and calculate the band structures. Subsequently, we derive the corresponding tight-binding models and fit the hopping parameters as well as the Coulomb interactions. When displacement field is applied, anisotropic nearest neighbor hoppings can further be achieved. If successfully fabricated, the device could be an important stepping stone towards understanding high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that magnons in two-dimensional altermagnets can spontaneously decay at zero temperature. The decay rate is determined by quantum fluctuations and scattering processes involving the decay of a single magnon into three. These processes are kinematically allowed due to the convexity of the altermagnetic magnon dispersion. For small wavevectors $k$ the decay rate is proportional to $k^5$ with a direction-dependent prefactor which is maximal along the diagonals of the Brillouin zone. Moreover, for a given momentum only magnons with one specific chirality can spontaneously decay.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetism and spin excitations in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson flux model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-dimensional Hatano-Nelson model with non-reciprocal hoppings is a prominent example of a relatively simple non-Hermitian quantum-mechanical system, which allows to study various phenomena in open quantum systems without adding extra gain and loss terms. Here we propose to use it as a building block to construct a correlated non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in two dimensions. It has the characteristic form of a flux model with clock-anticlockwise non-reciprocal hopping on each plaquette. Adding the on-site Hubbard type interaction we analyze the formation of the longe-range antiferromagnetic order and its spin excitations. Such a model is non-Hermitian, but $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric, which leads to the existence of two regions: a region of unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry (real-valued spectrum) and a region of broken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry with exceptional lines and complex-valued energy spectrum. The transition from one region to another is controlled by the value of the on-site interaction parameter and coincides with the metal-insulator transition. We also analyze the spin wave spectrum, which is characterized by two diffusive d-wave type of modes corresponding to gain and loss.</description>

      <title>Spin Liquid Mimicry in the Hydroxide Double Perovskite CuSn(OH)$_6$ Induced by Correlated Proton Disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The face-centered-cubic lattice is composed of edge-sharing tetrahedra, making it a leading candidate host for strongly frustrated magnetism, but relatively few face-centered frustrated materials have been investigated. In the hydroxide double perovskite CuSn(OH)$_6$, magnetic frustration of the Cu$^{2+}$ quantum spins is partially relieved by strong Jahn-Teller distortions. Nevertheless, the system shows no signs of long-range magnetic order down to 45 mK and instead exhibits broad thermodynamic anomalies in specific heat and magnetization, indicating short-range dynamical spin correlations-a behavior typical of quantum spin liquids. We propose that such an unusual robustness of the spin-liquid-like state is a combined effect of quantum fluctuations of the quantum spins $S=\frac{1}{2}$, residual frustration on the highly distorted face-centered Cu$^{2+}$ sublattice, and correlated proton disorder. Similar to the disorder-induced spin-liquid mimicry in YbMgGaO$_4$ and herbertsmithite, proton disorder destabilizes the long-range magnetic order by introducing randomness into the magnetic exchange interaction network. However, unlike the quenched substitutional disorder on the magnetic sublattice, which is difficult to control, proton disorder can in principle be tuned through pressure-driven proton ordering transitions. This opens up the prospect of tuning the degree of disorder in a magnetic system to better understand its influence on the magnetic ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In f-electron materials like Pr or U compounds with non-Kramers states of the f-shell the ground state may be a nonmagnetic singlet due to the action of the crystalline electric field. Nevertheless these compounds can order magnetically. They develop a ground state moment and long range order due to the spontaneous admixture of the excited state into the ground state caused by inter-site exchange. This mechanism can establish magnetic order if a control parameter exceeds a critical value defining the quantum critical point between disordered and magnetic phase. Here we investigate the magnetocaloric properties of such quantum magnets where the entropy release at low temperature is due to a competition between thermal depopulation and spontaneous order effects. We determine field and temperature dependence of specific heat for ferro- and antiferromagnetic order and also calculate the adiabatic magneto- and barocaloric cooling rates. As a model application we discuss the magnetic specific heat of the new induced ferromagnet PrIr3. Furthermore we analyze the excitation spectrum of the singlet induced moment magnets in an external field with particular emphasis on field and temperature dependence of the critical soft mode. We find that the latter is fragile and exists only at specific points in the phase diagram.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reintroduce the parafermion-paraboson classification in $R$-paraparticles in terms of their average occupation numbers, analogous to Green's parastatistics. The notion of $p$-order in $R$-parafermions is also redefined as the maximum number of particles that can occupy a quantum state. An example of an order-$2$ $R$-parafermion with $m=2$ internal degrees of freedom is presented, which obeys an exclusion principle that is not Pauli's. The interacting $R$-parafermions are studied in the context of bosonization. Specifically, we show that while density waves are generally bosonic in nature and that flavor-charge separation naturally occurs for any one-dimensional $R$-parafermion system described by the Luttinger model, flavor waves do not always satisfy bose statistics. Comparison of the partition functions further show that only $(p=1)$-ordered $R$-parafermions are compatible with the bosonization procedure in the low-energy limit. Based from these results, we discuss a potential realization of $R$-parafermion signatures in one-dimensional systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of hard-core bosons on ladders, in the presence of strong kinetic constrains akin to those of the Bariev model. We use a combination of analytical methods and numerical simulations to establish the phase diagram of the model. The model displays a paired Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase featuring an emergent dipole symmetry, which encodes the local pairing constraint into a global, nonlocal quantity. We scrutinize the effect of such emergent low-energy symmetry during quench dynamics including single-particle defects. We observe that, despite being approximate, the dipole symmetry still leads to very slow relaxation dynamics, which we model via an effective field theory. The model we discuss is amenable to realization in both cold atoms in optical lattices and Rydberg atom arrays with dynamics taking place solely in the Rydberg manifold. To observe the unusual dynamics of excitations in such experimental platforms, we propose a two-step protocol, which starts with the quasi-adiabatic preparation of low-energy states, followed by the local creation of defects and their study under quench dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The structural and electronic properties of the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$ clinopyroxene systems have been investigated by means of perturbed angular correlation (PAC) measurements, performed at ISOLDE, combined with $ab-initio$ electronic structure calculations within the density functional theory (DFT) framework. The partial density of states (PDOS) of the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$ stable compounds has been determined, and it has been observed that the requirement of including an on-site Hubbard-$U$ potential was necessary in order to describe the highly correlated Mn $3d$-states. By considering $U_{eff}$=4 eV, we obtained a band gap width of 1.82 eV and 1.70 eV, for the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$, respectively. Combining electric field gradient (EFG) first principles calculations, using a supercell scheme, with experimental PAC results, we were able to infer that the Cd probe can replace either the $A$ (Ca, Sr) or the Mn sites in the crystalline structures. We also showed that Cd substitution is expected to lead to a reduction in the width of the band gap in these systems, evidencing opportunities for potential band-gap engineering.</description>

      <title>Holographic Non-Hermitian Lattices and Junctions and their RG Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and study inhomogeneous non-Hermitian strongly coupled holographic field theories. We consider two models: a lattice where in each site there is some inflow/outflow of matter and a Hermitian/non-Hermitian/Hermitian junction. By tuning a complex external gauge field, we find a non-Hermitian model which can be mapped to a Hermitian one via a complexified U(1) gauge transformation. On the other hand, in the absence of the gauge field we find non-Hermitian solutions with a purely imaginary current. Despite this, all expectation values respect PT symmetry and thus we expect the system to feature unitary time evolution. Nonetheless, we have not found a map bringing these solutions to a Hermitian description. We study the RG flows of solutions with imaginary current finding that in the IR they can be mapped to a Hermitian conformal fixed point via a complexified U(1) transformation. Remarkably, we also obtain solutions where the null energy condition is violated near the boundary of the dual geometry.</description>

      <title>Anderson transition symmetries at the band-edge of a correlated Sn/Si monolayer</title>

Abstract: The interplay between Anderson localization and Coulomb repulsion reveals deep connections to superconductivity and many-body localization in quantum systems. In this study, we investigate a tin monolayer on silicon, a material known for its likely antiferromagnetic Mott-correlated ground-state. From the spatial correlations of local density of states (LDOS) maps measured by scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we precisely identify the mobility edge between extended and localized states at the valence band-edge. Using theoretical analysis to explain the energy-dependent LDOS fluctuations, we estimate the system's conductivity change across this effective metal-insulator transition. Then, we compute the multifractal spectra of iso-energy LDOS maps and show that they follow an exact symmetry relation based on the algebraic structure of nonlinear sigma-models (NL$\sigma$Ms) - the field theory of mesoscopic electronic systems. This observation suggests that NL$\sigma$Ms are valid even in a strongly correlated 2D system, down to conductivity levels as low as g ~ 0.1. We anticipate that the relation may be different in the chiral-superconducting phase reported for p-doped Sn/Si monolayer. Finally, we point out that multifractal analysis could equally be applied to universal conductance fluctuations in magneto-transport experiments.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Acoustogalvanic Effect in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals superconductors are attracting much attention owing to their rich phase diagrams including possible unconventional superconductivity. However, they suffer from a lack of reliable methods for identifying their nontrivial pairing symmetries and quantum geometry. In this study, we propose nonlinear responses driven by surface acoustic waves as a novel probe to access exotic Bogoliubov quasiparticles in such superconductors. Our approach is particularly suitable for addressing the superconducting gap structure as the gap energies in these systems typically lie within the frequency range of surface acoustic waves, and thus paves the way toward the experimental identification of exotic superconducting states especially in low-$T_c$ superconductors.</description>

      <title>Memory in strain-tuned insulator-metal-insulator sequence of transitions after photoexcitation in the Mott material V2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Memory effects during metal-insulator transitions in quantum materials reveal complex physics and potential for novel electronics mimicking biological neural systems. Nonetheless, understanding of memory and nonlinearity in sequential non-equilibrium transitions remains elusive as the full chain of transitions can involve features lasting anywhere from femtoseconds to microseconds. Here, we extend time-resolved x-ray Bragg diffraction to the dynamic range of timescales spanning 9 orders of magnitude to fully trace the pathways of photoexcited insulator-metal transition and the following relaxation through non-equilibrium metal-insulator transitions in epitaxial films of V2O3, a promising Mott material. We find 5 orders of magnitude variation in metal-insulator transition time, from nanoseconds to hundreds of microseconds, depending on pre-excitation phase state. We provide a theoretical explanation and simulations based on strain feedback to domain nucleation. The lingering transition is stretched in time by memory of spatial and energy heterogeneity and, contrary to known memory effects in vanadium oxides commonly described by power laws, follows an extremely (factor below 0.2) stretched exponential. The induced dramatic slowdown in the light-driven highly correlated system signifies unusually high heterogeneity of transition barriers similar to biological systems, and demonstrates importance of non-local correlations of structure in evolution of transitional phases in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>High to low temperature: $O(N)$ model at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $O(N)$ vector model for scalars with quartic interaction at large $N$ on $S^1\times S^2$ without the singlet constraint. The non-trivial fixed point of the model is described by a thermal mass satisfying the gap equation at large $N$. We obtain the free energy and the energy density for the model as a series at low temperature in units of the radius of the sphere. We show these results agree with the Borel-Pad\'{e} extrapolations of the high temperature expansions of the free energy and energy density obtained in our previous work. This agreement validates both the expansions and demonstrates that low temperature expansions obtained here correspond to the same fixed point studied earlier at high temperature. We obtain the ratio of the free energy of the theory at the non-trivial fixed point to that of the Gaussian theory at all values of temperature. This ratio begins at $4/5$ when the temperature is infinity, decreases to a minimum value of $0.760937$, then increases and approaches unity as the temperature is decreased.</description>
