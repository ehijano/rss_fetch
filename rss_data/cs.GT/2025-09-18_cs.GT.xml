      <title>How Bad Is Forming Your Own Multidimensional Opinion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the formation of opinions on interconnected topics within social networks is of significant importance. It offers insights into collective behavior and decision-making, with applications in Graph Neural Networks. Existing models propose that individuals form opinions based on a weighted average of their peers' opinions and their own beliefs. This averaging process, viewed as a best-response game, can be seen as an individual minimizing disagreements with peers, defined by a quadratic penalty, leading to an equilibrium. Bindel, Kleinberg, and Oren (FOCS 2011) provided tight bounds on the "price of anarchy" defined as the maximum overall disagreement at equilibrium relative to a social optimum. Bhawalkar, Gollapudi, and Munagala (STOC 2013) generalized the penalty function to non-quadratic penalties and provided tight bounds on the price of anarchy.
  When considering multiple topics, an individual's opinions can be represented as a vector. Parsegov, Proskurnikov, Tempo, and Friedkin (2016) proposed a multidimensional model using the weighted averaging process, but with constant interdependencies between topics. However, the question of the price of anarchy for this model remained open. We address this by providing tight bounds on the multidimensional model, while also generalizing it to more complex interdependencies. Following the work of Bhawalkar, Gollapudi, and Munagala, we provide tight bounds on the price of anarchy under non-quadratic penalties. Surprisingly, these bounds match the scalar model. We further demonstrate that the bounds remain unchanged even when adding another layer of complexity, involving groups of individuals minimizing their overall internal and external disagreement penalty, a common occurrence in real-life scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimal Algorithms for Bandit Learning in Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of pure exploration in matching markets under uncertain preferences, where the goal is to identify a stable matching with confidence parameter $\delta$ and minimal sample complexity. Agents learn preferences via stochastic rewards, with expected values indicating preferences. This finds use in labor market platforms like Upwork, where firms and freelancers must be matched quickly despite noisy observations and no prior knowledge, in a stable manner that prevents dissatisfaction. We consider markets with unique stable matching and establish information-theoretic lower bounds on sample complexity for (1) one-sided learning, where one side of the market knows its true preferences, and (2) two-sided learning, where both sides are uncertain. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm and prove that it asymptotically ($\delta\to 0$) matches the lower bound to a constant for one-sided learning. Using the insights from the lower bound, we extend our algorithm to the two-sided learning setting and provide experimental results showing that it closely matches the lower bound on sample complexity. Finally, using a system of ODEs, we characterize the idealized fluid path that our algorithm chases.</description>

      <title>Friend or Foe: Delegating to an AI Whose Alignment is Unknown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI systems have the potential to improve decision-making, but decision makers face the risk that the AI may be misaligned with their objectives. We study this problem in the context of a treatment decision, where a designer decides which patient attributes to reveal to an AI before receiving a prediction of the patient's need for treatment. Providing the AI with more information increases the benefits of an aligned AI but also amplifies the harm from a misaligned one. We characterize how the designer should select attributes to balance these competing forces, depending on their beliefs about the AI's reliability. We show that the designer should optimally disclose attributes that identify \emph{rare} segments of the population in which the need for treatment is high, and pool the remaining patients.</description>

      <title>Emergent Alignment via Competition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human values remains a fundamental challenge, but does our inability to create perfectly aligned models preclude obtaining the benefits of alignment? We study a strategic setting where a human user interacts with multiple differently misaligned AI agents, none of which are individually well-aligned. Our key insight is that when the users utility lies approximately within the convex hull of the agents utilities, a condition that becomes easier to satisfy as model diversity increases, strategic competition can yield outcomes comparable to interacting with a perfectly aligned model. We model this as a multi-leader Stackelberg game, extending Bayesian persuasion to multi-round conversations between differently informed parties, and prove three results: (1) when perfect alignment would allow the user to learn her Bayes-optimal action, she can also do so in all equilibria under the convex hull condition (2) under weaker assumptions requiring only approximate utility learning, a non-strategic user employing quantal response achieves near-optimal utility in all equilibria and (3) when the user selects the best single AI after an evaluation period, equilibrium guarantees remain near-optimal without further distributional assumptions. We complement the theory with two sets of experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimal Type-Dependent Liquid Welfare Guarantees for Autobidding Agents with Budgets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online advertising systems have recently transitioned to autobidding, allowing advertisers to delegate bidding decisions to automated agents. Each advertiser directs their agent to optimize an objective function subject to return-on-investment (ROI) and budget constraints. Given their practical relevance, this shift has spurred a surge of research on the liquid welfare price of anarchy (POA) of fundamental auction formats under autobidding, most notably simultaneous first-price auctions (FPA). One of the main challenges is to understand the efficiency of FPA in the presence of heterogeneous agent types. We introduce {type-dependent smoothness framework that enables a unified analysis of the POA in such complex autobidding environments. In our approach, we derive type-dependent smoothness parameters which we carefully balance to obtain POA bounds. This balancing gives rise to a POA-revealing mathematical program, which we use to determine tight bounds on the POA of coarse correlated equilibria (CCE). Our framework is versatile enough to handle heterogeneous agent types and extends to the general class of fractionally subadditive valuations. Additionally, we develop a novel reduction technique that transforms budget-constrained agents into budget-unconstrained ones. Combining this reduction technique with our smoothness framework enables us to derive tight bounds on the POA of CCE in the general hybrid agent model with both ROI and budget constraints. Among other results, our bounds uncover an intriguing threshold phenomenon showing that the POA depends intricately on the smallest and largest agent types. We also extend our study to FPAs with reserve prices, which can be interpreted as predictions of agents' values, to further improve efficiency guarantees.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Design with Outliers and Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of mechanism design with outliers, where the designer can discard $z$ agents from the social cost objective. This setting is particularly relevant when some agents exhibit extreme or atypical preferences. As a natural case study, we consider facility location on the line: $n$ strategic agents report their preferred locations, and a mechanism places a facility to minimize a social cost function. In our setting, the $z$ agents farthest from the chosen facility are excluded from the social cost. While it may seem intuitive that discarding outliers improves efficiency, our results reveal that the opposite can hold.
  We derive tight bounds for deterministic strategyproof mechanisms under the two most-studied objectives: utilitarian and egalitarian social cost. Our results offer a comprehensive view of the impact of outliers. We first show that when $z \ge n/2$, no strategyproof mechanism can achieve a bounded approximation for either objective. For egalitarian cost, selecting the $(z + 1)$-th order statistic is strategyproof and 2-approximate. In fact, we show that this is best possible by providing a matching lower bound. Notably, this lower bound of 2 persists even when the mechanism has access to a prediction of the optimal location, in stark contrast to the setting without outliers. For utilitarian cost, we show that strategyproof mechanisms cannot effectively exploit outliers, leading to the counterintuitive outcome that approximation guarantees worsen as the number of outliers increases. However, in this case, access to a prediction allows us to design a strategyproof mechanism achieving the best possible trade-off between consistency and robustness. Finally, we also establish lower bounds for randomized mechanisms that are truthful in expectation.</description>

      <title>MetaTrading: An Immersion-Aware Model Trading Framework for Vehicular Metaverse Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Timely updating of Internet of Things data is crucial for achieving immersion in vehicular metaverse services. However, challenges such as latency caused by massive data transmissions, privacy risks associated with user data, and computational burdens on metaverse service providers (MSPs) hinder the continuous collection of high-quality data. To address these challenges, we propose an immersion-aware model trading framework that enables efficient and privacy-preserving data provisioning through federated learning (FL). Specifically, we first develop a novel multi-dimensional evaluation metric for the immersion of models (IoM). The metric considers the freshness and accuracy of the local model, and the amount and potential value of raw training data. Building on the IoM, we design an incentive mechanism to encourage metaverse users (MUs) to participate in FL by providing local updates to MSPs under resource constraints. The trading interactions between MSPs and MUs are modeled as an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) to analyze and balance their costs and gains, where MSPs as leaders determine rewards, while MUs as followers optimize resource allocation. To ensure privacy and adapt to dynamic network conditions, we develop a distributed dynamic reward algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, without acquiring any private information from MUs and other MSPs. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, achieving improvements in IoM of 38.3% and 37.2%, and reductions in training time to reach the target accuracy of 43.5% and 49.8%, on average, for the MNIST and GTSRB datasets, respectively. These findings validate the effectiveness of our approach in incentivizing MUs to contribute high-value local models to MSPs, providing a flexible and adaptive scheme for data provisioning in vehicular metaverse services.</description>

      <title>Timestamp Manipulation: Timestamp-based Nakamoto-style Blockchains are Vulnerable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05328v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nakamoto consensus are the most widely adopted decentralized consensus mechanism in cryptocurrency systems. Since it was proposed in 2008, many studies have focused on analyzing its security. Most of them focus on maximizing the profit of the adversary. Examples include the selfish mining attack [FC '14] and the recent riskless uncle maker (RUM) attack [CCS '23]. In this work, we introduce the Staircase-Unrestricted Uncle Maker (SUUM), the first block withholding attack targeting the timestamp-based Nakamoto-style blockchain. Through block withholding, timestamp manipulation, and difficulty risk control, SUUM adversaries are capable of launching persistent attacks with zero cost and minimal difficulty risk characteristics, indefinitely exploiting rewards from honest participants. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle that threatens the security of blockchains. We conduct a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of SUUM, including the attack conditions, its impact on blockchains, and the difficulty risks. Finally, we further discuss four feasible mitigation measures against SUUM.</description>
