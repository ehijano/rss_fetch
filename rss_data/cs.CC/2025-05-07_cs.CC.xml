      <title>Testing Juntas Optimally with Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove tight upper and lower bounds of $\Theta\left(\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}\left( \sqrt{2^k \log\binom{n}{k} } + \log\binom{n}{k} \right)\right)$ on the number of samples required for distribution-free $k$-junta testing. This is the first tight bound for testing a natural class of Boolean functions in the distribution-free sample-based model. Our bounds also hold for the feature selection problem, showing that a junta tester must learn the set of relevant variables. For tolerant junta testing, we prove a sample lower bound of $\Omega(2^{(1-o(1)) k} + \log\binom{n}{k})$ showing that, unlike standard testing, there is no large gap between tolerant testing and learning.</description>

      <title>KRW Composition Theorems via Lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.02740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the major open problems in complexity theory is proving super-logarithmic lower bounds on the depth of circuits (i.e., $\mathbf{P}\not\subseteq\mathbf{NC}^1$). Karchmer, Raz, and Wigderson (Computational Complexity 5(3/4), 1995) suggested to approach this problem by proving that depth complexity behaves "as expected" with respect to the composition of functions $f\diamond g$. They showed that the validity of this conjecture would imply that $\mathbf{P}\not\subseteq\mathbf{NC}^1$.
  Several works have made progress toward resolving this conjecture by proving special cases. In particular, these works proved the KRW conjecture for every outer function $f$, but only for few inner functions $g$. Thus, it is an important challenge to prove the KRW conjecture for a wider range of inner functions.
  In this work, we extend significantly the range of inner functions that can be handled. First, we consider the $\textit{monotone}$ version of the KRW conjecture. We prove it for every monotone inner function $g$ whose depth complexity can be lower bounded via a query-to-communication lifting theorem. This allows us to handle several new and well-studied functions such as the $s\textbf{-}t$-connectivity, clique, and generation functions.
  In order to carry this progress back to the $\textit{non-monotone}$ setting, we introduce a new notion of $\textit{semi-monotone}$ composition, which combines the non-monotone complexity of the outer function $f$ with the monotone complexity of the inner function $g$. In this setting, we prove the KRW conjecture for a similar selection of inner functions $g$, but only for a specific choice of the outer function $f$.</description>

      <title>Constrained Boundary Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boundary labeling is a technique in computational geometry used to label sets of features in an illustration. It involves placing labels along an axis-parallel bounding box and connecting each label with its corresponding feature using non-crossing leader lines. Although boundary labeling is well-studied, semantic constraints on the labels have not been investigated thoroughly. In this paper, we introduce grouping and ordering constraints in boundary labeling: Grouping constraints enforce that all labels in a group are placed consecutively on the boundary, and ordering constraints enforce a partial order over the labels. We show that it is NP-hard to find a labeling for arbitrarily sized labels with unrestricted positions along one side of the boundary. However, we obtain polynomial-time algorithms if we restrict this problem either to uniform-height labels or to a finite set of candidate positions. Furthermore, we show that finding a labeling on two opposite sides of the boundary is NP-complete, even for uniform-height labels and finite label positions. Finally, we experimentally confirm that our approach has also practical relevance.</description>

      <title>Residue Domination in Bounded-Treewidth Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the vertex selection problem $(\sigma,\rho)$-DomSet one is given two fixed sets $\sigma$ and $\rho$ of integers and the task is to decide whether we can select vertices of the input graph such that, for every selected vertex, the number of selected neighbors is in $\sigma$ and, for every unselected vertex, the number of selected neighbors is in $\rho$ [Telle, Nord. J. Comp. 1994]. This framework covers many fundamental graph problems such as Independent Set and Dominating Set.
  We significantly extend the recent result by Focke et al. [SODA 2023] to investigate the case when $\sigma$ and $\rho$ are two (potentially different) residue classes modulo $m\ge 2$. We study the problem parameterized by treewidth and present an algorithm that solves in time $m^{tw} \cdot n^{O(1)}$ the decision, minimization and maximization version of the problem. This significantly improves upon the known algorithms where for the case $m \ge 3$ not even an explicit running time is known. We complement our algorithm by providing matching lower bounds which state that there is no $(m-\epsilon)^{pw} \cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm parameterized by pathwidth $pw$, unless SETH fails. For $m = 2$, we extend these bounds to the minimization version as the decision version is efficiently solvable.</description>

      <title>Separating complexity classes of LCL problems on grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17445v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems on $\mathbb{Z}^n$ from the point of view of descriptive set theory, computability theory, and factors of i.i.d. Our results separate various complexity classes that were not previously known to be distinct and serve as counterexamples to a number of natural conjectures in the field.</description>
