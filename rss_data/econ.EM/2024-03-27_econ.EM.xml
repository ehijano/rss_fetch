      <title>Statistical Inference of Optimal Allocations I: Regularities and their Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develp a functional differentiability approach for solving statistical optimal allocation problems. We first derive Hadamard differentiability of the value function through a detailed analysis of the general properties of the sorting operator. Central to our framework are the concept of Hausdorff measure and the area and coarea integration formulas from geometric measure theory. Building on our Hadamard differentiability results, we demonstrate how the functional delta method can be used to directly derive the asymptotic properties of the value function process for binary constrained optimal allocation problems, as well as the two-step ROC curve estimator. Moreover, leveraging profound insights from geometric functional analysis on convex and local Lipschitz functionals, we obtain additional generic Fr\'echet differentiability results for the value functions of optimal allocation problems. These compelling findings motivate us to study carefully the first order approximation of the optimal social welfare. In this paper, we then present a double / debiased estimator for the value functions. Importantly, the conditions outlined in the Hadamard differentiability section validate the margin assumption from the statistical classification literature employing plug-in methods that justifies a faster convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Distributional Treatment Effect with Finite Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Treatment effect heterogeneity is of a great concern when evaluating the treatment. However, even with a simple case of a binary treatment, the distribution of treatment effect is difficult to identify due to the fundamental limitation that we cannot observe both treated potential outcome and untreated potential outcome for a given individual. This paper assumes a finite mixture model on the potential outcomes and a vector of control covariates to address treatment endogeneity and imposes a Markov condition on the potential outcomes and covariates within each type to identify the treatment effect distribution. The mixture weights of the finite mixture model are consistently estimated with a nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm, thus allowing us to consistently estimate the component distribution parameters, including ones for the treatment effect distribution.</description>

      <title>Party On: The Labor Market Returns to Social Networks in Adolescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09426v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the returns to adolescent friendships on earnings in adulthood using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Because both education and friendships are jointly determined in adolescence, OLS estimates of their returns are likely biased. We implement a novel procedure to obtain bounds on the causal returns to friendships: we assume that the returns to schooling range from 5 to 15% (based on prior literature), and instrument for friendships using similarity in age among peers. Having one more friend in adolescence increases earnings between 7 and 14%, substantially more than OLS estimates would suggest.</description>

      <title>Partial Identification of Individual-Level Parameters Using Aggregate Data in a Nonparametric Binary Outcome Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the relationship between variables at the individual level can be different from the relationship between those same variables aggregated over individuals. This problem of aggregation becomes relevant when the researcher wants to learn individual-level relationships, but only has access to data that has been aggregated. In this paper, I develop a methodology to partially identify linear combinations of conditional average outcomes from aggregate data when the outcome of interest is binary, while imposing as few restrictions on the underlying data generating process as possible. I construct identified sets using an optimization program that allows for researchers to impose additional shape and data restrictions. I also provide consistency results and construct an inference procedure that is valid with aggregate data, which only provides marginal information about each variable. I apply the methodology to simulated and real-world data sets and find that the estimated identified sets are too wide to be useful, but become narrower as more assumptions are imposed and data aggregated at a finer level is available. This suggests that to obtain useful information from aggregate data sets about individual-level relationships, researchers must impose further assumptions that are carefully justified or seek out data aggregated at the finest level possible.</description>
