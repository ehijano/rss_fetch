      <title>A physics-informed data-driven framework for modeling hyperelastic materials with progressive damage and failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a two-stage physics-informed, data-driven constitutive modeling framework for hyperelastic soft materials undergoing progressive damage and failure. The framework is grounded in the concept of hyperelasticity with energy limiters and employs Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to separately learn the intact (undamaged) elastic response and damage evolution directly from data. In Stage I, GPR models learn the intact hyperelastic response through volumetric and isochoric response functions (or only the isochoric response under incompressibility), ensuring energetic consistency of the intact response and satisfaction of fundamental principles such as material frame indifference and balance of angular momentum. In Stage II, damage is modeled via a separate GPR model that learns the mapping between the intact strain energy density predicted by Stage I models and a stress-reduction factor governing damage and failure, with monotonicity, non-negativity, and complete-failure constraints enforced through penalty-based optimization to ensure thermodynamic admissibility. Validation on synthetic datasets, including benchmarking against analytical constitutive models and competing data-driven approaches, demonstrates high in-distribution accuracy under uniaxial tension and robust generalization from limited training data to compression and shear modes not used during training. Application to experimental brain tissue data demonstrates the practical applicability of the framework and enables inference of damage evolution and critical failure energy. Overall, the proposed framework combines the physical consistency, interpretability, and generalizability of analytical models with the flexibility, predictive accuracy, and automation of machine learning, offering a powerful approach for modeling failure in soft materials under limited experimental data.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Temporal Embeddings via a Hybrid Seq2Seq Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates how shallow, NISQ-compatible quantum layers can improve temporal representation learning in real-world sequential data. We develop a QLSTM Seq2Seq autoencoder in which a depth-1 variational quantum circuit is embedded inside each recurrent gate, shaping the geometry of the learned latent manifold. Evaluated on fourteen rolling S and P 500 windows from 2022 to 2025, the quantum-enhanced encoder produces smoother trajectories, clearer regime transitions, and more stable, sector-coherent clusters than a classical LSTM baseline. These geometric properties support the use of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel for downstream portfolio allocation, where both RBF-Graph and RBF-DivMom strategies consistently outperform their classical counterparts in risk-adjusted terms. Analysis across periods shows that compressed manifolds favor concentrated allocation, while dispersed manifolds favor diversification, demonstrating that latent geometry serves as a regime indicator. The results highlight a practical role for shallow hybrid quantum and classical layers in NISQ-era sequence modeling, offering a reproducible pathway for improving temporal embeddings in finance and other data-limited, noise-sensitive domains.</description>

      <title>Systematic Trend-Following with Adaptive Portfolio Construction: Enhancing Risk-Adjusted Alpha in Cryptocurrency Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets exhibit pronounced momentum effects and regime-dependent volatility, presenting both opportunities and challenges for systematic trading strategies. We propose AdaptiveTrend, a multi-component algorithmic trading framework that integrates high-frequency trend-following on 6-hour intervals with monthly adaptive portfolio construction and asymmetric long-short capital allocation. Our framework introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic trailing stop mechanism calibrated to intra-day volatility regimes, (2) a rolling Sharpe-ratio-based asset selection procedure with market-capitalization-aware filtering, and (3) a theoretically motivated asymmetric 70/30 long-short allocation scheme grounded in the empirical positive drift of crypto markets. Through extensive out-of-sample backtesting across 150+ cryptocurrency pairs over a 36-month evaluation window (2022-2024), AdaptiveTrend achieves an annualized Sharpe ratio of 2.41, a maximum drawdown of -12.7%, and a Calmar ratio of 3.18, significantly outperforming benchmark trend-following strategies (TSMOM, time-series momentum) and equal-weighted buy-and-hold portfolios. We further conduct rigorous robustness analyses including parameter sensitivity, transaction cost modeling, and regime-conditional performance decomposition, demonstrating the strategy's resilience across bull, bear, and sideways market conditions.</description>

      <title>Systematic Analysis of Penalty-Optimised Illumination Design for Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing via the Extendable Framework TVAM AID Using the Core Imaging Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing(TVAM) is a novel manufacturing method that allows for the fast creation of objects of complex geometry in layerless fashion. The process is based on the solidification of photopolymer that occurs when a sufficient threshold dose of light-energy is absorbed. In order to create complex shapes, an illumination plan must be designed to force solidification in some desired areas while leaving other regions liquid. Determining an illumination plan can be considered as an optimisation problem where a variety of objective functionals (penalties) can be used. This work considers a selection of penalty functions and their impact on selected printing metrics; linking the shape of penalty functions to ranges of light-energy dose levels in in-part regions that should be printed and out-of-part regions that should remain liquid. Further, the threshold parameters that are typically used to demarcate minimum light-energy for in-part regions and maximum light-energy for out-of-part regions are investigated systematically as design parameters on both existing and new methods. This enables the characterisation of their effects on some selected printing metrics as well as informed selection for default values. This work is underpinned by a reproducible and extensible framework, TVAM Adaptive Illumination Design(TVAM AID), which makes use of the open-source Core Imaging Library(CIL) that is designed for tomographic imaging with an emphasis on reconstruction. The foundation of TVAM AID which is presented here can hence be easily enhanced by existing functionality in CIL thus lowering the barrier to entry and encouraging use of strategies that already exist for reconstruction optimisation.</description>

      <title>MagneX: A High-Performance, GPU-Enabled, Data-Driven Micromagnetics Solver for Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to comprehensively investigate the multiphysics coupling in spintronic devices, it is essential to parallelize and utilize GPU-acceleration to address the spatial and temporal disparities inherent in the relevant physics. Additionally, the use of cutting-edge time integration libraries as well as machine learning (ML) approaches to replace and potentially accelerate expensive computational routines are attractive capabilities to enhance modeling capabilities moving forward. Leveraging the Exascale Computing Project software framework AMReX, as well as SUNDIALS time-integration libraries and python-based ML workflows, we have developed an open-source micromagnetics modeling tool called MagneX. This tool incorporates various crucial magnetic coupling mechanisms, including Zeeman coupling, demagnetization coupling, crystalline anisotropy interaction, exchange coupling, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) coupling. We demonstrate the GPU performance and scalability of the code and rigorously validate MagneX's functionality using the mumag standard problems and widely-accepted DMI benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the data-driven capability of MagneX by replacing the computationally-expensive demagnetization physics with neural network libraries trained from our simulation data. With the capacity to explore complete physical interactions, this innovative approach offers a promising pathway to better understand and develop fully integrated spintronic and electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Few-Shot Temporal Reasoning of LLMs for Human Activity Prediction in Smart Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anticipating human activities and their durations is essential in applications such as smart-home automation, simulation-based architectural and urban design, activity-based transportation system simulation, and human-robot collaboration, where adaptive systems must respond to human activities. Existing data-driven agent-based models--from rule-based to deep learning--struggle in low-data environments, limiting their practicality. This paper investigates whether large language models, pre-trained on broad human knowledge, can fill this gap by reasoning about everyday activities from compact contextual cues. We adopt a retrieval-augmented prompting strategy that integrates four sources of context--temporal, spatial, behavioral history, and persona--and evaluate it on the CASAS Aruba smart-home dataset. The evaluation spans two complementary tasks: next-activity prediction with duration estimation, and multi-step daily sequence generation, each tested with various numbers of few-shot examples provided in the prompt. Analyzing few-shot effects reveals how much contextual supervision is sufficient to balance data efficiency and predictive accuracy, particularly in low-data environments. Results show that large language models exhibit strong inherent temporal understanding of human behavior: even in zero-shot settings, they produce coherent daily activity predictions, while adding one or two demonstrations further refines duration calibration and categorical accuracy. Beyond a few examples, performance saturates, indicating diminishing returns. Sequence-level evaluation confirms consistent temporal alignment across few-shot conditions. These findings suggest that pre-trained language models can serve as promising temporal reasoners, capturing both recurring routines and context-dependent behavioral variations, thereby strengthening the behavioral modules of agent-based models.</description>

      <title>Toward Adaptive Non-Intrusive Reduced-Order Models: Design and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projection-based Reduced Order Models (ROMs) are often deployed as static surrogates, which limits their practical utility once a system leaves the training manifold. We formalize and study adaptive non-intrusive ROMs that update both the latent subspace and the reduced dynamics online. Building on ideas from static non-intrusive ROMs, specifically, Operator Inference (OpInf) and the recently-introduced Non-intrusive Trajectory-based optimization of Reduced-Order Models (NiTROM), we propose three formulations: Adaptive OpInf (sequential basis/operator refits), Adaptive NiTROM (joint Riemannian optimization of encoder/decoder and polynomial dynamics), and a hybrid that initializes NiTROM with an OpInf update. We describe the online data window, adaptation window, and computational budget, and analyze cost scaling. On a transiently perturbed lid-driven cavity flow, static Galerkin/OpInf/NiTROM drift or destabilize when forecasting beyond training. In contrast, Adaptive OpInf robustly suppresses amplitude drift with modest cost; Adaptive NiTROM is shown to attain near-exact energy tracking under frequent updates but is sensitive to its initialization and optimization depth; the hybrid is most reliable under regime changes and minimal offline data, yielding physically coherent fields and bounded energy. We argue that predictive claims for ROMs must be cost-aware and transparent, with clear separation of training/adaptation/deployment regimes and explicit reporting of online budgets and full-order model queries. This work provides a practical template for building self-correcting, non-intrusive ROMs that remain effective as the dynamics evolve well beyond the initial manifold.</description>

      <title>SLD-L2S: Hierarchical Subspace Latent Diffusion for High-Fidelity Lip to Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although lip-to-speech synthesis (L2S) has achieved significant progress in recent years, current state-of-the-art methods typically rely on intermediate representations such as mel-spectrograms or discrete self-supervised learning (SSL) tokens. The potential of latent diffusion models (LDMs) in this task remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce SLD-L2S, a novel L2S framework built upon a hierarchical subspace latent diffusion model. Our method aims to directly map visual lip movements to the continuous latent space of a pre-trained neural audio codec, thereby avoiding the information loss inherent in traditional intermediate representations. The core of our method is a hierarchical architecture that processes visual representations through multiple parallel subspaces, initiated by a subspace decomposition module. To efficiently enhance interactions within and between these subspaces, we design the diffusion convolution block (DiCB) as our network backbone. Furthermore, we employ a reparameterized flow matching technique to directly generate the target latent vectors. This enables a principled inclusion of speech language model (SLM) and semantic losses during training, moving beyond conventional flow matching objectives and improving synthesized speech quality. Our experiments show that SLD-L2S achieves state-of-the-art generation quality on multiple benchmark datasets, surpassing existing methods in both objective and subjective evaluations.</description>

      <title>Potential-energy gating for robust state estimation in bistable stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce potential-energy gating, a method for robust state estimation in systems governed by double-well stochastic dynamics. The observation noise covariance of a Bayesian filter is modulated by the local value of a known or assumed potential energy function: observations are trusted when the state is near a potential minimum and progressively discounted as it approaches the barrier separating metastable wells. This physics-based mechanism differs from purely statistical robust filters, which treat all regions of state space identically, and from constrained filters, which impose hard bounds on states rather than modulating observation trust. We implement the gating within Extended, Unscented, Ensemble, and Adaptive Kalman filters and particle filters, requiring only two additional hyperparameters. Synthetic benchmarks on a Ginzburg-Landau double-well process with 10% outlier contamination and Monte Carlo validation over 100 replications show 57-80% RMSE improvement over the standard Extended Kalman Filter, all statistically significant (p &lt; 10^{-15}, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). A naive topological baseline using only distance to the nearest well achieves 57%, confirming that the continuous energy landscape adds an additional ~21 percentage points. The method is robust to misspecification: even when assumed potential parameters deviate by 50% from their true values, improvement never falls below 47%. Comparing externally forced and spontaneous Kramers-type transitions, gating retains 68% improvement under noise-induced transitions whereas the naive baseline degrades to 30%. As an empirical illustration, we apply the framework to Dansgaard-Oeschger events in the NGRIP delta-18O ice-core record, estimating asymmetry parameter gamma = -0.109 (bootstrap 95% CI: [-0.220, -0.011], excluding zero) and demonstrating that outlier fraction explains 91% of the variance in filter improvement.</description>

      <title>Fin-RATE: A Real-world Financial Analytics and Tracking Evaluation Benchmark for LLMs on SEC Filings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the finance domain, LLMs are increasingly expected to parse complex regulatory disclosures. However, existing benchmarks often focus on isolated details, failing to reflect the complexity of professional analysis that requires synthesizing information across multiple documents, reporting periods, and corporate entities. Furthermore, these benchmarks do not disentangle whether errors arise from retrieval failures, generation inaccuracies, domain-specific reasoning mistakes, or misinterpretation of the query or context, making it difficult to precisely diagnose performance bottlenecks. To bridge these gaps, we introduce Fin-RATE, a benchmark built on U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings and mirroring financial analyst workflows through three pathways: detail-oriented reasoning within individual disclosures, cross-entity comparison under shared topics, and longitudinal tracking of the same firm across reporting periods. We benchmark 17 leading LLMs, spanning open-source, closed-source, and finance-specialized models, under both ground-truth context and retrieval-augmented settings. Results show substantial performance degradation, with accuracy dropping by 18.60\% and 14.35\% as tasks shift from single-document reasoning to longitudinal and cross-entity analysis. This degradation is driven by increased comparison hallucinations, temporal and entity mismatches, and is further reflected in declines in reasoning quality and factual consistency--limitations that existing benchmarks have yet to formally categorize or quantify.</description>

      <title>Can LLM-based Financial Investing Strategies Outperform the Market in Long Run?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07078v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been leveraged for asset pricing tasks and stock trading applications, enabling AI agents to generate investment decisions from unstructured financial data. However, most evaluations of LLM timing-based investing strategies are conducted on narrow timeframes and limited stock universes, overstating effectiveness due to survivorship and data-snooping biases. We critically assess their generalizability and robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols. Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets, underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets, incurring heavy losses. These findings highlight the need to develop LLM strategies that are able to prioritise trend detection and regime-aware risk controls over mere scaling of framework complexity.</description>

      <title>Thought Purity: A Defense Framework For Chain-of-Thought Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks, but this explicit reasoning process introduces a critical vulnerability: adversarial manipulation of the thought chain itself, known as Chain-of-Thought Attacks (CoTA). Such attacks subtly corrupt the reasoning path to produce erroneous outputs, challenging conventional defenses that often sacrifice model utility for safety. To address this, we propose Thought Purity(TP), a defense framework that shifts from passive refusal to active reasoning recovery. TP integrates a safety-aware data pipeline with reinforcement learning, employing a dual-reward mechanism to teach models to dynamically identify and isolate malicious logic while preserving correct reasoning. Experiments on multiple model families demonstrate that TP significantly reduces the attack success rate of CoTA while maintaining or enhancing the model's performance on benign tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a general framework of distributional computational graphs: computational graphs whose inputs are probability distributions rather than point values. We analyze the discretization error that arises when these graphs are evaluated using finite approximations of continuous probability distributions. Such an approximation might be the result of representing a continuous real-valued distribution using a discrete representation or from constructing an empirical distribution from samples (or might be the output of another distributional computational graph).
