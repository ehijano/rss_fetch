      <title>Instantons and Rarefaction Pulses as Pathways to Global Phase Coherence in Gain-Based Optical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how to reliably remove unwanted global phase windings in gain-based optical oscillator networks, thereby ensuring convergence to the true synchronized configuration corresponding to the XY Hamiltonian's global minimum. Focusing on one-dimensional rings and two-dimensional toroidal lattices, we show that two key strategies greatly enhance the probability of reaching the defect-free state. First, operating at a low effective injection rate just above threshold, exploits the amplitude degree of freedom, allowing the system to form transient zero-amplitude holes: instantons in one dimension, or vortex-antivortex rarefaction pulses in two-dimensional space, that enable phase slips. Second, preparing the initial condition with amplitude or phase inhomogeneities can directly seed these amplitude collapses and prevent the system from getting trapped in higher-energy states with nonzero winding. Using the Stuart--Landau and Ginzburg--Landau equations as models for fast-reservoir lasers, we derive analytic and numerical evidence that even relatively minor amplitude dips can trigger global unwinding in 1D. We further demonstrate that the pump's slow annealing favours these amplitude-driven events, leading to improved success in finding the globally coherent ground state. These findings highlight the critical role of amplitude freedom in analogue solvers for XY optimization problems, showing how local amplitude suppression provides a direct route to ejecting topological defects.</description>

      <title>Dissipative solitons in parity-time symmetric laser cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of optically coherent ultrashort pulses by mode-locked lasers has revolutionized advancements in modern science and technology. These pulses often arise from the formation of dissipative solitons, which emerge due to a balance between energy excitation and dissipation. Harnessing the concept of parity-time (PT) symmetry to control this balance, we demonstrate a new type of laser dissipative solitons hosted in linearly coupled ring cavities. Our experiments are performed in a laser where the linear hybridized modes are in the PT-symmetric phase. We experimentally observe the formation of short pulses, stabilized by the selective breaking of the PT-symmetry by the Kerr nonlinearity. Our results unlock new possibilities for passive mode-locking by showing spontaneous pulse formation in PT-symmetric lasers without the need for additional intricate components such as saturable absorber or non-reciprocal and polarisation sensitive elements.</description>

      <title>Sine-Gordon kink lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an extended model with two real scalar fields, $\phi(x,t)$ and $\chi(x,t)$. The first sector is controlled by the sine-Gordon superpotential, while the second field is submitted to the $\chi^4$ one. The fields mutually interact via a nontrivial coupling function $f(\chi)$ that also changes the kinematics of $\phi$. We briefly review the implementation of the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) prescription. We then solve the resulting BPS equations for two different interactions $f$. The first one leads to a single kink-kink configuration, while the second one gives rise to a inhomogeneous sine-Gordon kink lattice. We study the linear stability of these new solutions, focusing on their translational modes. We also explore how the strength of the mutual interaction affects the BPS profiles. In particular, we show that a homogeneous lattice with identical kinks is attained in the regime of extremely strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal interactions induce frequency shifts in superradiant lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiant lasers, which consist of incoherently driven atoms coupled to a lossy cavity, are a promising source of coherent light due to their stable frequency and superior narrow linewidth. We show that when a fraction of the atoms is not driven, a shift in the lasing frequency and a broadening of the linewidth occur, limiting the performance of a superradiant laser. We explain this behavior by identifying nonreciprocal interactions between driven and undriven atoms, i.e., competing alignment and antialignment of their dipoles. Our results have implications for the realization of superradiant lasers, establishing the relevance of nonreciprocal phenomena for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate modelling of Kerr-Brillouin combs in Fabry-Perot resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new mean-field equation for modeling Fabry-Perot resonators filled with a dispersive medium exhibiting both Brillouin and Kerr nonlinearities, e.g. an optical fiber. This model is derived from a unified framework that accounts for Brillouin scattering and four-wave mixing. It involves two coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations for the forward and backward propagating fields, alongside a single equation governing the acoustic oscillation. Under the standard assumptions for the mean-field approach (high finesse, weak nonlinearity, and weak dispersion) we demonstrate that our model closely matches the original system. The simplified and elegant mathematical structure of our equation provides valuable physical insights. As a key example, we derive an expression for the growth rate of harmonic perturbations to the steady states. Additionally, our model facilitates fast and accurate numerical simulations using standard Fourier split-step methods. We highlight the effectiveness of this approach by simulating frequency comb generation in state-of-the-art high-Q fiber Fabry-Perot resonators.</description>
