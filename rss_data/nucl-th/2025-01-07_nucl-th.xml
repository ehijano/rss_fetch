      <title>Nuclear EoS with finite range interaction and the Constrained Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of the many-body correlations with respect the MF description characterizing the Constrained Molecular Dynamics are discussed in the case of finite and zero range effective microscopic interactions. In particular, for the system $^{64}Ni+^{48}Ca$ fusion-fission cross-sections, IMF production and transversal flow have been evaluated in the framework of the CoMD model at different incident energies. The results obtained significantly depend on whether the effects of the above-mentioned correlations are taken into account in the corresponding EoS.</description>

      <title>Study of medium-mass and heavy hypernuclei produced through spallation and fission reactions in inverse kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Innovative experiments using the inverse kinematics technique to accelerate light, medium-mass, and heavy nuclei at relativistic energies have become excellent tools to produce and study hypernuclei. In this work, we investigate hypernuclei created in spallation reactions, where multifragmentation, particle evaporation, and fission processes play an important role in the formation of final hypernuclei residues. For the description of spallation reactions, we couple the Li\`ege intranuclear cascade model, extended recently to the strange sector, to a new version of the ablation (ABLA) model that accounts for the evaporation of {\Lambda}-particles from hot hyperremnants produced during the intranuclear cascade stage. These state-of-the art models are then used to study the production of hypernuclei close to the drip lines through spallation-evaporation and fission reactions. Moreover, recent results obtained for the study of hypernuclei dynamics, in particular, for the constraint of the viscosity parameter involved in hyperfission reactions are also presented.</description>

      <title>Parity doubled nucleons can rapidly cool neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In confined hadronic matter, the spontaneous breaking and restoration of chiral symmetry can be described by considering nucleons, $N_{+}(939)$, and excited states of opposite parity, $N_{-}(1535)$. In a cold, dense hadronic phase where chiral symmetry remains spontaneously broken, direct Urca decay processes involving the $N_{-}$ are possible, e.g. $N_- \rightarrow N_+ + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$. We show that at low temperature and moderate densities, because the $N_-$ is much heavier than the $N_+$, such cooling dominates over standard $N_+$ direct Urca processes. This provides a strong constraint on chiral symmetry restoration in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Antideuteron Flux Within a Dynamical Coalescence Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic antideuterons are considered as one of the most promising tools for the indirect detection of dark matter due to their ultra-low astrophysical backgrounds. Currently only upper limits on the antideuteron flux exist, but advancements in experimental detection technology may soon lead to positive signals. A major source of background is the production of secondary antideuterons through collisions of cosmic rays with the surrounding medium. In this study, antideuteron production is modeled using a multiphase transport model (AMPT) coupled with a dynamical coalescence model. By applying a widely used leaky box model and incorporating specific processes, we present a new theoretical baseline for atmospheric secondary antideuteron flux, including a tertiary contribution, from primary cosmic rays interacting with Earth's atmosphere. Our results indicate that the atmospheric antideuteron flux are within the range of various existing calculations and remain well below the upper limits set by the Balloon-borne Experiment with a Superconducting Spectrometer (BESS). The atomospheric antideuteron is found to dominate the antideuteron background at kinetic energies below $0.26 $ GeV/n.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative calculations of nuclear matter using in-medium similarity renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-perturbative ab initio calculations of infinite nuclear matter using In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (IMSRG) method is developed in this work, which enables calculations with chiral two and three-nucleon forces at N$^2$LO and N$^3$LO. Results from the many-body perturbation theory at different orders and coupled-cluster theory are also presented for comparison. It is shown that different many-body approaches lead to divergences with a harder nuclear interaction for pure neutron matter. For symmetric nuclear matter, such divergences would appear even with soft nuclear interactions. This work provides a novel alternative infrastructure for future studies of dense nuclear matter and strongly-correlated many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Evolutions of in-medium baryon-baryon scattering cross sections and stiffness of dense nuclear matter from Bayesian analyses of FOPI proton flow excitation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within a Bayesian statistical framework using a Gaussian Process (GP) emulator for an isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (IBUU) transport model simulator of heavy-ion reactions, we infer from the proton directed and elliptical flow in mid-central Au+Au reactions at beam energies from 150 to 1200 MeV/nucleon taken by the FOPI Collaboration the posterior probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the in-medium baryon-baryon scattering cross section modification factor $X$ (with respect to their free-space values) and the stiffness parameter $K$ of dense nuclear matter. We find that the most probable value of $X$ evolves from around 0.7 to 1.0 as the beam energy $E_{beam}/A$ increases. On the other hand, the posterior PDF($K$) may have dual peaks having roughly the same height or extended shoulders at high $K$ values. More quantitatively, the posterior PDF($K$) changes from having a major peak around 220 MeV characterizing a soft EOS in the reaction at $E_{beam}/A$=150 MeV to one that peaks around 320 MeV indicating a stiff EOS in the reactions at $E_{beam}/A$ higher than about 600 MeV. The transition from soft to stiff happens in mid-central Au+Au reactions at beam energies around 250 MeV/nucleon in which $K=220$ MeV and $K=320$ MeV are approximately equally probable. Altogether, the FOPI proton flow excitation function data indicate a gradual hardening of hot and dense nuclear matter as its density and temperature increase in reactions with higher beam energies.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic Monte Carlo for finite systems at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order virtual excitations play an important role in microscopic models of nuclear reactions at intermediate energies. However, the factorial growth of their complexity has prevented their consistent inclusion in ab initio many-body calculations. For infinite systems at finite temperature, such drawbacks can be overcome using diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) techniques to resum entire series of Feynman diagrams. We present a DiagMC algorithm that can be applied to self-bound systems with discrete energy levels at zero temperature, and demonstrate its potential for the Richardson model of nuclear pairing. We show that sampling the topological space of diagrams allows the inclusion of high-order excitations that are neglected in state-of-the-art approximations used in nuclear physics and quantum chemistry. We propose that sampling the diagrammatic space can overcome the long-standing gap between our microscopic understanding of structure and reactions in nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Axial-Vector and Tensor Spin Polarization and Chiral Restoration in Quark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spontaneous spin-polarizations of quark matter with flavour $SU(2)$ symmetry at zero temperature in the NJL model. In a relativistic framework, there are two types of the spin-spin interactions: axial-vector (AV) and tensor (T), which accordingly give rise to different types of spin-polarized materials. When the spin-spin interaction is sufficiently strong, the spin-polarized phase emerges within a specific density region. As the spin-spin interaction becomes stronger, this phase extends over higher density region beyond the critical density of chiral restoration in normal quark matter. We show that the spin-polarized phase leads to another kind of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking phase.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Schiff Moments and CP Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews the calculation of nuclear Schiff moments, which one must know in order to interpret experiments that search for time-reversal-violating electric dipole moments in certain atoms and molecules. After briefly reviewing the connection between dipole moments and CP violation in and beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, Schiff's theorem, which concerns the screening of nuclear electric dipole moments by electrons, Schiff moments, and experiments to measure dipole moments in atoms and molecules, the paper examines attempts to compute Schiff moments in nuclei such as $^{199}$Hg and octupole-deformed isotopes such as $^{225}$Ra, which are particularly useful in experiments. It then turns to ab initio nuclear-structure theory, describing ways in which both the In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group and coupled-cluster theory can be used to compute important Schiff moments more accurately than the less controlled methods that have been applied so far.</description>

      <title>Extracting the Speed of Sound in Heavy-Ion Collisions: A Study of Quantum Fluctuations and Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermalization of quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions is crucial for understanding its behavior as a relativistic fluid and the thermodynamic properties of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). This study investigates the role of fluctuations in the relationship between transverse momentum and particle multiplicity, with a particular focus on their impact on extracting the QCD speed of sound. In a thermalized quark-gluon plasma, fluctuations are dominantly quantum in origin and follow a Gaussian distribution due to their independence from the thermodynamic response. In contrast, non-thermalized systems display non-Gaussian fluctuations, reflecting the breakdown of thermalization. By leveraging the Gaussianity condition of quantum fluctuations, the physical value of the speed of sound can be extracted statistically, even in the presence of significant event-by-event fluctuations. This framework provides a robust diagnostic tool for probing thermalization and extracting thermodynamic properties in both large and small collision systems.</description>

      <title>Constraining the chiral magnetic effect using spectator and participant planes across Au+Au and isobar collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}} = 200$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions through an improved two-plane method analysis of the $\Delta\gamma$ observable, probing $\mathcal{CP}$-symmetry breaking in strong interactions and topological properties of the QCD vacuum. Using a multiphase transport model with tunable CME strengths, we systematically compare Au+Au and isobar collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}} = 200$ GeV. We observe a reduced difference in the CME signal-to-background ratio between the spectator and participant planes for Au+Au collisions compared to isobar collisions. A comprehensive chi-square analysis across all three collision systems reveals stronger CME signatures in Au+Au collisions relative to isobar collisions, particularly when measured with respect to the spectator plane. Our findings demonstrate an enhanced experimental reliability of the two-plane method for the CME detection in Au+Au collisions.</description>

      <title>In-medium $\Lambda N$ interactions with leading order covariant chiral hyperon/nucleon-nucleon forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-medium $\Lambda N$ interactions are crucial in hypernuclei and neutron star physics. In this work, we study the in-medium $\Lambda N$ interaction within the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) framework, employing the leading-order covariant chiral hyperon/nucleon-nucleon forces for the first time. We demonstrate that a consistent description of both the experimental cross-section data and the `empirical value' of the $\Lambda$ single-particle potential can be achieved. This contrasts with the majority of studies in the non-relativistic framework, where higher-order two-body chiral forces are typically required. This study offers a new perspective on the in-medium $\Lambda N$ interactions, urgently needed in relativistic \textit{ab initio} hypernuclear physics studies.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and causality constraints on Fermi liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate symmetry and causality constraints on interacting Fermi liquids. Whereas Galilean or Lorentz boost symmetry leads to a well-known constraint on the first Landau parameter $F_1$, we show that scale invariance similarly constrains $F_0$. In the case of conformal Fermi liquids, we show that causality constraints on the particle-hole continuum and on zero sound strongly restrict the available parameter space for interacting Fermi liquids. We also consider nonlinear response, which we show is sensitive to additional ``generalized Landau parameters'' even at lowest orders in the long wavelength limit. We impose Galilean, Lorentz and scale symmetry on these generalized Landau parameters, obtaining further nonlinear constraints. We test our constraints in several microscopic models that enter a Fermi liquid phase.</description>

      <title>Valence quark-stopping and gluon junction-stopping scenarios in electron-nucleus collisions at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider: Which one is correct?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current literature, two stopping scenarios are being discussed in the context of high-energy collisions: the valence quark scenario and the gluon or baryon junction scenario. In the valence quark-stopping scenario, three valence quarks each contribute one-third of the baryon number within a baryon. Conversely, in the gluon junction-stopping scenario, the gluon junction is responsible for carrying the entire baryon number. At present, there is no consensus regarding which type of stopping scenario is correct. Based on a multi-source thermal model, our investigation indicates that experimental data analyzed in previous studies suggest that the valence quark-stopping scenario is indeed accurate. It is anticipated that this scenario can be further validated through electron-nucleus ($eA$) collisions at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).</description>

      <title>Direct observation of $\beta$ and $\gamma$ decay from a high-spin long-lived isomer in $^{187}$Ta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $^{187}$Ta ($Z=73$, $N=114$) is located in the neutron-rich $A \approx 190$ region where a prolate-to-oblate shape transition via triaxial softness is predicted to take place. A preceding work on the $K^{\pi} = (25/2^-)$ isomer and a rotational band to which the isomer decays carried out by the same collaboration revealed that axial symmetry is slightly violated in this nucleus. This paper focuses on a higher-lying isomer, which was previously identified at 2933(14) keV by mass measurements with the Experimental Storage Ring at GSI. The isomer of interest has been populated by a multi-nucleon transfer reaction with a $^{136}$Xe primary beam incident on a natural tungsten target, using the KEK Isotope Separation System at RIKEN. New experimental findings obtained in the present paper include the internal and external $\beta$-decay branches from the high-spin isomer and a revised half-life of 136(24) s. The evaluated hindrances for $K$-forbidden transitions put constraints on the spin-parity assignment, which can be interpreted as being ascribed to a prolate shape with a five-quasiparticle configuration by model calculations.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole dynamics of carbon isotopes and 10Be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric quadrupole (E2) moments and transitions provide measures of nuclear deformation and related collective structure. However, matrix elements of the E2 operator are sensitive to the nuclear wave function at large distances and are poorly convergent within the ab initio no-core shell model approach. We demonstrate for the first time that the ratio of neutron to proton quadrupole transition matrix elements, Mn/Mp, is well-converged in the ab initio no-core shell model and provides a new and robust tool for comparing with experimental results. We find that our parameter-free results for Mn/Mp for the carbon isotopes and 10Be compare well with experiment, where available, and offer new insight into the quadrupole dynamics of nuclear response.</description>

      <title>Volume effect on the extraction of sound velocity in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions</title>

Abstract: The determination of the speed of sound in quark-gluon plasma is a crucial aspect of understanding the properties of strongly interacting matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In this study, we investigate the impact of initial-state fluctuations on the extraction of the speed of sound in a quark-gluon plasma in the ultra-central collisions. By employing the TRENTo model for simulating initial conditions, we demonstrate that these fluctuations lead to sizable volume effect, which in turn corrects the measured values of the sound velocity. With respect to realistic conditions of high-energy heavy-ion experiments, we provide quantitative estimate of these corrections.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of Z(N) = 6 magicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of magic numbers of protons and neutrons in nuclei is essential for understanding nuclear structure and fundamental nuclear forces. Over decades, researchers have conducted theoretical and experimental studies on the new magic number Z(N) = 6, focusing on observables such as radii, binding energy, electromagnetic transition, and nucleon separation energies. We perform the ab initio no-core shell model calculations for the occupation numbers of the lowest single particle states in the ground states of Z(N) = 6 and Z(N) = 8 isotopes (isotones). Our calculations do not support Z(N) = 6 as a magic number over a span of atomic numbers. However, 14C and 14O exhibit the characteristics of double-magic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Modeling net-charge fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of Pb+Pb data for net-charge fluctuations at LHC energies within the HYDJET++ model is presented. The strongly intensive quantities $D$ and $\Sigma$ are used to get rid of the effects related to volume fluctuations of the system. We employ two versions of the HYDJET++ for the analysis. The first one is the standard or default version, whereas the second one represents its further modification, which takes into account explicit event-by-event conservation of the electric net-charge of produced particles. Inclusion of the canonical net-charge conservation in the model allows one for better description of the experimental data obtained by the ALICE and the CMS Collaborations. Comparison with calculations of other models is also presented.</description>

      <title>Exploring the impact of $\Delta$-isobars on Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We include the $\Delta$-isobars in the equation of state (EOS) of neutron star (NS) and study its effects with various parameter sets of the RMF model. We compare our results with the NS's constraints from the mass-radius measurement of PSR J0348+0432, PSR J1614-2230, PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0952-0607, and tidal deformability of GW170817. We calculate the mass-radius profile and tidal deformabilities of the NS using 21 parameter sets of the RMF model.Analyzing the result with various parameters, it is clear that only few parameter sets can satisfy simultaneously the constraints from NICER and GW170817. NLD parameter set satisfy all the constraints of NICER and GW170817. For its strong predictive power for the bulk properties of the neutron star, we take NLD parameter set as a representative for the detailed calculation of effect of $\Delta$-isobar on neutron star properties. We demonstrate that it is possible that $\Delta$-isobar can produce at 2-3 times the saturation density by adjusting the coupling constants $X_{\sigma\Delta}$, $X_{\rho\Delta}$ and $X_{\omega\Delta}$ in an appropriate range. Bulk properties of the NS like mass-radius profile and tidal deformability is strongly affected by the interaction strength of $\Delta$-isobar. Our calculation shows that it is also possible that by choosing $X_{\sigma\Delta}$, $X_{\rho\Delta}$ and $X_{\omega\Delta}$ to a suitable range the threshold density of $\Delta^-$-isobar become lower than $\Lambda^0$ hyperon. For a particular value of $\Delta$-coupling constants, the $R_{1.4}$ decrease by 1.7 km. This manuscipt give an argumentative justification for allowing $\Delta$-isobar degrees of freedom in the calculation of the NS properties.</description>

      <title>Exposing the dead-cone effect of jet quenching in QCD medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.14668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When an energetic parton traverses the hot QCD medium it may suffer multiple scattering and lose its energy. The medium-induced gluon radiation for a massive quark will be suppressed relative to that of a light quark due to the dead-cone effect. The development of new declustering techniques of jet evolution makes a direct study of the dead-cone effect in the QCD medium possible for the first time. In this work, we compute the emission angle distribution of the charm-quark initiated splittings in $\rm D^0$ meson tagged jet and that of the light parton initiated splittings in an inclusive jet in p+p and Pb+Pb at $\rm 5.02$~TeV by utilizing the declustering techniques of jet evolution. The heavy quark propagation and indued energy loss in the QCD medium are simulated with the SHELL model based on the Langevin equation. By directly comparing the emission angle distributions of charm-quark-initiated splittings with those of light parton-initiated splittings at the same energy intervals of the initial parton, we provide insights into the fundamental splitting structure in A+A collisions, thereby exploring the possible observation of the dead-cone effect in medium-induced radiation. We further investigate the case of the emission angle distributions normalized to the number of splittings and find the dead-cone effect will broaden the emission angle of the splitting and reduce the possibility to occur such splitting, therefore leading the massive parton to lose less energy. We also find the collisional energy loss mechanism has a negligible impact on the medium modification to the emission angle distribution of the charm-quark initiated splittings for $\rm D^0$-meson tagged jets.</description>

      <title>Determination of the moments of the proton charge density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13521v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A global analysis of proton electric form factor experimental data from Rosenbluth separation and low squared four-momentum transfer experiments is discussed for the evaluation of the spatial moments of the proton charge density based on the recently published integral method. Specific attention is paid to the evaluation of the systematic errors of the method, particularly the sensitivity to the choice of the mathematical expression of the form factor fitting function. Within this comprehensive analysis of proton electric form factor data, the moments of the proton charge density are determined for integer order moments, particularly: $\langle r^2 \rangle$=0.694(09)$_{Sta.}$(16)$_{Sys.}$~fm$^2$, $\langle r^3 \rangle$=0.870(46)$_{Sta.}$(80)$_{Sys.}$~fm$^3$, and $\langle r^4 \rangle$=1.47(25)$_{Sta.}$(45)$_{Sys.}$~fm$^4$.</description>

      <title>The structure of the f_0(980) from system size dependent hadronic resonance ratios in p+p, p+Pb, and Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the hadronic phase in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions can be used to understand the properties of the $f_0(980)$ resonance. In particular it is shown that the centrality dependence of the $f_0(980)/\pi$ and $f_0(980)/\phi$ ratios depends strongly on the $f_0(980)\rightarrow \overline{K}+K$ branching ratio and whether the $f_0(980)$ is produced as a $\left | \overline{q}q \right \rangle$ or $\left | \overline{s}s \right \rangle$ state. These conclusions are drawn from calculations within the partial chemical equilibrium of the HRG model within Thermal-FIST as well as with the fully non-equilibrium hybrid-transport approach UrQMD. Our findings show how the hadronic phase in heavy ion collisions can be used for studies of exotic hadron properties otherwise possible only in dedicated experiments such as PANDA.</description>

      <title>$\nu$-point energy correletors with FastEEC: small-$x$ physics from LHC jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, energy correlators have emerged as a powerful tool for studying jet substructure, with promising applications such as probing the hadronization transition, analyzing the quark-gluon plasma, and improving the precision of top quark mass measurements. The projected $N$-point correlator measures correlations between $N$ final-state particles by tracking the largest separation between them, showing a scaling behavior related to DGLAP splitting functions. These correlators can be analytically continued in $N$, commonly referred to as $\nu$-correlators, allowing access to non-integer moments of the splitting functions. Of particular interest is the $\nu \to 0$ limit, where the small momentum fraction behavior of the splitting functions requires resummation. Originally, the computational complexity of evaluating $\nu$-correlators for $M$ particles scaled as $2^{2M}$, making it impractical for real-world analyses. However, by using recursion, we reduce this to $M 2^M$, and through the FastEEC method of dynamically resolving subjets, $M$ is replaced by the number of subjets. This breakthrough enables, for the first time, the computation of $\nu$-correlators for LHC data. In practice, limiting the number of subjets to 16 is sufficient to achieve percent-level precision, which we validate using known integer-$\nu$ results and convergence tests for non-integer $\nu$. We have implemented this in an update to FastEEC and conducted an initial study of power-law scaling in the perturbative regime as a function of $\nu$, using CMS Open Data on jets. The results agree with DGLAP evolution, except at small $\nu$, where the anomalous dimension saturates to a value that matches the BFKL anomalous dimension.</description>
