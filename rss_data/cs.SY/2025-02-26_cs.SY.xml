      <title>Gaussian Process-Based Scalar Field Estimation in GPS-Denied Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for an autonomous agent to map an unknown scalar field in GPS-denied regions. To reduce localization errors, the agent alternates between GPS-enabled and GPS-denied areas while collecting measurements. User-defined error bounds determine the dwell time in each region. A switching trajectory is then designed to ensure field measurements in GPS-denied regions remain within the specified error limits. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis guarantees bounded error trajectories while tracking the desired path. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through simulations, with an error analysis comparing the GP-predicted scalar field model to the actual field.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Input-Output Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer a framework for ensuring set invariance and designing constrained control laws. However, crafting a valid CBF relies on system-specific assumptions and the availability of an accurate system model, underscoring the need for systematic data-driven synthesis methods. This paper introduces a data-driven approach to synthesizing a CBF for discrete-time LTI systems using only input-output measurements. The method begins by computing the maximal control invariant set using an input-output data-driven representation, eliminating the need for precise knowledge of the system's order and explicit state estimation. The proposed CBF is then systematically derived from this set, which can accommodate multiple input-output constraints. Furthermore, the proposed CBF is leveraged to develop a minimally invasive safety filter that ensures recursive feasibility with an adaptive decay rate. To improve clarity, we assume a noise-free dataset, though data-driven control techniques can be used to robustify the approach. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on an unknown time-delay system.</description>

      <title>Distributed Zonotopic Fusion Estimation for Multi-sensor Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusion estimation is often used in multi-sensor systems to provide accurate state information which plays an important role in the design of efficient control and decision-making. This paper is concerned with the distributed zonotopic fusion estimation problem for multi-sensor systems. The objective is to propose a zonotopic fusion estimation approach using different zonotope fusion criteria. We begin by proposing a novel zonotope fusion criterion to compute a distributed zonotopic fusion estimate (DZFE). The DZFE is formulated as a zonotope enclosure for the intersection of local zonotopic estimates from individual sensors. Then, the optimal parameter matrices for tuning the DZFE are determined by the analytical solution of an optimization problem. To reduce the conservatism of the DZFE with optimal parameters, we enhance our approach with an improved zonotope fusion criterion, which further improves the estimation performance of this DZFE by constructing tight strips for the intersection. In addition, we tackle the problem of handling sequentially arrived local estimates in realistic communication environments with a sequential zonotope fusion criterion. This sequential zonotope fusion offers reduced computational complexity compared to batch zonotope fusion. Notice that the proposed zonotope fusion criteria are designed to meet the state inclusion property and demonstrate performance superiority over local zonotopic estimates. We also derive stability conditions for these DZFEs to ensure their generator matrices are ultimately bounded. Finally, two illustrative examples are employed to show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Sample-efficient diffusion-based control of complex nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex nonlinear system control faces challenges in achieving sample-efficient, reliable performance. While diffusion-based methods have demonstrated advantages over classical and reinforcement learning approaches in long-term control performance, they are limited by sample efficiency. This paper presents SEDC (Sample-Efficient Diffusion-based Control), a novel diffusion-based control framework addressing three core challenges: high-dimensional state-action spaces, nonlinear system dynamics, and the gap between non-optimal training data and near-optimal control solutions. Through three innovations - Decoupled State Diffusion, Dual-Mode Decomposition, and Guided Self-finetuning - SEDC achieves 39.5\%-49.4\% better control accuracy than baselines while using only 10\% of the training samples, as validated across three complex nonlinear dynamic systems. Our approach represents a significant advancement in sample-efficient control of complex nonlinear systems. The implementation of the code can be found at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DIFOCON-C019.</description>

      <title>A Normal Variance Mixture Model for Robust Kalman Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kalman filter is ubiquitous for state space models because of its desirable statistical properties, ease of implementation, and generally good performance. However, it can perform poorly in the presence of outliers, or measurements with noise variances much greater than those assumed by the filter. An algorithm that is similar to the Kalman filter but robust to outliers is derived in this report. This algorithm -- called the normal variance mixture filter (NVMF) -- replaces the Gaussian distribution for the noise in the Kalman filter measurement model with a normal variance mixture distribution that admits heavier tails. Choice of the mixing density determines the complexity and performance of the NVMF. When the mixing density is the Dirac delta function, the NVMF is equivalent to the Kalman filter. Choice of an inverse gamma mixing density leads to closed-form recursions for the state estimate and its error covariance matrix that are robust to outliers. The NVMF is compared to the benchmark probabilistic data association filter (PDAF), as well as two other robust filters from the recent literature, for a simulated example. While all four robust filters outperform the Kalman filter when outliers are present, the NVMF provides the most consistent performance across all simulations.</description>

      <title>A Complex-Valued Feedback Linearization-Based Controller for a Voltage Source Inverter Tied to the Grid via a Second-Order Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this document, a nonlinear control law for a grid-tied converter is introduced. The converter topology consists of a voltage source inverter (VSI) linked to the grid through an inductive-capacitive second-order filter, its input being connected to a capacitive DC-link supplied by a renewable energy-based input power source. In order to achieve good performance in presence of large state excursions caused mainly by substantial set-point modifications and/or considerable disturbances, a nonlinear control law based on a complex-valued feedback linearization strategy is designed. Specifically, a flat output is adopted, which is given by the summation of the energy stored in the DC-link capacitor and in the output filter's inductor and capacitor, as well as by the reactive energy at the output. After linearizing the system through a pertinent coordinate transformation and a nonlinear feedback, a linear trajectory tracking control law is implemented. The performance of the system controlled by applying the proposed strategy is tested via simulation for a very weak grid of unity X/R ratio, yielding satisfactory results.</description>

      <title>Off-Policy Temporal Difference Learning for Perturbed Markov Decision Processes: Theoretical Insights and Extensive Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Programming suffers from the curse of dimensionality due to large state and action spaces, a challenge further compounded by uncertainties in the environment. To mitigate these issue, we explore an off-policy based Temporal Difference Approximate Dynamic Programming approach that preserves contraction mapping when projecting the problem into a subspace of selected features, accounting for the probability distribution of the perturbed transition probability matrix. We further demonstrate how this Approximate Dynamic Programming approach can be implemented as a particular variant of the Temporal Difference learning algorithm, adapted for handling perturbations. To validate our theoretical findings, we provide a numerical example using a Markov Decision Process corresponding to a resource allocation problem.</description>

      <title>Inversion-free feed-forward and feedback control of MSM based actuator with large non-smooth input hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic systems with a large and non-smooth hysteresis in feed-forward challenge the design of feedback control since the instantaneous input gain is varying during operation, in worst case between zero and infinity. Magnetic shape memory (MSM) actuators with multi-stable transitions represent such untypical system plant with only measured output displacement. This paper provides a case study of designing the feed-froward and feedback control system for an MSM-based actuator setup with a fairly high level of the output sensing noise. First, a recently introduced inversion-free feed-forward hysteresis compensator is adapted for the Krasnoselskii-Pokrovskii operator model. Then, a robust feedback proportional-integral (PI) loop shaping is performed, while taking into account the lagging behavior of the low-pass filtering and plant uncertainties. Experimental results show that the parallel action of feed-forward and feedback parts improves the overall position control performance.</description>

      <title>Smart Sampling Strategies for Wireless Industrial Data Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In industrial environments, data acquisition accuracy is crucial for process control and optimization. Wireless telemetry has proven to be a valuable tool for improving efficiency in well-testing operations, enabling bidirectional communication and real-time control of downhole tools. However, high sampling frequencies present challenges in telemetry, including data storage, transmission, computational resource consumption, and battery life of wireless devices. This study explores how optimizing data acquisition strategies can reduce aliasing effects and systematic errors while improving sampling rates without compromising measurement accuracy. A reduction of 80% in sampling frequency was achieved without degrading measurement quality, demonstrating the potential for resource optimization in industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Complex Electromagnetic Space Combat System-of-systems Modeling and Key Node Identification Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the application of advanced science and technology in the military field, modern warfare has developed into a confrontation between systems. The combat system-of-systems (CSoS) has numerous nodes, multiple attributes and complex interactions, and its research and analysis are facing great difficulties. Electromagnetic space is an important dimension of modern warfare. Modeling and analyzing the CSoS from this perspective is of great significance to studying modern warfare and can provide a reference for the research of electromagnetic warfare. In this study, the types of nodes and relationships in the complex electromagnetic space of CSoS are first divided, the important attributes of the combat nodes are extracted, and the relationship weights are normalized to establish a networked model. On this basis, the calculation method of CSoS combat effectiveness based on the combat cycle is proposed, and then the identification and sorting of key nodes can be realized by the node deletion method. Finally, by constructing an instance of aircraft carrier fleet confrontation, the feasibility of this method has been verified, and the experimental results have been compared with classical algorithms to demonstrate the advanced nature of this method.</description>

      <title>CalibRefine: Deep Learning-Based Online Automatic Targetless LiDAR-Camera Calibration with Iterative and Attention-Driven Post-Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate multi-sensor calibration is essential for deploying robust perception systems in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and intelligent transportation. Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on manually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data preprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that trains on automatically detected objects--using relative positions, appearance embeddings, and semantic classes--to generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets, we show that CalibRefine delivers high-precision calibration results with minimal human involvement, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and remaining competitive with, or surpassing, manually tuned baselines. Our findings highlight how robust object-level feature matching, together with iterative and self-supervised attention-based adjustments, enables consistent sensor fusion in complex, real-world conditions without requiring ground-truth calibration matrices or elaborate data preprocessing.</description>

      <title>The Cyber Immune System: Harnessing Adversarial Forces for Security Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both parasites in biological systems and adversarial forces in cybersecurity are often perceived as threats: disruptive elements that must be eliminated. However, these entities play a critical role in revealing systemic weaknesses, driving adaptation, and ultimately strengthening resilience. This paper draws from environmental epidemiology and cybersecurity to reframe parasites and cyber exploiters as essential stress-testers of complex systems, exposing hidden vulnerabilities and pushing defensive innovations forward. By examining how biological and digital systems evolve in response to persistent threats, we highlight the necessity of adversarial engagement in fortifying security frameworks. The recent breach of the DOGE website serves as a timely case study, illustrating how adversarial forces, whether biological or digital, compel systems to reassess and reinforce their defenses.</description>

      <title>Learning Backbones: Sparsifying Graphs through Zero Forcing for Effective Graph-Based Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for graph sparsification that preserves the essential learning attributes of original graphs, improving computational efficiency and reducing complexity in learning algorithms. We refer to these sparse graphs as "learning backbones". Our approach leverages the zero-forcing (ZF) phenomenon, a dynamic process on graphs with applications in network control. The key idea is to generate a tree from the original graph that retains critical dynamical properties. By correlating these properties with learning attributes, we construct effective learning backbones. We evaluate the performance of our ZF-based backbones in graph classification tasks across eight datasets and six baseline models. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques. Additionally, we explore extensions using node distance metrics to further enhance the framework's utility.</description>

      <title>Toward 6-DOF Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Energy-Aware Position Control based on Deep Reinforcement Learning: Preliminary Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for surveying, mapping, and inspecting unexplored underwater areas plays a crucial role, where maneuverability and power efficiency are key factors for extending the use of these platforms, making six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) holonomic platforms essential tools. Although Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Model Predictive Control controllers are widely used in these applications, they often require accurate system knowledge, struggle with repeatability when facing payload or configuration changes, and can be time-consuming to fine-tune. While more advanced methods based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have been proposed, they are typically limited to operating in fewer degrees of freedom. This paper proposes a novel DRL-based approach for controlling holonomic 6-DOF AUVs using the Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC) algorithm, which does not require manual tuning and directly feeds commands to the thrusters without prior knowledge of their configuration. Furthermore, it incorporates power consumption directly into the reward function. Simulation results show that the TQC High-Performance method achieves better performance to a fine-tuned PID controller when reaching a goal point, while the TQC Energy-Aware method demonstrates slightly lower performance but consumes 30% less power on average.</description>

      <title>GPUArmor: A Hardware-Software Co-design for Efficient and Scalable Memory Safety on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory safety errors continue to pose a significant threat to current computing systems, and graphics processing units (GPUs) are no exception. A prominent class of memory safety algorithms is allocation-based solutions. The key idea is to maintain each allocation's metadata (base address and size) in a disjoint table and retrieve it at runtime to verify memory accesses. While several previous solutions have adopted allocation-based algorithms (e.g., cuCatch and GPUShield), they typically suffer from high memory overheads or scalability problems. In this work, we examine the key characteristics of real-world GPU workloads and observe several differences between GPU and CPU applications regarding memory access patterns, memory footprint, number of live allocations, and active allocation working set. Our observations motivate GPUArmor, a hardware-software co-design framework for memory safety on GPUs. We show that a simple compiler analysis combined with lightweight hardware support using a small Memory Lookaside Buffer (MLB) can help prevent spatial and temporal memory violations on modern GPU workloads with 2.3% average run time overheads. More importantly, GPUArmor achieves speed-of-light performance with negligible storage requirements. This result benefits both base and bounds solutions and memory tagging techniques, which we showcase with GPUArmor-HWOnly, a variation of GPUArmor that does not require recompilation, and achieves 2.2% slowdowns while significantly reducing storage overheads beyond traditional memory tagging approaches.</description>

      <title>Smart and Efficient IoT-Based Irrigation System Design: Utilizing a Hybrid Agent-Based and System Dynamics Approach</title>

Abstract: Regarding problems like reduced precipitation and an increase in population, water resource scarcity has become one of the most critical problems in modern-day societies, as a consequence, there is a shortage of available water resources for irrigation in arid and semi-arid countries. On the other hand, it is possible to utilize modern technologies to control irrigation and reduce water loss. One of these technologies is the Internet of Things (IoT). Despite the possibility of using the IoT in irrigation control systems, there are complexities in designing such systems. Considering this issue, it is possible to use agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) methodologies to design complex cyber-physical systems such as IoT-based systems. In this research, a smart irrigation system is designed based on Prometheus AOSE methodology, to reduce water loss by maintaining soil moisture in a suitable interval. The designed system comprises sensors, a central agent, and irrigation nodes. These agents follow defined rules to maintain soil moisture at a desired level cooperatively. For system simulation, a hybrid agent-based and system dynamics model was designed. In this hybrid model, soil moisture dynamics were modeled based on the system dynamics approach. The proposed model, was implemented in AnyLogic computer simulation software. Utilizing the simulation model, irrigation rules were examined. The system's functionality in automatic irrigation mode was tested based on a 256-run, fractional factorial design, and the effects of important factors such as soil properties on total irrigated water and total operation time were analyzed. Based on the tests, the system consistently irrigated nearly optimal water amounts in all tests. Moreover, the results were also used to minimize the system's energy consumption by reducing the system's operational time.</description>

      <title>Equidistant-Sample or Wait-and-Sample to Minimize Age Under Sampling Constraint?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a status update system with a source, a sampler, a transmitter, and a monitor. The source governs a stochastic process that the monitor wants to observe in a timely manner. To achieve this, the sampler samples fresh update packets which the transmitter transmits via an error prone communication channel to the monitor. The transmitter can transmit without any constraint, i.e., it can transmit whenever an update packet is available to the transmitter. However, the sampler is imposed with a sampling rate constraint. The goal of the sampler is to devise an optimal policy that satisfies the resource constraint while minimizing the age of the monitor. We formulate this problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). We find several structures of an optimal policy. We leverage the optimal structures to find a low complexity optimal policy in an explicit manner, without resorting to complex iterative schemes or techniques that require bounding the age.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, coordination control of discrete event systems under joint sensor and actuator attacks is investigated. Sensor attacks are described by a set of attack languages using a proposed ALTER model. Several local supervisors are used to control the system. The goal is to design local supervisors to ensure safety of the system even under cyber attacks (CA). The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such supervisors are derived in terms of conditional decomposability, CA-controllability and CA-observability. A method is developed to calculate local state estimates under sensor attacks. Two methods are also developed to design local supervisors, one for discrete event systems satisfying conditional decomposability, CA-controllability and CA-observability, and one for discrete event systems satisfying conditional decomposability only. The approach works for both stealthy and non-stealthy attacks. A practical example is given to illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Electromagnetic Transient Power System Studies using Bayesian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The power system of the future will be governed by complex interactions and non-linear phenomena at small time-scales, that should be studied more and more through computationally expensive software simulations. To solve the abovementioned problems, power system engineers face problems with following characteristics: (i) a computationally expensive simulator, (ii) non-linear functions to optimize and (iii) lack of abundance of data. Existing optimization settings involving EMT-type simulations have been developed, but mainly use a deterministic model and optimizer, which may be computationally inefficient and do not guarantee finding a global optimum. Furthermore, the main focus has been on optimization routines, and less attention has been paid to other tasks such as classification. In this paper, an automation framework based on Bayesian Optimization is introduced, and applied to two case studies involving optimization and classification. It is found that the framework has the potential to reduce computational effort, outperform deterministic optimizers and is applicable to a multitude of problems. Nevertheless, it was found that the output of the Bayesian Optimization depends on the number of samples used for initialization, and in addition, careful selection of surrogate models, which should be subject to future investigation.</description>

      <title>Design and Control of a VTOL Aerial Vehicle Tilting its Rotors Only with Rotor Thrusts and a Passive Joint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel VTOL UAV that owns a link connecting four rotors and a fuselage by a passive joint, allowing the control of the rotor's tilting angle by adjusting the rotors' thrust. This unique structure contributes to eliminating additional actuators, such as servo motors, to control the tilting angles of rotors, resulting in the UAV's weight lighter and simpler structure. We first derive the dynamical model of the newly designed UAV and analyze its controllability. Then, we design the controller that leverages the tiltable link with four rotors to accelerate the UAV while suppressing a deviation of the UAV's angle of attack from the desired value to restrain the change of the aerodynamic force. Finally, the validity of the proposed control strategy is evaluated in simulation study.</description>

      <title>Scheduling Power-Intensive Operations of Battery Energy Storage Systems and Application to Hybrid Hydropower Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel set of power constraints for Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs), referred to as Dynamic Power Constraints (DPCs), that account for the voltage and current limits of the BESS as a function of its State of Charge (SOC). These constraints are formulated for integration into optimization-based BESS scheduling problems, providing a significant improvement over traditional static constraints. It is shown that, under mild assumptions typically verified during practical operations, DPCs can be expressed as a linear function of the BESS power, thus making it possible to retrofit existing scheduling problems without altering their tractability property (i.e., convexity). The DCPs unify voltage and current constraints into a single framework, filling a gap between simplified models used in BESS schedulers and more advanced models in real-time controllers and Battery Management Systems (BMSs). By improving the representation of the BESS's power capability, the proposed constraints enable schedulers to make more reliable and feasible decision, especially in power-intensive applications where the BESS operates near its rated power. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the DPCs, a simulation-based performance evaluation is conducted using a hybrid system comprising a 230 MW Hydropower Plant (HPP) and a 750 kVA/500 kWh BESS. Compared to state-of-the-art formulations such as static power constraints and DPC formulations without voltage constraints the proposed method reduces BESS constraint violations by 93% during real-time operations.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sensor and Actuator Selection for Factored Markov Decision Processes: Complexity, Approximability and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Factored Markov Decision Processes (fMDPs) are a class of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in which the states (and actions) can be factored into a set of state (and action) variables and can be encoded compactly using a factored representation. In this paper, we consider a setting where the state of the fMDP is not directly observable, and the agent relies on a set of potential sensors to gather information. Each sensor has a selection cost and the designer must select a subset of sensors under a limited budget. We formulate the problem of selecting a set of sensors for fMDPs (under a budget) to maximize the infinite-horizon discounted return provided by the optimal policy. We show the fundamental result that it is NP-hard to approximate this problem to within any non-trivial factor. Our inapproximability results for optimal sensor selection also extend to a general class of Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs). We then study the dual problem of budgeted actuator selection (at design-time) to maximize the expected return under the optimal policy. Again, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate this problem to within any non-trivial factor. Furthermore, with explicit examples, we show the failure of greedy algorithms for both the sensor and actuator selection problems and provide insights into the factors that cause these problems to be challenging. Despite this, through extensive simulations, we show the practical effectiveness and near-optimal performance of the greedy algorithm for actuator and sensor selection in many real-world and randomly generated instances.</description>

      <title>Optimal Distribution System Restoration with Tractable Modeling of Decision-Dependent Interruption Cost and Cold Load Pickup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing optimized restoration strategies for power distribution systems (PDSs) is essential to meet the pressing demand for enhanced resilience. Prior knowledge of customer interruption cost (CIC) and load restoration behaviors, particularly cold load pickup (CLPU), is crucial for guiding effective restoration; however, both are reciprocally affected by the realized customer interruption duration (CID), making them decision-dependent and challenging to model especially given the limited understanding of underlying physical mechanisms. This paper presents a novel approach by constructing tractable models to capture the varying patterns of CIC and CLPU with CID - patterns which can be derived from limited data and reflect observed surface-level correlations rather than underlying mechanisms, thereby enabling practical surrogate modeling of these decision-dependencies. Specifically, quadratic functions are used to model the increasing rate of CIC with CID based on data fitting. Several defining characteristics of CLPU are extracted, each modeled in a piecewise linear form relative to CID, and the actual restored load accounting for CLPU is subsequently retrieved. Building on these models, a PDS restoration optimization model is constructed, incorporating mobile energy storage systems (MESSs) and network reconfiguration. Case studies validate our approach and also highlight MESS's unique potential to accelerate CLPU-related restoration.</description>

      <title>RIS-Aided Monitoring With Cooperative Jamming: Design and Performance Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided wireless surveillance system. In this system, a monitor not only receives signal from suspicious transmitter via a RIS-enhanced legitimate surveillance (LS) link but also simultaneously takes control of multiple jammers to degrade the quality of received suspicious signal. Under this setup, to enhance monitoring performance requires improvements of both the received signal quality at the monitor and the cooperative jamming (CJ). Considering that the surveillance system is aided by one RIS, whose phase shift optimization involves both channel state information (CSI) of the LS and CJ links, we utilize partial CSI to alleviate the CSI acquisition burden in our design. We propose two RIS-aided monitoring schemes with optimal jammer selection (OJS), and derive their closed-form expressions of surveillance success probability (SSP), respectively. Furthermore, we consider RIS-aided monitoring schemes with random jammer selection as corresponding benchmarks. Thereafter, we analyze special cases where the jammers are using power control to avoid being found, making it appears like passive monitoring. Also, the effect of RIS is highlighted by considering asymptotically large number of RIS elements. Numerical results verify that the proposed OJS strategy further enhances the RIS-aided monitoring performance compared with non-jammer-selection RISLR and RISCR schemes, where the superiority comes at the cost of CSI knowledge and becomes marginal in the region of high jamming power. In addition, the RISLO shows surveillance performance advantage overRISCOwhen the suspicious power is low or when the number of RIS elements is large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13681v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a new transcription, change point localization, and mesh refinement scheme for direct optimization-based solutions and for uniform approximation of optimal control trajectories associated with a class of nonlinear constrained optimal control problems (OCPs). The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a direct multiple shooting technique -- $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization). The mesh refinement technique consists of two steps -- localization of certain irregular regions in an optimal control trajectory via wavelets, followed by a targeted $h$-refinement approach around such regions of irregularity. Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties, along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy. We also announce, and make freely available, a new software package based on $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ along with all its functionalities for completeness. The package is available at: https://github.com/chatterjee-d/QuITOv2.git.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observation-based trajectory prediction for systems with unknown dynamics is essential in fields such as physics and biology. Most existing approaches are limited to learning within a single system with fixed dynamics patterns. However, many real-world applications require learning across systems with evolving dynamics patterns, a challenge that has been largely overlooked. To address this, we systematically investigate the problem of Continual Dynamics Learning (CDL), examining task configurations and evaluating the applicability of existing techniques, while identifying key challenges. In response, we propose the Mode-switching Graph ODE (MS-GODE) model, which integrates the strengths LG-ODE and sub-network learning with a mode-switching module, enabling efficient learning over varying dynamics. Moreover, we construct a novel benchmark of biological dynamic systems for CDL, Bio-CDL, featuring diverse systems with disparate dynamics and significantly enriching the research field of machine learning for dynamic systems.

      <description>arXiv:2409.15267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Peer-to-peer learning is an increasingly popular framework that enables beyond-5G distributed edge devices to collaboratively train deep neural networks in a privacy-preserving manner without the aid of a central server. Neural network training algorithms for emerging environments, e.g., smart cities, have many design considerations that are difficult to tune in deployment settings -- such as neural network architectures and hyperparameters. This presents a critical need for characterizing the training dynamics of distributed optimization algorithms used to train highly nonconvex neural networks in peer-to-peer learning environments. In this work, we provide an explicit characterization of the learning dynamics of wide neural networks trained using popular distributed gradient descent (DGD) algorithms. Our results leverage both recent advancements in neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory and extensive previous work on distributed learning and consensus. We validate our analytical results by accurately predicting the parameter and error dynamics of wide neural networks trained for classification tasks.</description>
