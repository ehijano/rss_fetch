      <title>Complexity and algorithms for Swap median and relation to other consensus problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genome rearrangements are events in which large blocks of DNA exchange pieces during evolution. The analysis of such events is a tool for understanding evolutionary genomics, based on finding the minimum number of rearrangements to transform one genome into another. In a general scenario, more than two genomes are considered and we have new challenges. The {\sc Median} problem consists in finding, given three permutations and a distance metric, a permutation $s$ that minimizes the sum of the distances between $s$ and each input. We study the {\sc median} problem over \emph{swap} distances in permutations, for which the computational complexity has been open for almost 20 years (Eriksen, \emph{Theor. Compt. Sci.}, 2007). We consider this problem through some branches. We associate median solutions and interval convex sets, where the concept of graph convexity inspires the following investigation: Does a median permutation belong to every shortest path between one of the pairs of input permutations? We are able to partially answer this question, and as a by-product we solve a long open problem by proving that the {\sc Swap Median} problem is NP-hard. Furthermore, using a similar approach, we show that the {\sc Closest} problem, which seeks to minimize the maximum distance between the solution and the input permutations, is NP-hard even considering three input permutations. This gives a sharp dichotomy into the P vs. NP-hard approaches, since considering two input permutations the problem is easily solvable and considering any number of input permutations it is known to be NP-hard since 2007 (Popov, \emph{Theor. Compt. Sci.}, 2007). In addition, we show that {\sc Swap Median} and {\sc Swap Closest} are APX-hard problems.</description>

      <title>New Direct Sum Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A function $f:[n]^{d} \to \mathbb{F}_2$ is a \defn{direct sum} if there are functions $L_i:[n]\to \mathbb{F}_2$ such that ${f(x) = \sum_{i}L_i(x_i)}$. In this work we give multiple results related to the property testing of direct sums.
  Our first result concerns a test proposed by Dinur and Golubev in 2019. We call their test the Diamond test and show that it is indeed a direct sum tester. More specifically, we show that if a function $f$ is $\epsilon$-far from being a direct sum function, then the Diamond test rejects $f$ with probability at least $\Omega_{n,\epsilon}(1)$. Even in the case of $n = 2$, the Diamond test is, to the best of our knowledge, novel and yields a new tester for the classic property of affinity.
  Apart from the Diamond test, we also analyze a broad family of direct sum tests, which at a high level, run an arbitrary affinity test on the restriction of $f$ to a random hypercube inside of $[n]^d$. This family of tests includes the direct sum test analyzed in \cite{di19}, but does not include the Diamond test. As an application of our result, we obtain a direct sum test which works in the online adversary model of \cite{KRV}.
  Finally, we also discuss a Fourier analytic interpretation of the diamond tester in the $n=2$ case, as well as prove local correction results for direct sum as conjectured by Dinur and Golubev.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Linear Arc Monadic Datalog and Gadget Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Datalog program solves a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) if and only if it derives the goal predicate precisely on the unsatisfiable instances of the CSP.
  There are three Datalog fragments that are particularly important for finite-domain constraint satisfaction: arc monadic Datalog, linear Datalog, and symmetric linear Datalog, each having good computational properties. We consider the fragment of Datalog where we impose all of these restrictions simultaneously, i.e., we study \emph{symmetric linear arc monadic (slam) Datalog}. We characterise the CSPs that can be solved by a slam Datalog program as those that have a gadget reduction to a particular Boolean constraint satisfaction problem. We also present exact characterisations in terms of a homomorphism duality (which we call \emph{unfolded caterpillar duality}), and in universal-algebraic terms (using known minor conditions, namely the existence of quasi Maltsev operations and $k$-absorptive operations of arity $nk$}, for all $n,k \geq 1$). Our characterisations also imply that the question whether a given finite-domain CSP can be expressed by a slam Datalog program is decidable.</description>

      <title>Efficient approximation schemes for scheduling on a stochastic number of machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study three two-stage optimization problems with a similar structure and different objectives. In the first stage of each problem, the goal is to assign input jobs of positive sizes to unsplittable bags. After this assignment is decided, the realization of the number of identical machines that will be available is revealed. Then, in the second stage, the bags are assigned to machines. The probability vector of the number of machines in the second stage is known to the algorithm as part of the input before making the decisions of the first stage. Thus, the vector of machine completion times is a random variable. The goal of the first problem is to minimize the expected value of the makespan of the second stage schedule, while the goal of the second problem is to maximize the expected value of the minimum completion time of the machines in the second stage solution. The goal of the third problem is to minimize the \ell_p norm for a fixed p&gt;1, where the norm is applied on machines' completion times vectors. Each one of the first two problems admits a PTAS as Buchem et al. showed recently. Here we significantly improve all their results by designing an EPTAS for each one of these problems. We also design an EPTAS for \ell_p norm minimization for any p&gt;1.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Arrival Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a new modification of the Arrival problem, which allows for nodes that exhibit random as well as controlled behaviour, in addition to switching nodes. We study the computational complexity of these extensions, building on existing work on Reachability Switching Games. In particular, we show for versions of the arrival problem involving just switching and random nodes it is \PP{}-hard to decide if their value is greater than a half and we give a PSPACE decision algorithm.</description>

      <title>Hive-type polytopes for quiver multiplicities and the membership problem for quiver moment cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $Q$ be a bipartite quiver with vertex set $Q_0$ such that the number of arrows between any source vertex and any sink vertex is constant. Let $\beta=(\beta(x))_{x \in Q_0}$ be a dimension vector of $Q$ with positive integer coordinates.
  Let $rep(Q, \beta)$ be the representation space of $\beta$-dimensional representations of $Q$ and $GL(\beta)$ the base change group acting on $rep(Q, \beta)$ be simultaneous conjugation. Let $K^{\beta}_{\underline{\lambda}}$ be the multiplicity of the irreducible representation of $GL(\beta)$ of highest weight $\underline{\lambda}$ in the ring of polynomial functions on $rep(Q, \beta)$.
  We show that $K^{\beta}_{\underline{\lambda}}$ can be expressed as the number of lattice points of a polytope obtained by gluing together two Knutson-Tao hive polytopes. Furthermore, this polytopal description together with Derksen-Weyman's Saturation Theorem for quiver semi-invariants allows us to use Tardos' algorithm to solve the membership problem for the moment cone associated to $(Q,\beta)$ in strongly polynomial time.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Minimizing Energy Consumption of Partitioning DAG Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a graph partition problem where we are given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose vertices and arcs can be respectively regarded as tasks and dependencies among tasks. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total energy consumed for completing these tasks by assigning the tasks to k heterogeneous machines. We first show that the problem is NP-hard. Then, we present polynomial-time algorithms for two special cases where there are only two machines and where the input DAG is a directed path. Finally, we study a natural variant where there are only two machines with one of them being capable of executing a limited number of tasks. We show that this special case remains computationally hard.</description>

      <title>Orbit-blocking words and the average-case complexity of Whitehead's problem in the free group of rank 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let F_2 denote the free group of rank 2. Our main technical result of independent interest is: for any element u of F_2, there is g in F_2 such that no cyclically reduced image of u under an automorphism of F_2 contains g as a subword. We then address computational complexity of the following version of the Whitehead automorphism problem: given a fixed u in F_2, decide, on an input v in F_2 of length n, whether or not v is an automorphic image of u. We show that there is an algorithm that solves this problem and has constant (i.e., independent of n) average-case complexity.</description>
