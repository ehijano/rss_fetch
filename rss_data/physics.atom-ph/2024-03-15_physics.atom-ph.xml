      <title>Radiative lifetime of the A 2{\Pi}1/2 state in RaF with relevance to laser cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiative lifetime of the $A$ $^2 \Pi_{1/2}$ (v=0) state in radium monofluoride (RaF) is measured to be 35(1) ns. The lifetime of this state is of relevance to the laser cooling of RaF via the optically closed $A$ $^2 \Pi_{1/2} \leftarrow X$ $^2\Sigma_{1/2}$ transition, which is an advantageous aspect of the molecule for its promise as a probe for new physics. The radiative decay rate $\Gamma = 2.9(2)\times 10^7$ s$^{-1}$ is extracted using the lifetime, which determines the natural linewidth of 4.6(3) MHz and the maximum photon scattering rate of $4.1(3)\times 10^6$ s$^{-1}$ of the laser-cooling transition. RaF is thus found to have a comparable photon-scattering rate with other laser-cooled molecules, while thanks to its highly diagonal Franck-Condon matrix it is expected to scatter an order of magnitude more photons when using 3 cooling lasers before it decays to a dark state. The lifetime measurement in RaF is benchmarked by measuring the lifetime of the $8P_{3/2}$ state in Fr to be 83(3) ns, in agreement with literature.</description>

      <title>Measuring the molecular Migdal effect with neutron scattering on diatomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Migdal effect is a key inelastic signal channel which could be used to detect low-mass dark matter, but it has never been observed experimentally using Standard Model probes. Here we propose an experiment which could detect the Migdal effect in diatomic molecules through low-energy neutron scattering. The enhancement of the Migdal rate through non-adiabatic couplings, which are absent in isolated atoms, combined with the distinctive photon energies of electronic transitions in CO, suggest that a positive detection of the molecular Migdal effect may be possible with modest beam times at existing neutron facilities.</description>

      <title>Error analysis in large area multi-Raman pulse atom interferometry due to undesired spontaneous decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the fact that atom interferometry has been a successful application of quantum sensing, a major topic of interest is the further improvement of the sensitivity of these devices. In particular, the area enclosed by the interferometer (which controls the sensitivity) can be increased by providing a larger momentum kick to the atom cloud, increasing the extent of the momentum axis. One such atom optics technique involves increasing the number of central $\pi-$Raman pulses. This technique, while providing the prerequisite additional momentum boost, also causes the atom to remain in the intermediate high energy state for longer periods of time. This additional length of time is often neglected in many treatments due to the adiabatic elimination of the higher energy state enabled by the large optical detuning. The increased time in the intermediate high energy state results in a higher probability of undesired spontaneous decay and a loss of quantum information, thereby adding error to the atom interferometer. In this work, we consider an open quantum system using the Lindblad master equation to devise a model for the atomic state dynamics that includes the undesired spontaneous decay from the intermediate high energy state. We formulate an error figure of merit to analyze limitations of an atom interferometer configured for acceleration measurements. Our theoretical results show the error figure of merit will be dominated by a $N_{R}^{-2}$ scaling factor for low numbers of $\pi-$Raman pulses, but will be dominated by a monotonic increase in error for high number of $\pi-$Raman pulses. We determined the number of $\pi$-Raman pulses that accomplishes maximal momentum transfer with a the minimal error, depending on major system parameters.</description>

      <title>Stopping mass-selected alkaline-earth metal monofluoride beams of high energy via formation of unusually stable anions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct laser-coolability and a comparatively simple electronic structure render alkaline-earth metal monofluoride molecules versatile laboratories for precision tests of fundamental physics. In this theoretical work, a route for efficient stopping and cooling of high-energy hot beams of mass-selected alkaline-earth metal monofluorides via their anions is explored to facilitate subsequent precision experiments with trapped molecules. It is shown that these molecular anions possess an unusually strong chemical bond and that RaF$^-$ features properties favourable for efficient pre-cooling, indicating the applicability of direct laser-cooling of the anion.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum thermalization restricted to Hilbert space fragments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermalization occurs in a broad class of systems from elementary particles to complex materials. Out-of-equilibrium quantum systems have long been understood to either thermalize or retain memory of their initial states, but not both. Here we achieve the first simultaneous demonstration of thermalization and memory in a quantum system. Using a Rydberg atom array, we observe quantum thermalization restricted to Hilbert space fragments, where the thermalized system retains characteristics of the initial configuration. Intriguingly, states from different subspaces do not thermalize with each other even when they have the same energy. Our work challenges established ideas of quantum thermalization while experimentally resolving the longstanding tension between thermalization and memory. These results may be applied to control entanglement dynamics in quantum processors and quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Competing Interactions in Strongly Driven Multi-Level Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally study the level mixing, splitting and repulsion of an optically driven atomic multi-level system under two competing interactions. The strength of the optical coupling is increased until it surpasses the atomic hyperfine interaction responsible for mixing the magnetic substates. Due to the multi-level character of the coupled state space, the level shifts exhibit complex behavior reminiscent of the Paschen-Back effect. Our results show that multi-level effects can have significant influence for strong external drive, differing from a simple model of effective non-interacting two-level systems. These results highlight the relevance of imperfections of the light polarization or initial state preparation in strongly optically driven systems.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of a trapped atom interferometer with accelerating optical traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to increase the measured phase of an atom interferometer and improve its sensitivity, researchers attempt to increase the enclosed space-time area using two methods: creating larger separations between the interferometer arms and having longer evolution times. However, increasing the evolution time reduces the bandwidth that can be sampled, whereas decreasing the evolution time worsens the sensitivity. In this paper, we attempt to address this by proposing a setup for high-bandwidth applications, with improved overall sensitivity. This is realized by accelerating and holding the atoms using optical dipole traps. We find that accelerations of up to $10^{3}$-$10^{5}$ m/s$^2$ can be achieved using acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) to move the traps. By comparing the sensitivity of our approach to acceleration as a baseline to traditional atom interferometry, we find a substantial improvement to the state of the art. In the limit of appropriate beam and optics stabilization, sensitivities approaching 10$^{-14}$ (m/s$^2$)/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ may be achievable at 1 Hz, while detection at 1 kHz with a sensitivity an order of magnitude better than traditional free-fall atom interferometers is possible with today's systems.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by remarkable properties of superfluid edge dislocations in solid Helium-4, we discuss a broad class of quantum systems -- boundaries in phase separated lattice states, magnetic domain walls, and ensembles of Luttinger liquids -- that can be classified as Transverse Quantum Fluids (TQF). After introducing the general idea of TQF, we focus on a coupled array of Luttinger liquids forming an incoherent TQF. This state is a long-range ordered quasi-one-dimensional superfluid, topologically protected against quantum phase slips by tight-binding of instanton dipoles, that has no coherent quasi-particle excitations at low energies. Incoherent TQF is a striking example of the irrelevance of the Landau quasiparticle criterion for superfluidity in systems that lack Galilean invariance. We detail its phenomenology, to motivate a number of experimental studies in condensed matter and cold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Generation of Picosecond Ion Pulses by Ultrafast Electron-Stimulated Desorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient method to produce laser-triggered proton pulses below 500\,ps pulse width at keV energies. We use femtosecond photoelectron pulses emitted from a cathode to enable ultrafast electron-stimulated desorption of adsorbates on a stainless steel plate under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. While direct photoionization of atoms to form well-timed ion pulses can suffer from a laser-focus-limited large starting volume, in our method the starting plane of the ions is defined with nanometer precision at a solid surface. We clearly outline how the method could be used in the future to efficiently produce ion beam pulses in the (sub-)picosecond range for pump-probe experiments with ions.</description>

      <title>Broadband near-ultraviolet dual comb spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The highly energetic photons of ultraviolet light drive electronic and rovibronic transitions in all molecular species. This radiation is thus a prime tool for strongly selective spectroscopic fingerprinting and real-time environmental monitoring if broad spectral coverage, short acquisition times and high spectral resolution is achieved - requirements that are in mutual competition in traditional applications. As a novel approach with intrinsic potency in all three aspects, here we introduce ultraviolet dual comb spectroscopy using two broadband ultraviolet frequency combs centered at 871 THz and covering a spectral bandwidth of 35.7 THz. Within a 100 us acquisition time window, we obtain rotational state-resolved absorption spectra of formaldehyde, a prototype molecule with high relevance for laser spectroscopy and environmental sciences. This is the first realization of broadband dual comb spectroscopy in the ultraviolet spectral region and a pioneering tool to allow for real-time monitoring of rovibronic transitions.</description>

      <title>Long-lived collective Rydberg excitations in atomic gas achieved via ac-Stark lattice modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective Rydberg excitations provide promising applications ranging from quantum information processing, and quantum computing to ultra-sensitive electrometry. However, their short lifetime is an immense obstacle in real-life scenarios. The state-of-the-art methods of prolonging the lifetime were mainly implemented for ground-state quantum memories and would require a redesign to effectively work on different atomic transitions. We propose a protocol for extending the Rydberg excitation lifetime, which in principle can freeze the spin-wave and completely cancel the effects of thermal dephasing. The protocol employs off-resonant ac-Stark lattice modulation of spin waves by interfering two laser beams on the atomic medium. Our implementation showed that the excitation lifetime can be extended by an order of magnitude, paving the way towards more complex protocols for collective Rydberg excitations.</description>
