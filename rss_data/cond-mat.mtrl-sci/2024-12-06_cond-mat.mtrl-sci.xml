      <title>Quantum Theory of X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing quantum materials is essential for understanding their microscopic interactions and advancing quantum technology. X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) with coherent X-ray sources offers access to higher-order correlations, but its theoretical basis, the Siegert relation, is derived from dynamical light scattering with independent classical scatterers, and its validity for XPCS remains unexamined. Here we present a microscopic quantum theory of XPCS derived from elecron-photon interaction Hamiltonians, introducing four configurations tied to distinct fourth-order electron-density correlation functions. We examine the validity of the Siegert relation and derive a generalized Siegert relation. Notably, the Siegert relation breaks down even in non-interacting Fermi gas due to exchange interactions. Furthermore, density matrix renormalization group calculations on 1D Kitaev chain reveal oscillatary signatures that can distinguish topologically trivial phases from topological phases with Majorana zero modes. Our work provides a robust theoretical foundation for XPCS and highlights the value of higher-order correlations in advanced X-ray and neutron sources for probing quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Performance-driven Computational Design of Multi-terminal Compositionally Graded Alloy Structures using Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial control of material placement afforded by metal additive manufacturing (AM) has enabled significant progress in the development and implementation of compositionally graded alloys (CGAs) for spatial property variation in monolithic structures. However, cracking and brittle phase formation have hindered CGA development, with limited research extending beyond materials design to structural design. Notably, the high-dimensional alloy design space (systems with more than three active elements) remains poorly understood, specifically for CGAs. As a result, many prior efforts take a trial-and-error approach. Additionally, current structural design methods are inadequate for joining dissimilar alloys. In light of these challenges, recent work in graph information modeling and design automation has enabled topological partitioning and analysis of the alloy design space, automated design of multi-terminal CGAs, and automated conformal mapping of CGAs onto corresponding structural geometries. In comparison, prior gradient design approaches are limited to two-terminal CGAs. Here, we integrate these recent advancements, demonstrating a unified performance-driven CGA design approach on a gas turbine blade with broader application to other material systems and engineering structures.</description>

      <title>The Role of Chalcogen Vacancies in Single Photon Emission from Monolayer Tungsten Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanism of single photon emission (SPE) in two-dimensional (2D) materials is an unsolved problem important for quantum optical materials and the development of quantum information applications. In 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$), quantum emission has been broadly attributed to exciton localization from atomic point defects, yet the precise microscopic picture is not fully understood. This work presents a new framework, supported by both computational and experimental evidence, to explain both the origins of facile SPE in WSe2 and the relative scarcity of SPE in the related 2D TMD, tungsten disulfide (WS$_2$). A vertical divacancy configuration of selenium creates a defect-centered, direct energy gap in the band structure of WSe2, giving rise to highly localized, radiative transitions. This configuration is shown to be energetically preferred in the monolayer lattice, which is reflected in the abundant experimental observation of SPE in WSe2 both from the literature and this work. In contrast, the same vertical divacancy configuration in WS2 does not create direct localized transitions, consistent with scarce observations of SPE in that material. By revealing a single mechanism in tungsten-based TMDs that addresses the prevalence of SPE and is consistent between theory and experiment, these results provide a framework for better understanding the rules governing the atomic origins of single photon emission in TMDs.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric domain walls for environmental sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain walls in ferroelectric oxides provide fertile ground for the development of next-generation nanotechnology. Examples include domain-wall-based memory, memristors, and diodes, where the unusual electronic properties and the quasi-2D nature of the walls are leveraged to emulate the behavior of electronic components at ultra-small length scales. Here, we demonstrate atmosphere-related reversible changes in the electronic conduction at neutral ferroelectric domain walls in Er(Mn,Ti)O$_3$. By exposing the system to reducing and oxidizing conditions, we drive the domain walls from insulating to conducting, and vice versa, translating the environmental changes into current signals. Density functional theory calculations show that the effect is predominately caused by charge carrier density modulations, which arise as oxygen interstitials accumulate at the domain walls. The work introduces an innovative concept for domain-wall based environmental sensors, giving an additional dimension to the field of domain wall nanoelectronics and sensor technology in general.</description>

      <title>Impact of local structure on melt dynamics in Cu-Ti alloys: Insights from ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principle based molecular-dynamics simulations have been performed for binary Cu$_x$Ti$_{1-x}$ (x = 0.31, 0.50, and 0.76) alloys to investigate the relationship between local structure and dynamical properties in the liquid and undercooled melt. The undercooled melts show a pronounced short-range order, majorly a five-fold symmetry (FFS) around the Cu atoms, which competes with bcc ordering. This complex SRO is also reflected in the partial coordination numbers, where mainly a Z12 coordination is present around Cu, which corresponds to an icosahedral ordering. Higher coordination numbers were obtained for Ti compatible with Frank-Kasper polyhedra. The increasing Frank-Kasper polyhedra coordination scenario around Ti impacts on the interatomic distances of Ti atoms, which increase with increasing Ti content. The Cu$_{50}$Ti$_{50}$ composition exhibits the highest FFS ordering and amount of Frank-Kasper polyhedra, which explains the slowest melt dynamics, found experimentally and in simulations for this composition. Thus, our results suggest that the high undercooling degree and glass-forming ability of binary CuTi alloys, originates from the high complexity of the local structure rather than due to the preferred formation of Cu-Ti pairs, as Cu-Ti interactions were found to be weak.</description>

      <title>Prediction of polarization vortices, charge modulation, flat bands, and moir\'e magnetism in twisted oxide bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent surge of interest in moir\'e superlattices of twisted van der Waals compounds has spotlighted the emergence of unconventional superconductivity and novel electronic phases. However, the range of moir\'e phenomena can be dramatically expanded by incorporating complex oxide materials into twisted heterostructures. In this study, motivated by the recent breakthroughs in synthesis of free-standing oxide membranes, we explore the emergent structural and electronic properties of twisted oxide bilayers. We focus on the classic perovskite oxide, SrTiO3, and design SrTiO3 bilayers with a relative twist between the individual layers. Using density functional theory calculations, we predict the appearance of vortex-antivortex polarization patterns at the interface of the SrTiO3 bilayers driven by twist. We also predict charge modulation of the interfacial Ti ions induced by varying local coordination which follow the moir\'e pattern. Furthermore, we forecast the emergence of flat bands at large twist angles and the associated localized electronic states with moir\'e-periodic charge density, originating from the interlayer bonding effects resulting in the formation of dangling bonds. Finally, we predict that hole doping induces unconventional d0 magnetism in otherwise nonmagnetic SrTiO3, driven by the exchange splitting of the high-density O-p bands and producing the spin density with moir\'e periodicity. These results demonstrate a broad landscape of emergent phenomena which may occur in moir\'e-engineered oxide heterostructures showing far-reaching perspectives of these material systems for further fundamental studies and potential applications.</description>

      <title>Confined Magnetization at the Sublattice-Matched Ruthenium Oxide Heterointerface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating a heterostructure by combining two magnetically and structurally distinct ruthenium oxides is a crucial approach for investigating their emergent magnetic states and interactions. Previously, research has predominantly concentrated on the intrinsic properties of the ferromagnet SrRuO3 and recently discovered altermagnet RuO2 solely. Here, we engineered an ultrasharp sublattice-matched heterointerface using pseudo-cubic SrRuO3 and rutile RuO2, conducting an in-depth analysis of their spin interactions. Structurally, to accommodate the lattice symmetry mismatch, the inverted RuO2 layer undergoes an in-plane rotation of 18 degrees during epitaxial growth on SrRuO3 layer, resulting in an interesting and rotational interface with perfect crystallinity and negligible chemical intermixing. Performance-wise, the interfacial layer of 6 nm in RuO2 adjacent to SrRuO3 exhibits a nonzero magnetic moment, contributing to an enhanced anomalous Hall effect (AHE) at low temperatures. Furthermore, our observations indicate that, in contrast to SrRuO3 single layers, the AHE of [(RuO2)15/(SrRuO3)n] heterostructures shows nonlinear behavior and reaches its maximum when the SrRuO3 thickness reaches tens of nm. These results suggest that the interfacial magnetic interaction surpasses that of all-perovskite oxides (~5-unit cells). This study underscores the significance and potential applications of magnetic interactions based on the crystallographic asymmetric interfaces in the design of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Unified analysis of phase-field models for cohesive fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address in this review unified analysis of phase-field models for cohesive fracture. Aiming to regularize the Barenblatt (1959) cohesive zone model, all the discussed models are distinguished by three characteristic functions, i.e., the geometric function dictating the crack profile, the degradation function for the constitutive relation and the dissipation function defining the crack driving force. The latter two functions coincide in the associated formulation, while in the non-associated one they are designed to be different. Distinct from the counterpart for brittle fracture, in the phase-field model for cohesive fracture the regularization length parameter has to be properly incorporated into the dissipation and/or degradation functions such that the failure strength and traction-separation softening curve are both well-defined. Moreover, the resulting crack bandwidth needs to be non-decreasing during failure in order that imposition of the crack irreversibility condition does not affect the anticipated traction-separation law (TSL). With a truncated degradation function that is proportional to the length parameter, the Conti et al.(2016) model and the latter improved versions can deal with crack nucleation only in the vanishing limit and capture cohesive fracture only with a particular TSL. Owing to a length scale dependent degradation function of rational fraction, these deficiencies are largely overcome in the phase-field cohesive zone model (PF-CZM). Among many variants in the literature, only with the optimal geometric function, can the associated PF-CZM apply to general non-concave softening laws and the non-associated uPF-CZM to (almost) any arbitrary one. Some mis-interpretations are clarified and representative numerical examples are presented.</description>

      <title>Perspective on 2D perovskite ferroelectrics and multiferroics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics and multiferroics have attracted considerable scientific and technological interest in recent years due to the increasing demands for miniaturization and low energy consumption of electronic devices. At present, the research on 2D ferroelectrics and multiferroics is still focused on van der Waals materials, while the known bulk ferroelectric and multiferroic materials are mostly found in perovskite systems. The ability to prepare and transfer 2D perovskite oxides has provided unprecedented opportunities for developing ferroelectrics and multiferroics based on 2D perovskites. In this Perspective, we review the research progress on 2D ferroelectrics and multiferroics in inorganic perovskites in terms of different ferroelectric and magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms. The improper ferroelectricity and novel magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms discovered in 2D perovskites are emphasized, and then, the main challenges and future development direction are put forward.</description>

      <title>Type-II Dirac nodal chain semimetal CrB4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac nodal line semimetals with topologically protected drumhead surface states have attracted intense theoretical and experimental attention over a decade. However, the study of type-II Dirac nodal line semimetals is rare, especially the type-II nodal chain semimetals have not been confirmed by experiment due to the lack of ideal material platform. In this study, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we predict that CrB4 is an ideal type-II Dirac nodal chain semimetal protected by the mirror symmetry. Moreover, there are two nodal rings protected by both space-inversion and time-reversal symmetries in CrB4. More importantly,in CrB4 the topologically protected drumhead surface states span the entire Brillouin zone at the Fermi level. On the other hand, the electron-hole compensation and the high mobility of Dirac fermions can result in large magnetoresistance effects in CrB4 according to the two-band model.Considering the fact that CrB4 has been synthesized experimentally and the spin-orbit coupling is very weak, CrB4 provides an ideal material platform for studying the exotic properties of type-II Dirac nodal chain semimetals in experiment.</description>

      <title>Advanced Design of Self-Healing Dielectric Capacitors: New Universal Concept and Computational Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new computational method is herein discussed to systemize the development of new dielectric capacitor designs. The method predicts the identities and amounts of (1) gaseous products of decomposition, (2) the volume of the emerged solid phase, coined soot, (3) the band gaps of the soot samples, and (4) the electrical conductivity of the soot. The predictions can be made by using electronic-structure methods of atomistic simulations combined with the exploration of the potential energy landscape. The work discusses and rates the relative importance of each of the four introduced descriptors to unequivocally characterize possible capacitor designs. The concept is addressed to researchers working with enhanced energy storage designs and electrical engineers.</description>

      <title>Copper delocalization leads to ultralow thermal conductivity in chalcohalide CuBiSeCl2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed anion halide-chalcogenide materials have attracted considerable attention due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties, making them promising candidates for various applications. Among these, CuBiSeCl_2 has recently been experimentally identified with remarkably low lattice thermal conductivity (k_L). In this study, we employ Wigner transport theory combined with neuroevolution machine learning potential (NEP)-assisted self-consistent phonon calculations to unravel the microscopic origins of this low k_L. Our findings reveal that the delocalization and weak bonding of copper atoms are key contributors to the strong phonon anharmonicity and wavelike tunneling (random walk diffusons). These insights deepen our understanding of the relationship between bonding characteristics, anharmonicity, delocalization, and vibrational dynamics, paving the way for the design and optimization of CuBiSeCl_2 and analogous materials for advanced phonon engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the origin of diffusion suppression of hydrogen isotopes at the {\alpha}-Al2O3(0001)/{\alpha}-Cr2O3(0001) interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been reported that the {\alpha}-Al2O3, a promising tritium permeation barrier material for a fusion reactor, can be grown at low temperatures on the {\alpha}-Cr2O3 template, and that {\alpha}-Al2O3/{\alpha}-Cr2O3 composite films have more efficiently suppress the hydrogen isotope permeation than the single {\alpha}-Al2O3 film. In this study, we investigated the diffusion properties of hydrogen isotopes at the {\alpha}-Al2O3(0001)/{\alpha}-Cr2O3(0001) interfaces using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. In the {\alpha}-Al2O3 region near the interfaces, O-H covalent bonds, which are not observed in the bulk {\alpha}-Al2O3, are formed, and hydrogen isotopes become stable. Such chemical bonds induced by the interfaces are the origin of hydrogen isotope trapping and result in a larger diffusion barrier than in the {\alpha}-Al2O3 and the {\alpha}-Cr2O3. It was also found that the suppression of hydrogen isotope diffusion does not occur at the interface site but at sites adjacent to the interfaces. In addition, the interface enhances the oxygen vacancies, which may also suppress hydrogen isotope permeation.</description>

      <title>Exciton thermalization dynamics in monolayer MoS2: a first-principles Boltzmann equation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding exciton thermalization is critical for optimizing optoelectronic and photocatalytic processes in many materials. However, it is hard to access the dynamics of such processes experimentally, especially on systems such as monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, where various low-energy excitations pathways can compete for exciton thermalization. Here, we study exciton dynamics due to exciton-phonon scattering in monolayer MoS2 from a first-principles, interacting Green's function approach, to obtain the relaxation and thermalization of low-energy excitons following different initial excitations at different temperatures. We find that the thermalization occurs on a picosecond timescale at 300 K but can increase by an order of magnitude at 100 K. The long total thermalization time, owing to the nature of its excitonic band structure, is dominated by slow spin-flip scattering processes in monolayer MoS2. In contrast, thermalization of excitons in individual spin-aligned and spin-anti-aligned channels can be achieved within a few hundred fs when exciting higher-energy excitons. We further simulate the intensity spectrum of time-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES) experiments and anticipate that such calculations may serve as a map to correlate spectroscopic signatures with microscopic exciton dynamics.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional \b{eta}-phase copper iodide: a promising candidate for low-temperature thermoelectric applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth telluride-based materials is the only commercially viable room-temperature thermoelectric material, despite its limited tellurium and poor mechanical properties. The search for materials with a high figure of merit (zT &gt; 1.00) near room temperature remains a major challenge. In this work, we systematically investigate the structural stability and the thermoelectric capabilities of monolayer \b{eta}-CuI and {\gamma}-CuI through the density functional theory (DFT) combined with Boltzmann transport theory. Based on the thermoelectric transport coefficients of monolayer \b{eta}-CuI and {\gamma}-CuI, we predict their zT values will vary with carrier concentration and increase with temperature. Comparing the zT values, monolayer \b{eta}-CuI demonstrates superior thermoelectric properties compared to {\gamma}-CuI. At room temperature, the optimal zT values of monolayer \b{eta}-CuI exceed 1.50, with particularly high values of 2.98 (p-type) and 4.10 (n-type) along the Zigzag direction, demonstrating significant anisotropy. These results suggest the great potential of the monolayer \b{eta}-CuI is promising candidate materials for low temperature thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>GARFIELD, a toolkit for interpreting ultrafast electron diffraction data of imperfect quasi-single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) data from low-symmetry single crystals of small molecules is often challenged by the difficulty of assigning unique Laue indices to the observed Bragg reflections. For a variety of technical and physical reasons, UED diffraction images are typically of lower quality when viewed from the perspective of structure determination by single-crystal X-ray or electron diffraction. Nevertheless, time series of UED images can provide valuable insight into structural dynamics, provided that an adequate interpretation of the diffraction patterns can be achieved. GARFIELD is a collection of tools with a graphical user interface designed to facilitate the interpretation of diffraction patterns and to index Bragg reflections in challenging cases where other indexing tools are ineffective. To this end, GARFIELD enables the user to interactively create, explore, and optimize sets of parameters that define the diffraction geometry and characteristic properties of the sample.</description>

      <title>Four-fold Anisotropic Magnetoresistance in Antiferromagnetic Epitaxial Thin Films of MnPt$_{x}$Pd$_{1-x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets are emerging as promising alternatives to ferromagnets in spintronics applications. A key feature of antiferromagnets is their anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), which has the potential to serve as a sensitive marker for the antiferromagnetic order parameter. However, the underlying origins of this behavior remain poorly understood. In this study, we report the observation of AMR in epitaxial thin films of the collinear L1$_{0}$ antiferromagnet MnPt$_{x}$Pd$_{1-x}$. In thicker films, the AMR is dominated by a non-crystalline two-fold component. As the film thickness is reduced, however, a crystalline four-fold component emerges, accompanied by the appearance of uncompensated magnetic moment, which strongly modifies the magnetotransport properties in the thinner films. We demonstrate that interfacial interactions lead to a large density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level. This enhanced DOS, combined with disorder in thinner films, stabilizes the uncompensated moment and induces a four-fold modulation of the DOS as the Neel vector rotates, explaining the observed AMR behavior.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the mechanisms underlying ultrafast cross-luminescence observed in BaF2 crystals doped with LaF3. We identified an ultrafast luminescent component with a decay time of approximately 150 ps, which emerges under excitation energies exceeding 24 eV as a novel radiative recombination process between electrons in the 5p core band of Ba2+ and holes in the 5p core band of La3+. Ab initio calculations support this hypothesis, showing that the energy levels of the core bands facilitate such transitions. The findings indicate that BaF2-LaF3 scintillators hold significant promise for applications in time-of-flight tomography.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of displacive ferroelectricity: applications to quantum criticality and classical phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate quantitative prediction of the finite-temperature properties of a phase transitioning system has been a long-standing challenge in condensed matter physics and materials science. Here we regard a collective vector mode as essential quasiparticle excitation of the displacive ferroelectricity. Starting from the quantum statistic description of this excitation, we develop a self-consistent, microscopically based phase-transition theory of displacive ferroelectricity. This theory enables one to use only the ground-state properties to predict the finite-temperature properties and in particular, the criticality of phase transitions, in a striking contrast to the widely used Landau-Ginzburg phenomenological description near the critical point. Its applications to the quantum paraelectrics SrTiO$_3$ and KTaO$_3$ as well as the classical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ demonstrate remarkable quantitative agreements with the experimentally measured critical behaviors of the phase transitions and the corresponding dielectric/ferroelectric properties throughout the entire temperature ranges of the phases without fitting parameters. The theory should be general and can be utilized to understand a broad range of phase transitions in other bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>The spin-phonon relaxation mechanism of single-molecule magnets in the presence of strong exchange coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic relaxation in coordination compounds is largely dominated by the interaction of the spin with phonons. Large zero-field splitting and exchange coupling values have been empirically found to strongly suppress spin relaxation and have been used as the main guideline for designing new molecular compounds. Although a comprehensive understanding of spin-phonon relaxation has been achieved for mononuclear complexes, only a qualitative picture is available for polynuclear compounds. Here we fill this critical knowledge gap by providing a full first-principle description of spin-phonon relaxation in an air-stable Co(II) dimer with both large single-ion anisotropy and exchange coupling. Simulations reproduce the experimental relaxation data with excellent accuracy and provide a microscopic understanding of Orbach and Raman relaxation pathways and their dependency on exchange coupling, zero-field splitting, and molecular vibrations. Theory and numerical simulations show that increasing cluster nuclearity to just four cobalt units would lead to a complete suppression of Raman relaxation. These results hold a general validity for single-molecule magnets, providing a deeper understanding of their relaxation and revised strategies for their improvement.</description>

      <title>Sub-diffraction Imaging of Carrier Dynamics in Halide Perovskite Semiconductors: Effects of Passivation, Morphology, and Ion Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We spatially resolve photocarrier dynamics in halide perovskites using time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy (trEFM) to map surface potential equilibration during photoexcitation. Following treatment with different surface passivation agents, we show that trEFM probes dynamics directly related to surface recombination velocity and carrier lifetimes correlated with time-resolved photoluminescence. Our results reveal nanoscale variations in recombination dynamics following surface passivation. We also observe heterogeneity in surface potential equilibration times dependent on perovskite film morphology. We combine wavelength- and intensity-dependent measurements with drift-diffusion simulations to disentangle the influence of carrier recombination and ion migration on surface potential equilibration. These results demonstrate that we can use mechanical detection to image electronic carrier recombination dynamics in perovskites below the optical diffraction limit while also showing the potential for future improvements in heterogeneity of surface passivation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importance of simple geometrical invariants, such as the Berry curvature and quantum metric, constructed from the Bloch states of a crystal has become well-established over four decades of research. More complex aspects of geometry emerge in properties linking multiple bands, such as optical responses. In the companion work [arXiv:2409.16358], we identified novel multi-state geometrical invariants using an explicitly gauge-invariant formalism based on projection operators, which we used to clarify the relation between the shift current and the theory of electronic polarization among other advancements for second-order non-linear optics. Here, we provide considerably more detail on the projector formalism and the geometrical invariants arising in the vicinity of a specific value of crystal momentum. We combine the introduction to multi-state quantum geometry with broadly relevant algebraic relationships and detailed example calculations, enabling extensions toward future applications to topological and geometrical properties of insulators and metals.</description>

      <title>Itinerant Ferromagnetism from One-Dimensional Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a universal kinetic mechanism for a half-metallic ferromagnet -- a metallic state with full spin polarization -- arising from strong on-site Coulomb repulsions between particles that exhibit constrained one-dimensional (1D) dynamics. We illustrate the mechanism in the context of a solvable model on a Lieb lattice in which doped electrons have 1D mobility. Such 1D motion is shown to induce only multi-spin ring exchanges of even parity, which mediate ferromagnetism and result in a unique half-metallic ground state. In contrast to the Nagaoka mechanism of ferromagnetism, this result pertains to any doped electron density in the {\it thermodynamic} limit. We explore various microscopic routes to such (approximate) 1D dynamics, highlighting two examples: doped holes in the strong-coupling limit of the Emery model and vacancies in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. Finally, we demonstrate an intriguing exact equivalence between the bosonic and fermionic versions of these models, which implies a novel mechanism for the conjectured Bose metallic phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a graphene derivative displaying novel topological phenomena without the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a collinear altermagnet. By investigating the retarded and advanced Green's functions, we calculate the spectral density and amplitude of wave function whose exact solutions are analytically obtained. The altermagnetism breaks the intrinsic time-reversal symmetry, guaranteeing the formation of pairs of Weyl points associated with the internal spin structure chiralities. We demonstrate the evolution of Dirac and Weyl crossings, in which spontaneous Hall effect is controlled by the chiral edge modes. Topological phase transitions are characterized by the high Chern numbers preserving the non-intersecting flows of Wannier centers over occupied bands. We illustrate possible experiments to realize topologically altermagnetic responses according to the bulk-boundary correspondence.</description>

Abstract: Van der Waals magnets are an emerging material family for investigating light-matter interactions and spin-correlated excitations. Here, we report the discovery of a photo-induced state with a lifetime of 17 ps in the van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$, which appears exclusively with resonant pumping at 1.476 eV in the antiferromagnetic state. The long-lived state comes with a negative photoconductivity, a characteristic optical response of population inversion. Our findings demonstrate a promising pathway to potentially achieve long-lived lasing at terahertz frequencies in reduced dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite materials are highly promising for a range of optoelectronic applications including energy conversion technologies, owing to their high charge-carrier mobilities, adaptability of bandgap tuning, and exceptional light-harvesting capabilities. Yet, defects that arise during manufacturing often lead to performance limitations such as hindered efficiency and stability. This is primarily due to significant deviations in crystal geometry and band structure elements such as the Fermi level, work function, and density of states, compared to pristine perovskite. To mitigate these issues, this study explored the passivation of surface iodide-vacancy defect in perovskite using small-molecule Lewis bases, an approach aims to counteract these detrimental effects. Among the examined N-, P- and O-coordinated benzyl derivatives, those featuring a phosphonic acid group as a passivator for the undercoordinated Pb(II) sites demonstrated outstanding electronic structure properties. This was notably achieved by lowering the Fermi level, increasing the work function, and suppressing surface trap states. The effective restoration of electronic properties achieved by targeted small molecule passivation provides crucial insights into enhanced functionality and efficiency for defect perovskite materials.</description>

      <title>Wall Slip Effects on Parameter Estimation for Integral-Type Viscoelastic Models: Insights from High Density Polyethylene and Thermoplastic Elastomer Melts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of wall slip on parameter estimation for integral-type non-linear viscoelastic models with time-strain separable memory functions, specifically examining high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) melts. Significant wall slip was observed in HDPE under non-linear conditions, complicating the characterization of its damping function using step strain data. In contrast, TPE exhibited negligible wall slip across a wide range of strains and shear rates, facilitating successful parameterization of its damping function using the Wagner-type K-BKZ equation and enabling accurate predictions of various material functions. For HDPE, the study investigated alternative approaches to parameterize the K-BKZ equation, including the use of steady and time-dependent material functions at low deformation rates where wall slip effects are minimal. The findings underscore the challenges of estimating parameters in the presence of wall slip and propose strategies to address these challenges, particularly for materials like HDPE, where pronounced slip complicates traditional rheological characterization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ongoing demand for more energy-efficient, high-performance electronics is driving the exploration of innovative materials and device architectures, where interfaces play a crucial role due to the continuous downscaling of device dimensions. Tellurium (Te), in its two-dimensional (2D) form, offers significant potential due to its high carrier mobility and ambipolar characteristics, with the carrier type easily tunable via surface modulation. In this study, we leverage atomically controlled material transformations in 2D Te to create intimate junctions, enabling near-ideal field-effect transistors (FETs) for both n-type and p-type operation. A NiTex-Te contact provides highly transparent interfaces, resulting in low contact resistance, while the TiOx-Te gate dielectric forms an ultraclean interface with a capacitance equivalent to 0.88 nm equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), where the quantum capacitance of Te is observed. Subthreshold slopes (SS) approach the Boltzmann limit, with a record-low SS of 3.5 mV/dec achieved at 10 K. Furthermore, we demonstrate 2D Te-based complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) inverters operating at an ultralow voltage of 0.08 V with a voltage gain of 7.1 V/V. This work presents a promising approach to forming intimate dielectric/semiconductor and metal/semiconductor junctions for next-generation low-power electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Coactive-Staggered Feature in Weyl Materials for Enhancing the Anomalous Nernst Conductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power generation through the anomalous Nernst effect in topological Weyl materials has several advantages over conventional thermoelectrics due to the transverse geometry. However, the magnitude of the anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) in most known materials is too small to be of practical use, and there exist few guiding principles for finding materials with optimal thermoelectric properties. This work shows that the ANC is maximal when there is a ``coactive-staggered" feature in the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). It is shown that a minimal arrangement of two Weyl pairs leads to such a feature, and tuning the separations between the pairs controls the temperature at which the ANC is maximal. Several methods are proposed for creating such arrangements of Weyl points starting from Dirac semimetal materials. It is also demonstrated how an existing coactive-staggered AHC in a Heusler material can be exploited, by collectively tuning the positions of the Weyl points through strain to further enhance the ANC. A modest 20% amplification of the ANC is achieved, even with relatively minor changes in Weyl point positions.</description>

Abstract: Tunable quantum materials hold great potential for applications. Of special interest are materials in which small lattice strain induces giant electronic responses. The kagome compounds AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) provide a testbed for such singular electronic states. In this study, through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we provide comprehensive spectroscopic measurements of the giant responses induced by compressive and tensile strains on the charge-density-wave (CDW) order parameter and high-order van Hove singularity (HO-VHS) in CsV3Sb5. We observe a tripling of the CDW gap magnitudes with ~1% strain, accompanied by the changes of both energy and mass of the saddle-point fermions. Our results reveal an anticorrelation between the unconventional CDW order parameter and the mass of a HO-VHS, and highlight the role of the latter in the superconducting pairing. The giant electronic responses uncover a rich strain tunability of the versatile kagome system in studying quantum interplays under lattice perturbations.</description>

      <title>How Graph Neural Network Interatomic Potentials Extrapolate: Role of the Message-Passing Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural network interatomic potentials (GNN-IPs) are gaining significant attention due to their capability of learning from large datasets. Specifically, universal interatomic potentials based on GNN, usually trained with crystalline geometries, often exhibit remarkable extrapolative behavior towards untrained domains, such as surfaces or amorphous configurations. However, the origin of this extrapolation capability is not well understood. This work provides a theoretical explanation of how GNN-IPs extrapolate to untrained geometries. First, we demonstrate that GNN-IPs can capture non-local electrostatic interactions through the message-passing algorithm, as evidenced by tests on toy models and DFT data. We find that GNN-IP models, SevenNet and MACE, accurately predict electrostatic forces in untrained domains, indicating that they have learned the exact functional form of the Coulomb interaction. Based on these results, we suggest that the ability to learn non-local electrostatic interactions, coupled with the embedding nature of GNN-IPs, explains their extrapolation ability. We find that the universal GNN-IP, SevenNet-0, effectively infers non-local Coulomb interactions in untrained domains but fails to extrapolate the non-local forces arising from the kinetic term, which supports the suggested theory. Finally, we address the impact of hyperparameters on the extrapolation performance of universal potentials, such as SevenNet-0 and MACE-MP-0, and discuss the limitations of the extrapolation capabilities.</description>

      <title>Magnetic ground state of monolayer CeI$_{2}$: occupation matrix control and DFT+U calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic ground state is crucial for the applications of the two-dimension magnets as it decides fundamental magnetic properties of the material, such as magnetic order, magnetic transition temperature, and low-energy excitation of the spin waves. However, the simulations for magnetism of local-electron systems are challenging due to the existence of metastable states. In this study, occupation matrix control (OMC) and density functional theory plus Hubbard $U$ calculations are applied to investigate the magnetic ground state of monolayer CeI$_{2}$. Following the predicted ferromagnetic (FM) order, the FM ground state and the FM metastable states are identified and found to have different values of the magnetic parameters. Based on the calculated magnetic parameters of the FM ground state, the Curie temperature is estimated to be $128$ K for monolayer CeI$_{2}$. When spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is considered, the FM ground state is further confirmed to contain both off-plane and in-plane components of magnetization. SOC is shown to be essential for reasonably describing not only magnetic anisotropy but also local electronic orbital state of monolayer CeI$_{2}$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic spectroscopy of ferromagnetic materials by representing the differential susceptibility as a sum of Lorentzians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The idea to extract information on magnetically different phases from magnetic measurements is very attractive and many efforts have been made in this area. One of the most popular direction is to use the Preisach model formalism to analyze the 2D Preisach distribution function (PDF) obtained either from first order reversal curves (FORC) or minor loops. Here we present an alternative a much simpler procedure - the analysis of the derivative of the saturation magnetization loop, the differential susceptibility curve. It follows the Lorentzian shape with very high accuracy for ferromagnetic polycrystalline materials. This allows decomposing any differential susceptibility curve of a complex multi-phase material into individual components representing different magnetic phases by Lorenzian peaks - in the same way as it is done in X-ray analysis of materials. We show that the minor differential susceptibility curves also have the Lorenzian shape that can facilitate calculation of the Preisach distribution function from the experimental curves and reduce noise in the resulting PDF.</description>

      <title>Analytical Green's Function of Multidimensional Boltzmann Transport Equation for Modeling Hydrodynamic Second Sound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic second sound can be generated by heat pulses when the phonon-phonon interaction is dominantly momentum conserving, and the propagation of the temperature field becomes wavelike rather than diffusive. While the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) has been widely applied to study phonon dynamics and thermal transport at the nanoscale, modeling the hydrodynamic transport regime remains challenging. The widely used relaxation time approximation (RTA) treats all phonon interactions as resistive without considering momentum conservation, resulting in the absence of phonon hydrodynamics. Rigorously solving BTE by inverting the full scattering matrix, however, is extremely computationally demanding and has been only applied to model one-dimensional temperature variations. Here, we present an analytical Green's function formalism for solving multidimensional Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) using phonon properties from first-principles calculations. This formalism involves Callaway's scattering approximation with separate relaxation times for momentum-conserving and momentum-destroying scattering events. The Green's function captures phonon dynamics in a wide range of temperature, spatial, and temporal scales, and successfully reproduces the transition from ballistic, hydrodynamic, to diffusive transport regimes. Our method avoids the computationally demanding inversion of large scattering matrices and shows good accuracies in predicting the temperature oscillation in ultrafast pump-probe characterizations with different geometries of thermal excitation.</description>

      <title>DFT and Model Hamiltonian Study of Optoelectronic Properties of Some Low-Symmetry Graphene Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the electronic and optical properties of three low-symmetry graphene quantum dots (GQDs), with the point-group symmetries $C_{2v}$, and $C_{2h}$. For the calculations of linear optical absorption spectra, we employed both the first-principles time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT), and the electron-correlated Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) model coupled with the configuration-interaction (CI) approach. In the PPP-CI approach, calculations were performed using both screened and standard parameters, along with efficiently incorporating electron correlation effects using multi-reference singles-doubles configuration-interaction for both ground and excited states. We assume that the GQDs are saturated by hydrogen atoms at the edges, making them effectively polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) dibenzo[bc,ef]coronene (also known as benzo(1,14)bisanthene, C$_{30}$H$_{14}$), and two isomeric compounds, dinaphtho[8,1,2abc;2,1,8klm]coronene and dinaphtho[8,1,2abc;2,1,8jkl]coronene with the chemical formula C$_{36}$H$_{16}$. The two isomers have different point group symmetries, therefore, this study will also help us understand the influence of symmetry on optical properties. A common feature of the absorption spectra of the three GQDs is that the first peak representing the optical gap is of low to moderate intensity, while the intense peaks appear at higher energies. For each GQD, PPP model calculations performed with the screened parameters agree well with the experimental results of the corresponding PAH, and also with the TDDFT calculations. To further quantify the influence of electron-correlation effects, we also computed the singlet-triplet gap (spin gap) of the three GQDs, and we found them to be significant.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions of correlated systems from graph neural networks with quantum embedding techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlated systems represent a class of materials that are difficult to describe through traditional electronic structure methods. The computational demand to simulate the structural dynamics of such systems, with correlation effects considered, is substantial. Here, we investigate the structural dynamics of $f$- and $d$-electron correlated systems by integrating quantum embedding techniques with interatomic potentials derived from graph neural networks. For Cerium, a prototypical correlated $f$-electron system, we use Density Functional Theory with the Gutzwiller approximation to generate training data due to efficiency with which correlations effects are included for large multi-orbital systems. For Nickel Oxide, a prototypical correlated $d$-electron system, advancements in computational capabilities now permit the use of full Dynamical Mean Field Theory to obtain energies and forces. We train neural networks on this data to create a model of the potential energy surface, enabling rapid and effective exploration of structural dynamics. Utilizing these potentials, we delineate transition pathways between the $\alpha$, $\alpha'$, and $\alpha''$ phases of Cerium and predict the melting curve of Nickel Oxide. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning potentials to accelerate the study of strongly correlated systems, offering a scalable approach to explore and understand the complex physics governing these materials.</description>

Abstract: Floquet engineering of topological phase transitions driven by a high-frequency time-periodic field is a promising approach to realizing new topological phases of matter distinct from static states. Here, we theoretically investigate Floquet engineering topological phase transitions in the quantum spin Hall $\alpha$-$T_{3}$ system driven by an off-resonant circularly polarized light. In addition to the quantum spin (anomalous) Hall insulator phase with multiple helical (chiral) edge states, spin-polarized topological metallic phases are observed, where the bulk topological band gap of one spin sub-band overlaps with the other gapless spin sub-band. Moreover, with a staggered potential, the topological invariants of the system depend on whether the middle band is occupied because of the breaking of symmetry with respect to the center of energy-momentum plane. Our work highlights the significance of Floquet engineering in realizing new topological phases in $\alpha$-$T_{3}$ lattices.</description>

      <title>Theory of magnetism for rare-earth magnets on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice with non-Kramers ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the rapid experimental progress on the rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland lattice magnets, we propose a generic effective spin model that describes interacting non-Kramers local moments on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice. We point out that the local moments consist of both magnetic dipole and quadrupole components and the effective model turns out to be an extended XYZ model with an intrinsic field that accounts for the crystal field splitting. We then study the ground-state phase diagram of the model and find that pure quadrupole orders, which are invisible to conventional experimental probes, can be stabilized over a broad regime. In particular, we show that a hidden ``1/3 magnetization plateau'' with quadrupole orders generally exists and discuss its experimental signatures. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our results to the rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland lattice magnets Pr$_{2}$Ga$_{2}$BeO$_{7}$ and Pr$_{2}$Be$_{2}$GeO$_{7}$.</description>
