      <title>Faraday patterns, spin textures, spin-spin correlations and competing instabilities in a driven spin-1 antiferromagnetic Bose-Einstein condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of transient Faraday patterns and spin textures in driven quasi-one-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates under the periodic modulation of $s$-wave scattering lengths $a_0$ and $a_2$, starting from the anti-ferromagnetic phase. This phase is characterized by a Bogoliubov spectrum consisting of three modes: one mode is gapped, while the other two are gapless. When $a_0$ is modulated and half of the modulation frequency lies below the gapped mode, density and spin Faraday patterns emerge. In that case, in quasi-one-dimension, the spin texture is characterized by periodic domains of opposite $z$-polarizations. When driven above the gap, the spin texture is characterized by random orientations of spin vectors along the condensate axis. Qualitatively new features appear in the driven quasi-two-dimensional condensate. For instance, when driven above the gap, the spin textures are characterized by anomalous vortices and antivortices that do not exhibit phase winding in individual magnetic components. Below the gap, the spin texture exhibits irregular ferromagnetic patches with opposite polarizations. The spatial spin-spin correlations in quasi-one-dimension exhibit a Gaussian envelope, whereas they possess a Bessel function dependence in quasi-two-dimension. Under the $a_2$-modulation, the density patterns dominate irrespective of the driving frequency, unless the spin-dependent interaction strength is sufficiently smaller than that of the spin-independent interaction. The intriguing scenario of competing instability can emerge when both scattering lengths are simultaneously modulated. Finally, we show that the competing instabilities result in a complex relationship between the population transfer and the strength of the quadratic Zeeman field, while keeping all other parameters constant.</description>

      <title>Self-trapping and skin solitons in two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional non-Hermitian photonic lattices with asymmetric couplings offer rich possibilities for controlling wave localization, through the emergence of the non-Hermitian skin effect at lattice corners or sides. Incorporating optical nonlinearity fundamentally alters these boundary-localization characteristics. Here we show that in a two-dimensional Hatano-Nelson lattice with Kerr nonlinearity, the interplay between self-trapping and directional propagation leads to position dependent amplitude thresholds. Single-site excitations having above a critical amplitude become confined to their initial position, with lower thresholds near the position where the linear eigenmodes are localized and higher thresholds within the lattice's bulk. Additionally, we study the differences of this dynamical interplay, for wider initial excitations, between the focusing and defocusing Kerr-nonlinearity regimes. Lastly, we identify skin soliton solutions in a variety of two-dimensional lattice geometries featuring coupling asymmetry.</description>
