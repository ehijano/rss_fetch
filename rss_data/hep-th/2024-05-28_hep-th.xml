      <title>Spindle black holes and theories of class $\mathcal{F}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct solutions in the form of $AdS_2\times\Sigma$, where $\Sigma$ denotes a spindle geometry, within a particular 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauged supergravity with vector multiplets and a charged hypermultiplet stemming from a consistent truncation of 6d matter coupled $F(4)$ gauged supergravity on a Riemann surface. We also compute the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for the presumed asymptotically $AdS_4$ black hole solutions, providing a dual prediction for the spindle index of 3d superconformal field theories falling under the class $\mathcal{F}$. Notably, the gravitational block description of the solutions accurately replicates the entropy and the values of scalar fields at the two orbifold points of the spindle, validating our findings.</description>

      <title>Bayesian RG Flow in Neural Network Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Neural Network Field Theory correspondence (NNFT) is a mapping from neural network (NN) architectures into the space of statistical field theories (SFTs). The Bayesian renormalization group (BRG) is an information-theoretic coarse graining scheme that generalizes the principles of the Exact Renormalization Group (ERG) to arbitrarily parameterized probability distributions, including those of NNs. In BRG, coarse graining is performed in parameter space with respect to an information-theoretic distinguishability scale set by the Fisher information metric. In this paper, we unify NNFT and BRG to form a powerful new framework for exploring the space of NNs and SFTs, which we coin BRG-NNFT. With BRG-NNFT, NN training dynamics can be interpreted as inducing a flow in the space of SFTs from the information-theoretic `IR' $\rightarrow$ `UV'. Conversely, applying an information-shell coarse graining to the trained network's parameters induces a flow in the space of SFTs from the information-theoretic `UV' $\rightarrow$ `IR'. When the information-theoretic cutoff scale coincides with a standard momentum scale, BRG is equivalent to ERG. We demonstrate the BRG-NNFT correspondence on two analytically tractable examples. First, we construct BRG flows for trained, infinite-width NNs, of arbitrary depth, with generic activation functions. As a special case, we then restrict to architectures with a single infinitely-wide layer, scalar outputs, and generalized cos-net activations. In this case, we show that BRG coarse-graining corresponds exactly to the momentum-shell ERG flow of a free scalar SFT. Our analytic results are corroborated by a numerical experiment in which an ensemble of asymptotically wide NNs are trained and subsequently renormalized using an information-shell BRG scheme.</description>

      <title>Charting the Conformal Manifold of Holographic CFT$_2$'s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct new continuous families of ${\rm AdS}_3\times S^3\times {\rm T}^4$ and ${\rm AdS}_3\times S^3\times S^3\times S^1$ solutions in heterotic and type II supergravities. These families are found in three-dimensional consistent truncations and controlled by 17 parameters, which include TsT $\beta$ deformations and encompass several supersymmetric sub-families. The different uplifts are constructed in a unified fashion by means of Exceptional Field Theory (ExFT). This allows the computation of the Kaluza-Klein spectra around the deformations, to test the stability of the solutions, and to interpret them holographically and as worldsheet models. To achieve this, we describe how the half-maximal ${\rm SO}(8,8)$ ExFT can be embedded into ${\rm E}_{8(8)}$ ExFT.</description>

      <title>Complexity is not Enough for Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical generation of randomness in Brownian systems as a function of the degree of locality of the Hamiltonian. We first express the trace distance to a unitary design for these systems in terms of an effective equilibrium thermal partition function, and provide a set of conditions that guarantee a linear time to design. We relate the trace distance to design to spectral properties of the time-evolution operator. We apply these considerations to the Brownian $p$-SYK model as a function of the degree of locality $p$. We show that the time to design is linear, with a slope proportional to $1/p$. We corroborate that when $p$ is of order the system size this reproduces the behavior of a completely non-local Brownian model of random matrices. For the random matrix model, we reinterpret these results from the point of view of classical Brownian motion in the unitary manifold. Therefore, we find that the generation of randomness typically persists for exponentially long times in the system size, even for systems governed by highly non-local time-dependent Hamiltonians. We conjecture this to be a general property: there is no efficient way to generate approximate Haar random unitaries dynamically, unless a large degree of fine-tuning is present in the ensemble of time-dependent Hamiltonians. We contrast the slow generation of randomness to the growth of quantum complexity of the time-evolution operator. Using known bounds on circuit complexity for unitary designs, we obtain a lower bound determining that complexity grows at least linearly in time for Brownian systems. We argue that these bounds on circuit complexity are far from tight and that complexity grows at a much faster rate, at least for non-local systems.</description>

      <title>A black hole effective theory for strongly interacting matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a new tool for studying strongly coupled matter: an effective theory of black holes in gravity, which maps to a hydrodynamic description of field theories via the gauge-gravity duality. Our approach is inspired by previously known effective theories found in the limit of high number of dimensions. We argue that the new approach can accurately describe phase transitions in a wide class of theories, such as the Yang-Mills and other nearly critical field theories. As an application, we analyze the interface between confining and deconfining phases in holographic Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>New horizon symmetries, hydrodynamics, and quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the formulation of horizon symmetries presented in previous literature to include diffeomorphisms that can shift the location of the horizon. In the context of the AdS/CFT duality, we show that horizon symmetries can be interpreted on the boundary as emergent low-energy gauge symmetries. In particular, we identify a new class of horizon symmetries that extend the so-called shift symmetry, which was previously postulated for effective field theories of maximally chaotic systems. Additionally, we comment on the connections of horizon symmetries with bulk calculations of out-of-time-ordered correlation functions and the phenomenon of pole-skipping.</description>

      <title>Angular fractals in thermal QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that thermal effective field theory controls the long-distance expansion of the partition function of a $d$-dimensional QFT, with an insertion of any finite-order spatial isometry. Consequently, the thermal partition function on a sphere displays a fractal-like structure as a function of angular twist, reminiscent of the behavior of a modular form near the real line. As an example application, we find that for CFTs, the effective free energy of even-spin minus odd-spin operators at high temperature is smaller than the usual free energy by a factor of $1/2^d$. Near certain rational angles, the partition function receives subleading contributions from "Kaluza-Klein vortex defects" in the thermal EFT, which we classify. We illustrate our results with examples in free and holographic theories, and also discuss nonperturbative corrections from worldline instantons.</description>

      <title>Estimating Quantum Gravity Corrections to Correlators near Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the size of quantum gravity effects near black hole horizons. By considering black holes in asymptotically AdS spacetime, we can make use of the "quantum deviation" to estimate the size of quantum gravity corrections to the semiclassical analysis. We find that, in a typical pure state, corrections to correlation functions are typically of order exp(-S/2). Both the magnitude and time dependence of the correlator differ from previous results related to the spectral form factor, which estimated the correlator in a thermal state. Our results severely constrain proposals, such as non-violent unitarization and some versions of fuzzballs, that predict significant corrections to the semiclassical computation of correlation functions near black holes. We point out one possible loophole: our results rely on the standard result that bulk reconstruction is state independent for small perturbations outside the black hole.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Charge Constraints on AdS Black Holes from Free Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetric AdS black hole solutions exist only when their angular momenta and charges satisfy a certain constraint that depends on the dimension. We show that these nonlinear relations on the conserved charges agree with a computation in the dual supersymmetric CFT in its free limit, with interactions entering only through a uniform rescaling of all charges. Our computations apply to the highly non-trivial charge constraints for AdS$_4$, AdS$_5$ and AdS$_7$ black holes, and generalize an earlier one for the analogous constraint in AdS$_3$. Our results suggest a microscopic understanding of AdS black holes beyond the scope of supersymmetric indices.</description>

      <title>Chiral shift symmetries as an infinite tower of subleading super-shift symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral shift symmetries of the massless free bosons in two dimensions are global symmetries that are somewhat similar to asymptotic symmetries. They are most transparent in double-null coordinates where they are parametrized by two functions of one variable. In BMS-type coordinates, half of them appear as an infinite tower of sub-leading super-shift symmetries.</description>

      <title>Defining Root-$T\overline{T}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a tentative definition of the recently introduced Root-$T\bar{T}$ operator in a generic, two dimensional quantum conformal field theory with continuous spectrum of scaling weights. The definition assumes certain factorization properties and uses Schwinger parametrization to introduce the square root. The properties of the operator thus defined is investigated by explicit computation of variations o two- and three-point correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Free scalar field theory on a Sobolev space over a bounded interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses several functional analytic issues relevant for field theories in the context of the Hamiltonian formulation for a free, massless, scalar field defined on a closed interval of the real line. The fields that we use belong to a Sobolev space with a scalar product. As we show this choice is useful because it leads to an explicit representation of the points in the fibers of the phase space (the cotangent bundle of the configuration space). The dynamical role of the boundary of the spatial manifold where the fields are defined is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Lifshitz Fermion Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the static entanglement structure in (1+1)-dimensional free Dirac-fermion theory with Lifshitz symmetry and arbitrary integer dynamical critical exponent. This model is different from the one introduced in [Hartmann et al., SciPost Phys. 11, no.2, 031 (2021)] due to a proper treatment of the square Laplace operator. Dirac fermion Lifshitz theory is local as opposed to its scalar counterpart which strongly affects its entanglement structure. We show that there is quantum entanglement across arbitrary subregions in various pure (including the vacuum) and mixed states of this theory for arbitrary integer values of the dynamical critical exponent. Our numerical investigations show that quantum entanglement in this theory is tightly bounded from above. Such a bound and other physical properties of quantum entanglement are carefully explained from the correlation structure in these theories. A generalization to (2+1)-dimensions where the entanglement structure is seriously different is addressed.</description>

      <title>One-form symmetries and the 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $A$-model: Topologically twisted indices for any $G$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons-matter gauge theories with a one-form symmetry in the $A$-model formalism on $\Sigma_g\times S^1$. We explicitly compute expectation values of topological line operators that implement the one-form symmetry. This allows us to compute the topologically twisted index on the closed Riemann surface $\Sigma_g$ for any real compact gauge group $G$. All computations are carried out in the effective $A$-model on $\Sigma_g$, whose ground states are the so-called Bethe vacua. We discuss how the 3d one-form symmetry acts on the Bethe vacua, and how its 't Hooft anomaly constrains the vacuum structure. In the special case of the $SU(N)_K$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons theory, we obtain results for the $(SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_r)^{\theta}_K$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons theories, for all non-anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_r \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_N$ subgroups of the center of the gauge group, and with the associated $\mathbb{Z}_r$ $\theta$-angle turned on, reproducing and extending various results in the literature. In particular, we find an interesting mixed 't Hooft anomaly between gravity and the $\mathbb{Z}_r$ one-form symmetry of the $SU(N)_K$ theory (for $N$ even, $\frac{N}{r}$ odd and $\frac{K}{r}$ even). This plays a key role in our derivation of the Witten index, which we explicitly compute for any $N$, $K$ and $r$ in terms of refinements of Jordan's totient function. Our results lead to precise conjectures about integrality of indices, which appear to have a strong number-theoretic flavour. Note: this paper directly builds upon unpublished notes by Brian Willett from 2020.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct Narain conformal field theories (CFTs) from quantum subsystem codes, a more comprehensive class of quantum error-correcting codes than quantum stabilizer codes, for qudit systems of prime dimensions. The resulting code CFTs exhibit a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, enabling us to perform the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging to derive their orbifolded and fermionized theories when the symmetry is non-anomalous. We classify a subset of these subsystem code CFTs using weighted oriented graphs and enumerate those with small central charges. Consequently, we identify several bosonic code CFTs self-dual under the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold, new supersymmetric code CFTs, and a few fermionic code CFTs with spontaneously broken supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Feynman Integral Reductions by Intersection Theory with Orthogonal Bases and Closed Formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a prescription for choosing orthogonal bases of differential $n$-forms belonging to quadratic twisted period integrals, with respect to the intersection number inner product. To evaluate these inner products, we additionally propose a new closed formula for intersection numbers beyond $\mathrm{d} \log$ forms. These findings allow us to systematically construct orthonormal bases between twisted period integrals of this type. In the context of Feynman integrals, this represents all diagrams at one-loop.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss numerical aspects of instantons in two- and three-dimensional $\phi^4$ theories with an internal $O(N)$ symmetry group, the so-called $N$-vector model. Combining asymptotic transseries expansions for large argument with convergence acceleration techniques, we obtain high-precision values for certain integrals of the instanton that naturally occur in loop corrections around instanton configurations. Knowledge of these numerical properties are necessary in order to evaluate corrections to the large-order factorial growth of perturbation theory in $\phi^4$ theories. The results contribute to the understanding of the mathematical structures underlying the instanton configurations.</description>

Three general possibilities arise: one where tortoise coordinate appears as the unique solution, other that includes Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates as a very specific case, but that also allows other similar transformations, and finally a new set of coordinates with very different properties than the other two. In particular, this represents any causal patch of the spherically symmetric metrics in a compactified form. We analyze some relations, taking the Schwarzschild case as prototype, but also contrasting the cosmological de-Sitter and Anti-de-Sitter solutions for the new proposed pulsating coordinates.</description>

      <title>Contour gauge: Compendium of Results in Theory and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review, we outline the main features of the non-local gauge, named the contour gauge. The contour gauge belongs to the axial type of gauges and extends the local gauge used in the most of approaches. The geometry of gluon fields and the path-dependent formalism are the essential tools for the description of non-local gauges. The principle feature of the contour gauge is that there are no the residual gauges which are left in the finite domain of space. In the review, we present the useful correspondence between the contour gauge conception and the Hamiltonian (Lagrangian) formalism. The Hamiltonian formalism is turned out to be a very convenient framework for the understanding of contour gauges. The comprehensive comparison analysis of the local and non-local gauges advocates the advantage of the contour gauge use. We show that the appropriate use the contour gauge leads to the existence of extra diagram contributions. These additional contributions, first, restore the gauge invariance of the hadron tensor and, second, give the important terms for the observable quantities. We also demonstrate the significant role of the additional diagrams to form the relevant contour in the Wilson path-ordered exponential. Ultimately, it leads to the spurious singularity fixing. Moreover, in the present review, we discuss in detail the problem of spin and orbital angular momentum separation. We show that in $SU(3)$ gauge theories the gluon decomposition on the physical and pure gauge components has a strong mathematical evidence provided the contour gauge conception has been used. In addition, we prove that the contour gauge possesses the special kind of residual gauge that manifests at the boundary of space. Besides, the boundary field configurations can be associated with the pure gauge fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a pipeline to infer the equation of state of neutron stars from observations based on deep neural networks. In particular, using the standard (deterministic), as well as Bayesian (probabilistic) deep networks, we explore how one can infer the interior speed of sound of the star given a set of mock observations of total stellar mass, stellar radius and tidal deformability. We discuss in detail the construction of our simulated dataset of stellar observables starting from the solution of the gravitational equations, as well as the relevant architectures for the deep networks, along with their performance and accuracy. We further explain how our pipeline is capable to detect a possible QCD phase transition in the stellar core. Our results show that deep networks offer a promising tool towards solving the inverse problem of neutron stars, and the accurate inference of their interior from future stellar observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a not necessarily semisimple modular tensor category C, we use the corresponding 3d TFT defined in [arXiv:1912.02063] to explicitly describe a modular functor as a symmetric monoidal 2-functor from a 2-category of oriented bordisms to a 2-category of finite linear categories. This recovers a result by Lyubashenko [arXiv:hep-th/9405168] obtained via generators and relations. Pulling back the modular functor for C to a 2-category of bordisms with orientation reversing involution cancels the gluing anomaly, and further pulling back to the original bordism category along a doubling functor leads to the modular functor for the Drinfeld centre Z(C).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A planar superfluid is considered and interpreted in terms of electromagnetism and gravity. It has previously been suggested that the superfluid flow can be regarded as analogous to an electromagnetic field and that a non-vanishing density gradient give rise to a gravity-like force. The present work seeks to reconcile these hitherto distinct pictures into a unified exposition of vortex electrodynamics in a curved analogue space-time. By constructing a theory in which the planar Maxwell's equations are coupled to a (d+1)-dimensional conformally curved space-time, we expose a correspondence between the resulting equations of motion of the embedded fields and the dynamics of a quantum fluid. Finally, an effective vortex metric whose connection components are torsional is studied and its effect on the superfluid Maxwell's equations is elucidated upon.</description>

Abstract: We give an overview of recent developments in the computation of the anomalous dimension matrix of composite operators in non-forward kinematics. The elements of this matrix determine the scale dependence of non-perturbative parton distributions, such as GPDs, and hence constitute important input for phenomenological studies of exclusive processes like deeply-virtual Compton scattering. Particular emphasis will be put on a recently developed method that exploits consistency relations for the anomalous dimension matrix which follow from the renormalization structure of the operators.</description>

      <title>The Separate Universe approach for multifield inflation models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes could constitute part or all of dark matter but they require large inhomogeneities to form in the early universe. These inhomogeneities can strongly backreact on the large scale dynamics of the universe. Stochastic inflation provides a way of studying this backreaction and getting an estimation of the abundance of primordial black holes. Because stochastic inflation focuses on large scale dynamics, it rests on the separate universe approach. However, the validity of this approach has only been checked in single field models, but not in multifield models in which we expect strong boosts in the power spectrum, leading to the formation of primordial black holes. We will check the validity of a separate universe approach in multifield models by matching it with a complete cosmological perturbation theory approach at large scales. In particular, we wish to compare these two paradigms and their differences in the adiabatic and entropic directions of the phase space. This will give us a range of validity and conditions one needs to verify in order to apply the separate universe approach and stochastic inflation in multifield models.</description>

      <title>Theoretical bounds on dark Higgs mass in a self-interacting dark matter model with $U(1)'$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the null results of current dark matter searches and the small-scale problems, we study a dark sector charged by a spontaneous broken gauge $U(1)'$. To explore the parameter space of this model, in addition to the consideration of the small-scale data, we also consider the theoretical bounds on the dark Higgs mass, with the upper bound coming from the tree-level perturbative unitarity and the lower bound from the one-loop Linde-Weinberg bound. We deeply examine the dependence of the Linde-Weinberg bound on gauge choice and energy scale. Combining the theoretical and observational constraints, we obtain the following ranges for the parameter space: the dark matter mass is 10-500 GeV, the mediator (dark photon) mass is 0.5-5 MeV, the dark Higgs mass is 0.05-50 MeV, the dark fine-structure constant is 0.001-0.5. We conclude that the dark Higgs in this model cannot be ignored in the phenomenological study of the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Signatures of gravitational wave memory in the radiative process of entangled quantum probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we examine entangled quantum probes in geodesic trajectories in a background with gravitational wave (GW) burst. In particular, these quantum probes are prepared initially either in the symmetric or anti-symmetric Bell's states and we study the radiative process as the GW burst passes. Our considered GW burst backgrounds have the profiles of -- Heaviside-theta, $tanh$, Gaussian, and $sech$-squared functions respectively. The first two burst profiles have an asymmetric nature and thus result in non-zero gravitational wave memory. Whereas, for the last two symmetric profiles there is no asymptotic memory. For eternal switching, our observations suggest that the collective transition rate for the entangled probes due to symmetric GW bursts remains the same as obtained in the flat space. Whereas, for asymmetric bursts with memory, there is a finite change, indicating a direct possibility to distinguish between the two above-mentioned scenarios. We also consider finite switching in terms of Gaussian functions and observe characteristic differences in the radiative process between the GW backgrounds with and without memory. Notably, if the Gaussian switching is peaked much later compared to the passing of GW, only memory profiles contribute to the radiative process. We further discuss the physical implications of our findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We complete the perturbative program for equilibrium thermodynamics of cosmological first-order phase transitions by determining the finite-temperature effective potential of gauge-Higgs theories at next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^4$LO). The computation of the three-loop effective potential required to reach this order is extended to generic models in dimensionally reduced effective theories in a companion article. Our N$^4$LO result is the last perturbative order before confinement renders electroweak gauge-Higgs theories non-perturbative at four loops. By contrasting our analysis with non-perturbative lattice results, we find a remarkable agreement. As a direct application for predictions of gravitational waves produced by a first-order transition, our computation provides the final fully perturbative results for the phase transition strength and speed of sound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the recent construction of $N_f=1$ baryons on the $\eta^\prime$ domain wall can be understood as vortexes of the principal effective theory -- the Chern-Simons-Higgs theory -- on a 2+1-dimensional sheet. This theory has a series of vertex solutions, and the vortex with unit topological charge naturally spins $N_c/2$, which coincides with the spin of the one-flavor baryon in QCD. Since the $N_c$ scaling of the vortexes is the same as that of baryons, baryons can be regarded as vortexes. By virtue of the particle-vortex symmetry, the dual Zhang-Hansson-Kivelson theory indicates that the quark carries topological charge $1/N_c$ and obeys fractional statistics. The generalization to arbitrary $N_f$ is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Exact Degeneracy of Casimir Energy for $\mathcal{N}=4$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory on ADE Singularities and S-Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classically, the ground states of $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb{R}\times S^3/\Gamma$ where $\Gamma$ is a discrete ADE subgroup of $SU(2)$ are represented by flat Wilson lines winding around the ADE singularity. By a duality relating such ground states to WZW conformal blocks, the ground state degeneracy cannot be lifted by quantum corrections. Using the superconformal index, we compute the supersymmetric Casimir energy of each flat Wilson line for $SU(2)$ SYM on different ADE singularities and find that the flat Wilson lines all have the same supersymmetric Casimir energy. We argue that this exact degeneracy is peculiar to $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetry and show that the degeneracy is lifted when the number of supersymmetry is reduced. In particular, we uncover a surprising result for the ground state structure of the conformal $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(2)$ four-flavor theory on $S^3/\Gamma$. For $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, S-duality maps the ground state Wilson lines to ground state t' Hooft lines taking values in the Langlands dual group. We show that the supersymmetric Casimir energy of the t' Hooft line ground states is the same as the Wilson line ground states. This can be viewed as a ground state test of S-duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinos from the cosmos have proven to be ideal for probing the nature of space-time. Previous studies on high-energy events of IceCube suggested that some of these events might be gamma-ray burst neutrinos, with their speeds varying linearly with their energy, implying also the coexistence of subluminal and superluminal propagation. However, a recent reanalysis of the data, incorporating revised directional information, reveals stronger signals that neutrinos are actually being slowed down compared to previous suggestion of neutrino speed variation. Thus, it is worth discussing its implications for the brane/string inspired framework of space-time foam, which has been used to explain previous observations. We revisit effects on neutrino propagation from specific foam models within the framework, indicating that the implied violation of Lorentz invariance could necessarily cause the neutrino to decelerate. We therefore argue that this sort of model is in agreement with the updated phenomenological indication just mentioned. An extended analysis of the revised IceCube data will further test these observations and stringy quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the concept of global symmetry has generalized considerably. Two dramatic examples of this generalization are the exotic symmetries that govern theories with fractons and non-invertible symmetries, which do not fuse according to a group law. Only recently has the interplay between these two been examined. In this paper, we provide further examples of the interplay in the XY plaquette model, XY cube model, 1+1 d theory with global dipole symmetry, and the 2+1 d Lifshitz theory. They are analogs of the duality symmetries in 2d CTFs and are constructed by first gauging a finite subgroup of the momentum symmetry on half of spacetime and then performing a duality transformation. We analyze the fusion rules of the symmetries and find that they are condensation defects from an analog of higher gauging exotic symmetries. We also address their dependence on the UV cutoff when relevant.</description>

Abstract: We study a specific class of CFTs that involve coupled free fermions, arising from parafermion CFTs and lattice constructions. We analyse their representation spaces and the underlying exclusion statistics of coupled free fermions using specific bases. In one particular case, we reveal an unexpected connection between the coset construction of parafermions, the lattice construction, and and orbifold thereof. This connection is supported by proving a range of character identities within the context of coupled free fermions. Simultaneously, we obtain explicit expressions of certain string functions in terms of Dedekind eta functions.</description>

Abstract: In the standard derivation of the Kerr-Schild double copy, the geodicity of the Kerr-Schild vector and the stationarity of the spacetime are presented as assumptions that are necessary for the single copy to satisfy Maxwell's equations. However, it is well known that the vacuum Einstein equations imply that the Kerr-Schild vector is geodesic and shear-free, and that the spacetime possesses a distinguished vector field that is simultaneously a Killing vector of the full spacetime and the flat background, but need not be timelike with respect to the background metric. We show that the gauge field obtained by contracting this distinguished Killing vector with the Kerr-Schild graviton solves the vacuum Maxwell equations, and that this definition of the Kerr-Schild double copy implies the Weyl double copy when the spacetime is Petrov type D. When the Killing vector is taken to be timelike with respect to the background metric, we recover the familiar Kerr-Schild double copy, but the prescription is well defined for any vacuum Kerr-Schild spacetime and we present new examples where the Killing vector is null or spacelike. While most examples of physical interest are type D, vacuum Kerr-Schild spacetimes are generically of Petrov type II. We present a straightforward example of such a spacetime and study its double copy structure. Our results apply to real Lorentzian spacetimes as well as complex spacetimes and real spacetimes with Kleinian signature, and provide a simple correspondence between real and self-dual vacuum Kerr-Schild spacetimes. This correspondence allows us to study the double copy structure of a self-dual analog of the Kerr spacetime. We provide evidence that this spacetime may be diffeomorphic to the self-dual Taub-NUT solution.</description>

      <title>Dispersion and absorption effects in the linearized Euler-Heisenberg electrodynamics under an external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of the Ohmic and magnetic density currents are investigated in the linearized Euler-Heisenberg electrodynamics. The linearization is introduced through an external magnetic field, in which the vector potential of the Euler-Heisenberg electrodynamics is expanded around of a magnetic background field, that we consider uniform and constant in this paper. From the Euler-Heisenberg linearized equations, we obtain the solutions for the refractive index associated with the electromagnetic wave superposition, when the current density is ruled by the Ohm law, and in the second case, when the current density is set by a isotropic magnetic conductivity. These solutions are functions of the magnetic background $({\bf B})$, of the wave propagation direction $({\bf k})$, it also depends on the conductivity, and on the wave frequency. As consequence, the dispersion and the absorption of plane waves change when ${\bf B}$ is parallel to ${\bf k}$ in relation to the case of ${\bf B}$ perpendicular to ${\bf k}$ in the medium. The characteristics of the refraction index related to directions of ${\bf B}$ and of the wave polarization open a discussion for the birefringence in this medium.</description>

      <title>Ghost-Free Electroweak Symmetry Breaking with Weakly Nonlocal Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weakly nonlocal (WNL) Quantum Field Theories (QFT's) may define a new class of UV-completions in particle physics and gravity, without introducing any new elementary particle. One problematic issue is how to realize spontaneous symmetry breaking without introducing an infinite tower of ghosts in the perturbative spectrum. In this article, a WNL extension of the Standard Model (SM) is proposed: the Fuzzy Standard Model (FSM). It is a smooth deformation of the SM based on covariant star-products of fields. This new formalism realizes electroweak symmetry breaking without ghosts at tree-level. We give evidences that the FSM exhibit Vainshtein screening, aka classicalization, in the deep-UV. This could solve the electroweak hierarchy problem if it occurs at the TeV-scale.</description>

      <title>ALPs, the on-shell way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how the coupling between axion-like particles (ALPs) and matter can be obtained at the level of on-shell scattering amplitudes. We identify three conditions that allow us to compute amplitudes that correspond to shift-symmetric Lagrangians, at the level of operators with dimension 5 or higher, and we discuss how they relate and extend the Adler's zero condition. These conditions are necessary to reduce the number of coefficients consistent with the little-group scaling to the one expected from the Lagrangian approach. We also show how our formalism easily explains that the dimension-5 interaction involving one ALP and two massless spin-1 bosons receive corrections from higher order operators only when the ALP has a non-vanishing mass. As a direct application of our results, we perform a phenomenological study of the inelastic scattering $\ell^+\ell^- \to \phi h$ (with $\ell^\pm$ two charged leptons, $\phi$ the ALP and $h$ the Higgs boson) for which, as a result of the structure of the 3-point and 4-point amplitudes, dimension-7 operators can dominate over the dimension-5 ones well before the energy reaches the cutoff of the theory.</description>

      <title>The effect of wave dark matter on equal mass black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For dark matter to be detectable with gravitational waves from binary black holes, it must reach higher than average densities in their vicinity. In the case of light (wave-like) dark matter, the density of dark matter between the binary can be significantly enhanced by accretion from the surrounding environment. Here we show that the resulting dephasing effect on the last ten orbits of an equal mass binary is maximized when the Compton wavelength of the scalar particle is comparable to the orbital separation, $2\pi/\mu\sim d$. The phenomenology of the effect is different from the channels that are usually discussed, where dynamical friction (along the orbital path) and radiation of energy and angular momentum drive the dephasing, and is rather dominated by the radial force (the spacetime curvature in the radial direction) towards the overdensity between the black holes. Whilst our numerical studies limit us to scales of the same order, this effect may persist at larger separations and/or particle masses, playing a significant role in the merger history of binaries.</description>

      <title>Quantum information spreading in generalised dual-unitary circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spreading of quantum information in a recently introduced family of brickwork quantum circuits that generalises the dual-unitary class. These circuits are unitary in time, while their spatial dynamics is unitary only in a restricted subspace. First, we show that local operators spread at the speed of light as in dual-unitary circuits, i.e., the butterfly velocity takes the maximal value allowed by the geometry of the circuit. Then, we prove that the entanglement spreading can still be characterised exactly for a family of compatible initial states (in fact, for an extension of the compatible family of dual-unitary circuits) and that the asymptotic entanglement slope is again independent on the R\'enyi index. Remarkably, however, we find that the entanglement velocity is generically smaller than one. We use these properties to find a closed-form expression for the entanglement membrane in these circuits.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Nonlinear Tidal Love Numbers of Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that asymptotically flat Schwarzschild black holes in general relativity in four spacetime dimensions have vanishing induced linear tidal response. We extend this result beyond linear order for the polar sector, by solving the static nonlinear Einstein equations for the perturbations of the Schwarzschild metric and computing the quadratic corrections to the electric-type tidal Love numbers. After explicitly performing the matching with the point-particle effective theory at leading order in the derivative expansion, we show that the Love number couplings remain zero at higher order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the chiral phase transition within the Linear Sigma Model with quarks from its thermodynamical potential considering quantum corrections up to ring diagrams in the high-temperature regime. Demanding a second order phase transition as expected in the chiral limit at low baryon chemical potential, that the curvature of the critical line matches the one obtained in lattice simulations and that the value of the speed of sound at high temperature and zero density has its measured value, we constrain the couplings and other free parameters of the model. We set restrictions to locate the position of the Critical End Point in the phase diagram from a fast drop-off of the critical line reminiscent from the behavior of the speed of sound near criticality. Our results set tight constrains in parameter space for the model to exhibit realistic features.</description>

      <title>Membrane Paradigm Approach to the Johannsen-Psaltis Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Johannsen-Psaltis (JP) black hole is a phenomenologically viable metric obtained by judiciously deforming the Kerr black hole such that the metric is asymptotically flat and causal and is consistent with the weak field, post-Newtonian tests of gravity; however, it has additional hairs besides its mass and angular momentum. As it deviates from the Kerr black hole in the strong coupling regime, it is a useful metric to test the Kerr hypothesis that states that all astrophysical black holes are of the Kerr type. Here we give a membrane description of this black hole that effectively amounts to replacing the observable part of the black hole with a fluid with thermal properties. A timelike membrane, a stretched horizon local in time is assumed to exist. This membrane is expected to approximate the null event horizon that is highly non-local in time. We derive the energy-momentum tensor of the fluid and all the transport coefficients using the action formulation to the membrane as advocated by Parikh and Wilczek. In the fluid description, one observes that the finiteness of the transport coefficients constrains the additional hairs of the Johannsen-Psaltis black hole. Analytically continuing the pressure of the fluid to all values of the radial coordinate $r$, one obtains interesting Van der Waals-type behavior of the pressure of the fluid which diverges at the radius of the outer ergosphere, lending support, from the membrane paradigm's perspective to the claim that relativistic astrophysical jets are produced by the ergoregion of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution in Canonical Quantum Gravity is Trivial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wheeler-DeWitt equation does not describe any explicit time evolution of the wave function, and somehow related to this issue, there is no natural way of defining an invariant inner product that provides a viable probability interpretation. We show that both of these difficulties are solved in a covariant canonical formulation of general relativity where the configuration space is extended by introducing the embedding coordinates as dynamical variables. The formalism describes the evolution of the wave function from one spacelike slice to another, but as in the case of spatial diffeomorphisms this is simply implemented by a coordinate change in the wave function. We demonstrate how the time equation disappears after gauge fixing that removes the embedding coordinates. These findings indicate that the time evolution is trivial in a background independent formulation of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Displacement within velocity effect in gravitational wave memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sandwich gravitational waves exhibit the memory effect (VM) which however can become, for specific values of the wave parameters, pure displacement (DM) as suggested by Zel'dovich and Polnarev. Fixing such a "miraculous" value, the particle trajectory is an (approximate) standing wave characterized by a unique integer $m$, for which the particle does not absorb any energy from the passing wave. Our statements are illustrated by a simple Gaussian and by the P\"oschl-Teller potential as profiles.</description>
