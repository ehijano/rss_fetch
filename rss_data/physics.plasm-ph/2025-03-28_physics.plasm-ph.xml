      <title>High-Performance Computational Magnetohydrodynamics with Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the AGATE simulation code, a Python-based framework developed primarily for solving the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations while maintaining adaptability to other equation sets. The code employs a modular, object-oriented architecture that separates interface specifications from numerical implementations, allowing users to customize numerical methods and physics models. Built on a Godunov-type finite-volume scheme, AGATE currently supports the ideal, Hall, and Chew-Goldberger-Low (CGL) MHD equations, with multiple acceleration options ranging from Numpy to GPU-enabled computation via NVIDIA CUDA. Performance testing demonstrates that our GPU implementations achieve 40-60x speedups over CPU versions. Comprehensive validation through established benchmarks confirms accurate reproduction of both linear and nonlinear phenomena across different MHD regimes. This combination of modularity, performance, and extensibility makes AGATE suitable for multiple applications: from rapid prototyping to production simulations, and from numerical algorithm development to physics education.</description>

      <title>Effect of convective transport in edge/SOL plasmas of ADITYA-U tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2-D edge plasma fluid transport code, UEDGE has been used to simulate the edge region of circular limiter plasmas of ADITYA-U for modelling the measured electron density profile. The limiter geometry of ADITYA-U has been introduced in the UEDGE code, which is primarily developed and used for divertor configuration. The computational mesh defining the limiter geometry is generated by a routine developed in-house, and has successfully been integrated with the UEDGE code to simulate the edge plasma parameters of ADITYA-U. The radial profiles of edge and scrape-off layer (SOL) electron density, ne and temperature are obtained from the simulations and used to model the measured ne profile using Langmuir probe array. It has been found that a convective velocity, vconv. is definitely needed in addition to the constant perpendicular diffusion coefficient, D throughout the edge and SOL regions to model the edge ne profile. The obtained vconv. is inward and radially constant with a value of 1.5 m/s and the radially constant D is ~ 0.2 m 2/s. The value of D ~ 0.2 m2/s is found to be much less than fluctuation induced diffusivities and lies in-between the neoclassical diffusivity and Bohm diffusivity estimated in the edge-SOL region of ADITYA-U tokamak. Furthermore, the transport of radial electron heat flux is found to be maximizing near the limiter tip location in the poloidal plane.</description>

      <title>Multiscale geometrical Lagrangian statistics of heavy impurities in drift-wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of heavy impurities in edge plasma turbulence by analyzing their trajectories using the Hasegawa-Wakatani model. Through direct numerical simulations, we track ensembles of charged impurity particles over hundreds of eddy turnover times within statistically steady turbulent flows. Assuming that heavy impurities lag behind the flow, a novel derivation of relaxation time of heavy impurities is proposed. Our results reveal that heavy impurities can cluster within turbulence. We provide multiscale geometrical Lagrangian statistics of heavy impurities trajectories. To quantify directional changes, we analyze the scale-dependent curvature angle, along with the influence of the Stokes number on the mean curvature angles and the probability distribution function of curvature angles.</description>

      <title>Numerical proof-of-concept of a photon, proton, and positron laser-driven source with nanostructured targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A source of high-energy photons, ions, and positrons can be attained with the interaction of ultra-intense femtosecond laser pulses with advanced nanostructured targets. We present and characterise a numerical model that mimics the foam deposition process on solid substrates, as it occurs in Double-Layer Target (DLT) manufacturing. The model is integrated into Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations in full 3D geometry to study electron acceleration, consequent high-energy photon emission, proton acceleration, and pair production with realistic target and laser parameters. We highlight the importance of realistic foam morphology modelling even at high-laser intensity and the need for specific optimisation of target parameters with realistic PIC simulations to improve radiation production efficiency. Our study shows that the DLT could be a compact multi-purpose scheme to achieve high-brightness photons and high-energy protons and to observe and optimise non-linear Breit-Wheeler pair production.</description>

      <title>Towards Intelligent Control of MeV Energy Electrons and Protons from kHz Repetition Rate Ultra-Intense Laser Plasma Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-intense laser-matter interactions are often difficult to predict from first principles because of the complexity of plasma processes and the many degrees of freedom relating to the laser and target parameters. An important approach to controlling and optimizing ultra-intense laser interactions involves gathering large data sets and using this data to train statistical and machine learning models. In this paper we describe experimental efforts to accelerate electrons and protons to $\sim$MeV energies with this goal in mind. These experiments involve a 1 kHz repetition rate ultra-intense laser system with $\sim$10mJ per shot, a peak intensity near $5 \times 10^{18}$ W/cm$^{2}$, and a "liquid leaf" target. Improvements to the data acquisition capabilities of this laser system greatly aided this investigation. Generally, we find that the trained models were very effective for controlling the numbers of MeV electrons ejected. The models were less successful at shifting the energy range of ejected electrons. Simultaneous control of the numbers of $\sim$MeV electrons and the energy range will be the subject of future experimentation using this platform.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence of muon production from a laser-wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on experimental evidence of muon generation from a laser-wakefield accelerator driven by a PW-class laser. The muons were generated following the interaction of a GeV-scale high-charge electron beam with a 2 cm-thick Pb target and were detected using a Timepix3 detector placed behind a suitable shielding configuration. Data analysis indicates a $95\pm3$ % confidence of muon detection over noise, in excellent agreement with numerical modelling. Extrapolation of the experimental setup to higher electron energies and charges suggests the potential to generate approximately $10^4$ muons/shot with multi-PW lasers and to direct them onto cm$^2$-scale areas for applications. The results presented here demonstrate the possibility of muon generation using high-power lasers and establish a foundation for the systematic application of laser-driven muon beams.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Reconnection in the Plasma Disk at 23 Jupiter Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key open question in astrophysics is how plasma is transported within strongly magnetized, rapidly rotating systems. Magnetic reconnection and flux tube interchange are possible mechanisms, with Jupiter serving as the best local analog for distant systems. However, magnetic reconnection at Jupiter remains poorly understood. A key indicator of active magnetic reconnection is the ion diffusion region, but its detection at Jupiter has remained unconfirmed. Here, we report a unique magnetic reconnection event in Jupiter's inner magnetosphere that presents the first detection of an ion diffusion region. We provide evidence that this event involves localized flux tube interchange motion driven by centrifugal forces, which occurs inside a thin current sheet formed by the collision and twisting of two distinct flux tubes. This study provides new insights into Io-genic plasma transport at Jupiter and the unique role of magnetic reconnection in rapidly rotating systems, two key unresolved questions.</description>

      <title>Proton-Driven Plasma Wakefield Acceleration for Future HEP Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the main elements of a collider facility based on proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration. We show that very competitive luminosities could be reached for high energy $e^+e^-$ colliders. A first set of parameters was developed for a Higgs Factory indicating that such a scheme is indeed potentially feasible. There are clearly many challenges to the development of this scheme, including novel RF acceleration modules and high precision and strong magnets for the proton driver. Challenges in the plasma acceleration stage include the ability to accelerate positrons while maintaining necessary emittance and the energy transfer efficiency from the driver to the witness. Since many exciting applications would become available from our approach, its development should be pursued.</description>

      <title>On the Nature of Subharmonics of the Electron Emission from Ultracold Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most interesting phenomena in the ultracold plasmas are multiple subharmonics of the electron emission observed after its irradiation by the monochromatic radiowaves. Unfortunately, the early interpretation of this phenomenon as the so-called Tonks-Dattner resonances (i.e., actually the standing Langmuir waves) encountered a number of serious obstacles, such as a lack of the adequate boundary conditions, an incorrect dependence on the electron temperature, and an insensitivity to the shape of the cloud. Here, we suggest an alternative interpretation based on the quasi-classical multiphoton ionization of the 'secondary' Rydberg atoms formed in the expanding and cooling plasma clouds. As follows from our numerical simulations, the efficiency of such ionization exhibits a series of well-expressed peaks. Moreover, this process is evidently irrelevant to the boundary conditions and global shape of the cloud. Therefore, this should be a viable alternative to the earlier idea of Tonks--Dattner resonances.</description>

      <title>Applying the Liouville-Lanczos Method of Time-Dependent Density-Functional Theory to Warm Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ab initio modeling of dynamic structure factors (DSF) and related density response properties in the warm dense matter (WDM) regime is a challenging computational task. The DSF, convolved with a probing X-ray beam and instrument function, is measured in X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) experiments, which allows for the study of electronic structure properties at the microscopic level. Among the various ab initio methods, linear response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) is a key framework for simulating the DSF. The standard approach in LR-TDDFT for computing the DSF relies on the orbital representation. A significant drawback of this method is the unfavorable scaling of the number of required empty bands as the wavenumber increases, making LR-TDDFT impractical for modeling XRTS measurements over large energy scales, such as in backward scattering geometry. We consider and test an alternative approach that employs the Liouville-Lanczos (LL) method for simulating the DSF. This approach does not require empty states and allows the DSF at large momentum transfer values and over a broad frequency range to be accessed. We compare the results obtained from the LL method with those from the standard LR-TDDFT within the projector augmented-wave formalism for isochorically heated aluminum and warm dense hydrogen. Additionally, we utilize exact path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results for the imaginary-time density-density correlation function (ITCF) of warm dense hydrogen to rigorously benchmark the LL approach. We discuss the application of the LL method for calculating DSFs and ITCFs at different wavenumbers, the effects of pseudopotentials, and the role of Lorentzian smearing. The successful validation of the LL method under WDM conditions makes it a valuable addition to the ab initio simulation landscape, supporting experimental efforts and advancing WDM theory.</description>

      <title>Determination of non-local characteristics of density transport in 2D simulations of the SOL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By use of Lagrangian tracers propagated on 2D simulations of Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) turbulence, we are able to determine the non-local fractional-advection, fractional-diffusion equation (FADE) coefficients for a number of equilibrium cases. Solutions of the resultant FADEs shows good agreement with the simulated mean density profiles. We detail how the FADE is derived: the stochastic flux equation is introduced, and it is shown how it is used to find general forms of Fick's first and second laws, dependent on the jump function. We show for spatially homogeneous jump functions which belong to the Levy-alpha Stable distribution that transport may be approximated by a non-local FADE with four parameters. This work demonstrates the sound basis for FADEs to act as reduced models of transport in systems dominated by coherent structures; so justifies the development of a first-principles approach to calculating FADE parameters.</description>

      <title>Experimental Signatures for Identifying Distinct Origins of Color Field Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signatures for non-abelian dynamics have long been central to QCD and QGP. Equally important are they in spin systems and laser-plasma interactions, where they emerge as effective interactions. Distinguishing experimentally gauge inequivalent sources (and hence potentials) that produce the same field tensor is one major task in this endeavour. As a step in this direction, this paper investigates how physically distinct sources which produce the same color electric field (uniform and constant) may be distinguished experimentally in a gauge-invariant manner. We first study the motion of a test particle in such fields and show that the resultant trajectories are counterintuitive. We then examine the radiation emitted - both gluonic and photonic and show that each source (independent non-abelian configuration) leaves a unique signature in the energy spectra, laying the ground for application to specific physical systems.</description>

      <title>Reformulating polarized radiative transfer for astrophysical applications (I). A formalism allowing non-local Magnus solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00252v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solar atmosphere is diagnosed by solving the polarized radiative transfer problem for plasmas in Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE). A key challenge in multidimensional NLTE diagnosis is to integrate efficiently the radiative transfer equation (RTE), but current methods are local, i.e. limited to constant propagation matrices. This paper introduces a formalism for non-local integration of the RTE using the Magnus expansion. We begin by framing the problem in terms of rotations within the Lorentz / Poincare group (Stokes formalism), motivating the use of the Magnus expansion. By combining the latter with a highly detailed algebraic characterization of the propagation matrix, we derive a compact analytical evolution operator that supports arbitrary variations of the propagation matrix and allows to increasingly consider any order in the Magnus expansion. Additionally, we also reformulate the inhomogeneous part of the RTE, again using the Magnus expansion, and introducing the new concept of inhomogeneous evolution operator. This provides the first consistent, general, and non-local formal solution to the RTE that is furthermore efficient and separates integration from the algebraic formal solution. Our framework is verified analytically and computationally, leading to a new family of numerical radiative transfer methods and potential applications such as accelerating NLTE calculations. With minor adjustments, our results apply to other universal physical problems sharing the Lorentz / Poincare algebra in special relativity and electromagnetism.</description>
