      <title>New Lie systems from Goursat distributions: reductions and reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that types of bracket-generating distributions lead to new classes of Lie systems with compatible geometric structures. Specifically, the $n$-trailer system is analysed, showing that its associated distribution is related to a Lie system if $n = 0$ or $n = 1$. These systems allow symmetry reductions and the reconstruction of solutions of the original system from those of the reduced one. The reconstruction procedure is discussed and indicates potential extensions for studying broader classes of differential equations through Lie systems and new types of superposition rules.</description>

      <title>Attention Mechanisms in Dynamical Systems: A Case Study with Predator-Prey Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms are widely used in artificial intelligence to enhance performance and interpretability. In this paper, we investigate their utility in modeling classical dynamical systems -- specifically, a noisy predator-prey (Lotka-Volterra) system. We train a simple linear attention model on perturbed time-series data to reconstruct system trajectories. Remarkably, the learned attention weights align with the geometric structure of the Lyapunov function: high attention corresponds to flat regions (where perturbations have small effect), and low attention aligns with steep regions (where perturbations have large effect). We further demonstrate that attention-based weighting can serve as a proxy for sensitivity analysis, capturing key phase-space properties without explicit knowledge of the system equations. These results suggest a novel use of AI-derived attention for interpretable, data-driven analysis and control of nonlinear systems. For example our framework could support future work in biological modeling of circadian rhythms, and interpretable machine learning for dynamical environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the almost-periodic solutions for the one-dimensional nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation within the non-relativistic limit under periodic boundary conditions. Specifically, by employing the method introduced in \cite{Bourgain2005JFA}, we establish the existence and linear stability of full-dimensional tori with subexponential decay for the equation.</description>

      <title>On global rigidity of transversely holomorphic Anosov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study transversely holomorphic flows, i.e. those whose holonomy pseudo-group is given by biholomorphic maps. We prove that for Anosov flows on smooth compact manifolds, the strong unstable (respectively, stable) distribution is integrable to complex manifolds, on which the flow acts holomorphically. Furthermore, assuming its complex dimension to be one, it is uniquely integrable to complex affine one-dimensional manifolds, each moreover affinely diffeomorphic to $\mathbb C$, on which the flow acts affinely. In this case, the weak stable (respectively, unstable) foliation is transversely holomorphic, and even transversely projective if the flow is assumed to be topologically transitive. By combining these facts in low dimensions, our main result is as follows : if a transversely holomorphic Anosov flow on a smooth compact five-dimensional manifold is topologically transitive, then it is either $C^\infty$-orbit equivalent to the suspension of a hyperbolic automorphism of a complex torus, or, up to finite covers, $C^\infty$-orbit equivalent to the geodesic flow of a compact hyperbolic manifold.</description>

      <title>On the regularity of time-delayed embeddings with self-intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study regularity of the time-delayed coordinate maps \[\phi_{h,k}(x) = (h(x), h(Tx), \ldots, h(T^{k-1}x))\] for a diffeomorphism $T$ of a compact manifold $M$ and smooth observables $h$ on $M$. Takens' embedding theorem shows that if $k &gt; 2\dim M$, then $\phi_{h,k}$ is an embedding for typical $h$. We consider the probabilistic case, where for a given probability measure $\mu$ on $M$ one allows self-intersections in the time-delayed embedding to occur along a zero-measure set. We show that if $k \geq \dim M$ and $k &gt; \dim_H(\text{supp} \mu)$, then for a typical observable, $\phi_{h,k}$ is injective on a full-measure set with a pointwise Lipschitz inverse. If moreover $k &gt; \dim M$, then $\phi_{h,k}$ is a local diffeomorphism at almost every point. As an application, we show that if $k &gt; \dim M$, then the Lyapunov exponents of the original system can be approximated with arbitrary precision by almost every orbit in the time-delayed model of the system. We also give almost sure pointwise bounds on the prediction error and provide a non-dynamical analogue of the main result, which can be seen as a probabilistic version of Whitney's embedding theorem.</description>

      <title>Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition For Sparse Reconstruction of Closable Koopman Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial temporal reconstruction of dynamical system is indeed a crucial problem with diverse applications ranging from climate modeling to numerous chaotic and physical processes. These reconstructions are based on the harmonious relationship between the Koopman operators and the choice of dictionary, determined implicitly by a kernel function. This leads to the approximation of the Koopman operators in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) associated with that kernel function. Data-driven analysis of Koopman operators demands that Koopman operators be closable over the underlying RKHS, which still remains an unsettled, unexplored, and critical operator-theoretic challenge. We aim to address this challenge by investigating the embedding of the Laplacian kernel in the measure-theoretic sense, giving rise to a rich enough RKHS to settle the closability of the Koopman operators. We leverage Kernel Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition with the Laplacian kernel to reconstruct the dominant spatial temporal modes of various diverse dynamical systems. After empirical demonstration, we concrete such results by providing the theoretical justification leveraging the closability of the Koopman operators on the RKHS generated by the Laplacian kernel on the avenues of Koopman mode decomposition and the Koopman spectral measure. Such results were explored from both grounds of operator theory and data-driven science, thus making the Laplacian kernel a robust choice for spatial-temporal reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Topologically stable manifolds for index-$1$ singular dominated splittings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $C^2$ vector fields, we study regular ergodic measures whose supports admit singular dominated splittings with one of the bundles having dimension $1$. For such a measure $\mu$, we prove that if any periodic orbit within the support of $\mu$ (when it exists) has at least one negative Lyapunov exponent, and if the dynamics on the support of $\mu$ is not topologically equivalent to an irrational flow on a $2$-torus, then $\mu$-almost every point $x$ admits a $2$-dimensional topologically stable manifold $V^s(x)$: we mean that $V^s(x)$ is an embedded disc such that the orbit any point within it converges to the orbit of $x$ up to a time-reparametrization. Note that we do not assume any hyperbolicity for $\mu$.
  We also establish an analogous conclusion for compact invariant sets $\Lambda$ with a singular dominated splitting, assuming some mild contraction property (any regular ergodic measure properly supported in $\Lambda$ must have at least one negative Lyapunov exponent). This result will be used in our future work on the Palis density conjecture for three-dimensional vector fields.</description>

      <title>Pi in the Mandelbrot set everywhere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical phenomenon of $\pi$ appearing at parameters $c = 1/4$, $c=-3/4$ and $c=-5/4$ in the Mandelbrot set $\mathcal{M}$ has been known for over 30 years. In 2001, the first proof was provided by Aaron Klebanoff for the parameter $c=1/4$. Very recently in 2023, an even sharper result for $c=1/4$ was proved using holomorphic dynamics by Paul Siewert. This new proof also provided a conceptual understanding of the phenomenon. In this paper, we give, for the first time, a proof of the known phenomenon for the parameters $c=-3/4$ and $c=-5/4$, which is also conceptual, and we provide a generalization of the phenomenon and the proof for all bifurcation points of the Mandelbrot set.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations of synchronized solutions in a continuum limit of the Kuramoto model with two-mode interaction depending on two graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bifurcations of the completely synchronized state in a continuum limit (CL) for the Kuramoto model (KM) of identical oscillators with two-mode interaction depending on two graphs. Here one of the graphs is uniform but may be deterministic dense, random dense or random sparse, and the other is a deterministic finite nearest neighbor. We use the center manifold reduction technique, which is a standard one in dynamical systems, and prove that the CL suffers bifurcations at which the one-parameter family of completely synchronized state becomes unstable and a stable two-parameter family of $\ell$-humped sinusoidal shape stationary solutions ($\ell\ge 2$) appears, where $n$ represents the node number. This contrasts the author's recent result on the classical KM in which bifurcation behavior in its CL is very different from ones in the KM and difficult to explain by standard techniques in dynamical systems such as the center manifold reduction. Moreover, similar bifurcation behavior is shown to occur in the KM, based on the previous fundamental results. The occurrence of such bifurcations were suggested by numerical simulations for the deterministic graphs in a previous study. We also demonstrate our theoretical results by numerical simulations for the KM with the zero natural frequency.</description>

      <title>The Influence of the Memory Capacity of Neural DDEs on the Universal Approximation Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), which are the continuous-time analog of Residual Neural Networks (ResNets), have gained significant attention in recent years. Similarly, Neural Delay Differential Equations (Neural DDEs) can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of Densely Connected Residual Neural Networks (DenseResNets). In contrast to traditional ResNet architectures, DenseResNets are feed-forward networks that allow for shortcut connections across all layers. These additional connections introduce memory in the network architecture, as typical in many modern architectures. In this work, we explore how the memory capacity in neural DDEs influences the universal approximation property. The key parameter for studying the memory capacity is the product $K \tau$ of the Lipschitz constant and the delay of the DDE. In the case of non-augmented architectures, where the network width is not larger than the input and output dimensions, neural ODEs and classical feed-forward neural networks cannot have the universal approximation property. We show that if the memory capacity $K\tau$ is sufficiently small, the dynamics of the neural DDE can be approximated by a neural ODE. Consequently, non-augmented neural DDEs with a small memory capacity also lack the universal approximation property. In contrast, if the memory capacity $K\tau$ is sufficiently large, we can establish the universal approximation property of neural DDEs for continuous functions. If the neural DDE architecture is augmented, we can expand the parameter regions in which universal approximation is possible. Overall, our results show that by increasing the memory capacity $K\tau$, the infinite-dimensional phase space of DDEs with positive delay $\tau&gt;0$ is not sufficient to guarantee a direct jump transition to universal approximation, but only after a certain memory threshold, universal approximation holds.</description>

      <title>KAM theory at the Quantum resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the semiclassical operator $\hat{H}(\epsilon,h):=H_{0}(hD_{x})+\epsilon \tilde{P}_{0}$ on $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{l})$, where the symbol of $\hat{H}(\epsilon,h)$ corresponds to a perturbed classical Hamiltonian of the form:
  \begin{align*}
  H(x,y,\epsilon)=H_{0}(y)+\epsilon P_{0}(x,y).
  \end{align*}
  Here, $\tilde{P}_{0}=Op_{h}^{W}(P_{0})$ is a bounded pseudodifferential operator with a holomorphic symbol that decays to zero at infinity, and $\epsilon\in \mathbb{R}$ is a small parameter. We establish that for small $|\epsilon|&lt;\epsilon^{*}$, there exists a frequency $\omega(\epsilon)$ satisfying condition \eqref{b}, such that the spectrum of $\hat{H}(\epsilon,h)$ is given by the quantization formula:
  \begin{align*}
  E(n_{y},E_{u},E_{v},\epsilon,h)=\varepsilon(h,\epsilon)+h\sum_{j=1}^{d}\omega_{j}(n_{y}^{j}+\frac{\vartheta_{j}}{4})+\frac{\epsilon}{2}\bigg(\sum_{j=1}^{d_{0}}\lambda_{j}
  (n_{u}^{j}+\frac{1}{2})+\sum_{j=1}^{d_{0}}\tilde{\lambda}_{j}(n_{v}^{j}+\frac{1}{2})\bigg)+O(\epsilon\exp(-ch^{\frac{1}{\alpha-1}})),
  \end{align*}
  where $\alpha&gt;1$ is Gevrey index, $\vartheta$ represents the Maslov index of the torus.
  This spectral expression captures the detailed structure of the perturbed system, reflecting the influence of partial resonances in the classical dynamics. In particular, the resonance-induced quadratic terms give rise to clustering of eigenvalues, determined by the eigenvalues $\lambda_{j}$ and $\tilde{\lambda}_{j}$ of the associated quadratic form in the resonant variables. Moreover, the corresponding eigenfunctions exhibit semiclassical localization-quantum scarring-on lower-dimensional invariant tori formed via partial splitting under resonance.</description>

      <title>Quantum mechanical closure of partial differential equations with symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for the dynamical closure of spatiotemporal dynamics governed by partial differential equations. We employ the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics to embed the original classical dynamics into an infinite dimensional quantum mechanical system, using the space of quantum states to model the unresolved degrees of freedom of the original dynamics and the technology of quantum measurement to predict their contributions to the resolved dynamics. We use a positivity preserving discretization to project the embedded dynamics to finite dimension. Combining methods from operator valued kernels and delay embedding, we derive a compressed representation of the dynamics that is invariant under the spatial symmetries of the original dynamics. We develop a data driven formulation of the scheme that can be realized numerically and apply it to a dynamical closure problem for the shallow water equations, demonstrating that our closure model can accurately predict the main features of the true dynamics, including for out of sample initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator on spaces of exponential volume growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function associated with ball averages on spaces with exponential volume growth. We focus on discrete groups with balls defined by invariant metrics associated with a variety of length functions. Under natural assumptions on the rough radial structure of the group in question, we establish a weak-type $\mathcal{L}\left(\log \mathcal{L}\right)^{\bf c}$ maximal inequality for the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. We give a variety of examples where the rough radial structure assumptions hold, based on considerations from geometric group theory, or on analytic considerations related to the regular representation of the group. We elucidate the connections of these assumptions to a spherical coarse median inequality, to almost exact polynomial-exponential growth of balls, and to the radial rapid decay property.
  In particular, the weak-type maximal inequality in $\mathcal{L}\left(\log \mathcal{L}\right)^{\bf c}$ is established for any lattice in a connected semisimple Lie group with finite center, with respect to the distance function restricted from the Riemannian distance on symmetric space to an orbit of the lattice. It is also established for right-angled Artin groups, Coxeter groups and braid groups, for a suitable choice of word metric.
  For non-elementary word-hyperbolic group we establish that the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator with respect to balls defined by a word length satisfies the weak-type $(1,1)$ maximal inequality, which is the optimal result.</description>

      <title>Counting and equidistribution of strongly reversible closed geodesics in negative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a pinched negatively curved Riemannian orbifold, whose fundamental group has torsion of order $2$. Generalizing results of Sarnak and Erlandsson-Souto for constant curvature oriented surfaces, and with very different techniques, we give an asymptotic counting result on the number of strongly reversible periodic orbits of the geodesic flow in $M$, and prove their equidistribution towards the Bowen-Margulis measure. The result is proved in the more general setting with weights coming from thermodynamic formalism, and also in the analogous setting of graphs of groups with $2$-torsion.

      <title>Dynamic Analysis of Flexible Stepping Frames for Earthquakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the nonlinear dynamics of stepping flexible frames under seismic excitation. The conventional iterative method of solution of peak quasi-dynamic displacement of stepping frames is not guaranteed to converge. To address this limitation, we present closed-form solutions and stability criteria for displacement response of stepping flexible frames. Bifurcation of displacements in response of such systems is next studied through the extension of dynamics of stepping rigid bodies. An approximate analytical expression is presented to account for the effects of moving resonance under earthquake ground motions. The closed-form solutions for displacement demand can be readily adjusted to incorporate the influence of moving resonance on the quasi-dynamic response of stepping oscillators. While the quasi-dynamic method of analysis may be useful in the early stages of design, numerical integration of the nonlinear system of differential equations of motion is recommended for the solution of dynamic response in such applications. Implications for formal limit-state analysis of stepping response are discussed, accompanied by several examples demonstrating the procedures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Latent Diffeomorphic Dynamic Mode Decomposition (LDDMD), a new data reduction approach for the analysis of non-linear systems that combines the interpretability of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) with the predictive power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Notably, LDDMD maintains simplicity, which enhances interpretability, while effectively modeling and learning complex non-linear systems with memory, enabling accurate predictions. This is exemplified by its successful application in streamflow prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the invariants of Steiner chains consisting of four circles. In particular, we compute the invariant moments of curvatures in Steiner 4-chains and give two applications of the obtained formulas. Specifically, we present an algorithmic feasibility criterion for Steiner 4-chains and identify the poristic Steiner chains having extremal areas, which yields a generalisation of the main results of a recent paper by K.Kiradjiev. The proofs are based on the invariants of Steiner chains described by R.Schwarz and S.Tabachnikov and on the relations between the radii of neighbouring poristic circles established by P.Yiu.</description>

      <title>Some variants of the periodic tiling conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The periodic tiling conjecture (PTC) asserts, for a finitely generated Abelian group $G$ and a finite subset $F$ of $G$, that if there is a set $A$ that solves the tiling equation $\mathbb{1}_F * \mathbb{1}_A = 1$, there is also a periodic solution $\mathbb{1}_{A_{\mathrm{p}}}$. This conjecture is known to hold for some groups $G$ and fail for others. In this paper we establish three variants of the PTC. The first (due to Tim Austin) replaces the constant function $1$ on the right-hand side of the tiling equation by $0$, and the indicator functions $\mathbb{1}_F$ and $\mathbb{1}_A$ by bounded integer-valued functions. The second, which applies in $G=\mathbb{Z}^2$, replaces the right-hand side of the tiling equation by an integer-valued periodic function, and the functions $\mathbb{1}_F$ and $\mathbb{1}_A$ on the left-hand side by bounded integer-valued functions. The third (which is the most difficult to establish) is similar to the second, but retains the property of both $\mathbb{1}_A$ and $\mathbb{1}_{A_{\mathrm{p}}}$ being indicator functions; in particular, we establish the PTC for multi-tilings in $G=\mathbb{Z}^2$. As a result, we obtain the decidability of constant-level integer tilings in any finitely generated Abelian group $G$ and multi-tilings in $G=\mathbb{Z}^2$.</description>

      <title>A Sparse Bayesian Learning Algorithm for Estimation of Interaction Kernels in Motsch-Tadmor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the data-driven identification of asymmetric interaction kernels in the Motsch-Tadmor model based on observed trajectory data. The model under consideration is governed by a class of semilinear evolution equations, where the interaction kernel defines a normalized, state-dependent Laplacian operator that governs collective dynamics. To address the resulting nonlinear inverse problem, we propose a variational framework that reformulates kernel identification using the implicit form of the governing equations, reducing it to a subspace identification problem. We establish an identifiability result that characterizes conditions under which the interaction kernel can be uniquely recovered up to scale. To solve the inverse problem robustly, we develop a sparse Bayesian learning algorithm that incorporates informative priors for regularization, quantifies uncertainty, and enables principled model selection. Extensive numerical experiments on representative interacting particle systems demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and interpretability of the proposed framework across a range of noise levels and data regimes.</description>

      <title>The Restricted Three-Body Problem as a Perturbed Duffing Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the restricted circular planar three-body problem. We prove that for every negative Jacobi constant of sufficiently large magnitude, the surface of unperturbed parabolic solutions breaks to induce homoclinic tangle for all but at most finitely many mass ratios of primaries. This result is not covered by \cite{G} as the required large magnitude of the Jacobi constant is uniform across the mass ratios.
  Our approach consists of three main ingredients. First, by introducing new coordinate transformations, we reformulate the restricted three-body problem as a perturbed Duffing equation. Second, we adopt the method recently introduced in \cite{CW} to derive integral equations for the primary stable and unstable solutions. This enables us to effectively capture the order of the singularities involved and to further establish the existence and analytic dependence of the invariant manifolds on the mass ratio of the primaries and the Jacobi constant. Third, in evaluating the Poincar\'e-Melnikov integral, we take advantage of the explicit homoclinic solution of the unperturbed Duffing equation.
  Compared to existing works, our proof is significantly simpler and more direct. Moreover, the paper is self-contained: we do not rely on McGehee's analysis in \cite{Mc} to justify the applicability of the Poincar\'e-Melnikov method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the semilinear wave equation featuring the displacement dependent term $\sigma(u)\partial_t u $ and nonlinearity $f(u)$. By developing refined space-time a priori estimates under extended ranges of the nonlinearity exponents with $\sigma(u)$ and $f(u)$, the well-posedness of the weak solution is established. Furthermore, the existence of a global attractor in the naturally phase space $H^1_0(\Omega)\times L^2(\Omega)$ is obtained. Moreover, the regularity of the global attractor is established, implying that it is a bounded subset of $(H^2(\Omega)\cap H^1_0(\Omega))\times H^1_0(\Omega)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a multiplicative function $f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{C}$ is Toeplitz if and only if there are a Dirichlet character $\chi$ and a finite subset $F$ of prime numbers such that $f(n)=\chi(n)$ for each $n$ which is coprime to all numbers from $F$. All such functions bounded by~1 are necessarily pretentious and they have exactly one Furstenberg system. Moreover, we characterize the class of pretentious functions that have precisely one Furstenberg system as those being Besicovitch (rationally) almost periodic. As a consequence, we show that the corrected Elliott's conjecture implies Frantzikinakis-Host's conjecture on the uniqueness of Furstenberg system for all real-valued bounded by~1 multiplicative functions. We also clarify relations between different classes of aperiodic multiplicative functions.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we contribute to the study of the dynamics induced by the conjugation action on the space of subgroups of Baumslag-Solitar groups BS(m,n), via the mixing properties of elements asymptotically produced by suitable random walks on the group. In an acylindrically hyperbolic context, the authors of [HMO] demonstrated strong mixing situations, namely topological mu-mixing, a strengthening of high topological transitivity. Regarding non-metabelian and non-unimodular BS(m,n), we exhibit here a radically different situation on each of the pieces except one of the partition introduced in [CGLMS22] (although it is highly topologically transitive on each piece). On the other hand, when BS(m,n) is unimodular, we demonstrate the topological mu-mixing character on each of the pieces.</description>

      <title>Energetic consistency and heat transport in Fourier-Galerkin truncations of free slip 3D rotating convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the effects of energetic consistency in Fourier truncated models of the 3D Boussinesq-Coriolis (BC) equations as a case-study towards improving the realism of convective processes in climate models. As a benchmark we consider the Nusselt number, defined as the average vertical heat transport of a convective flow. A set of formulae are derived which give the ODE projection of the BC model onto any finite selection of modes. It is proven that projected ODE models obey energy relations consistent with the PDE if and only if a mode selection Criterion regarding the vertical resolution is satisfied. It is also proven that the energy relations imply the existence of a compact attractor for these ODE's, which then implies bounds on the Nusselt number. By contrast, it is proven that a broad class of energetically inconsistent models admit solutions with unbounded, exponential growth, precluding the existence of a compact attractor and giving an infinite Nusselt number. On the other hand, certain energetically inconsistent models can admit compact attractors as shown via a simple model. The above formulas are implemented in MATLAB, enabling a user to study any desired Fourier truncated model by selecting a desired finite set of Fourier modes. All code is made available on GitHub. Several numerical studies of the Nusselt number are conducted to assess the convergence of the Nusselt number with respect to increasing spatial resolution for consistent models and measure the distorting effects of inconsistency for more general solutions.</description>

      <title>A Proof of the Persistence of Anti-integrable States for Three-Dimensional Quadratic Diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional quadratic diffeomorphisms with quadratic inverse generically have five independent parameters. When some parameters approach infinity, the diffeomorphisms may exhibit a so-called anti-integrable limit in the traditional sense of Aubry and Abramovici. That is, the dynamics of the diffeomorphisms reduce to symbolic dynamics on a finite number of symbols. However, the diffeomorphisms may reduce to quadratic correspondences when parameters approach infinity, and the traditional anti-integrable limit does not deal with this situation. Meiss asked what about an anti-integrable limit for it. Remarkable progress was achieved very recently by the work of Hampton and Meiss [SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst. 21 (2022), pp. 650--675]. Using the contraction mapping theorem, they showed there is a bijection between the anti-integrable states and the sequences of branches of a quadratic correspondence. They also showed that an anti-integrable state can be continued to a genuine orbit of the three-dimensional diffeomorphism. This paper aims to contribute to the progress, by means of the implicit function theorem. We shall show that, under a slightly more restricted condition than that imposed by Hampton and Meiss, the bijection indeed is a topological conjugacy and establish the uniform hyperbolicity of the continued genuine orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build a Shannon orbit equivalence between the universal odometer and a variety of rank-one systems. This is done in a unified manner, using what we call flexible classes of rank-one transformations. Our main result is that every flexible class contains an element which is Shannon orbit equivalent to the universal odometer. Since a typical example of flexible class is $\{T\}$ when $T$ is an odometer, our work generalizes a recent result by Kerr and Li, stating that every odometer is Shannon orbit equivalent to the universal odometer. When the flexible class is a singleton, the rank-one transformation given by the main result is explicit. This applies to odometers and Chacon's map. We also prove that strongly mixing systems, systems with a given eigenvalue, or irrational rotations whose angle belongs to any fixed open subset of the real line form flexible classes. In particular, strong mixing, rationality or irrationality of the eigenvalues are not preserved under Shannon orbit equivalence.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Birkhoff sections in a 3-manifold foliated by invariant tori. We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for various types of periodic orbits to serve as boundary orbits of a Birkhoff section. The construction relies on the dynamical behaviour of the flow combined with fundamental topological argument. As an application, we study the boundaries of toric domains and the energy hypersurfaces of separable Hamiltonian systems, providing conditions for the existence or non-existence of different types of Birkhoff sections. Additionally, we offer an alternative proof of part of the results presented in [23] and [14].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In one-dimensional Diophantine approximation, the Diophantine properties of a real number are characterized by its partial quotients, especially the growth of its large partial quotients. Notably, Kleinbock and Wadleigh [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 2018] made a seminal contribution by linking the improvability of Dirichlet's theorem to the growth of the product of consecutive partial quotients. In this paper, we extend the concept of Dirichlet non-improvable sets within the framework of shrinking target problems. Specifically, consider the dynamical system $([0,1), T)$ of continued fractions. Let $\{z_n\}_{n \ge 1}$ be a sequence of real numbers in $[0,1]$ and let $B &gt; 1$. We determine the Hausdorff dimension of the following set:
  \[
  \begin{split}
  \{x\in[0,1):|T^nx-z_n||T^{n+1}x-Tz_n|&lt;B^{-n}\text{ infinitely often}\}.
  \end{split}

      <title>The evolutionary advantage of guilt: co-evolution of social and non-social guilt in structured populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building ethical machines may involve bestowing upon them the emotional capacity to self-evaluate and repent on their actions. While apologies represent potential strategic interactions, the explicit evolution of guilt as a behavioural trait remains poorly understood. Our study delves into the co-evolution of two forms of emotional guilt: social guilt entails a cost, requiring agents to exert efforts to understand others' internal states and behaviours; and non-social guilt, which only involves awareness of one's own state, incurs no social cost. Resorting to methods from evolutionary game theory, we study analytically, and through extensive numerical and agent-based simulations, whether and how guilt can evolve and deploy, depending on the underlying structure of the systems of agents. Our findings reveal that in lattice and scale-free networks, strategies favouring emotional guilt dominate a broader range of guilt and social costs compared to non-structured well-mixed populations, so leading to higher levels of cooperation. In structured populations, both social and non-social guilt can thrive through clustering with emotionally inclined strategies, thereby providing protection against exploiters, particularly for less costly non-social strategies. These insights shed light on the complex interplay of guilt and cooperation, enhancing our understanding of ethical artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>On pairs of spectrum maximizing products with distinct factor multiplicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10513v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Bochi and Laskawiec constructed an example of a set of matrices $\{A,B\}$ having two different (up to cyclic permutations of factors) spectrum maximizing products, $AABABB$ and $BBABAA$. In this paper, we identify a class of matrix sets for which the existence of at least one spectrum maximizing product with an odd number of factors automatically entails the existence of another spectrum maximizing product. Moreover, in addition to Bochi--Laskawiec's example, the number of factors of the same name (factors of the form $A$ or $B$) in these matrix products turns out to be different. The efficiency of the proposed approach is confirmed by constructing an example of a set of $2\times2$ matrices $\{A,B\}$ that has spectrum maximizing products of the form $BAA$ and $BBA$.</description>

      <title>Undecidability in the Ramsey theory of polynomial equations and Hilbert's tenth problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that several sets of interest arising from the study of partition regularity and density Ramsey theory of polynomial equations over integral domains are undecidable. In particular, we show that the set of homogeneous polynomials $p \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$ for which the equation $p(x_1,\cdots,x_n) = 0$ is partition regular over $\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$ is undecidable conditional on Hilbert's tenth problem for $\mathbb{Q}$. For other integral domains, we get the analogous result unconditionally. More generally, we determine the exact lightface complexity of the various sets of interest. For example, we show that the set of homogeneous polynomials $p \in \mathbb{F}_q(t)[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$ for which the equation $p(x_1,\cdots,x_n) = 0$ is partition regular over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)\setminus\{0\}$ is $\Pi_2^0$-complete.
  We also prove several other results of independent interest. These include a compactness principle and a uniformity principle for density Ramsey theory on countable cancellative left amenable semigroups, as well as the existence of the natural extension for measure preserving systems of countable cancellative left reversible semigroups.</description>

      <title>Pareto-Nash Allocations under Incomplete Information: A Model of Stable Optima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior literature on two-firm two-market and two-stage extended dynamic models has introduced what Guth (2016) succinctly terms a social dilemma. A state in which conglomerate firms competing in a Bertrand duopoly consider jointly optimizing profits under a tacit self-enforcing agreement to deter market entry. This theoretical article reinterprets the social dilemma highlighted by Guth (2016) not only in the context of allocation but also through the lens of competition where entry must legally be permitted even if cooperative signalling would otherwise sustain joint profitability. This study explores the significance of a sufficiency condition on each firm's non-instantaneous reaction function requiring the maintenance of a stable long-run equilibrium through retaliative restraint characterized by either two negative eigenvalues or a saddle-path trajectory.</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis of multiplicative chaos Part II: Fourier dimensions of classical multiplicative chaos measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified approach for studying the polynomial Fourier decay of classical multiplicative chaos measures. As consequences, we obtain the precise Fourier dimensions for multiplicative chaos measures arising from the following key models: the sub-critical 1D and 2D GMC; the sub-critical $d$-dimensional GMC with $d \ge 3$ when the parameter $\gamma$ is near the critical value; the canonical Mandelbrot random coverings; the canonical Mandelbrot cascades. For various other models, we establish the non-trivial lower bounds of the Fourier dimensions and in various cases we conjecture that they are all optimal and provide the exact value of the Fourier dimensions.</description>
