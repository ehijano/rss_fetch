      <title>Progress Towards Decoding Visual Imagery via fNIRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07662v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the possibility of reconstructing images from fNIRS brain activity and start building a prototype to match the required specs. By training an image reconstruction model on downsampled fMRI data, we discovered that cm-scale spatial resolution is sufficient for image generation. We obtained 71% retrieval accuracy with 1-cm resolution, compared to 93% on the full-resolution fMRI, and 20% with 2-cm resolution. With simulations and high-density tomography, we found that time-domain fNIRS can achieve 1-cm resolution, compared to 2-cm resolution for continuous-wave fNIRS. Lastly, we share designs for a prototype time-domain fNIRS device, consisting of a laser driver, a single photon detector, and a time-to-digital converter system.</description>

      <title>Gene-Level Representation Learning via Interventional Style Transfer in Optical Pooled Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical pooled screening (OPS) combines automated microscopy and genetic perturbations to systematically study gene function in a scalable and cost-effective way. Leveraging the resulting data requires extracting biologically informative representations of cellular perturbation phenotypes from images. We employ a style-transfer approach to learn gene-level feature representations from images of genetically perturbed cells obtained via OPS. Our method outperforms widely used engineered features in clustering gene representations according to gene function, demonstrating its utility for uncovering latent biological relationships. This approach offers a promising alternative to investigate the role of genes in health and disease.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray luminescence is produced when contrast agents absorb energy from X-ray photons and release a portion of that energy by emitting photons in the visible and near-infrared range. X-ray luminescence computed tomography (XLCT) was introduced in the past decade as a hybrid molecular imaging modality combining the merits of both X-ray imaging (high spatial resolution) and optical imaging (high sensitivity to tracer nanophosphors).</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Sequence Combinations on Breast Tumor Segmentation in Multiparametric MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is a key tool for assessing breast cancer progression. Although deep learning has been applied to automate tumor segmentation in breast MRI, the effect of sequence combinations in mpMRI remains under-investigated. This study explores the impact of different combinations of T2-weighted (T2w), dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map on breast tumor segmentation using nnU-Net. Evaluated on a multicenter mpMRI dataset, the nnU-Net model using DCE sequences achieved a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.18 for functional tumor volume (FTV) segmentation. For whole tumor mask (WTM) segmentation, adding the predicted FTV to DWI and ADC map improved the DSC from 0.57 $\pm$ 0.24 to 0.60 $\pm$ 0.21. Adding T2w did not yield significant improvement, which still requires further investigation under a more standardized imaging protocol. This study serves as a foundation for future work on predicting breast cancer treatment response using mpMRI.</description>

      <title>Micro-expression recognition based on depth map to point cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-expressions are nonverbal facial expressions that reveal the covert emotions of individuals, making the micro-expression recognition task receive widespread attention. However, the micro-expression recognition task is challenging due to the subtle facial motion and brevity in duration. Many 2D image-based methods have been developed in recent years to recognize MEs effectively, but, these approaches are restricted by facial texture information and are susceptible to environmental factors, such as lighting. Conversely, depth information can effectively represent motion information related to facial structure changes and is not affected by lighting. Motion information derived from facial structures can describe motion features that pixel textures cannot delineate. We proposed a network for micro-expression recognition based on facial depth information, and our experiments have demonstrated the crucial role of depth maps in the micro-expression recognition task. Initially, we transform the depth map into a point cloud and obtain the motion information for each point by aligning the initiating frame with the apex frame and performing a differential operation. Subsequently, we adjusted all point cloud motion feature input dimensions and used them as inputs for multiple point cloud networks to assess the efficacy of this representation. PointNet++ was chosen as the ultimate outcome for micro-expression recognition due to its superior performance. Our experiments show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the existing deep learning methods, including the baseline, on the $CAS(ME)^3$ dataset, which includes depth information.</description>

      <title>On Annotation-free Optimization of Video Coding for Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today, image and video data is not only viewed by humans, but also automatically analyzed by computer vision algorithms. However, current coding standards are optimized for human perception. Emerging from this, research on video coding for machines tries to develop coding methods designed for machines as information sink. Since many of these algorithms are based on neural networks, most proposals for video coding for machines build upon neural compression. So far, optimizing the compression by applying the task loss of the analysis network, for which ground truth data is needed, is achieving the best coding performance. But ground truth data is difficult to obtain and thus an optimization without ground truth is preferred. In this paper, we present an annotation-free optimization strategy for video coding for machines. We measure the distortion by calculating the task loss of the analysis network. Therefore, the predictions on the compressed image are compared with the predictions on the original image, instead of the ground truth data. Our results show that this strategy can even outperform training with ground truth data with rate savings of up to 7.5 %. By using the non-annotated training data, the rate gains can be further increased up to 8.2 %.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Frequency Dual Progressive Attention Network For Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In medical images, various types of lesions often manifest significant differences in their shape and texture. Accurate medical image segmentation demands deep learning models with robust capabilities in multi-scale and boundary feature learning. However, previous networks still have limitations in addressing the above issues. Firstly, previous networks simultaneously fuse multi-level features or employ deep supervision to enhance multi-scale learning. However, this may lead to feature redundancy and excessive computational overhead, which is not conducive to network training and clinical deployment. Secondly, the majority of medical image segmentation networks exclusively learn features in the spatial domain, disregarding the abundant global information in the frequency domain. This results in a bias towards low-frequency components, neglecting crucial high-frequency information. To address these problems, we introduce SF-UNet, a spatial-frequency dual-domain attention network. It comprises two main components: the Multi-scale Progressive Channel Attention (MPCA) block, which progressively extract multi-scale features across adjacent encoder layers, and the lightweight Frequency-Spatial Attention (FSA) block, with only 0.05M parameters, enabling concurrent learning of texture and boundary features from both spatial and frequency domains. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed SF-UNet on three public datasets. Experimental results show that compared to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) medical image segmentation networks, SF-UNet achieves the best performance, and achieves up to 9.4\% and 10.78\% improvement in DSC and IOU. Codes will be released at https://github.com/nkicsl/SF-UNet.</description>

      <title>3D CBCT Challenge 2024: Improved Cone Beam CT Reconstruction using SwinIR-Based Sinogram and Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the 3D CBCT Challenge 2024, a part of ICASSP SP Grand Challenges 2024. Improvement in Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) reconstruction has been achieved by integrating Swin Image Restoration (SwinIR) based sinogram and image enhancement modules. The proposed methodology uses Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent (NAG) to solve the least squares (NAG-LS) problem in CT image reconstruction. The integration of sinogram and image enhancement modules aims to enhance image clarity and preserve fine details, offering a promising solution for both low dose and clinical dose CBCT reconstruction. The averaged mean squared error (MSE) over the validation dataset has decreased significantly, in the case of low dose by one-fifth and clinical dose by one-tenth. Our solution is one of the top 5 approaches in this challenge.</description>

      <title>The impact of deep learning aid on the workload and interpretation accuracy of radiologists on chest computed tomography: a cross-over reader study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretation of chest computed tomography (CT) is time-consuming. Previous studies have measured the time-saving effect of using a deep-learning-based aid (DLA) for CT interpretation. We evaluated the joint impact of a multi-pathology DLA on the time and accuracy of radiologists' reading.
  40 radiologists were randomly split into three experimental arms: control (10), who interpret studies without assistance; informed group (10), who were briefed about DLA pathologies, but performed readings without it; and the experimental group (20), who interpreted half studies with DLA, and half without. Every arm used the same 200 CT studies retrospectively collected from BIMCV-COVID19 dataset; each radiologist provided readings for 20 CT studies. We compared interpretation time, and accuracy of participants diagnostic report with respect to 12 pathological findings.
  Mean reading time per study was 15.6 minutes [SD 8.5] in the control arm, 13.2 minutes [SD 8.7] in the informed arm, 14.4 [SD 10.3] in the experimental arm without DLA, and 11.4 minutes [SD 7.8] in the experimental arm with DLA. Mean sensitivity and specificity were 41.5 [SD 30.4], 86.8 [SD 28.3] in the control arm; 53.5 [SD 22.7], 92.3 [SD 9.4] in the informed non-assisted arm; 63.2 [SD 16.4], 92.3 [SD 8.2] in the experimental arm without DLA; and 91.6 [SD 7.2], 89.9 [SD 6.0] in the experimental arm with DLA. DLA speed up interpretation time per study by 2.9 minutes (CI95 [1.7, 4.3], p&lt;0.0005), increased sensitivity by 28.4 (CI95 [23.4, 33.4], p&lt;0.0005), and decreased specificity by 2.4 (CI95 [0.6, 4.3], p=0.13).
  Of 20 radiologists in the experimental arm, 16 have improved reading time and sensitivity, two improved their time with a marginal drop in sensitivity, and two participants improved sensitivity with increased time. Overall, DLA introduction decreased reading time by 20.6%.</description>

      <title>One-Step Effective Diffusion Network for Real-World Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have been increasingly employed to tackle the real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) problem due to their powerful generative image priors. Most of the existing methods start from random noise to reconstruct the high-quality (HQ) image under the guidance of the given low-quality (LQ) image. While promising results have been achieved, such Real- ISR methods require multiple diffusion steps to reproduce the HQ image, increasing the computational cost. Meanwhile, the random noise introduces uncertainty in the output, which is unfriendly to image restoration tasks. To address these issues, we propose a one-step effective diffusion network, namely OSEDiff, for the Real- ISR problem. We argue that the LQ image contains rich information to restore its HQ counterpart, and hence the given LQ image can be directly taken as the starting point for diffusion, eliminating the uncertainty introduced by random noise sampling. We finetune the pre-trained diffusion network with trainable layers to adapt it to complex image degradations. To ensure that the one-step diffusion model could yield HQ Real-ISR output, we apply variational score distillation in the latent space to conduct KL-divergence regularization. As a result, our OSEDiff model can efficiently and effectively generate HQ images in just one diffusion step. Our experiments demonstrate that OSEDiff achieves comparable or even better Real-ISR results, in terms of both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, than previous diffusion model based Real-ISR methods that require dozens or hundreds of steps. The source codes will be released at https://github.com/cswry/OSEDiff.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Representation Learning of Cardiac MRI via Attribute Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretability is essential in medical imaging to ensure that clinicians can comprehend and trust artificial intelligence models. Several approaches have been recently considered to encode attributes in the latent space to enhance its interpretability. Notably, attribute regularization aims to encode a set of attributes along the dimensions of a latent representation. However, this approach is based on Variational AutoEncoder and suffers from blurry reconstruction. In this paper, we propose an Attributed-regularized Soft Introspective Variational Autoencoder that combines attribute regularization of the latent space within the framework of an adversarially trained variational autoencoder. We demonstrate on short-axis cardiac Magnetic Resonance images of the UK Biobank the ability of the proposed method to address blurry reconstruction issues of variational autoencoder methods while preserving the latent space interpretability.</description>

      <title>From Chaos to Clarity: 3DGS in the Dark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis from raw images provides superior high dynamic range (HDR) information compared to reconstructions from low dynamic range RGB images. However, the inherent noise in unprocessed raw images compromises the accuracy of 3D scene representation. Our study reveals that 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is particularly susceptible to this noise, leading to numerous elongated Gaussian shapes that overfit the noise, thereby significantly degrading reconstruction quality and reducing inference speed, especially in scenarios with limited views. To address these issues, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning framework designed to reconstruct HDR 3DGS from a limited number of noisy raw images. This framework enhances 3DGS by integrating a noise extractor and employing a noise-robust reconstruction loss that leverages a noise distribution prior. Experimental results show that our method outperforms LDR/HDR 3DGS and previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised and supervised pre-trained models in both reconstruction quality and inference speed on the RawNeRF dataset across a broad range of training views. Code can be found in \url{https://lizhihao6.github.io/Raw3DGS}.</description>

      <title>On Evaluating Adversarial Robustness of Volumetric Medical Segmentation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volumetric medical segmentation models have achieved significant success on organ and tumor-based segmentation tasks in recent years. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored, raising serious concerns regarding the real-world deployment of tools employing such models in the healthcare sector. This underscores the importance of investigating the robustness of existing models. In this context, our work aims to empirically examine the adversarial robustness across current volumetric segmentation architectures, encompassing Convolutional, Transformer, and Mamba-based models. We extend this investigation across four volumetric segmentation datasets, evaluating robustness under both white box and black box adversarial attacks. Overall, we observe that while both pixel and frequency-based attacks perform reasonably well under white box setting, the latter performs significantly better under transfer-based black box attacks. Across our experiments, we observe transformer-based models show higher robustness than convolution-based models with Mamba-based models being the most vulnerable. Additionally, we show that large-scale training of volumetric segmentation models improves the model's robustness against adversarial attacks. The code and pretrained models will be made available at https://github.com/HashmatShadab/Robustness-of-Volumetric-Medical-Segmentation-Models.</description>

      <title>A novel method for identifying rice seed purity based on hybrid machine learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the grain industry, the identification of seed purity is a crucial task as it is an important factor in evaluating the quality of seeds. For rice seeds, this property allows for the reduction of unexpected influences of other varieties on rice yield, nutrient composition, and price. However, in practice, they are often mixed with seeds from others. This study proposes a novel method for automatically identifying the rice seed purity of a certain rice variety based on hybrid machine learning algorithms. The main idea is to use deep learning architectures for extracting important features from the raw data and then use machine learning algorithms for classification. Several experiments are conducted following a practical implementation to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The obtained results show that the novel method improves significantly the performance of existing methods. Thus, it can be applied to design effective identification systems for rice seed purity.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Machine Learning Driven Material Defect Detection: Challenges, Solutions, and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07880</link>

Abstract: Material defects (MD) represent a primary challenge affecting product performance and giving rise to safety issues in related products. The rapid and accurate identification and localization of MD constitute crucial research endeavours in addressing contemporary challenges associated with MD. Although conventional non-destructive testing methods such as ultrasonic and X-ray approaches have mitigated issues related to low efficiency in manual inspections, they struggle to meet the diverse requirements of high precision, real-time speed, automation, and intelligence. In recent years, propelled by the swift advancement of machine learning (ML) technologies, particularly exemplified by deep learning, ML has swiftly emerged as the core technology and a prominent research direction for material defect detection (MDD). Through a comprehensive review of the latest literature, we systematically survey the ML techniques applied in MDD into five categories: unsupervised learning, supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and generative learning. We provide a detailed analysis of the main principles and techniques used, together with the advantages and potential challenges associated with these techniques. Furthermore, the survey focuses on the techniques for defect detection in composite materials, which are important types of materials enjoying increasingly wide application in various industries such as aerospace, automotive, construction, and renewable energy. Finally, the survey explores potential future directions in MDD utilizing ML technologies. This comprehensive survey not only consolidates existing literature on ML-based MDD technologies but also serves as a foundational reference for future researchers and industrial practitioners, providing valuable insights and guidance in developing advanced and efficient MDD systems.</description>

      <title>WMAdapter: Adding WaterMark Control to Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Watermarking is crucial for protecting the copyright of AI-generated images. We propose WMAdapter, a diffusion model watermark plugin that takes user-specified watermark information and allows for seamless watermark imprinting during the diffusion generation process. WMAdapter is efficient and robust, with a strong emphasis on high generation quality. To achieve this, we make two key designs: (1) We develop a contextual adapter structure that is lightweight and enables effective knowledge transfer from heavily pretrained post-hoc watermarking models. (2) We introduce an extra finetuning step and design a hybrid finetuning strategy to further improve image quality and eliminate tiny artifacts. Empirical results demonstrate that WMAdapter offers strong flexibility, exceptional image generation quality and competitive watermark robustness.</description>

      <title>2.5D Multi-view Averaging Diffusion Model for 3D Medical Image Translation: Application to Low-count PET Reconstruction with CT-less Attenuation Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an important clinical imaging tool but inevitably introduces radiation hazards to patients and healthcare providers. Reducing the tracer injection dose and eliminating the CT acquisition for attenuation correction can reduce the overall radiation dose, but often results in PET with high noise and bias. Thus, it is desirable to develop 3D methods to translate the non-attenuation-corrected low-dose PET (NAC-LDPET) into attenuation-corrected standard-dose PET (AC-SDPET). Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a new state-of-the-art deep learning method for image-to-image translation, better than traditional CNN-based methods. However, due to the high computation cost and memory burden, it is largely limited to 2D applications. To address these challenges, we developed a novel 2.5D Multi-view Averaging Diffusion Model (MADM) for 3D image-to-image translation with application on NAC-LDPET to AC-SDPET translation. Specifically, MADM employs separate diffusion models for axial, coronal, and sagittal views, whose outputs are averaged in each sampling step to ensure the 3D generation quality from multiple views. To accelerate the 3D sampling process, we also proposed a strategy to use the CNN-based 3D generation as a prior for the diffusion model. Our experimental results on human patient studies suggested that MADM can generate high-quality 3D translation images, outperforming previous CNN-based and Diffusion-based baseline methods.</description>

      <title>SE(3)-Equivariant and Noise-Invariant 3D Rigid Motion Tracking in Brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rigid motion tracking is paramount in many medical imaging applications where movements need to be detected, corrected, or accounted for. Modern strategies rely on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and pose this problem as rigid registration. Yet, CNNs do not exploit natural symmetries in this task, as they are equivariant to translations (their outputs shift with their inputs) but not to rotations. Here we propose EquiTrack, the first method that uses recent steerable SE(3)-equivariant CNNs (E-CNN) for motion tracking. While steerable E-CNNs can extract corresponding features across different poses, testing them on noisy medical images reveals that they do not have enough learning capacity to learn noise invariance. Thus, we introduce a hybrid architecture that pairs a denoiser with an E-CNN to decouple the processing of anatomically irrelevant intensity features from the extraction of equivariant spatial features. Rigid transforms are then estimated in closed-form. EquiTrack outperforms state-of-the-art learning and optimisation methods for motion tracking in adult brain MRI and fetal MRI time series. Our code is available at https://github.com/BBillot/EquiTrack.</description>

      <title>Provably Robust Score-Based Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Plug-and-Play Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a great number of tasks in science and engineering, the goal is to infer an unknown image from a small number of measurements collected from a known forward model describing certain sensing or imaging modality. Due to resource constraints, this task is often extremely ill-posed, which necessitates the adoption of expressive prior information to regularize the solution space. Score-based diffusion models, due to its impressive empirical success, have emerged as an appealing candidate of an expressive prior in image reconstruction. In order to accommodate diverse tasks at once, it is of great interest to develop efficient, consistent and robust algorithms that incorporate unconditional score functions of an image prior distribution in conjunction with flexible choices of forward models.
  This work develops an algorithmic framework for employing score-based diffusion models as an expressive data prior in general nonlinear inverse problems. Motivated by the plug-and-play framework in the imaging community, we introduce a diffusion plug-and-play method (DPnP) that alternatively calls two samplers, a proximal consistency sampler based solely on the likelihood function of the forward model, and a denoising diffusion sampler based solely on the score functions of the image prior. The key insight is that denoising under white Gaussian noise can be solved rigorously via both stochastic (i.e., DDPM-type) and deterministic (i.e., DDIM-type) samplers using the unconditional score functions. We establish both asymptotic and non-asymptotic performance guarantees of DPnP, and provide numerical experiments to illustrate its promise in solving both linear and nonlinear image reconstruction tasks. To the best of our knowledge, DPnP is the first provably-robust posterior sampling method for nonlinear inverse problems using unconditional diffusion priors.</description>

      <title>Correlation-aware Coarse-to-fine MLPs for Deformable Medical Image Registration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deformable image registration is a fundamental step for medical image analysis. Recently, transformers have been used for registration and outperformed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Transformers can capture long-range dependence among image features, which have been shown beneficial for registration. However, due to the high computation/memory loads of self-attention, transformers are typically used at downsampled feature resolutions and cannot capture fine-grained long-range dependence at the full image resolution. This limits deformable registration as it necessitates precise dense correspondence between each image pixel. Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without self-attention are efficient in computation/memory usage, enabling the feasibility of capturing fine-grained long-range dependence at full resolution. Nevertheless, MLPs have not been extensively explored for image registration and are lacking the consideration of inductive bias crucial for medical registration tasks. In this study, we propose the first correlation-aware MLP-based registration network (CorrMLP) for deformable medical image registration. Our CorrMLP introduces a correlation-aware multi-window MLP block in a novel coarse-to-fine registration architecture, which captures fine-grained multi-range dependence to perform correlation-aware coarse-to-fine registration. Extensive experiments with seven public medical datasets show that our CorrMLP outperforms state-of-the-art deformable registration methods.</description>

      <title>Approximation properties relative to continuous scale space for hybrid discretizations of Gaussian derivative operators</title>

Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of properties of two hybrid discretization methods for Gaussian derivatives, based on convolutions with either the normalized sampled Gaussian kernel or the integrated Gaussian kernel followed by central differences. The motivation for studying these discretization methods is that in situations when multiple spatial derivatives of different order are needed at the same scale level, they can be computed significantly more efficiently compared to more direct derivative approximations based on explicit convolutions with either sampled Gaussian kernels or integrated Gaussian kernels.
  While these computational benefits do also hold for the genuinely discrete approach for computing discrete analogues of Gaussian derivatives, based on convolution with the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel followed by central differences, the underlying mathematical primitives for the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, in terms of modified Bessel functions of integer order, may not be available in certain frameworks for image processing, such as when performing deep learning based on scale-parameterized filters in terms of Gaussian derivatives, with learning of the scale levels.
  In this paper, we present a characterization of the properties of these hybrid discretization methods, in terms of quantitative performance measures concerning the amount of spatial smoothing that they imply, as well as the relative consistency of scale estimates obtained from scale-invariant feature detectors with automatic scale selection, with an emphasis on the behaviour for very small values of the scale parameter, which may differ significantly from corresponding results obtained from the fully continuous scale-space theory, as well as between different types of discretization methods.</description>

      <title>Diffusion models for Gaussian distributions: Exact solutions and Wasserstein errors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion or score-based models recently showed high performance in image generation. They rely on a forward and a backward stochastic differential equations (SDE). The sampling of a data distribution is achieved by solving numerically the backward SDE or its associated flow ODE. Studying the convergence of these models necessitates to control four different types of error: the initialization error, the truncation error, the discretization and the score approximation. In this paper, we study theoretically the behavior of diffusion models and their numerical implementation when the data distribution is Gaussian. In this restricted framework where the score function is a linear operator, we can derive the analytical solutions of the forward and backward SDEs as well as the associated flow ODE. This provides exact expressions for various Wasserstein errors which enable us to compare the influence of each error type for any sampling scheme, thus allowing to monitor convergence directly in the data space instead of relying on Inception features. Our experiments show that the recommended numerical schemes from the diffusion models literature are also the best sampling schemes for Gaussian distributions.</description>

      <title>Towards Realistic Data Generation for Real-World Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing image super-resolution (SR) techniques often fail to generalize effectively in complex real-world settings due to the significant divergence between training data and practical scenarios. To address this challenge, previous efforts have either manually simulated intricate physical-based degradations or utilized learning-based techniques, yet these approaches remain inadequate for producing large-scale, realistic, and diverse data simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce a novel Realistic Decoupled Data Generator (RealDGen), an unsupervised learning data generation framework designed for real-world super-resolution. We meticulously develop content and degradation extraction strategies, which are integrated into a novel content-degradation decoupled diffusion model to create realistic low-resolution images from unpaired real LR and HR images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDGen excels in generating large-scale, high-quality paired data that mirrors real-world degradations, significantly advancing the performance of popular SR models on various real-world benchmarks.</description>
