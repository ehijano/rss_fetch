      <title>Pseudo-Bifurcations in Stochastic Non-Normal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We challenge the prevailing emphasis on bifurcations as the primary mechanism behind many abrupt changes in complex systems and propose an alternative, more universally applicable explanation based on non-normal dynamics. We demonstrate that linear or approximately linear stochastic systems near a dynamical attractor exhibit transient repulsive dynamics - termed pseudo-bifurcations - when interacting components are sufficiently asymmetric and hierarchically organized, i.e., non-normal. These pseudo-bifurcations produce early-warning signals commonly linked to bifurcations, such as dimension reduction, critical slowing down, and increased variance. Furthermore, we show that, as actual bifurcations approach, non-normal transients also emerge, complicating their distinction and potentially creating a bias that suggests the system is much closer to a critical point than it actually is. We support our analytical derivations by empirically demonstrating that the brain exhibits clear signs of such non-normal transients during epileptic seizures. Many systems suspected of approaching critical bifurcation points should be reconsidered, as non-normal dynamics offer a more generic explanation for the observed phenomena across natural, physical, and social systems.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation analysis of quasi-periodic orbits of mechanical systems with 1:2 internal resonance via spectral submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 1:2 internally resonant mechanical system can undergo secondary Hopf (Neimark-Sacker) bifurcations, resulting in a quasi-periodic response when the system is subject to harmonic excitation. While these quasi-periodic orbits have been observed in practice, their bifurcations are not well studied, especially in high-dimensional mechanical systems. This is mainly because of the challenges associated with the computation and bifurcation detection of these quasi-periodic motions. Here we present a computational framework to address these challenges via reductions on spectral submanifolds, which transforms quasi-periodic orbits of high-dimensional systems as limit cycles of four-dimensional reduced-order models. We apply the proposed framework to analyze bifurcations of quasi-periodic orbits in several mechanical systems exhibiting 1:2 internal resonance, including a finite element model of a shallow-curved shell. We uncover local bifurcations such as period-doubling and saddle-node, as well as global bifurcations such as homoclinic connections, isolas, and simple bifurcations of quasi-periodic orbits. We also observe cascades of period-doubling bifurcations of quasi-periodic orbits that eventually result in chaotic motions, as well as the coexistence of chaotic and quasi-periodic attractors. These findings elucidate the complex bifurcation mechanism of quasi-periodic orbits in 1:2 internally resonant systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring Geometrical Properties of Chaotic Systems Through an Analysis of the Rulkov Neuron Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While extensive research has been conducted on chaos emerging from a dynamical system's temporal dynamics, our research examines extreme sensitivity to initial conditions in discrete-time dynamical systems from a geometrical perspective. Specifically, we develop methods of detecting, classifying, and quantifying geometric structures that lead to chaotic behavior in maps, including certain bifurcations, fractal geometry, strange attractors, multistability, fractal basin boundaries, and Wada basins of attraction. We also develop slow-fast dynamical systems theory for discrete-time systems, with a specific application to modeling the spiking and bursting behavior emerging from the electrophysiology of biological neurons. Our research mainly focuses on two simple low-dimensional slow-fast Rulkov maps, which model both non-chaotic and chaotic spiking-bursting neuronal behavior. We begin by exploring the maps' individual dynamics and parameter spaces, performing bifurcation analyses, describing and quantifying their chaotic dynamics, and modeling an injection of current into them. Then, by putting these neurons into different physical arrangements and coupling them with a flow of current, we find that complex dynamics and geometries emerge from the existence of multistability and final state sensitivity in higher-dimensional state space. We then analyze the complexity and fractalization of these coupled neuron systems' attractors and basin boundaries using our mathematical and computational methods. This paper begins with a conversational introduction to the geometry of chaos, then integrates mathematics, physics, neurobiology, computational modeling, and electrochemistry to present original research that provides a novel perspective on how types of geometrical sensitivity to initial conditions appear in discrete-time neuron systems.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue and pseudospectrum processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with rank 1 perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies on a time-dependent random matrix model called the non-Hermitian matrix-valued Brownian motion, we propose two kinds of dynamical processes of $n \times n$ matrices generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices. As a deterministic rank 1 perturbation, $\delta J$ is added at time $m \leq n$, where $\delta \in {\mathbb{C}}$ and $J$ is the all-ones matrix. For each process, first we report the complicated motion of the eigenvalues which are numerically calculated. Then we derive the specific equation which determines the motion of non-zero eigenvalues and clarifies the time-dependence of degeneracy of the zero-eigenvalue. The Catalan numbers play an important role to describe an outlier of non-zero eigenvalues. Comparison with the solutions of this equation, it is concluded that the numerically observed non-zero eigenvalues distributing around the zero-eigenvalue are not the exact eigenvalues of the original system but of the system perturbed by uncontrolled rounding errors of computer. This phenomenon implies the high sensitivity of the degenerated zero-eigenvalue to random dense perturbations. The domain in which the eigenvalues of randomly perturbed system are distributed is identified with the pseudospectrum including the zero-eigenvalue of the original system with $\delta J$. We characterize the pseudospectrum processes using the symbol curves of the corresponding nonnormal Toeplitz operators without $\delta J$. We report new phenomena in our second model such that at each time the outermost closed simple curve cut out from the symbol curve is realized as the exact eigenvalues, but the inner part of symbol curve is reduced in size and embedded in the pseudospectrum including the zero-eigenvalue. The asymptotics of the processes in the infinite-matrix limit $n \to \infty$ are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot forecasting of chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15771</link>

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is a challenging problem that traditionally requires specialized models custom-trained for the specific task at hand. Recently, inspired by the success of large language models, foundation models pre-trained on vast amounts of time-series data from diverse domains have emerged as a promising candidate for general-purpose time-series forecasting. The defining characteristic of these foundation models is their ability to perform zero-shot learning, that is, forecasting a new system from limited context data without explicit re-training or fine-tuning. Here, we evaluate whether the zero-shot learning paradigm extends to the challenging task of forecasting chaotic systems. Across 135 distinct chaotic dynamical systems and $10^8$ timepoints, we find that foundation models produce competitive forecasts compared to custom-trained models (including NBEATS, TiDE, etc.), particularly when training data is limited. Interestingly, even after point forecasts fail, large foundation models are able to preserve the geometric and statistical properties of the chaotic attractors. We attribute this success to foundation models' ability to perform in-context learning and identify context parroting as a simple mechanism used by these models to capture the long-term behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight the potential of foundation models as a tool for probing nonlinear and complex systems.</description>

      <title>Partial suppression of chaos in relativistic 3-body problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent numerical results seem to suggest that in certain regimes of typical particle velocities the gravitational $N-$body problem (for $3\leq N\lesssim 10^3$) is intrinsically less chaotic when the post-Newtonian (PN) force terms are included, with respect to its classical counterpart that exhibits a slightly larger maximal Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda_{\rm max}$. In this work we explore the dynamics of wildly chaotic, regular and nearly regular configurations of the 3-body problem with and without the PN corrective terms aiming at shedding some light on the behaviour of the Lyapunov spectra under the effect of said corrections. Because the interaction of the tangent-space dynamics in gravitating systems, needed to evaluate the Lyapunov exponents, becomes rapidly computationally heavy due to the complexity of the higher order force derivatives involving multiple powers of $v/c$, we introduce a technique to compute a proxy of the Lyapunov spectrum based on the time-dependent diagonalization of the inertia tensor of a cluster of trajectories in phase-space. We find that, for a broad range of orbital configurations, the relativistic 3-body problem has a smaller $\Lambda_{\rm max}$ than its classical counterpart starting with the exact same initial condition. However, the rest of the Lyapunov spectrum can be either lower or larger in the classical case, suggesting that the relativistic precession effectively reduces chaos only along one (or few) directions in phase-space. As a general trend, the dynamical entropy of the relativistic simulations as function of the rescaled speed of light always has a regime in which falls below the classical value.} We observe that, the sole analysis of $\Lambda_{\rm max}$ could induce possibly misleading conclusions on the chaoticity of systems with small (and possibly large $N$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Eigenspaces and Pseudospectra of Nonnormal and Defective Matrix-Valued Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider nonnormal matrix-valued dynamical systems with discrete time. For an eigenvalue of matrix, the number of times it appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial is called the algebraic multiplicity. On the other hand, the geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the linear space of eigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue. If the former exceeds the latter, then the eigenvalue is said to be defective and the matrix becomes nondiagonalizable by any similarity transformation. The discrete-time of our dynamics is identified with the geometric multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$. Its algebraic multiplicity takes about half of the matrix size at $t=1$ and increases stepwise in time, which keeps excess to the geometric multiplicity until their coincidence at the final time. Our model exhibits relaxation processes from far-from-normal to near-normal matrices, in which the defectivity of $\lambda_0$ is recovering in time. We show that such processes are realized as size reductions of pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. Here the pseudospectra are the domains on the complex plane which are not necessarily exact spectra but in which the resolvent of matrix takes extremely large values. The defective eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ is sensitive to perturbation and the eigenvalues of the perturbed systems are distributed densely in the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. By constructing generalized eigenspace for $\lambda_0$, we give the Jordan block decomposition for the resolvent of matrix and characterize the pseudospectrum dynamics. Numerical study of the systems perturbed by Gaussian random matrices supports the validity of the present analysis.</description>
