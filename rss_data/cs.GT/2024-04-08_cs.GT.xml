      <title>The Hyperdrive Protocol: An Automated Market Maker for Fixed and Variable Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperdrive is a protocol designed to facilitate the trading of fixed and variable rate assets. The protocol's unique pricing model consolidates liquidity into a single pool which addresses the challenges of fragmented liquidity across terms, eliminates the need for rollovers, and allows terms to be issued on demand. Its design meaningfully improves trading efficiency, liquidity provisioning, and user experience over existing fixed and variable rate protocol models.</description>

      <title>Fair Lotteries for Participatory Budgeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pursuit of participatory budgeting (PB) outcomes with broader fairness guarantees, we initiate the study of lotteries over discrete PB outcomes. As the projects have heterogeneous costs, the amount spent may not be equal ex ante and ex post. To address this, we develop a technique to bound the amount by which the ex-post spend differs from the ex-ante spend -- the property is termed budget balanced up to one project (BB1). With respect to fairness, we take a best-of-both-worlds perspective, seeking outcomes that are both ex-ante and ex-post fair. Towards this goal, we initiate a study of ex-ante fairness properties in PB, including Individual Fair Share (IFS), Unanimous Fair Share (UFS) and their stronger variants, as well as Group Fair Share (GFS). We show several incompatibility results between these ex-ante fairness notions and existing ex-post concepts based on justified representation. One of our main contributions is a randomized algorithm which simultaneously satisfies ex-ante Strong UFS, ex-post full justified representation (FJR) and ex-post BB1 for PB with binary utilities.</description>

      <title>Optimal Allocation of Tasks and Price of Anarchy of Distributed Optimization in Networked Computing Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The allocation of computing tasks for networked distributed services poses a question to service providers on whether centralized allocation management be worth its cost. Existing analytical models were conceived for users accessing computing resources with practically indistinguishable (hence irrelevant for the allocation decision) delays, which is typical of services located in the same distant data center. However, with the rise of the edge-cloud continuum, a simple analysis of the sojourn time that computing tasks observe at the server misses the impact of diverse latency values imposed by server locations. We therefore study the optimization of computing task allocation with a new model that considers both distance of servers and sojourn time in servers. We derive exact algorithms to optimize the system and we show, through numerical analysis and real experiments, that differences in server location in the edge-cloud continuum cannot be neglected. By means of algorithmic game theory, we study the price of anarchy of a distributed implementation of the computing task allocation problem and unveil important practical properties such as the fact that the price of anarchy tends to be small -- except when the system is overloaded -- and its maximum can be computed with low complexity.</description>

      <title>The Future of MEV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the Execution Tickets proposal on Ethereum Research, unveiling its potential to revolutionize the Ethereum blockchain's economic model. At the core of this proposal lies a novel ticketing mechanism poised to redefine how the Ethereum protocol distributes the value associated with proposing execution payloads. This innovative approach enables the Ethereum protocol to directly broker Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), traditionally an external revenue stream for validators. The implementation of Execution Tickets goes beyond optimizing validator compensation; it also introduces a new Ethereum native asset with a market capitalization expected to correlate closely with the present value of all value associated with future block production. The analysis demonstrates that the Execution Ticket system can facilitate a more equitable distribution of value within the Ethereum ecosystem, and pave the way for a more secure and economically robust blockchain network.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Fairness and Social Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithms are increasingly used to guide high-stakes decisions about individuals. Consequently, substantial interest has developed around defining and measuring the ``fairness'' of these algorithms. These definitions of fair algorithms share two features: First, they prioritize the role of a pre-defined group identity (e.g., race or gender) by focusing on how the algorithm's impact differs systematically across groups. Second, they are statistical in nature; for example, comparing false positive rates, or assessing whether group identity is independent of the decision (where both are viewed as random variables). These notions are facially distinct from a social welfare approach to fairness, in particular one based on ``veil of ignorance'' thought experiments in which individuals choose how to structure society prior to the realization of their social identity. In this paper, we seek to understand and organize the relationship between these different approaches to fairness. Can the optimization criteria proposed in the algorithmic fairness literature also be motivated as the choices of someone from behind the veil of ignorance? If not, what properties distinguish either approach to fairness?</description>

      <title>A many-to-one job market: more about the core and the competitive salaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies many-to-one assignment markets, or matching markets with wages. Although it is well-known that the core of this model is non-empty, the structure of the core has not been fully investigated. To the known dissimilarities with the one-to-one assignment game, we add that the bargaining set does not coincide with the core and the kernel may not be included in the core. Besides, not all extreme core allocations can be obtained by means of a lexicographic maximization or a lexicographic minimization procedure, as it is the case in the one-to-one assignment game.
  The maximum and minimum competitive salaries are characterized in two ways: axiomatically and by means of easily verifiable properties of an associated directed graph. Regarding the remaining extreme core allocations of the many-to-one assignment game, we propose a lexicographic procedure that, for each order on the set of workers, sequentially maximizes or minimizes each worker's competitive salary. This procedure provides all extreme vectors of competitive salaries, that is all extreme core allocations.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics for Utility Maximizing Agents: Exploring the Impact of Resource Penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a continuous-time nonlinear model of opinion dynamics with utility-maximizing agents connected via a social influence network. A distinguishing feature of the proposed model is the inclusion of an opinion-dependent resource-penalty term in the utilities, which limits the agents from holding opinions of large magnitude. The proposed utility functions also account for how the relative resources within the social group affect both an agent's stubbornness and social influence. Each agent myopically seeks to maximize its utility by revising its opinion in the gradient ascent direction of its utility function, thus leading to the proposed opinion dynamics. We show that, for any arbitrary social influence network, opinions are ultimately bounded. For networks with weak antagonistic relations, we show that there exists a globally exponentially stable equilibrium using contraction theory. We establish conditions for the existence of consensus equilibrium and analyze the relative dominance of the agents at consensus. We also conduct a game-theoretic analysis of the underlying opinion formation game, including on Nash equilibria and on prices of anarchy in terms of satisfaction ratios. Additionally, we also investigate the oscillatory behavior of opinions in a two-agent scenario. Finally, simulations illustrate our findings.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Information Propagation for Blockchain-empowered Mobile AIGC: A Graph Attention Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) is a rapidly evolving field that utilizes advanced AI algorithms to generate content. Through integration with mobile edge networks, mobile AIGC networks have gained significant attention, which can provide real-time customized and personalized AIGC services and products. Since blockchains can facilitate decentralized and transparent data management, AIGC products can be securely managed by blockchain to avoid tampering and plagiarization. However, the evolution of blockchain-empowered mobile AIGC is still in its nascent phase, grappling with challenges such as improving information propagation efficiency to enable blockchain-empowered mobile AIGC. In this paper, we design a Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based information propagation optimization framework for blockchain-empowered mobile AIGC. We first innovatively apply age of information as a data-freshness metric to measure information propagation efficiency in public blockchains. Considering that GATs possess the excellent ability to process graph-structured data, we utilize the GAT to obtain the optimal information propagation trajectory. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme exhibits the most outstanding information propagation efficiency compared with traditional routing mechanisms.</description>

      <title>On the price of exact truthfulness in incentive-compatible online learning with bandit feedback: A regret lower bound for WSU-UX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In one view of the classical game of prediction with expert advice with binary outcomes, in each round, each expert maintains an adversarially chosen belief and honestly reports this belief. We consider a recently introduced, strategic variant of this problem with selfish (reputation-seeking) experts, where each expert strategically reports in order to maximize their expected future reputation based on their belief. In this work, our goal is to design an algorithm for the selfish experts problem that is incentive-compatible (IC, or \emph{truthful}), meaning each expert's best strategy is to report truthfully, while also ensuring the algorithm enjoys sublinear regret with respect to the expert with the best belief. Freeman et al. (2020) recently studied this problem in the full information and bandit settings and obtained truthful, no-regret algorithms by leveraging prior work on wagering mechanisms. While their results under full information match the minimax rate for the classical ("honest experts") problem, the best-known regret for their bandit algorithm WSU-UX is $O(T^{2/3})$, which does not match the minimax rate for the classical ("honest bandits") setting. It was unclear whether the higher regret was an artifact of their analysis or a limitation of WSU-UX. We show, via explicit construction of loss sequences, that the algorithm suffers a worst-case $\Omega(T^{2/3})$ lower bound. Left open is the possibility that a different IC algorithm obtains $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Yet, WSU-UX was a natural choice for such an algorithm owing to the limited design room for IC algorithms in this setting.</description>

      <title>Is Limited Information Enough? An Approximate Multi-agent Coverage Control in Non-Convex Discrete Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional distributed approaches to coverage control may suffer from lack of convergence and poor performance, due to the fact that agents have limited information, especially in non-convex discrete environments. To address this issue, we extend the approach of [Marden 2016] which demonstrates how a limited degree of inter-agent communication can be exploited to overcome such pitfalls in one-dimensional discrete environments. The focus of this paper is on extending such results to general dimensional settings. We show that the extension is convergent and keeps the approximation ratio of 2, meaning that any stable solution is guaranteed to have a performance within 50% of the optimal one. The experimental results exhibit that our algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms, and also that the runtime is scalable.</description>

      <title>Red Teaming Game: A Game-Theoretic Framework for Red Teaming Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00322v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deployable Large Language Models (LLMs) must conform to the criterion of helpfulness and harmlessness, thereby achieving consistency between LLMs outputs and human values. Red-teaming techniques constitute a critical way towards this criterion. Existing work rely solely on manual red team designs and heuristic adversarial prompts for vulnerability detection and optimization. These approaches lack rigorous mathematical formulation, thus limiting the exploration of diverse attack strategy within quantifiable measure and optimization of LLMs under convergence guarantees. In this paper, we present Red-teaming Game (RTG), a general game-theoretic framework without manual annotation. RTG is designed for analyzing the multi-turn attack and defense interactions between Red-team language Models (RLMs) and Blue-team Language Model (BLM). Within the RTG, we propose Gamified Red-teaming Solver (GRTS) with diversity measure of the semantic space. GRTS is an automated red teaming technique to solve RTG towards Nash equilibrium through meta-game analysis, which corresponds to the theoretically guaranteed optimization direction of both RLMs and BLM. Empirical results in multi-turn attacks with RLMs show that GRTS autonomously discovered diverse attack strategies and effectively improved security of LLMs, outperforming existing heuristic red-team designs. Overall, RTG has established a foundational framework for red teaming tasks and constructed a new scalable oversight technique for alignment.</description>

      <title>Tiny Multi-Agent DRL for Twins Migration in UAV Metaverses: A Multi-Leader Multi-Follower Stackelberg Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The synergy between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and metaverses is giving rise to an emerging paradigm named UAV metaverses, which create a unified ecosystem that blends physical and virtual spaces, transforming drone interaction and virtual exploration. UAV Twins (UTs), as the digital twins of UAVs that revolutionize UAV applications by making them more immersive, realistic, and informative, are deployed and updated on ground base stations, e.g., RoadSide Units (RSUs), to offer metaverse services for UAV Metaverse Users (UMUs). Due to the dynamic mobility of UAVs and limited communication coverages of RSUs, it is essential to perform real-time UT migration to ensure seamless immersive experiences for UMUs. However, selecting appropriate RSUs and optimizing the required bandwidth is challenging for achieving reliable and efficient UT migration. To address the challenges, we propose a tiny machine learning-based Stackelberg game framework based on pruning techniques for efficient UT migration in UAV metaverses. Specifically, we formulate a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg model considering a new immersion metric of UMUs in the utilities of UAVs. Then, we design a Tiny Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (Tiny MADRL) algorithm to obtain the tiny networks representing the optimal game solution. Specifically, the actor-critic network leverages the pruning techniques to reduce the number of network parameters and achieve model size and computation reduction, allowing for efficient implementation of Tiny MADRL. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed schemes have better performance than traditional schemes.</description>

      <title>Trajectory-wise Iterative Reinforcement Learning Framework for Auto-bidding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In online advertising, advertisers participate in ad auctions to acquire ad opportunities, often by utilizing auto-bidding tools provided by demand-side platforms (DSPs). The current auto-bidding algorithms typically employ reinforcement learning (RL). However, due to safety concerns, most RL-based auto-bidding policies are trained in simulation, leading to a performance degradation when deployed in online environments. To narrow this gap, we can deploy multiple auto-bidding agents in parallel to collect a large interaction dataset. Offline RL algorithms can then be utilized to train a new policy. The trained policy can subsequently be deployed for further data collection, resulting in an iterative training framework, which we refer to as iterative offline RL. In this work, we identify the performance bottleneck of this iterative offline RL framework, which originates from the ineffective exploration and exploitation caused by the inherent conservatism of offline RL algorithms. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose Trajectory-wise Exploration and Exploitation (TEE), which introduces a novel data collecting and data utilization method for iterative offline RL from a trajectory perspective. Furthermore, to ensure the safety of online exploration while preserving the dataset quality for TEE, we propose Safe Exploration by Adaptive Action Selection (SEAS). Both offline experiments and real-world experiments on Alibaba display advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>
