      <title>Continual Learning for Acoustic Event Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuously learning new classes without catastrophic forgetting is a challenging problem for on-device acoustic event classification given the restrictions on computation resources (e.g., model size, running memory). To alleviate such an issue, we propose two novel diversity-aware incremental learning method for Spoken Keyword Spotting and Environmental Sound Classification. Our method selects the historical data for the training by measuring the per-sample classification uncertainty. For the Spoken Keyword Spotting application, the proposed RK approach introduces a diversity-aware sampler to select a diverse set from historical and incoming keywords by calculating classification uncertainty. As a result, the RK approach can incrementally learn new tasks without forgetting prior knowledge. Besides, the RK approach also proposes data augmentation and knowledge distillation loss function for efficient memory management on the edge device. For the Environmental Sound Classification application, we measure the uncertainty by observing how the classification probability of data fluctuates against the parallel perturbations added to the classifier embedding. In this way, the computation cost can be significantly reduced compared with adding perturbation to the raw data. Experimental results show that the proposed RK approach achieves 4.2% absolute improvement in terms of average accuracy over the best baseline on Google Speech Command dataset with less required memory. Experimental results on the DCASE 2019 Task 1 and ESC-50 dataset show that our proposed method outperforms baseline continual learning methods on classification accuracy and computational efficiency, indicating our method can efficiently and incrementally learn new classes without the catastrophic forgetting problem for on-device environmental sound classification</description>

      <title>SAM Audio: Segment Anything in Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General audio source separation is a key capability for multimodal AI systems that can perceive and reason about sound. Despite substantial progress in recent years, existing separation models are either domain-specific, designed for fixed categories such as speech or music, or limited in controllability, supporting only a single prompting modality such as text. In this work, we present SAM Audio, a foundation model for general audio separation that unifies text, visual, and temporal span prompting within a single framework. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture, SAM Audio is trained with flow matching on large-scale audio data spanning speech, music, and general sounds, and can flexibly separate target sources described by language, visual masks, or temporal spans. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of benchmarks, including general sound, speech, music, and musical instrument separation in both in-the-wild and professionally produced audios, substantially outperforming prior general-purpose and specialized systems. Furthermore, we introduce a new real-world separation benchmark with human-labeled multimodal prompts and a reference-free evaluation model that correlates strongly with human judgment.</description>

      <title>TICL+: A Case Study On Speech In-Context Learning for Children's Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Children's speech recognition remains challenging due to substantial acoustic and linguistic variability, limited labeled data, and significant differences from adult speech. Speech foundation models can address these challenges through Speech In-Context Learning (SICL), allowing adaptation to new domains without fine-tuning. However, the effectiveness of SICL depends on how in-context examples are selected. We extend an existing retrieval-based method, Text-Embedding KNN for SICL (TICL), introducing an acoustic reranking step to create TICL+. This extension prioritizes examples that are both semantically and acoustically aligned with the test input. Experiments on four children's speech corpora show that TICL+ achieves up to a 53.3% relative word error rate reduction over zero-shot performance and 37.6% over baseline TICL, highlighting the value of combining semantic and acoustic information for robust, scalable ASR in children's speech.</description>

      <title>What Does the Speaker Embedding Encode?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing a good speaker embedding has received tremendous interest in the speech community, with representations such as i-vector and d-vector demonstrating remarkable performance across various tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, a fundamental question remains largely unexplored: what properties are actually encoded in these embeddings? To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of three prominent speaker embedding methods: i-vector, d-vector, and RNN/LSTM-based sequence-vector (s-vector). Through carefully designed classification tasks, we systematically investigate their encoding capabilities across multiple dimensions, including speaker identity, gender, speaking rate, text content, word order, and channel information. Our analysis reveals distinct strengths and limitations of each embedding type: i-vector excels at speaker discrimination but encodes limited sequential information; s-vector captures text content and word order effectively but struggles with speaker identity; d-vector shows balanced performance but loses sequential information through averaging. Based on these insights, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework that integrates i-vector and s-vector, resulting in a new speaker embedding (i-s-vector) that combines their complementary advantages. Experimental results on RSR2015 demonstrate that the proposed i-s-vector achieves more than 50% EER reduction compared to the i-vector baseline on content mismatch trials, validating the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Phoneme-based speech recognition driven by large language models and sampling marginalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the Large Language Model-based Phoneme-to-Grapheme (LLM-P2G) method has shown excellent performance in speech recognition tasks and has become a feasible direction to replace the traditional WFST decoding method. This framework takes into account both recognition accuracy and system scalability through two-stage modeling of phoneme prediction and text generation. However, the existing LLM-P2G adopts the Top-K Marginalized (TKM) training strategy, and its candidate phoneme sequences rely on beam search generation, which has problems such as insufficient path diversity, low training efficiency, and high resource overhead. To this end, this paper proposes a sampling marginalized training strategy (Sampling-K Marginalized, SKM), which replaces beam search with random sampling to generate candidate paths, improving marginalized modeling and training efficiency. Experiments were conducted on Polish and German datasets, and the results showed that SKM further improved the model learning convergence speed and recognition performance while maintaining the complexity of the model. Comparative experiments with a speech recognition method that uses a projector combined with a large language model (SpeechLLM) also show that the SKM-driven LLM-P2G has more advantages in recognition accuracy and structural simplicity. The study verified the practical value and application potential of this method in cross-language speech recognition systems.</description>

      <title>MeanFlow-TSE: One-Step Generative Target Speaker Extraction with Mean Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target speaker extraction (TSE) aims to isolate a desired speaker's voice from a multi-speaker mixture using auxiliary information such as a reference utterance. Although recent advances in diffusion and flow-matching models have improved TSE performance, these methods typically require multi-step sampling, which limits their practicality in low-latency settings. In this work, we propose MeanFlow-TSE, a one-step generative TSE framework trained with mean-flow objectives, enabling fast and high-quality generation without iterative refinement. Building on the AD-FlowTSE paradigm, our method defines a flow between the background and target source that is governed by the mixing ratio (MR). Experiments on the Libri2Mix corpus show that our approach outperforms existing diffusion- and flow-matching-based TSE models in separation quality and perceptual metrics while requiring only a single inference step. These results demonstrate that mean-flow-guided one-step generation offers an effective and efficient alternative for real-time target speaker extraction.

      <title>Enhancing Fully Formatted End-to-End Speech Recognition with Knowledge Distillation via Multi-Codebook Vector Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional automatic speech recognition (ASR) models typically produce outputs as normalized texts lacking punctuation and capitalization, necessitating post-processing models to enhance readability. This approach, however, introduces additional complexity and latency due to the cascaded system design. In response to this challenge, there is a growing trend to develop end-to-end (E2E) ASR models capable of directly predicting punctuation and capitalization, though this area remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose an enhanced fully formatted E2E ASR model that leverages knowledge distillation (KD) through multi-codebook vector quantization (MVQ). Experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous works in word error rate (WER) both with and without punctuation and capitalization, and in punctuation error rate (PER). Evaluations on the LibriSpeech-PC test-clean and test-other subsets show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>chatter: a Python library for applying information theory and AI/ML models to animal communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of animal communication often involves categorizing units into types (e.g. syllables in songbirds, or notes in humpback whales). While this approach is useful in many cases, it necessarily flattens the complexity and nuance present in real communication systems. chatter is a new Python library for analyzing animal communication in continuous latent space using information theory and modern machine learning techniques. It is taxonomically agnostic, and has been tested with the vocalizations of birds, bats, whales, and primates. By leveraging a variety of different architectures, including variational autoencoders and vision transformers, chatter represents vocal sequences as trajectories in high-dimensional latent space, bypassing the need for manual or automatic categorization of units. The library provides an end-to-end workflow -- from preprocessing and segmentation to model training and feature extraction -- that enables researchers to quantify the complexity, predictability, similarity, and novelty of vocal sequences.</description>

      <title>JoyVoice: Long-Context Conditioning for Anthropomorphic Multi-Speaker Conversational Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large speech generation models are evolving from single-speaker, short sentence synthesis to multi-speaker, long conversation geneartion. Current long-form speech generation models are predominately constrained to dyadic, turn-based interactions. To address this, we introduce JoyVoice, a novel anthropomorphic foundation model designed for flexible, boundary-free synthesis of up to eight speakers. Unlike conventional cascaded systems, JoyVoice employs a unified E2E-Transformer-DiT architecture that utilizes autoregressive hidden representations directly for diffusion inputs, enabling holistic end-to-end optimization. We further propose a MM-Tokenizer operating at a low bitrate of 12.5 Hz, which integrates multitask semantic and MMSE losses to effectively model both semantic and acoustic information. Additionally, the model incorporates robust text front-end processing via large-scale data perturbation. Experiments show that JoyVoice achieves state-of-the-art results in multilingual generation (Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean) and zero-shot voice cloning. JoyVoice achieves top-tier results on both the Seed-TTS-Eval Benchmark and multi-speaker long-form conversational voice cloning tasks, demonstrating superior audio quality and generalization. It achieves significant improvements in prosodic continuity for long-form speech, rhythm richness in multi-speaker conversations, paralinguistic naturalness, besides superior intelligibility. We encourage readers to listen to the demo at https://jea-speech.github.io/JoyVoice</description>

      <title>MauBERT: Universal Phonetic Inductive Biases for Few-Shot Acoustic Units Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces MauBERT, a multilingual extension of HuBERT that leverages articulatory features for robust cross-lingual phonetic representation learning. We continue HuBERT pre-training with supervision based on a phonetic-to-articulatory feature mapping in 55 languages. Our models learn from multilingual data to predict articulatory features or phones, resulting in language-independent representations that capture multilingual phonetic properties. Through comprehensive ABX discriminability testing, we show MauBERT models produce more context-invariant representations than state-of-the-art multilingual self-supervised learning models. Additionally, the models effectively adapt to unseen languages and casual speech with minimal self-supervised fine-tuning (10 hours of speech). This establishes an effective approach for instilling linguistic inductive biases in self-supervised speech models.</description>

Abstract: The burgeoning growth of video-to-music generation can be attributed to the ascendancy of multimodal generative models. However, there is a lack of literature that comprehensively combs through the work in this field. To fill this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive review of video-to-music generation using deep generative AI techniques, focusing on three key components: conditioning input construction, conditioning mechanism, and music generation frameworks. We categorize existing approaches based on their designs for each component, clarifying the roles of different strategies. Preceding this, we provide a fine-grained categorization of video and music modalities, illustrating how different categories influence the design of components within the generation pipelines. Furthermore, we summarize available multimodal datasets and evaluation metrics while highlighting ongoing challenges in the field.</description>

      <title>ASR-Synchronized Speaker-Role Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speaker-role diarization (RD), such as doctor vs. patient or lawyer vs. client, is practically often more useful than conventional speaker diarization (SD), which assigns only generic labels (speaker-1, speaker-2). The state-of-the-art end-to-end ASR+RD approach uses a single transducer that serializes word and role predictions (role at the end of a speaker's turn), but at the cost of degraded ASR performance. To address this, we adapt a recent joint ASR+SD framework to ASR+RD by freezing the ASR transducer and training an auxiliary RD transducer in parallel to assign a role to each ASR-predicted word. For this, we first show that SD and RD are fundamentally different tasks, exhibiting different dependencies on acoustic and linguistic information. Motivated by this, we propose (1) task-specific predictor networks and (2) using higher-layer ASR encoder features as input to the RD encoder. Additionally, we replace the blank-shared RNNT loss by cross-entropy loss along the 1-best forced-alignment path to further improve performance while reducing computational and memory requirements during RD training. Experiments on a public and a private dataset of doctor-patient conversations demonstrate that our method outperforms the best baseline with relative reductions of 6.2% and 4.5% in role-based word diarization error rate (R-WDER), respectively</description>

      <title>MeanVC: Lightweight and Streaming Zero-Shot Voice Conversion via Mean Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) aims to transfer timbre from a source speaker to any unseen target speaker while preserving linguistic content. Growing application scenarios demand models with streaming inference capabilities. This has created a pressing need for models that are simultaneously fast, lightweight, and high-fidelity. However, existing streaming methods typically rely on either autoregressive (AR) or non-autoregressive (NAR) frameworks, which either require large parameter sizes to achieve strong performance or struggle to generalize to unseen speakers. In this study, we propose MeanVC, a lightweight and streaming zero-shot VC approach. MeanVC introduces a diffusion transformer with a chunk-wise autoregressive denoising strategy, combining the strengths of both AR and NAR paradigms for efficient streaming processing. By introducing mean flows, MeanVC regresses the average velocity field during training, enabling zero-shot VC with superior speech quality and speaker similarity in a single sampling step by directly mapping from the start to the endpoint of the flow trajectory. Additionally, we incorporate diffusion adversarial post-training to mitigate over-smoothing and further enhance speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that MeanVC significantly outperforms existing zero-shot streaming VC systems, achieving superior conversion quality with higher efficiency and significantly fewer parameters. Audio demos and code are publicly available at https://aslp-lab.github.io/MeanVC.</description>

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition aims to identify emotional states from speech signals and has been widely applied in human-computer interaction, education, healthcare, and many other fields. However, since speech data contain rich sensitive information, partial data can be required to be deleted by speakers due to privacy concerns. Current machine unlearning approaches largely depend on data beyond the samples to be forgotten. However, this reliance poses challenges when data redistribution is restricted and demands substantial computational resources in the context of big data. We propose a novel adversarial-attack-based approach that fine-tunes a pre-trained speech emotion recognition model using only the data to be forgotten. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively remove the knowledge of the data to be forgotten from the model, while preserving high model performance on the test set for emotion recognition.</description>
