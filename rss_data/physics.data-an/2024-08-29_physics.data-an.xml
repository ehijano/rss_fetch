      <title>Model-based and empirical analyses of stochastic fluctuations in economy and finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this work is the investigation of complexity, asymmetry, stochasticity and non-linearity of the financial and economic systems by using the tools of statistical mechanics and information theory. More precisely, this thesis concerns statistical-based modeling and empirical analyses with applications in finance, forecasting, production processes and game theory. In these areas the time dependence of probability distributions is of prime interest and can be measured or exactly calculated for model systems. The correlation coefficients and moments are among the useful quantities to describe the dynamics and the correlations between random variables. However, the full investigation can only be achieved if the probability distribution function of the variable is known; its derivation is one of the main focuses of the present work.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection in Collider Physics via Factorized Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To maximize the discovery potential of high-energy colliders, experimental searches should be sensitive to unforeseen new physics scenarios. This goal has motivated the use of machine learning for unsupervised anomaly detection. In this paper, we introduce a new anomaly detection strategy called FORCE: factorized observables for regressing conditional expectations. Our approach is based on the inductive bias of factorization, which is the idea that the physics governing different energy scales can be treated as approximately independent. Assuming factorization holds separately for signal and background processes, the appearance of non-trivial correlations between low- and high-energy observables is a robust indicator of new physics. Under the most restrictive form of factorization, a machine-learned model trained to identify such correlations will in fact converge to the optimal new physics classifier. We test FORCE on a benchmark anomaly detection task for the Large Hadron Collider involving collimated sprays of particles called jets. By teasing out correlations between the kinematics and substructure of jets, our method can reliably extract percent-level signal fractions. This strategy for uncovering new physics adds to the growing toolbox of anomaly detection methods for collider physics with a complementary set of assumptions.</description>

      <title>Anomaly detection with flow-based fast calorimeter simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, several normalizing flow-based deep generative models have been proposed to accelerate the simulation of calorimeter showers. Using CaloFlow as an example, we show that these models can simultaneously perform unsupervised anomaly detection with no additional training cost. As a demonstration, we consider electromagnetic showers initiated by one (background) or multiple (signal) photons. The CaloFlow model is designed to generate single photon showers, but it also provides access to the shower likelihood. We use this likelihood as an anomaly score and study the showers tagged as being unlikely. As expected, the tagger struggles when the signal photons are nearly collinear, but is otherwise effective. This approach is complementary to a supervised classifier trained on only specific signal models using the same low-level calorimeter inputs. While the supervised classifier is also highly effective at unseen signal models, the unsupervised method is more sensitive in certain regions and thus we expect that the ultimate performance will require a combination of these approaches.</description>
