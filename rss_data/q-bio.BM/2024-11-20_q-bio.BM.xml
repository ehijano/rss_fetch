      <title>Rapid response to fast viral evolution using AlphaFold 3-assisted topological deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fast evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious viruses poses a grand challenge to the rapid response in terms of viral tracking, diagnostics, and design and manufacture of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and vaccines, which are both time-consuming and costly. This underscores the need for efficient computational approaches. Recent advancements, like topological deep learning (TDL), have introduced powerful tools for forecasting emerging dominant variants, yet they require deep mutational scanning (DMS) of viral surface proteins and associated three-dimensional (3D) protein-protein interaction (PPI) complex structures. We propose an AlphaFold 3 (AF3)-assisted multi-task topological Laplacian (MT-TopLap) strategy to address this need. MT-TopLap combines deep learning with topological data analysis (TDA) models, such as persistent Laplacians (PL) to extract detailed topological and geometric characteristics of PPIs, thereby enhancing the prediction of DMS and binding free energy (BFE) changes upon virus mutations. Validation with four experimental DMS datasets of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) complexes indicates that our AF3 assisted MT-TopLap strategy maintains robust performance, with only an average 1.1% decrease in Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) and an average 9.3% increase in root mean square errors (RMSE), compared with the use of experimental structures. Additionally, AF3-assisted MT-TopLap achieved a PCC of 0.81 when tested with a SARS-CoV-2 HK.3 variant DMS dataset, confirming its capability to accurately predict BFE changes and adapt to new experimental data, thereby showcasing its potential for rapid and effective response to fast viral evolution.</description>

      <title>GNNAS-Dock: Budget Aware Algorithm Selection with Graph Neural Networks for Molecular Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a major element in drug discovery and design. It enables the prediction of ligand-protein interactions by simulating the binding of small molecules to proteins. Despite the availability of numerous docking algorithms, there is no single algorithm consistently outperforms the others across a diverse set of docking scenarios. This paper introduces GNNAS-Dock, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based automated algorithm selection system for molecular docking in blind docking situations. GNNs are accommodated to process the complex structural data of both ligands and proteins. They benefit from the inherent graph-like properties to predict the performance of various docking algorithms under different conditions. The present study pursues two main objectives: 1) predict the performance of each candidate docking algorithm, in terms of Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), thereby identifying the most accurate method for specific scenarios; and 2) choose the best computationally efficient docking algorithm for each docking case, aiming to reduce the time required for docking while maintaining high accuracy. We validate our approach on PDBBind 2020 refined set, which contains about 5,300 pairs of protein-ligand complexes.</description>

      <title>Exploring Optimal Transport-Based Multi-Grained Alignments for Text-Molecule Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of bioinformatics has seen significant progress, making the cross-modal text-molecule retrieval task increasingly vital. This task focuses on accurately retrieving molecule structures based on textual descriptions, by effectively aligning textual descriptions and molecules to assist researchers in identifying suitable molecular candidates. However, many existing approaches overlook the details inherent in molecule sub-structures. In this work, we introduce the Optimal TRansport-based Multi-grained Alignments model (ORMA), a novel approach that facilitates multi-grained alignments between textual descriptions and molecules. Our model features a text encoder and a molecule encoder. The text encoder processes textual descriptions to generate both token-level and sentence-level representations, while molecules are modeled as hierarchical heterogeneous graphs, encompassing atom, motif, and molecule nodes to extract representations at these three levels. A key innovation in ORMA is the application of Optimal Transport (OT) to align tokens with motifs, creating multi-token representations that integrate multiple token alignments with their corresponding motifs. Additionally, we employ contrastive learning to refine cross-modal alignments at three distinct scales: token-atom, multitoken-motif, and sentence-molecule, ensuring that the similarities between correctly matched text-molecule pairs are maximized while those of unmatched pairs are minimized. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explore alignments at both the motif and multi-token levels. Experimental results on the ChEBI-20 and PCdes datasets demonstrate that ORMA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</description>

      <title>log-RRIM: Yield Prediction via Local-to-global Reaction Representation Learning and Interaction Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of chemical reaction yields is crucial for optimizing organic synthesis, potentially reducing time and resources spent on experimentation. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), there is growing interest in leveraging AI-based methods to accelerate yield predictions without conducting in vitro experiments. We present log-RRIM, an innovative graph transformer-based framework designed for predicting chemical reaction yields. Our approach implements a unique local-to-global reaction representation learning strategy. This approach initially captures detailed molecule-level information and then models and aggregates intermolecular interactions, ensuring that the impact of varying-sizes molecular fragments on yield is accurately accounted for. Another key feature of log-RRIM is its integration of a cross-attention mechanism that focuses on the interplay between reagents and reaction centers. This design reflects a fundamental principle in chemical reactions: the crucial role of reagents in influencing bond-breaking and formation processes, which ultimately affect reaction yields. log-RRIM outperforms existing methods in our experiments, especially for medium to high-yielding reactions, proving its reliability as a predictor. Its advanced modeling of reactant-reagent interactions and sensitivity to small molecular fragments make it a valuable tool for reaction planning and optimization in chemical synthesis. The data and codes of log-RRIM are accessible through https://github.com/ninglab/Yield_log_RRIM.</description>
