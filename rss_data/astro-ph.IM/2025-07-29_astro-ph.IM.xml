      <title>Comparing Quantum Machine Learning Approaches in Astrophysical Signal Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) serves as a general-purpose, highly adaptable, and versatile framework for investigating complex systems across domains. However, the resulting computational resource demands, in terms of the number of parameters and the volume of data required to train ML models, can be high, often prohibitive. This is the case in astrophysics, where multimedia space data streams usually have to be analyzed. In this context, quantum computing emerges as a compelling and promising alternative, offering the potential to address these challenges in a feasible way. Specifically, a four-step quantum machine learning (QML) workflow is proposed encompassing data encoding, quantum circuit design, model training and evaluation. Then, focusing on the data encoding step, different techniques and models are investigated within a case study centered on the Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) signal detection in the astrophysics domain. The results thus obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of QML in astrophysics, highlighting the critical role of data encoding, which significantly affects the QML model performance.</description>

      <title>Radiometric Interferometry for Deep Space Navigation using Geostationary Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep space navigation presents significant challenges due to the unavailability of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals and severe signal attenuation over interplanetary distances. Traditional terrestrial systems, such as NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) and ESA ESTRACK, rely on Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) for angular positioning. However, these systems are limited by relatively short baselines, atmospheric distortions requiring extensive calibration, and reduced visibility availability due to Earth rotation. This research proposes a complementary deep space navigation approach using space based interferometry, in which radio signals from the spacecraft are received and cross correlated onboard Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites. By replacing terrestrial VLBI stations with dual GEO platforms, the method significantly extends the effective baseline, removes atmospheric phase errors, and provides almost continuous visibility to deep space targets. Unlike Earth based systems, GEO based interferometry maintains persistent station mutual visibility, enabling higher measurement availability and more flexible mission support. A complete system model is presented, including the principles of dual frequency phase based angular tracking and a structured error budget analysis. Theoretical results show that the GEO based system achieves a total angular error of approximately 3.73 nanoradians, within the same order of magnitude as terrestrial VLBI. Space based architecture nearly doubles the geometrical availability for interferometric tracking, while eliminating atmospheric distortions. These findings support the feasibility of the GEO based VLBI concept and motivate continued research and field validation for future deep space navigation applications.</description>

      <title>Crystal Eye: all sky MeV monitor with high precision real-time localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal Eye is a space-based all-sky monitor optimized for the autonomous detection and localization of transients in the 10 keV to 30 MeV energy range, a region where extensive observations and monitoring of various astrophysical phenomena are required. By focusing on the operating environment and its impact on the observation process, we optimized the detector design and assessed its scientific potential. We explored the use of novel techniques to achieve the science goals of the experiment. We assumed the orbit of a potential future mission at approximately 550 km altitude near the equatorial region with a 20{\deg} inclination. In such an orbit, the main background contributions for this kind of detector are from different particles and radiation of cosmic origin and secondaries produced by their interaction in the Earth's atmospheric and geomagnetic environment. We studied the response of the detector in this background environment, using the Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit. We also calculated other detector performance parameters to estimate its scientific capabilities. The detector effective area and efficiency are calculated for low energy gamma-ray sources and used to estimate its sensitivity to short-duration transient and persistent sources. The calculation shows a better effective area and sensitivity by several factors compared to existing instruments of similar type. A method is also developed and discussed to estimate the online transient-localization performance of the detector, suggesting a better localization precision by about an order of magnitude than those typically reported by existing gamma-ray monitors. We present here the simulation study and results of an innovative detector design concept that can make a significant contribution in the multi-messenger era. Moreover, this study can be useful as a technical reference for similar future experiments.</description>

      <title>Transmission of the AtmosPhere for AStronomical data: TAPAS upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art molecular databases and realistic global atmospheric models allow to predict accurate atmospheric transmittance spectra. The TAPAS online service provides atmospheric transmittance spectra of the most important species as well as Rayleigh extinction, adapted to any observing location, date, and direction. We describe recent updates, improvements, and additional tools. TAPAS is interpolating in location in the atmospheric profiles of temperature, pressure, H$_2$O, O$_2$ and O$_3$ extracted from the ECMWF and produced by Arletty, a Data Terra/AERIS/ESPRI product, supplemented by auxiliary climatological models for additional species. The transmittance spectra are computed with the LBLRTM code. The resolution is chosen to ensure that the shapes of all absorption lines are reproduced for each species. Major improvements are: $\bullet$ the extension of the wavelength range in the near-UV down to 300 nm; in the near-IR up to 3500 nm; $\bullet$ the use of HITRAN2020; $\bullet$ the addition of NO$_2$, to complement H$_2$O, O$_2$, O$_3$, N$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CH$_4$; $\bullet$ an increased accessibility; $\bullet$ the possibility to force the total H$_2$O column to match the one measured at the observatory. We show O3 absorption in the near-UV and near-IR and NO2 absorption in the visible. We illustrate the quality of TAPAS by means of comparisons between models and ESO/VLT/CRIRES recorded spectra of a hot star with spectral resolution 130,000, in two intervals with strong H$_2$O, NO$_2$, CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ absorption. We describe the measurement of an instrumental Line Spread Function (LSF) based on TAPAS O$_2$ lines and a method using the Singular Value Decomposition technique that can be made entirely automated. TAPAS can be used to improve the wavelength and to measure the LSF in regions where telluric features are present. The extended wavelength range will be particularly useful for future or recent spectrographs in the near-UV and in the near-infrared.</description>

      <title>Information Field Theory with JAX infers Air Shower Electric Currents from Antenna Signal Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct imaging of cosmic-ray-induced particle showers during daylight is a long-standing challenge in astroparticle physics. A promising avenue for capturing images of these showers is through the radio emissions generated by their electrically charged particles. Their corresponding current vectors evolve over time as the particle shower propagates through the Earth's atmosphere leading to a characteristic time-dependent electric field in an antenna array. In this work, we harness modern Bayesian inference techniques within the Python toolkit for numerical information field theory NIFTy, coupled with the high-performance numerical computing capabilities of the Python library JAX. This innovative combination enables us to reconstruct the particle shower and its temporal development from data collected by a ground-based antenna array. Our approach opens an initial pathway for detailed imaging of cosmic-ray showers, potentially advancing our understanding of high-energy astrophysical processes.</description>

      <title>Precision spectral estimation at sub-Hz frequencies: closed-form posteriors and Bayesian noise projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian method for estimating spectral quantities in multivariate Gaussian time series. The approach, based on periodograms and Wishart statistics, yields closed-form expressions at any given frequency for the marginal posterior distributions of the individual power spectral densities, the pairwise coherence, and the multiple coherence, as well as for the joint posterior distribution of the full cross-spectral density matrix. In the context of noise projection - where one series is modeled as a linear combination of filtered versions of the others, plus a background component - the method also provides closed-form posteriors for both the susceptibilities, i.e., the filter transfer functions, and the power spectral density of the background. Originally developed for the analysis of the data from the European Space Agency's LISA Pathfinder mission, the method is particularly well-suited to very-low-frequency data, where long observation times preclude averaging over large sets of periodograms, which would otherwise allow these to be treated as approximately normally distributed.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Link Budget Analysis for Low Earth Orbit Satellites in the Optical Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) optical satellite communication systems face performance challenges due to atmospheric effects such as scintillation, turbulence, wavefront distortion, beam spread, and jitter. This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical model to characterize these effects and their impact on signal propagation. We develop a methodology for dynamically calculating link budgets at any location and time by integrating these models into a probabilistic framework. The approach accounts for spatial and temporal variations in atmospheric conditions, enabling accurate estimation of link loss probabilities. Simulations validate the model's accuracy and applicability to real-world LEO satellite systems. This work offers a robust tool for optimizing link performance and enhancing the reliability of satellite networks, providing valuable insights for system designers and operators.</description>

      <title>Finetuning Stellar Spectra Foundation Models with LoRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models are beginning to impact stellar spectroscopy, where spectra encode rich physical information in a structured, language-like form. A key challenge is adapting these models across heterogeneous surveys with differing resolution and coverage. We apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune SpecCLIP--a contrastively pre-trained model on LAMOST and Gaia XP spectra--for downstream tasks on DESI Early Data Release (EDR) spectra. We show that LoRA enables few-shot learning on DESI, with performance varying by fine-tuned module and benefiting from Gaia XP knowledge embedded in the pre-trained model. Our results demonstrate that LoRA provides a lightweight and effective strategy for extending spectral foundation models to new instruments and survey domains.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Detection Using Machine Learning Models Trained on Synthetic Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With manual searching processes, the rate at which scientists and astronomers discover exoplanets is slow because of inefficiencies that require an extensive time of laborious inspections. In fact, as of now there have been about only 5,000 confirmed exoplanets since the late 1900s. Recently, machine learning (ML) has proven to be extremely valuable and efficient in various fields, capable of processing massive amounts of data in addition to increasing its accuracy by learning. Though ML models for discovering exoplanets owned by large corporations (e.g. NASA) exist already, they largely depend on complex algorithms and supercomputers. In an effort to reduce such complexities, in this paper, we report the results and potential benefits of various, well-known ML models in the discovery and validation of extrasolar planets. The ML models that are examined in this study include logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest. The dataset on which the models train and predict is acquired from NASA's Kepler space telescope. The initial results show promising scores for each model. However, potential biases and dataset imbalances necessitate the use of data augmentation techniques to further ensure fairer predictions and improved generalization. This study concludes that, in the context of searching for exoplanets, data augmentation techniques significantly improve the recall and precision, while the accuracy varies for each model.</description>

      <title>Comparing Behavioural Cloning and Reinforcement Learning for Spacecraft Guidance and Control Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guidance &amp; control networks (G&amp;CNETs) provide a promising alternative to on-board guidance and control (G&amp;C) architectures for spacecraft, offering a differentiable, end-to-end representation of the guidance and control architecture. When training G&amp;CNETs, two predominant paradigms emerge: behavioural cloning (BC), which mimics optimal trajectories, and reinforcement learning (RL), which learns optimal behaviour through trials and errors. Although both approaches have been adopted in G&amp;CNET related literature, direct comparisons are notably absent. To address this, we conduct a systematic evaluation of BC and RL specifically for training G&amp;CNETs on continuous-thrust spacecraft trajectory optimisation tasks. We introduce a novel RL training framework tailored to G&amp;CNETs, incorporating decoupled action and control frequencies alongside reward redistribution strategies to stabilise training and to provide a fair comparison. Our results show that BC-trained G&amp;CNETs excel at closely replicating expert policy behaviour, and thus the optimal control structure of a deterministic environment, but can be negatively constrained by the quality and coverage of the training dataset. In contrast RL-trained G&amp;CNETs, beyond demonstrating a superior adaptability to stochastic conditions, can also discover solutions that improve upon suboptimal expert demonstrations, sometimes revealing globally optimal strategies that eluded the generation of training samples.</description>

      <title>LensingFlow: An Automated Workflow for Gravitational Wave Lensing Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present LensingFlow. This is an implementation of an automated workflow to search for evidence of gravitational lensing in a large series of gravitational wave events. This workflow conducts searches for evidence in all generally considered lensing regimes. The implementation of this workflow is built atop the Asimov automation framework and CBCFlow metadata management software and the resulting product therefore encompasses both the automated running and status checking of jobs in the workflow as well as the automated production and storage of relevant metadata from these jobs to allow for later reproduction. This workflow encompasses a number of existing lensing pipelines and has been designed to accommodate any additional future pipelines to provide both a current and future basis on which to conduct large scale lensing analyses of gravitational wave signal catalogues. The workflow also implements a prioritisation management system for jobs submitted to the schedulers in common usage in computing clusters ensuring both the completion of the workflow across the entire catalogue of events as well as the priority completion of the most significant candidates. As a first proof-of-concept demonstration, we deploy LensingFlow on a mock data challenge comprising 10 signals in which signatures of each lensing regime are represented. LensingFlow successfully ran and identified the candidates from this data through its automated checks of results from consituent analyses.</description>

      <title>ULISSE: Determination of star-formation rate and stellar mass based on the one-shot galaxy imaging technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern sky surveys produce vast amounts of observational data, making the application of classical methods for estimating galaxy properties challenging and time-consuming. This challenge can be significantly alleviated by employing automatic machine and deep learning techniques. We propose an implementation of the ULISSE algorithm aimed at determining physical parameters of galaxies, in particular star-formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses ($M_{\ast}$), using only composite-color images. ULISSE is able to rapidly and efficiently identify candidates from a single image based on photometric and morphological similarities to a given reference object with known properties. This approach leverages features extracted from the ImageNet dataset to perform similarity searches among all objects in the sample, eliminating the need for extensive neural network training. Our experiments, performed on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, demonstrate that we are able to predict the joint star formation rate and stellar mass of the target galaxies within 1 dex in 60% to 80% of cases, depending on the investigated subsample (quiescent/star-forming galaxies, early-/late-type, etc.), and within 0.5 dex if we consider these parameters separately. This is approximately twice the fraction obtained from a random guess extracted from the parent population. Additionally, we find ULISSE is more effective for galaxies with active star formation compared to elliptical galaxies with quenched star formation. Additionally, ULISSE performs more efficiently for galaxies with bright nuclei such as AGN. Our results suggest that ULISSE is a promising tool for a preliminary estimation of star-formation rates and stellar masses for galaxies based only on single images in current and future wide-field surveys (e.g., Euclid, LSST), which target millions of sources nightly.</description>

      <title>Observability of radio reflections from exoplanet ionospheres with next generation radio telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much has been learned about exoplanets and their atmospheres in the last three decades with the help of highly sensitive optical telescopes. Limited observations using X-ray telescopes have revealed the presence of ionospheres with very high density plasma around the hot Jupiter HD189733b. Owing to high density, the cutoff frequency of this plasma would lie in the range of few GHz. As the planet goes around the star, we suggest it might be possible to capture the stellar radio emission reflected from the ionosphere of the planet. We find that the reflected spectrum has a slope which is representative of the plasma density profile of the ionosphere and has a cutoff frequency. After investigating the reflection and free-free absorption process in the ionosphere, we find that this reflected signal, though feeble, can be captured by very sensitive radio telescopes operating in the low frequency range. We estimate the reflected signal from the ionosphere of a hot Jupiter and find that the flux ratio of the planet to the star are about $\sim 0.01\%$. In the view of development of facilities like Square Kilometer Array, it might be possible to capture the reflected radio signal from the ionosphere and constrain the thermal state of the ionosphere.</description>

      <title>Long cavity spectral disperser at sub-picometer resolution. Design and analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many applications of spectrometry, a very high spectral resolution is of paramount importance for technologies such as wavelength division multiplexing, femtosecond laser pulse shaping, chemical analysis of gases, or astrophysics observations. A few techniques achieving such goal already exist as listed in the introducing paragraphs. In this article is described a long cavity spectral disperser that is likely to be integrated into a spectrometer and having the potential to attaining unsurpassed spectral resolving power equal to ten millions or more. The basic relations of its angular dispersion, free spectral range, resolving power, transmission and contrast are established and a preliminary optimized design is presented</description>

      <title>PyBird-JAX: Accelerated inference in large-scale structure with model-independent emulation of one-loop galaxy power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$, a differentiable, $\texttt{JAX}$-based implementation of $\texttt{PyBird}$, using internal neural network emulators to accelerate computationally costly operations for rapid large-scale structure (LSS) analysis. $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ computes one-loop EFTofLSS predictions for redshift-space galaxy power spectrum multipoles in 1.2 ms on a CPU and 0.2 ms on a GPU, achieving 3-4 orders of magnitude speed-up over $\texttt{PyBird}$. The emulators take a compact spline-based representation of the input linear power spectrum $P(k)$ as feature vectors, making the approach applicable to a wide range of cosmological models. We rigorously validate its accuracy against large-volume simulations and on BOSS data, including cosmologies not explicitly represented in the training set. Leveraging automatic differentiation, $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ supports Fisher forecasting, Taylor expansion of model predictions, gradient-based searches, and vectorised ensemble sampling. Interfaced with a variety of samplers and Boltzmann solvers, $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ provides a high-performance, end-to-end inference pipeline. Combined with a symbolic-$P(k)$ generator, a typical Stage-4 LSS MCMC converges in minutes on a GPU. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ delivers the precision and speed required for upcoming LSS surveys, opening the door to accelerated cosmological inference with minimal accuracy loss and no pretraining. In a companion paper [1], we put $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ to use in achieving LSS marginalised constraints free from volume projection effects through non-flat measures.</description>

      <title>PECCARY: A novel approach for characterizing orbital complexity, stochasticity, and regularity</title>

Abstract: Permutation Entropy and statistiCal Complexity Analysis for astRophYsics (PECCARY) is a computationally inexpensive, statistical method by which any time-series can be characterized as predominantly regular, complex, or stochastic. Elements of the PECCARY method have been used in a variety of physical, biological, economic, and mathematical scenarios, but have not yet gained traction in the astrophysical community. This study introduces the PECCARY technique with the specific aims to motivate its use in and optimize it for the analysis of astrophysical orbital systems. PECCARY works by decomposing a time-dependent measure, such as the x-coordinate or orbital angular momentum time-series, into ordinal patterns. Due to its unique approach and statistical nature, PECCARY is well-suited for detecting preferred and forbidden patterns (a signature of chaos), even when the chaotic behavior is short-lived or when working with a relatively short duration time-series or small sets of time-series data. A variety of examples are used to demonstrate the capabilities of PECCARY. These include mathematical examples (sine waves, varieties of noise, sums of sine waves, well-known chaotic functions), a double pendulum system, and astrophysical tracer particle simulations with potentials of varying intricacies. Since the adopted timescale used to diagnose a given time-series can affect the outcome, a method is presented to identify an ideal sampling scheme, constrained by the overall duration and the natural timescale of the system. The accompanying PECCARY Python package and its usage are discussed.</description>

      <title>In Situ Measurements of Dark Photon Dark Matter Using Parker Solar Probe: Going beyond the Radio Window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark photon dark matter (DPDM) emerges as a compelling candidate for ultralight bosonic dark matter, detectable through resonant conversion into photons within a plasma environment. This study employs in-situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), the first spacecraft to venture into the solar corona, to probe for DPDM signatures. The PSP in-situ measurements go beyond the traditional radio window, spanning frequencies between about 10 kHz and 20 MHz, a challenging range inaccessible to Earth-based radio astronomy. Additionally, the proximity of PSP to the resonant conversion location enhances the signal flux, providing a distinct advantage over ground-based observations. As a result, the PSP data establishes the most stringent constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ for DPDM frequencies between 70 kHz and 20 MHz, with values of $\epsilon \lesssim 10^{-14}-10^{-13}$. Investigating the data from STEREO satellites resulted in weaker constraints compared to those obtained from PSP. By utilizing state-of-the-art solar observations from space, we have surpassed the cosmic microwave background limits derived from early-universe observations.</description>

      <title>Filtering in CMB data analysis with application to ACT DR4 and Planck observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by observed discrepancies between the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 4 (ACT DR4) and Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy power spectra, particularly in the cross-correlation of temperature and E-mode polarization, we investigate challenges that may be encountered in the comparison of satellite and ground-based CMB data. In particular, we focus on the effects of Fourier-space filtering and masking involving bright point sources. We show that the filtering operation generates bright cross-shaped artifacts in the map, which stretch far outside typical point-source masks. If not corrected, these artifacts can add bias or additional variance to cross-spectra, skewing results. However we find that the effect of this systematic is not large enough to explain the ACT-Planck differences presented with ACT DR4.</description>

      <title>superB/NRPy: Scalable, Task-Based Numerical Relativity for 3G Gravitational Wave Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern gravitational-wave science demands increasingly accurate and computationally intensive numerical relativity (NR) simulations. The Python-based, open-source NRPy framework generates optimized C/C++ code for NR, including the complete NR code BlackHoles@Home (BH@H), which leverages curvilinear coordinates well-suited to many astrophysical scenarios. Historically, BH@H was limited to single-node OpenMP CPU parallelism. To address this, we introduce superB, an open-source extension to NRPy that enables automatic generation of scalable, task-based, distributed-memory Charm++ code from existing BH@H modules. The generated code partitions the structured grids used by NRPy/BH@H, managing communication between them. Its correctness is validated through bit-identical results with the standard OpenMP version on a single node and via a head-on binary black hole simulation in cylindrical-like coordinates, accurately reproducing quasi-normal modes (up to $\ell=8$). The superB/NRPy-generated code demonstrates excellent strong scaling, achieving an $\approx 45$x speedup on 64 nodes (7168 cores) compared to the original single-node OpenMP code for a large 3D vacuum test. This scalable infrastructure benefits demanding simulations and lays the groundwork for future multi-patch grid support, targeting long inspirals, extreme parameter studies, and rapid follow-ups. This infrastructure readily integrates with other NRPy/BH@H-based projects, enabling performant scaling for the general relativistic hydrodynamics code GRoovy, and facilitating future coupling with GPU acceleration via the NRPy-CUDA project.</description>
