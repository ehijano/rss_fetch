      <title>Pivotal Brauer-Picard groupoids and graded extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop pivotal and spherical versions of graded extension theory. We define the corresponding analogues of Brauer-Picard $2$-categorical groups and realize them as fixed points of natural $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ $2$-categorical actions. We classify graded extensions of a pivotal tensor category by monoidal $2$-functors into the pivotal Brauer-Picard $2$-categorical group. A similar statement is proven for spherical (unimodular) tensor categories. We also develop an obstruction theory for determining when pivotal structures can be extended.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-dualizing complexes of torsion modules and semi-infinite MGM duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is an MGM version of arXiv.org:1703.04266 and arXiv:1907.03364, and a follow-up to Section 5 of arXiv:1503.05523. In the setting of a commutative ring $S$ with a weakly proregular finitely generated ideal $J\subset S$, we consider the maximal, abstract, and minimal corresponding classes of $J$-torsion $S$-modules and $J$-contramodule $S$-modules with respect to a given pseudo-dualizing complex of $J$-torsion $S$-modules $L^\bullet$, and construct the related triangulated equivalences. As a special case, we obtain an equivalence of the semiderived categories for an $I$-adically coherent commutative ring $R$ with a weakly proregular ideal $I\subset R$, a dualizing complex of $I$-torsion $R$-modules $D^\bullet$, and a ring homomorphism $f\colon R\rightarrow S$ such that $f(I)\subset J$ and $S$ is a flat $R$-module. (If the ring $S$ is not Noetherian, then a certain further assumption, which we call quotflatness of the morphism of pairs $f\colon (R,I)\rightarrow(S,J)$, needs to be imposed.) In that case, the pseudo-dualizing complex $L^\bullet$ is constructed as a complex of $J$-torsion $S$-modules quasi-isomorphic to the tensor product of $D^\bullet$ with the infinite dual Koszul complex for some set of generators of the ideal $J\subset S$.</description>

      <title>Dagger categories and the complex numbers: Axioms for the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and linear contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06584v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We unravel a deep connection between limits of real numbers and limits in category theory. Using a new variant of the classical characterisation of the real numbers, we characterise the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and linear contractions in terms of simple category-theoretic structures and properties that do not refer to norms, continuity, or real numbers. This builds on Heunen, Kornell, and Van der Schaaf's easier characterisation of the category of all Hilbert spaces and linear contractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17769v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for an extensive $1$-category $\mathcal{E}$ with pullbacks and pullback stable coequalisers in which the forgetful functor $\mathcal{U}: \mathbf{Cat}(\mathcal{E})_1 \to \mathbf{Gph}(\mathcal{E})$ has left adjoint, the $2$-category $\mathbf{Cat}(\mathcal{E})$ of internal categories, functors and natural transformations has finite $2$-colimits. In addition, $\mathbf{Cat}(\mathcal{E})$ is extensive, has pullbacks and codescent coequalisers are stable under pullback along discrete Conduch\'{e} fibrations. Moreover, we give converse results to this.</description>

      <title>Hilbert $*$-categories: Where limits in analysis and category theory meet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces Hilbert $*$-categories: an abstraction of categories with similar algebraic and analytic properties to the categories of real, complex, and quaternionic Hilbert spaces and bounded linear maps. Other examples include categories of Hilbert W*-modules and of unitary group-representations. Hilbert $*$-categories are "analytically" complete in two ways: every bounded increasing sequence of Hermitian endomorphisms has a supremum, and every suitably bounded orthogonal family of parallel morphisms is summable. These "analytic" completeness properties are not assumed outright; rather, they are derived, respectively, from two new universal constructions: codirected $\ell^2$-limits of contractions and $\ell^2$-products. In turn, these are built from directed colimits in the wide subcategory of isometries.</description>

      <title>Dagger categories of relations: The equivalence of dilatory dagger categories and epi-regular independence categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several categories look like categories of relations, but do not fit the established theory of relations in regular categories. They include the category of surjective multivalued functions, the category of injective partial functions, the category of finite probability spaces and stochastic matrices, and the category of Hilbert spaces and linear contractions. To explain these anomalous examples, we develop a parallel theory of relations in epi-regular independence categories. Just as regular categories correspond to tabular allegories, epi-regular independence categories correspond to dilatory dagger categories. The equivalence maps epi-regular independence categories to their associated dagger category of relations, and dilatory dagger categories to their wide subcategory of coisometries.</description>

      <title>The formal theory of tangentads PART I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tangent categories offer a categorical context for differential geometry, by categorifying geometric notions like the tangent bundle functor, vector fields, Euclidean spaces, vector bundles, connections, etc. In the last decade, the theory has been extended in new directions, providing concepts such as tangent monads, tangent fibrations, tangent restriction categories, reverse tangent categories and many more. It is natural to wonder how these new flavours interact with the geometric constructions offered by the theory. How does a tangent monad or a tangent fibration lift to the tangent category of vector fields of a tangent category? What is the correct notion of vector bundles for a tangent restriction category? We answer these questions by adopting the formal approach of tangentads. Introduced in our previous work, tangentads provide a unifying context for capturing the different flavours of the theory and for extending constructions like the Grothendieck construction or the equivalence between split restriction categories and $\mathscr{M}$-categories, to the tangent-categorical context. In this paper, we construct the formal notion of vector fields for tangentads, by isolating the correct universal property enjoyed by vector fields in ordinary tangent categories. We show that vector fields form a Lie algebra and a $2$-monad and show how to construct vector fields using PIE limits. Finally, we compute vector fields for some examples of tangentads. In a forthcoming paper, we extend the theory to other constructions: differential objects, differential bundles, and connections.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of excisive functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a thick subcategory theorem for the category of $d$-excisive functors from finite spectra to spectra. This generalizes the Hopkins-Smith thick subcategory theorem (the $d=1$ case) and the $C_2$-equivariant thick subcategory theorem (the $d=2$ case). We obtain our classification theorem by completely computing the Balmer spectrum of compact $d$-excisive functors. A key ingredient is a non-abelian blueshift theorem for the generalized Tate construction associated to the family of non-transitive subgroups of products of symmetric groups. Also important are the techniques of tensor triangular geometry and striking analogies between functor calculus and equivariant homotopy theory. In particular, we introduce a functor calculus analogue of the Burnside ring and describe its Zariski spectrum \`{a} la Dress. The analogy with equivariant homotopy theory is strengthened further through two applications: We explain the effect of changing coefficients from spectra to ${\mathrm{H}\mathbb{Z}}$-modules and we establish a functor calculus analogue of transchromatic Smith-Floyd theory as developed by Kuhn-Lloyd. Our work offers a new perspective on functor calculus which builds upon the previous approaches of Arone-Ching and Glasman.</description>

      <title>Characterizing higher Auslander(-Gorenstein) Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that for Auslander algebras, the category of all (finitely generated) projective modules is an abelian category and this property of abelianness characterizes Auslander algebras by Tachikawa theorem in 1974.
  Let $n$ be a positive integer. In this paper, by using torsion theoretic methods, we show that $ n $-Auslander algebras can be characterized by the abelianness of the category of modules with projective dimension less than $ n $ and a certain additional property, extending the classical Auslander-Tachikawa theorem. By Auslander-Iyama correspondence a categorical characterization of the class of Artin algebras having $ n $-cluster tilting modules is obtained.
  Since higher Auslander algebras are a special case of higher Auslander-Gorenstein algebras, the results are given in the general setting as extending previous results of Kong. Moreover, as an application of some results, we give categorical descriptions for the semisimplicity and selfinjectivity of an Artin algebra.
  Higher Auslander-Gorenstein Algebras are also studied from the viewpoint of cotorsion pairs and, as application, we show that they satisfy in two nice equivalences.</description>

      <title>Length of triangulated categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07583v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of composition series of triangulated categories, which generalizes full exceptional sequences. The lengths of composition series yield invariants for triangulated categories. We study composition series of derived categories for some classes of projective varieties and finite-dimensional algebras. We prove that certain negative rational curves on rational surfaces cause composition series of different lengths in the derived categories of the surfaces. On the other hand, we show that for derived categories of finite-dimensional hereditary algebras, for nontrivial admissible subcategories of ${\rm D}^{\rm b}(\mathbb{P}^2)$ and for derived categories of some singular varieties, all composition series have the same length.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Universes in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Awodey, later with Newstead, showed how polynomial functors with extra structure (termed ``natural models'') hold within them the categorical semantics for dependent type theory. Their work presented these ideas clearly but ultimately led them outside of the usual category of polynomial functors to a particular \emph{tricategory} of polynomials in order to explain all of the structure possessed by such models. This paper builds off that work -- explicating the categorical semantics of dependent type theory by axiomatizing them entirely in terms of the usual category of polynomial functors. In order to handle the higher-categorical coherences required for such an explanation, we work with polynomial functors in the language of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), which allows for higher-dimensional structures to be expressed purely within this category. The move to HoTT moreover enables us to express a key additional condition on polynomial functors -- \emph{univalence} -- which is sufficient to guarantee that models of type theory expressed as univalent polynomials satisfy all higher coherences of their corresponding algebraic structures, purely in virtue of being closed under the usual constructors of dependent type theory. We call polynomial functors satisfying this condition \emph{polynomial universes}. As an example of the simplification to the theory of natural models this enables, we highlight the fact that a polynomial universe being closed under dependent product types implies the existence of a distributive law of monads, which witnesses the usual distributivity of dependent products over dependent sums.</description>
