      <title>Optimal message passing for molecular prediction is simple, attentive and spatial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strategies to improve the predicting performance of Message-Passing Neural-Networks for molecular property predictions can be achieved by simplifying how the message is passed and by using descriptors that capture multiple aspects of molecular graphs. In this work, we designed model architectures that achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing more complex models such as those pre-trained on external databases. We assessed dataset diversity to complement our performance results, finding that structural diversity influences the need for additional components in our MPNNs and feature sets.
  In most datasets, our best architecture employs bidirectional message-passing with an attention mechanism, applied to a minimalist message formulation that excludes self-perception, highlighting that relatively simpler models, compared to classical MPNNs, yield higher class separability. In contrast, we found that convolution normalization factors do not benefit the predictive power in all the datasets tested. This was corroborated in both global and node-level outputs. Additionally, we analyzed the influence of both adding spatial features and working with 3D graphs, finding that 2D molecular graphs are sufficient when complemented with appropriately chosen 3D descriptors. This approach not only preserves predictive performance but also reduces computational cost by over 50%, making it particularly advantageous for high-throughput screening campaigns.</description>

      <title>FragmentGPT: A Unified GPT Model for Fragment Growing, Linking, and Merging in Molecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fragment-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD) is a popular approach in early drug development, but designing effective linkers to combine disconnected molecular fragments into chemically and pharmacologically viable candidates remains challenging. Further complexity arises when fragments contain structural redundancies, like duplicate rings, which cannot be addressed by simply adding or removing atoms or bonds. To address these challenges in a unified framework, we introduce FragmentGPT, which integrates two core components: (1) a novel chemically-aware, energy-based bond cleavage pre-training strategy that equips the GPT-based model with fragment growing, linking, and merging capabilities, and (2) a novel Reward Ranked Alignment with Expert Exploration (RAE) algorithm that combines expert imitation learning for diversity enhancement, data selection and augmentation for Pareto and composite score optimality, and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to align the learner policy with multi-objective goals. Conditioned on fragment pairs, FragmentGPT generates linkers that connect diverse molecular subunits while simultaneously optimizing for multiple pharmaceutical goals. It also learns to resolve structural redundancies-such as duplicated fragments-through intelligent merging, enabling the synthesis of optimized molecules. FragmentGPT facilitates controlled, goal-driven molecular assembly. Experiments and ablation studies on real-world cancer datasets demonstrate its ability to generate chemically valid, high-quality molecules tailored for downstream drug discovery tasks.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks for Efficient Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein-ligand binding affinity is critical in drug discovery, but experimentally determining it is time-consuming and expensive. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to predict binding affinity, significantly accelerating this process. However, the high-performance requirements and vast datasets involved in affinity prediction demand increasingly large AI models, requiring substantial computational resources and training time. Quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. In particular, hybrid quantum-classical models can reduce the number of parameters while maintaining or improving performance compared to classical counterparts. Despite these advantages, challenges persist: why hybrid quantum models achieve these benefits, whether quantum neural networks (QNNs) can replace classical neural networks, and whether such models are feasible on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a hybrid quantum neural network (HQNN) that empirically demonstrates the capability to approximate non-linear functions in the latent feature space derived from classical embedding. The primary goal of this study is to achieve a parameter-efficient model in binding affinity prediction while ensuring feasibility on NISQ devices. Numerical results indicate that HQNN achieves comparable or superior performance and parameter efficiency compared to classical neural networks, underscoring its potential as a viable replacement. This study highlights the potential of hybrid QML in computational drug discovery, offering insights into its applicability and advantages in addressing the computational challenges of protein-ligand binding affinity prediction.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Regression for Enzyme Turnover Rates Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enzyme turnover rate is a fundamental parameter in enzyme kinetics, reflecting the catalytic efficiency of enzymes. However, enzyme turnover rates remain scarce across most organisms due to the high cost and complexity of experimental measurements. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal framework for predicting the enzyme turnover rate by integrating enzyme sequences, substrate structures, and environmental factors. Our model combines a pre-trained language model and a convolutional neural network to extract features from protein sequences, while a graph neural network captures informative representations from substrate molecules. An attention mechanism is incorporated to enhance interactions between enzyme and substrate representations. Furthermore, we leverage symbolic regression via Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to explicitly learn mathematical formulas that govern the enzyme turnover rate, enabling interpretable and accurate predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. This work provides a robust tool for studying enzyme kinetics and holds promise for applications in enzyme engineering, biotechnology, and industrial biocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Polymerization and replication of primordial RNA induced by clay-water interface dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study of life's origins, a key challenge is understanding how RNA could have polymerized and subsequently replicated in early Earth. We present a theoretical and computational framework to model the non-enzymatic polymerization of ribonucleotides and the template-dependent replication of primordial RNA molecules, at the interfaces between the aqueous solution and a clay mineral. Our results demonstrate that systematic polymerization and replication of single-stranded RNA polymers, sufficiently long to fold and acquire basic functions ($&gt;$15 nt), were feasible under these conditions. Crucially, this process required a physico-chemical environment characterized by large-amplitude oscillations with periodicity compatible with spring tide dynamics, suggesting that large moons may have played a role in the emergence of RNA-based life on planetary bodies. Interestingly, the theoretical analysis presents rigorous evidence that RNA replication efficiency increases in oscillating environments compared to constant ones. Moreover, the versatility of our framework enables comparisons between different genetic alphabets, showing that a four-letter alphabet -- particularly when allowing non-canonical base pairs, as in current RNA -- represents an optimal balance of replication speed and sequence diversity in the pathway to life.</description>

      <title>Protein folding classes -- High-dimensional geometry of amino acid composition space revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01857v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, the distributions of protein structure classes (or folding types) of experimentally determined structures from a legacy dataset and a comprehensive database (SCOP) are modeled precisely with geometric constructs such as convex polytopes in high-dimensional amino acid composition space. This is a follow-up of a previous non-statistical, geometry-motivated modeling of protein classes with ellipsoidal models, which is superseded presently in three important respects: (1) as a paradigm shift a descriptive 'distribution model' of experimental data is de-coupled from, and serves as the basis for, a possible future predictive 'domain model' generalizable to proteins in the same class for which 3D structures have yet to be determined experimentally, (2) the geometric and analytic characteristics of class distributions are obtained via exact computational geometry calculations, and (3) the full data from a comprehensive database are included in such calculations, eschewing training set selection and biases. In contrast to statistical and machine-learning approaches, the analytical, non-statistical geometry models of protein class distributions demonstrated in this study furnish complete and precise information on their size and relative disposition in the high-dimensional space (vis-\`a-vis any overlaps leading to ambiguity and classification limits). Intended primarily as an accurate and summary description of the complex relationships between amino acid composition and protein classes, and suitably as a basis for predictive modeling where possible, the results suggest that pen-ultimately they may be useful adjuncts for validating sequence-based protein structure predictions and contribute to theoretical and fundamental understanding of secondary structure formation and protein folding, demonstrating the role of high dimensional amino acid composition space in protein studies.</description>

      <title>Canonicalization of the E value from BLAST similarity search -- dissimilarity measure and distance function for a metric space of protein sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequence matching algorithms such as BLAST and FASTA have been widely used in searching for evolutionary origin and biological functions of newly discovered nucleic acid and protein sequences. As parts of these search tools, alignment scores and E values are useful indicators of the quality of search results from querying a database of annotated sequences, whereby a high alignment score (and inversely a low E value) reflects significant similarity between the query and the subject (target) sequences. For cross-comparison of results from sufficiently different queries however, the interpretation of alignment score as a similarity measure and E value a dissimilarity measure becomes somewhat nuanced, and prompts herein a judicious distinction of different types of similarity. We show that an adjustment of E value to account for self-matching of query and subject sequences corrects for certain ostensibly anomalous similarity comparisons, resulting in canonical dissimilarity and similarity measures that would be more appropriate for database applications, such as all-on-all sequence alignment or selection of diverse subsets. In actual practice, the canonicalization of E value dissimilarity improves clustering and the diversity of subset selection. While both E value and the canonical E value share positivity and symmetry, two of the four axiomatic properties of a metric space, the canonical E value is also reflexive and meets the condition of triangle inequality, thus itself an appropriate distance function for a metric space of protein sequences.</description>

      <title>ProLLaMA: A Protein Large Language Model for Multi-Task Protein Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Protein Language Models (PLMs) have transformed protein engineering, yet unlike their counterparts in Natural Language Processing (NLP), current PLMs exhibit a fundamental limitation: they excel in either Protein Language Understanding (PLU) or Protein Language Generation (PLG), but rarely both. This fragmentation hinders progress in protein engineering. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProLLaMA, a multitask protein language model enhanced by the Evolutionary Protein Generation Framework (EPGF). We construct a comprehensive instruction dataset containing approximately 13 million samples with over 11,000 superfamily annotations to facilitate better modeling of sequence-function landscapes. We leverage a two-stage training approach to develop ProLLaMA, a multitask LLM with protein domain expertise. Our EPGF addresses the mismatch between statistic language modeling and biological constraints through three innovations: a multi-dimensional interpretable scorer, hierarchical efficient decoding, and a probabilistic-biophysical joint selection mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProLLaMA excels in both unconditional and controllable protein generation tasks, achieving superior structural quality metrics compared to existing PLMs. Additionally, ProLLaMA demonstrates strong understanding capabilities with a 67.1% exact match rate in superfamily prediction. EPGF significantly enhances the biological viability of generated sequences, as evidenced by improved biophysical scores (+4.3%) and structural metrics (+14.5%). The project is available at https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ProLLaMA.</description>

      <title>More sophisticated is not always better: comparison of similarity measures for unsupervised learning of pathways in biomolecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding process pathways in molecular simulations such as the unbinding paths of small molecule ligands from their binding sites at protein targets in a set of trajectories via unsupervised learning approaches requires the definition of a suitable similarity measure between trajectories. We here evaluate the performance of four such measures with varying degree of sophistication, i.e., Euclidean and Wasserstein distances, Procrustes analysis and dynamical time warping, when analyzing trajectory data from two different biased simulation driving protocols in the form of constant velocity constraint targeted MD and steered MD. In a streptavidin-biotin benchmark system with known ground truth clusters, Wasserstein distances yielded the best clustering performance, closely followed by Euclidean distances, both being the most computationally efficient similarity measures. In a more complex A2a receptor-inhibitor system, however, the simplest measure, i.e., Euclidean distances, was sufficient to reveal meaningful and interpretable clusters.</description>
