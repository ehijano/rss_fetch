      <title>A Mission Engineering Framework for Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle Design in GNSS-Denied Environments for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Mission Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small, low-size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions due to their affordability, attritability, and suitability for distributed operations. However, their design poses challenges including limited endurance, constrained payload capacity, and reliance on simple sensing modalities such as fixed-field-of-view, bearing-only cameras. Traditional platform-centric methods cannot capture the coupled performance, cost, and coordination trade-offs that emerge at the system-of-systems level.
  This paper presents a mission engineering framework for early-phase design of low-SWaP-C UAV ISR architectures. The framework integrates design of experiments, multi-objective optimization, and high-fidelity simulation into a closed-loop process linking design variables to estimator-informed performance and mission cost. Candidate architectures are explored via Latin hypercube sampling and refined using a genetic algorithm, with performance evaluated through Monte Carlo trials of a federated Kalman filter benchmarked against the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound. Validation follows the Validation Square methodology, combining theoretical, empirical, and structural assessments.
  A case study on man-overboard localization in a GNSS-denied maritime environment shows that localization accuracy saturates at sub-meter levels, while higher-cost configurations primarily add redundancy and resilience. The framework thus quantifies mission trade-offs between performance, affordability, and robustness, providing a scalable decision-support tool for contested, resource-constrained ISR missions.</description>

      <title>Small HVAC Control Demonstrations in Larger Buildings Often Overestimate Savings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How much energy, money, and emissions can advanced control of heating and cooling equipment save in real buildings? To address this question, researchers sometimes control a small number of thermal zones within a larger multi-zone building, then report savings for the controlled zones only. That approach can overestimate savings by neglecting heat transfer between controlled zones and adjacent zones. This paper mathematically characterizes the overestimation error when the dynamics are linear and the objectives are linear in the thermal load, as usually holds when optimizing energy efficiency, energy costs, or emissions. Overestimation errors can be large even in seemingly innocuous situations. For example, when controlling only interior zones that have no direct thermal contact with the outdoors, all perceived savings are fictitious. This paper provides an alternative estimation method based on the controlled and adjacent zones' temperature measurements. The new method does not require estimating how much energy the building would have used under baseline operations, so it removes the additional measurement and verification challenge of accurate baseline estimation.</description>

      <title>HyperKKL: Enabling Non-Autonomous State Estimation through Dynamic Weight Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes HyperKKL, a novel learning approach for designing Kazantzis-Kravaris/Luenberger (KKL) observers for non-autonomous nonlinear systems. While KKL observers offer a rigorous theoretical framework by immersing nonlinear dynamics into a stable linear latent space, its practical realization relies on solving Partial Differential Equations (PDE) that are analytically intractable. Current existing learning-based approximations of the KKL observer are mostly designed for autonomous systems, failing to generalize to driven dynamics without expensive retraining or online gradient updates. HyperKKL addresses this by employing a hypernetwork architecture that encodes the exogenous input signal to instantaneously generate the parameters of the KKL observer, effectively learning a family of immersion maps parameterized by the external drive. We rigorously evaluate this approach against a curriculum learning strategy that attempts to generalize from autonomous regimes via training heuristics alone. The novel approach is illustrated on four numerical simulations in benchmark examples including the Duffing, Van der Pol, Lorenz, and R\"ossler systems.</description>

      <title>Toward Wireless Human-Machine Collaboration in the 6G Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next industrial revolution, Industry 5.0, will be driven by advanced technologies that foster human-machine collaboration (HMC). It will leverage human creativity, judgment, and dexterity with the machine's strength, precision, and speed to improve productivity, quality of life, and sustainability. Wireless communications, empowered by the emerging capabilities of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, will play a central role in enabling flexible, scalable, and low-cost deployment of geographically distributed HMC systems. In this article, we first introduce the generic architecture and key components of wireless HMC (WHMC). We then present the network topologies of WHMC and highlight impactful applications across various industry sectors. Driven by the prospective applications, we elaborate on new performance metrics that researchers and practitioners may consider during the exploration and implementation of WHMC and discuss new design methodologies. We then summarize the communication requirements and review promising state-of-the-art technologies that can support WHMC. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept case study and identify several open challenges.</description>

      <title>Opacity in Discrete Event Systems: A Perspective and Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opacity has emerged as a central confidentiality notion for information-flow security in discrete event systems (DES), capturing the requirement that an external observer (intruder) should never be able to determine with certainty whether the system is, was, or will be in a secret state. This article provides a concise, newcomer-friendly overview of opacity in DES, emphasizing core definitions and the unifying estimation viewpoint behind major opacity notions,. We summarize representative verification techniques and highlight how different observation models reshape both the problem formulation and algorithmic structure. We then review principal enforcement paradigms, ranging from opacity-enforcing supervisory control to sensor activation/information release optimization and obfuscation/editing mechanisms. Beyond finite automata, we outline how opacity has been studied in richer models such as stochastic systems, timed systems, Petri nets, and continuous/hybrid dynamics, and we briefly survey applications in robotics, location privacy, and information services. Finally, we discuss selected open challenges, including solvability under incomparable information, scalable methods beyond worst-case complexity, and opacity under intelligent or data-driven adversaries.</description>

      <title>Transformer Actor-Critic for Efficient Freshness-Aware Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging applications such as autonomous driving and industrial automation demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC), where maintaining fresh and timely information is critical. A key performance metric in such systems is the age of information (AoI). This paper addresses AoI minimization in a multi-user uplink wireless network using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), where users offload tasks to a base station. The system must handle user heterogeneity in task sizes, AoI thresholds, and penalty sensitivities, while adhering to NOMA constraints on user scheduling. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework based on proximal policy optimization (PPO), enhanced with a Transformer encoder. The attention mechanism allows the agent to focus on critical user states and capture inter-user dependencies, improving policy performance and scalability. Extensive simulations show that our method reduces average AoI compared to baselines. We also analyze the evolution of attention weights during training and observe that the model progressively learns to prioritize high-importance users. Attention maps reveal meaningful structure: early-stage policies exhibit uniform attention, while later stages show focused patterns aligned with user priority and NOMA constraints. These results highlight the promise of attention-driven DRL for intelligent, priority-aware resource allocation in next-generation wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Steady State Covariance Steering via Sparse Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the steady state covariance steering for linear dynamical systems via structural intervention on the system matrix. We formulate the covariance steering problem as the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the steady state and target Gaussian distributions. To solve the problem, we develop a solution method, hereafter referred to as the proximal gradient-based algorithm, of promoting sparsity in the structural intervention by integrating the objective into a proximal gradient framework with L1 regularization. The main contribution of this paper lies in the analytical expression of the KL divergence gradient with respect to the intervention matrix: the gradient is characterized by the solutions to two Lyapunov equations related to the state covariance equation and its adjoint. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proximal gradient-based algorithm effectively identifies sparse, structurally-constrained interventions to achieve precise covariance steering.</description>

      <title>Integrated Flight and Propulsion Control for Fixed-Wing UAVs via Thrust and Disturbance Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the position-tracking control problem for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with a turbojet engine via an integrated flight and propulsion control scheme. To this end, a hierarchical control framework with thrust and disturbance compensation is proposed. In particular, we first propose a perturbed fixed-wing UAV model with turbojet engine dynamics, accounting for both unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. Second, a versatile extended observer is designed to handle both unmeasurable thrust dynamics and external disturbances. Third, a hierarchical control framework is implemented using three observer-based controllers to guarantee position-tracking performance. With the proposed control strategy, we prove that the closed-loop system asymptotically converges to the desired trajectory. Finally, a comparative simulation is performed to illustrate the proposed control strategy.</description>

      <title>Signal Temporal Logic Verification and Synthesis Using Deep Reachability Analysis and Layered Control Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a signal temporal logic (STL)-based framework that rigorously verifies the feasibility of a mission described in STL and synthesizes control to safely execute it. The proposed framework ensures safe and reliable operation through two phases. First, the proposed framework assesses the feasibility of STL by computing a backward reachable tube (BRT), which captures all states that can satisfy the given STL, regardless of the initial state. The proposed framework accommodates the multiple reach-avoid (MRA) problem to address more general STL specifications and leverages a deep neural network to alleviate the computation burden for reachability analysis, reducing the computation time by about 1000 times compared to a baseline method. We further propose a layered planning and control architecture that combines mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for global planning with model predictive control (MPC) as a local controller for the verified STL. Consequently, the proposed framework can robustly handle unexpected behavior of obstacles that are not described in the environment information or STL, thereby providing reliable mission performance. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework can successfully compute BRT for a given STL and perform the mission.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-Wave RIS: Hardware Design and System-Level Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces have emerged as a promising hardware platform for shaping wireless propagation environments at millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) frequencies and beyond. While many existing studies emphasize channel modeling and signal processing, practical RIS deployment is fundamentally governed by hardware design choices and their system-level implications. This paper presents a hardware-centric overview of recent mm-Wave RIS developments, covering wideband realizations, high-resolution phase-quantized designs, fully printed low-cost implementations, optically transparent surfaces, RIS-on-chip solutions, and emerging three-dimensional architectures. Key challenges including mutual coupling, calibration, multi-RIS interaction, and frequency-dependent phase control are discussed to bridge hardware realization with system-level optimization. This overview provides practical design insights and aims to guide future RIS research toward scalable, efficient, and practically deployable intelligent surface architectures.</description>

      <title>Improving Spatial Allocation for Energy System Coupling with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In energy system analysis, coupling models with mismatched spatial resolutions is a significant challenge. A common solution is assigning weights to high-resolution geographic units for aggregation, but traditional models are limited by using only a single geospatial attribute. This paper presents an innovative method employing a self-supervised Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network to address this issue. This method models high-resolution geographic units as graph nodes, integrating various geographical features to generate physically meaningful weights for each grid point. These weights enhance the conventional Voronoi-based allocation method, allowing it to go beyond simply geographic proximity by incorporating essential geographic information.In addition, the self-supervised learning paradigm overcomes the lack of accurate ground-truth data. Experimental results demonstrate that applying weights generated by this method to cluster-based Voronoi Diagrams significantly enhances scalability, accuracy, and physical plausibility, while increasing precision compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>AdapTBF: Decentralized Bandwidth Control via Adaptive Token Borrowing for HPC Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern high-performance computing (HPC) applications run on compute resources but share global storage systems. This design can cause problems when applications consume a disproportionate amount of storage bandwidth relative to their allocated compute resources. For example, an application running on a single compute node can issue many small, random writes and consume excessive I/O bandwidth from a storage server. This can hinder larger jobs that write to the same storage server and are allocated many compute nodes, resulting in significant resource waste.
  A straightforward solution is to limit each application's I/O bandwidth on storage servers in proportion to its allocated compute resources. This approach has been implemented in parallel file systems using Token Bucket Filter (TBF). However, strict proportional limits often reduce overall I/O efficiency because HPC applications generate short, bursty I/O. Limiting bandwidth can waste server capacity when applications are idle or prevent applications from temporarily using higher bandwidth during bursty phases.
  We argue that I/O control should maximize per-application performance and overall storage efficiency while ensuring fairness (e.g., preventing small jobs from blocking large-scale ones). We propose AdapTBF, which builds on TBF in modern parallel file systems (e.g., Lustre) and introduces a decentralized bandwidth control approach using adaptive borrowing and lending. We detail the algorithm, implement AdapTBF in Lustre, and evaluate it using synthetic workloads modeled after real-world scenarios. Results show that AdapTBF manages I/O bandwidth effectively while maintaining high storage utilization, even under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Data-Driven Markov Chain Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov chains model a wide range of user behaviors. However, generating accurate Markov chain models requires substantial user data, and sharing these models without privacy protections may reveal sensitive information about the underlying user data. We introduce a method for protecting user data used to formulate a Markov chain model. First, we develop a method for privatizing database queries whose outputs are elements of the unit simplex, and we prove that this method is differentially private. We quantify its accuracy by bounding the expected KL divergence between private and non-private queries. We extend this method to privatize stochastic matrices whose rows are each a simplex-valued query of a database, which includes data-driven Markov chain models. To assess their accuracy, we analytically bound the change in the stationary distribution and the change in the convergence rate between a non-private Markov chain model and its private form. Simulations show that under a typical privacy implementation, our method yields less than 2% error in the stationary distribution, indicating that our approach to private modeling faithfully captures the behavior of the systems we study.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Trajectory Planning of Floating-Base Multi-Link Robot for Maneuvering in Confined Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floating-base multi-link robots can change their shape during flight, making them well-suited for applications in confined environments such as autonomous inspection and search and rescue. However, trajectory planning for such systems remains an open challenge because the problem lies in a high-dimensional, constraint-rich space where collision avoidance must be addressed together with kinematic limits and dynamic feasibility. This work introduces a hierarchical trajectory planning framework that integrates global guidance with configuration-aware local optimization. First, we exploit the dual nature of these robots - the root link as a rigid body for guidance and the articulated joints for flexibility - to generate global anchor states that decompose the planning problem into tractable segments. Second, we design a local trajectory planner that optimizes each segment in parallel with differentiable objectives and constraints, systematically enforcing kinematic feasibility and maintaining dynamic feasibility by avoiding control singularities. Third, we implement a complete system that directly processes point-cloud data, eliminating the need for handcrafted obstacle models. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments confirm that this framework enables an articulated aerial robot to exploit its morphology for maneuvering that rigid robots cannot achieve. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first planning framework for floating-base multi-link robots that has been demonstrated on a real robot to generate continuous, collision-free, and dynamically feasible trajectories directly from raw point-cloud inputs, without relying on handcrafted obstacle models.</description>

      <title>SignVLA: A Gloss-Free Vision-Language-Action Framework for Real-Time Sign Language-Guided Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present, to our knowledge, the first sign language-driven Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework for intuitive and inclusive human-robot interaction. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on gloss annotations as intermediate supervision, the proposed system adopts a gloss-free paradigm and directly maps visual sign gestures to semantic instructions. This design reduces annotation cost and avoids the information loss introduced by gloss representations, enabling more natural and scalable multimodal interaction.
  In this work, we focus on a real-time alphabet-level finger-spelling interface that provides a robust and low-latency communication channel for robotic control. Compared with large-scale continuous sign language recognition, alphabet-level interaction offers improved reliability, interpretability, and deployment feasibility in safety-critical embodied environments. The proposed pipeline transforms continuous gesture streams into coherent language commands through geometric normalization, temporal smoothing, and lexical refinement, ensuring stable and consistent interaction.
  Furthermore, the framework is designed to support future integration of transformer-based gloss-free sign language models, enabling scalable word-level and sentence-level semantic understanding. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in grounding sign-derived instructions into precise robotic actions under diverse interaction scenarios. These results highlight the potential of the framework to advance accessible, scalable, and multimodal embodied intelligence.</description>

      <title>Gradient Dominance in the Linear Quadratic Regulator: A Unified Analysis for Continuous-Time and Discrete-Time Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite its nonconvexity, policy optimization for the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) admits a favorable structural property known as gradient dominance, which facilitates linear convergence of policy gradient methods to the globally optimal gain. While gradient dominance has been extensively studied, continuous-time and discrete-time LQRs have largely been analyzed separately, relying on slightly different assumptions, proof strategies, and resulting guarantees. In this paper, we present a unified gradient dominance property for both continuous-time and discrete-time LQRs under mild stabilizability and detectability assumptions. Our analysis is based on a convex reformulation derived from a common Lyapunov inequality representation and a unified change-of-variables procedure. This convex-lifting perspective yields a single proof framework applicable to both time models. The unified treatment clarifies how differences between continuous-time and discrete-time dynamics influence theoretical guarantees and reveals a deeper structural symmetry between the two formulations. Numerical examples illustrate and support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Robust Helicopter Ship Deck Landing With Guaranteed Timing Using Shrinking-Horizon Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a runtime efficient algorithm for autonomous helicopter landings on moving ship decks based on Shrinking-Horizon Model Predictive Control (SHMPC). First, a suitable planning model capturing the relevant aspects of the full nonlinear helicopter dynamics is derived. Next, we use the SHMPC together with a touchdown controller stage to ensure a pre-specified maneuver time and an associated landing time window despite the presence of disturbances. A high disturbance rejection performance is achieved by designing an ancillary controller with disturbance feedback. Thus, given a target position and time, a safe landing with suitable terminal conditions is be guaranteed if the initial optimization problem is feasible. The efficacy of our approach is shown in simulation where all maneuvers achieve a high landing precision in strong winds while satisfying timing and operational constraints with maximum computation times in the millisecond range.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Multi-agent Race Strategies in Formula 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Formula 1, race strategies are adapted according to evolving race conditions and competitors' actions. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach for multi-agent race strategy optimization. Agents learn to balance energy management, tire degradation, aerodynamic interaction, and pit-stop decisions. Building on a pre-trained single-agent policy, we introduce an interaction module that accounts for the behavior of competitors. The combination of the interaction module and a self-play training scheme generates competitive policies, and agents are ranked based on their relative performance. Results show that the agents adapt pit timing, tire selection, and energy allocation in response to opponents, achieving robust and consistent race performance. Because the framework relies only on information available during real races, it can support race strategists' decisions before and during races.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Zero-Shot and One-Shot Adaptation of Small Language Models in Leader-Follower Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leader-follower interaction is an important paradigm in human-robot interaction (HRI). Yet, assigning roles in real time remains challenging for resource-constrained mobile and assistive robots. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for natural communication, their size and latency limit on-device deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a potential alternative, but their effectiveness for role classification in HRI has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we present a benchmark of SLMs for leader-follower communication, introducing a novel dataset derived from a published database and augmented with synthetic samples to capture interaction-specific dynamics. We investigate two adaptation strategies: prompt engineering and fine-tuning, studied under zero-shot and one-shot interaction modes, compared with an untrained baseline. Experiments with Qwen2.5-0.5B reveal that zero-shot fine-tuning achieves robust classification performance (86.66% accuracy) while maintaining low latency (22.2 ms per sample), significantly outperforming baseline and prompt-engineered approaches. However, results also indicate a performance degradation in one-shot modes, where increased context length challenges the model's architectural capacity. These findings demonstrate that fine-tuned SLMs provide an effective solution for direct role assignment, while highlighting critical trade-offs between dialogue complexity and classification reliability on the edge.</description>

      <title>Stealthy Sensor Attacks Against Direct Data-Driven Controllers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the vulnerability of discrete-time linear time-invariant systems to stealthy sensor attacks during the learning phase. In particular, we demonstrate that a {data-driven} adversary, without access to the system model, can inject attacks that mislead the operator into learning an {unstable} state-feedback controller. We further analyze attacks that degrade the performance of data-driven ${H}_2$ controllers, while ensuring that the operator can always compute a feasible controller. Potential mitigation strategies are also discussed. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacks and underscore the importance of accounting for adversarial manipulations in data-driven controller design.</description>

      <title>A spherical amplitude-phase formulation for 3-D adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) guidance with USGES stability guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently proposed 3-D adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) path-following algorithm addressed coupled motion dynamics of marine craft, aircraft and uncrewed vehicles under environmental disturbances such as wind, waves and ocean currents. Stability analysis established uniform semi-global exponential stability (USGES) using a body-velocity-based amplitude-phase representation of the North-East-Down kinematic differential equations. However, the analysis is limited to straight-line paths, and restrictive assumptions are needed to ensure convergence of the vertical crab angle estimation error to zero. In this paper, we revisit the ALOS framework and introduce a novel spherical amplitude-phase design model that uses an alternative definition of the vertical crab angle. Our proposed formulation enables a significantly simplified stability proof, while retaining the USGES property for straight-line paths, removing restrictive assumptions on constant altitude/depth or zero horizontal crab angle, and remaining valid for general 3-D motion with nonzero roll, pitch and flight-path angles. We also show that the USGES result extends to a class of curved 3-D paths.</description>

      <title>Efficient CNN Inference on Ultra-Low-Power MCUs via Saturation-Aware Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantized CNN inference on ultra-low-power MCUs incurs unnecessary computations in neurons that produce saturated output values. These values are too extreme and are eventually clamped to the boundaries allowed by the neuron. Often times, the neuron can save time by only producing a value that is extreme enough to lead to the clamped result, instead of completing the computation, yet without introducing any error. Based on this, we present saturation-aware convolution: an inference technique whereby we alter the order of computations in convolution kernels to induce earlier saturation, and value checks are inserted to omit unnecessary computations when the intermediate result is sufficiently extreme. Our experimental results display up to 24% inference time saving on a Cortex-M0+ MCU, with zero impact on accuracy.</description>

      <title>Gain-Scheduling Data-Enabled Predictive Control for Nonlinear Systems with Linearized Operating Regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a Gain-Scheduled Data-Enabled Predictive Control (GS-DeePC) framework for nonlinear systems based on multiple locally linear data representations. Instead of relying on a single global Hankel matrix, the operating range of a measurable scheduling variable is partitioned into regions, and regional Hankel matrices are constructed from persistently exciting data. To ensure smooth transitions between linearization regions and suppress region-induced chattering, composite regions are introduced, merging neighboring data sets and enabling a robust switching mechanism. The proposed method maintains the original DeePC problem structure and can achieve reduced computational complexity by requiring only short, locally informative data sequences. Extensive experiments on a nonlinear DC-motor with an unbalanced disc demonstrate the significantly improved control performance compared to standard DeePC.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the error dynamics of a thrusting spacecraft are nearly group affine on the $SE_2(3)$ Lie group, and the nonlinearity can be bounded, or removed with the application of a dynamic inversion control law. A numerical example validates the results by showing agreement between the error predicted by the log-dynamics and the error obtained from classical integration of trajectories using Newtonian dynamics. The result clarifies how thrusting spacecraft dynamics fit within the invariant systems framework.</description>

Abstract: In [1], a new modeling paradigm for developing rate-and-state-dependent, control-oriented friction models was introduced. The framework, termed Friction with Bristle Dynamics (FrBD), combines nonlinear analytical expressions for the friction coefficient with constitutive equations for bristle-like elements. Within the FrBD framework, this letter introduces two novel formulations based on the two most general linear viscoelastic models for solids: the Generalized Maxwell (GM) and Generalized Kelvin-Voigt (GKV) elements. Both are analyzed in terms of boundedness and passivity, revealing that these properties are satisfied for any physically meaningful parametrization. An application of passivity for control design is also illustrated, considering an example from robotics. The findings of this letter systematically integrate rate-and-state dynamic friction models with linear viscoelasticity.</description>

      <title>Passive Beam Shaping via Binary-Coded Apertures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a coded-aperture reflector for indoor mmWave coverage enhancement in obstructed or blocked LoS settings. We model the reflecting aperture using an equivalent array-factor formulation, where each passive reflecting cell contributes a reradiated field with phase set by the incident and departure directions. Building on this model, we develop two fabrication-friendly passive synthesis methods: (i) binary (1-bit) spatial coding that enables deterministic non-specular beam formation and multibeam patterns by selecting cell participation on a dense {\lambda}/2 lattice via an ON/OFF metallization mask, and (ii) diffraction-order (periodic) steering that exploits aperture periodicity to place selected diffraction orders at prescribed angles. We analytically characterize the proposed cosine-threshold quantization rule, including its asymptotic activation ratio and a distribution-free lower bound on non-specular gain relative to ideal continuous-phase control. To validate the proposed designs, we fabricate and metallize low-cost prototypes in-house using a copper-backed 3D-printed "inkwell" substrate with stencil-guided conductive ink deposition. 60 GHz over-the-air measurements show non-specular power enhancements on the order of +14-20 dB relative to passive, non-engineered (all-ON) reflector baselines. Results also demonstrate that fully passive, binary-coded apertures can deliver beam control with rapid in-lab manufacturability and offer a practical alternative to power-consuming reconfigurable surfaces for static indoor mmWave links.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show how informativity and identifiability for networks of dynamical systems can be investigated using Gr\"obner bases. We provide a sufficient condition for informativity in terms of positive definiteness of the spectrum of external signals and full generic rank of the transfer function relating the external signals to the inputs of the predictor. Moreover, we show how generic local network identifiability can be investigated by computing the dimension of the fiber associated with the closed loop transfer function from external measurable signals to the measured outputs.</description>

      <title>Preference Analysis Using Random Spanning Trees: A Stochastic Sampling Approach to Inconsistent Pairwise Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.01731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eliciting preferences from human judgements is inherently imprecise, yet most decision analysis methods force a single priority vector from pairwise comparisons, discarding the information embedded in inconsistencies. We instead leverage inconsistency to characterise preference uncertainty by examining all priority vectors consistent with the decision maker's judgements. Spanning tree analysis enumerates combinations of evaluation and weighting vectors from pairwise comparison subsets, each yielding a distinct preference vector and collectively defining a distribution over possible preference orderings. Since exponential growth renders complete enumeration prohibitive, we propose a stochastic random walk sampling approach with sample sizes formally established via statistical sampling theory. This enables two key metrics: Pairwise Winning Indices (PWIs), the probability one alternative is preferred to another, and Rank Acceptability Indices (RAIs), the probability an alternative attains a given rank. A notable advantage is applicability to incomplete pairwise comparisons, common in large-scale problems. We validate the methodology against complete enumeration on a didactic example, then demonstrate scalability on a telecommunications backbone infrastructure selection case study involving billions of spanning tree combinations. The approach yields probabilistic insights into preference robustness and ranking uncertainty, supporting informed decisions without the burden of exact enumeration.</description>

      <title>DreamWaQ++: Obstacle-Aware Quadrupedal Locomotion With Resilient Multi-Modal Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots hold promising potential for applications in navigating cluttered environments with resilience akin to their animal counterparts. However, their floating base configuration makes them vulnerable to real-world uncertainties, yielding substantial challenges in their locomotion control. Deep reinforcement learning has become one of the plausible alternatives for realizing a robust locomotion controller. However, the approaches that rely solely on proprioception sacrifice collision-free locomotion because they require front-feet contact to detect the presence of stairs to adapt the locomotion gait. Meanwhile, incorporating exteroception necessitates a precisely modeled map observed by exteroceptive sensors over a period of time. Therefore, this work proposes a novel method to fuse proprioception and exteroception featuring a resilient multi-modal reinforcement learning. The proposed method yields a controller that showcases agile locomotion performance on a quadrupedal robot over a myriad of real-world courses, including rough terrains, steep slopes, and high-rise stairs, while retaining its robustness against out-of-distribution situations.</description>

Abstract: In problems that involve input parameter information gathered from multiple data sources with varying reliability, incorporating decision makers' trust on different sources in optimization models can potentially improve solution performance. In this work, we propose a novel multi-reference distributionally robust optimization (MR-DRO) framework, where the model inputs are uncertain and their probability distributions can be statistically inferred from multiple information sources. Via nonparametric data fusion, we construct a Wasserstein ambiguity set to minimize the worst-case expected cost of a stochastic objective function, accounting for both uncertainty and unknown reliability of several given information sources. We reformulate the MR-DRO model as a linear program given linear objective and constraints in the original problem. We also incorporate a dynamic trust update mechanism that adjusts the trust for each source based on its performance over time. In addition, we introduce the concept of probability dominance to identify sources with dominant trust. Via computational studies using resource allocation and portfolio optimization instances, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the MR-DRO approach compared to traditional optimization frameworks relying on a single data source. Our results highlight the significance of integrating (dynamic) decision maker's trust in optimization under uncertainty, particularly when given diverse and potentially conflicting input data.</description>

Abstract: The digital transformation of power systems is accelerating the adoption of IEC 61850 standard. However, its communication protocols, including Sampled Values (SV), lack built-in security features such as authentication and encryption, making them vulnerable to malicious packet injection. Such cyber attacks can delay fault clearance or trigger unintended circuit breaker operations. While most existing research focuses on detecting cyber attacks in digital substations, intrusion prevention systems have been disregarded because of the risk of potential communication network disruptions. This paper proposes a novel method using hybrid statistical-deep learning for the detection, prevention, and source localization of IEC 61850 SV injection attacks. The method uses exponentially modified Gaussian distributions to model communication network latency and long short-term memory and Elman recurrent neural network to detect anomalous variations in the estimated probability distributions. It effectively discards malicious SV frames with minimal processing overhead and latency, maintains robustness against communication network latency variation and time-synchronization issues, and guarantees a near-zero false positive rate in non-attack scenarios. Comprehensive validation is conducted on three testbeds involving industrial-grade devices, hardware-in-the-loop simulations, virtualized intelligent electronic devices and merging units, and high-fidelity emulated communication networks. Results demonstrate the method's suitability for practical deployment in IEC 61850-compliant digital substations.</description>
