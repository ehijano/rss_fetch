      <title>Detection of the 2021 Arid Meteor Shower on Maunakea, Hawai'i</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the successful detection of the "Arid" Meteor Shower (IAU\#1130 ARD), predicted to emerge for the first time in 2021, using a publicly accessible YouTube live camera developed by us. This live camera, installed on the Subaru Telescope dome in the summit region of Maunakea, Hawai'i, features a wide field of view (70 deg by 40 deg) and high sensitivity, capable of observing stars fainter than 6th magnitude. Meteor detection was performed in two ways: visual inspection by citizen viewers and subsequent validation through automated detection. As a result, we confirmed that the number of meteors appearing from near the predicted radiant increased by more than six times (~9 sigma) compared to the preceding and following days. Our observation time was 4-5 hours after the predicted peak (solar longitude = 193.9 deg), providing clear data indicating that the activity had not yet declined. Optical observations at this time from the Northern Hemisphere are extremely limited and unique, making our observation point valuable. The meteors are characterized as slow and faint appearance, but several brighter meteors with wakes were also observed. Simulations tracing the dust trails from the parent body, Comet 15P/Finlay, suggest that our detection can be explained by either the dust trails released in 2008 or 2014, both requiring high ejection velocities. However, during the comet's 2008 return, its activity was exceptionally quiet, making a high-velocity dust ejection questionable. On the other hand, multiple large outbursts were observed during the 2014 return, at which time a certain amount of high-velocity dust release is expected. We conclude that the dust source of the meteor shower detected in Hawai'i this time is likely attributable to high-velocity (~67 m s-1) dust ejected during the 2014 outburst.</description>

      <title>Stellar control on atmospheric carbon chemistry, CO runaway, and organic synthesis on lifeless Earth-like planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundances of atmospheric carbon species--carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4)--exert fundamental controls on the climate, redox state, and prebiotic environment of terrestrial planets. As exoplanet atmospheric characterization advances, it is essential to understand how these species are regulated on habitable terrestrial planets across a wide range of stellar and planetary conditions. Here, we develop an integrated numerical model that couples atmospheric chemistry, climate, and the long-term carbon cycle to investigate the atmospheric compositions of lifeless, Earth-like planets orbiting Sun-like (F-, G-, and K-type) stars. Our simulations demonstrate that CO2, CO, and CH4 generally increase with orbital distance, and that planets near the outer edge of the habitable zone may undergo CO runaway--a photochemical instability driven by severe depletion of OH radicals. The threshold for CO runaway depends strongly on stellar spectral type and is most easily triggered around cooler, lower-mass stars. In contrast, the atmospheric production of formaldehyde (H2CO)--a key precursor for prebiotic organic chemistry--peaks around planets orbiting more massive, UV-luminous stars and is maximized at orbital distances just interior to the CO-runaway threshold. These results establish a quantitative framework linking observable system properties--stellar type and orbital distance--and the atmospheric carbon chemistry of lifeless Earth-like planets, providing new context for interpreting future spectroscopic observations and for evaluating the potential of such planets to sustain prebiotic chemistry.</description>

      <title>Two temperate Earth- and Neptune-sized planets orbiting fully convective M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the diversity of exoplanets continues to grow, it is important to revisit assumptions about habitability and classical HZ definitions. In this work, we introduce an expanded 'temperate' zone, defined by instellation fluxes between $0.1&lt;S/\mathrm{S}_\oplus&lt;5$, thus encompassing a broader range of potentially habitable worlds. We also introduce the TEMPOS survey, which aims to produce a catalogue of precise radii for temperate planets orbiting M dwarfs with $T_\mathrm{eff}\leq3400\,$ K. This work reports the discovery and characterisation of two planets in this temperate regime orbiting mid-type M dwarfs: TOI-6716\,b, a $0.98\pm0.07\,\mathrm{R}_\oplus$ planet orbiting its M4 host star ($R_\star=0.231\,\pm0.015\mathrm{R}_\odot$, $M_\star=0.223\pm0.011\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, $T_\mathrm{eff}=3110\pm80\,\mathrm{K}$) with a period $P=4.7185898^{+0.0000054}_{-0.0000041}\,\mathrm{d}$, and TOI-7384 b, a $3.56\pm0.21\,\mathrm{R}_\oplus$ planet orbiting an M4 ($R_\star=0.319\,\pm0.018\mathrm{R}_\odot$, $M_\star=0.318\pm0.016\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, $T_\mathrm{eff}=3185\pm75\,\mathrm{K}$) star every $P=6.2340258^{+0.0000034}_{-0.0000036}\,\mathrm{d}$. The radii of TOI-6716 b and TOI-7384 b have precisions of $6.8\%$ and $5.9\%$ respectively. We validate these planets with multi-band ground-based photometric observations, high-resolution imaging and statistical analyses. We find these planets to have instellation fluxes close to the inner (hotter) edge of the temperate zone, with $4.4\pm1.1\,\mathrm{S}_\oplus$ and $4.9\pm1.1\,\mathrm{S}_\oplus$ for TOI-6716 b and TOI-7384 b respectively. Also, with a predicted TSM similar to the TRAPPIST-1 planets, TOI-6716 b is likely to be a good rocky-world JWST target, should it have retained its atmosphere.</description>

      <title>On the orbital evolution of binaries with polar circumbinary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binaries occur in many astrophysical systems, from young protostellar binaries in star forming regions to supermassive black hole binaries in galaxy centers. In many cases, a circumbinary disk of gas forms around the binary with an orbit that may be misaligned to the binary plane. Misaligned disks around nearly circular binaries evolve into disks that are either aligned or counteraligned with the binary orbit. However, if the binary is sufficiently eccentric, then it can be more likely that the disk ends up in a polar-aligned configuration in which the disk angular momentum vector aligns with the binary eccentricity vector. We use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations, evolved to an approximate steady state under mass injection, to determine the orbital evolution of a binary with a polar-aligned disk for a range of binary-disk parameters. We find that, in all of the cases we have simulated, the binary shrinks with time. The decay rate is larger than for binaries surrounded by aligned or retrograde disks with matched disk parameters. The rate of shrinkage is largely unaltered by the size of the sink radii employed for the binary stars, but for small enough sink radii some of the models exhibit long-lived polar circumprimary disks, which are continually fed mass from the circumbinary disk. We discuss our results in the contexts of planet formation in young polar-aligned disks and merging supermassive black holes in galaxy centers.</description>

      <title>Distinct Rotational Evolution of Giant Planets and Brown Dwarf Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rotational velocity (vsini) survey of 32 stellar/substellar objects and giant planets using Keck/KPIC high-resolution spectroscopy, including 6 giant planets (2-7 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) and 25 substellar/stellar companions (12-88 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$). Adding companions with spin measurements from the literature, we construct a curated spin sample for 43 benchmark stellar/substellar companions and giant planets and 54 free-floating brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects. We compare their spins, parameterized as fractional breakup velocities at 10 Myr, assuming constant angular momentum evolution. We find the first clear evidence that giant planets exhibit distinct spins versus low-mass brown dwarf companions (10 to 40 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) at 4-4.5 $\sigma$ significance assuming inclinations aligned with their orbits, while under randomly oriented inclinations the significance is at 1.6-2.1 $\sigma$. Our findings hold when considering various assumptions about planets, and the mass ratio below 0.8% gives a clean cut for rotation between giant planets and brown dwarf companions. The higher fractional breakup velocities of planets can be interpreted as less angular momentum loss through circumplanetary disk braking during the planet formation phase. Brown dwarf companions exhibit evidence of slower rotation compared to isolated brown dwarfs, while planets and planetary mass objects show similar spins. Finally, our analysis of specific angular momentum versus age of 221 stellar/substellar objects below 0.1 MSun with spin measurements in the literature indicates that the substellar objects of 5-40 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ retain much higher angular momenta compared to stellar and substellar objects of 40-100 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ after 10 Myr, when their initial angular momenta were set.</description>

      <title>Setting up the physical principles of resilience in a model of the Earth System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resilience is a property of social, ecological, social-ecological and biophysical systems. It describes the capacity of a system to cope with, adapt to and innovate in response to a changing surrounding. Given the current climate change crisis, ensuring conditions for a sustainable future for the habitability on the planet is fundamentally dependent on Earth System (ES) resilience. It is thus particularly relevant to establish a model that captures and frames resilience of the ES, most particularly in physical terms that can be influenced by human policy\footnote{See page 4 for examples of strategies}. In this work we propose that resilience can serve as a theoretical foundation when unpacking and describing metastable states of equilibrium and energy dissipation in any dynamic description of the variables that characterise the ES. Since the impact of the human activities can be suitably gauged by the planetary boundaries (PBs) and the planet's temperature is the net result of the multiple PB variables, such as $\text{CO}_2$ concentration and radiative forcing, atmospheric aerosol loading, atmospheric ozone depletion, etc, then resilience features arise once conditions to avoid an ES runaway to a state where the average temperature is much higher than the current one. Our model shows that this runaway can be prevented by the presence of metastable states and dynamic friction built out of the interaction among the PB variables once suitable conditions are satisfied. In this work these conditions are specified. As humanity moves away from Holocene conditions, we argue that resilience features arising from metastable states might be crucial for the ES to follow sustainable trajectories in the Anthropocene that prevent it run into a much hotter potential equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Overestimated Pressure Broadening Misleads Model Spectra in Cool M Dwarf Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Available one-dimensional stellar models fail to reproduce the observed spectrum of the ultracool M dwarf TRAPPIST-1. In particular, current models predict strong iron hydride (FeH) absorption due to the Wing-Ford bands at 0.99$\mu$m, yet this spectral feature is only weakly present in TRAPPIST-1 and other mid-to-late M dwarf stars. Additionally, the shape of the continuum between the water bands in the near-infrared does not match between models and observations. Here, we show that assumptions about pressure broadening, specifically van der Waals broadening, have a dramatic effect on modeled broadband spectral features. We use Merged Parallelized Simplified-ATLAS to generate synthetic spectra over a range of van der Waals broadening strengths, adopting 1D PHOENIX temperature-pressure structures. We find that minimal broadening best matches the observed FeH profile at 0.99$\mu$m and in the pseudocontinuum between the large water bands. These results suggest that broadening prescriptions derived for Sun-like stars are not valid for lower-mass stars and that pressure broadening for molecular lines in cool stellar atmospheres must be reevaluated. Refining pressure broadening treatments will improve the accuracy of M dwarf spectral models, enabling more reliable determinations of stellar properties and atmospheric compositions of planets orbiting M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Paving the Road to the Habitable Worlds Observatory with High-Resolution Imaging I: New and Archival Speckle Observations of Potential HWO Target Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key goals of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is to directly image about 25 potentially habitable exoplanets and determine their properties. This challenge will require a large survey of nearby, bright stars -- ~100 according to the Astro2020 Decadel Survey. To ensure the success of the mission and to help guide design decisions, the stellar multiplicity of the target stars must be well-understood. To this end, we present optical speckle imaging of stars in the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) provisional HWO star list, which is currently the Tier 1 target list for the HWO Target Stars and Systems Sub-Working Group. We obtained new observations using `Alopeke and Zorro at Gemini Observatory and queried the Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program Archive for archival observations, resulting in speckle imaging data for 80 of the 164 stars. We confirmed one candidate companion detected previously by Gaia (HD 90089) and obtained an ambiguous detection of a known companion (HD 212330). To examine our sensitivity to companions, we simulated stellar companions down to ~0.1 $M_{\odot}$ for each target and found that 75%-85% would be detected in our speckle images; the remaining simulated companions are either too faint or too close-in, and will require follow-up using other methods such as long-term spectroscopic measurements and space-based techniques. This work represents a first step towards surveying potential HWO targets for close-in stellar companions and helping to inform the target selection process for the HWO direct-imaging survey, bringing us closer towards the discovery of potential habitable worlds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13154v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planetary systems with multiple transiting planets are beneficial for understanding planet occurrence rates and system architectures. Although we have yet to find a solar system analogue, future surveys may detect multiple terrestrial planets transiting a Sun-like star. In this work, we simulate transit timing observations of our system based on the actual orbital motions of Venus and the Earth+Moon (EM) -- influenced by the other solar system objects -- and retrieve the system's dynamical parameters for varying noise levels and observing durations. Using an approximate coplanar N-body model for transit-time variations, we consider test configurations with 2, 3, and 4 planets.
  For various observing baselines, we can robustly retrieve the masses and orbits of Venus and EM; detect Jupiter at high significance (for &lt; 90-second timing error and baseline $\leq$ 15 yrs); and detect Mars at 5 $\sigma$ confidence (with &lt; 20-second timing error and baseline $\geq$ 27 yrs) using TTVFaster. We also find that the 3-planet model is generally preferred, and provide equations to estimate the mass precision of Venus/Earth/Jupiter-analogues. The addition of Mars -- which is near a 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Earth -- improves our retrieval of Jupiter's parameters, suggesting that unseen terrestrials could interfere in the characterization of multi-planetary systems. Our findings are comparable to theoretical limits based upon stellar variability and may eventually be possible.</description>

      <title>Close-in planet induces flares on its host star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past decade, hundreds of exoplanets have been discovered in extremely short orbits below 10 days. Unlike in the Solar System, planets in these systems orbit their host stars close enough to disturb the stellar magnetic field lines. The interaction can enhance the star's magnetic activity, such as its chromospheric and radio emission, or flaring. So far, the search for magnetic star-planet interactions has remained inconclusive. Here, we report the first detection of planet-induced flares on HIP 67522, a 17 million-year-old G dwarf star with two known close-in planets. Combining space-borne photometry from TESS and dedicated CHEOPS observations over a span of 5 years, we find that the 15 flares in HIP 67522 cluster near the innermost planet's transit phase, indicating persistent magnetic star-planet interaction in the system. The stability of interaction implies that the innermost planet is continuously self-inflicting a six time higher flare rate than it would experience without interaction. The subsequent flux of energetic radiation and particles bombarding HIP 67522 b may explain the planet's remarkably extended atmosphere, recently detected with the James Webb Space Telescope. HIP 67522 is therefore an archetype to understand the impact of magnetic star-planet interaction on the atmospheres of nascent exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Phased-Array Laser Power Beaming from Cislunar Space to the Lunar Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a time-dependent, end-to-end framework for laser power beaming from cislunar orbits to the lunar surface. The model links on-orbit generation (solar arrays and wall-plug to optical), terrain-masked visibility and range, beam propagation with realistic divergence and jitter, and surface conversion with thermal and dust limits, returning delivered daily energy. Baseline loads for early polar activities (habitat survival, mobility, comm/nav, pilot ISRU) set target Wh\,day$^{-1}$ and are used consistently in scaling laws and design maps. A near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) to a Shackleton-rim site provides a worked example: for a 2\,m-class phased array at 1064\,nm the reference geometry yields $\sim$0.6--0.8\,kWh\,day$^{-1}$ to a 1\,m$^2$ receiver (about 28\,W averaged over the day). We place this result in context by comparing on the same daily-energy metric to surface photovoltaics (PV) with storage and to compact fission, and by showing how delivered energy scales nearly linearly with transmit power and as $D_{\rm eff}^{2}$ via encircled-energy capture, with a multiplicative gain from visibility (constellations). The same framework indicates practical regimes already within reach: e.g., a 10\,m effective-aperture optical phased array at $P_{\rm tx}=100$\,kW delivers $\sim$30--50\,kWh\,day$^{-1}$ at polar sites with typical single-orbiter visibility, as quantified by the delivered-energy and sizing maps. Thus, laser beaming is mass-competitive where darkness or permanent shadow forces deep storage for PV, or where distributed and duty-cycled users can amortize a shared transmitter; compact fission retains advantage for continuous multi-kW baseload at fixed sites.</description>

Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant shift in astrochemistry with a renewed focus on the role of non-thermal processes on the molecular interstellar medium, in particular energetic particles (such as cosmic ray particles and fast electrons) and X-ray radiation. This has been brought about in large part due to new observations of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMS) in environments that would inhibit their formation, such as cold, dense gas in prestellar cores or in the highly energetic environments in galactic centers. In parallel, there has been a plethora of new laboratory investigations on the role of high-energy radiation and electrons on the chemistry of astrophysical ices, demonstrating the ability of this radiation to induce complex chemistry. In recent years, theoretical models have also begun to include newer cosmic-ray-driven processes in both the gas and ice phases. In this review, we unify aspects of the chemistry driven by X-ray radiation and energetic particles into a ``high-energy astrochemistry'', defining this term and reviewing the underlying chemical processes. We conclude by examining various laboratories where high-energy astrochemistry is at play and identify future issues to be tackled.</description>
