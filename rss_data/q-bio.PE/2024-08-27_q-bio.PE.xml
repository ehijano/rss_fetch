      <title>Efficiently Approximating Spread Dimension with High Confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concepts of spread and spread dimension of a metric space were introduced by Willerton in the context of quantifying biodiversity of ecosystems. In previous work, we developed the theoretical basis for applications of spread dimension as an intrinsic dimension estimator. In this paper we introduce the pseudo spread dimension which is an efficient approximation of spread dimension, and we derive a formula for the standard error associated with this approximation.</description>

      <title>Impact of a block structure on the Lotka-Volterra model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09470v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lotka-Volterra (LV) model is a simple, robust, and versatile model used to describe large interacting systems such as food webs or microbiomes. The model consists of $n$ coupled differential equations linking the abundances of $n$ different species. We consider a large random interaction matrix with independent entries and a block variance profile. The $i$th diagonal block represents the intra-community interaction in community $i$, while the off-diagonal blocks represent the inter-community interactions. The variance remains constant within each block, but may vary across blocks.
  We investigate the important case of two communities of interacting species, study how interactions affect their respective equilibrium. We also describe equilibrium with feasibility (i.e., whether there exists an equilibrium with all species at non-zero abundances) and the existence of an attrition phenomenon (some species may vanish) within each community.
  Information about the general case of $b$ communities ($b&gt; 2$) is provided in the appendix.</description>

      <title>The rules of multiplayer cooperation in networks of communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community organization permeates both social and biological complex systems. To study its interplay with behavior emergence, we model mobile structured populations with multiplayer interactions. We derive general analytical methods for evolutionary dynamics under high home fidelity when populations self-organize into networks of asymptotically isolated communities. In this limit, community organization dominates over the network structure and emerging behavior is independent of network topology. We obtain the rules of multiplayer cooperation in networks of communities for different types of social dilemmas. The success of cooperation is a result of the benefits shared amongst communal cooperators outperforming the benefits reaped by defectors in mixed communities. Under weak selection, cooperation can evolve and be stable for any size (Q) and number (M) of communities if the reward-to-cost ratio (V/K) of public goods is higher than a critical value. Community organization is a solid mechanism for sustaining the evolution of cooperation under public goods dilemmas, particularly when populations are organized into a higher number of smaller communities. Contrary to public goods dilemmas relating to production, the multiplayer Hawk-Dove (HD) dilemma is a commons dilemma focusing on the fair consumption of preexisting resources. This game holds mixed results but tends to favour cooperation under larger communities, highlighting that the two types of social dilemmas might lead to solid differences in the behaviour adopted under community structure.</description>

      <title>Leveraging graphical model techniques to study evolution on phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of molecular and phenotypic traits is commonly modelled using Markov processes along a phylogeny. This phylogeny can be a tree, or a network if it includes reticulations, representing events such as hybridization or admixture. Computing the likelihood of data observed at the leaves is costly as the size and complexity of the phylogeny grows. Efficient algorithms exist for trees, but cannot be applied to networks. We show that a vast array of models for trait evolution along phylogenetic networks can be reformulated as graphical models, for which efficient belief propagation algorithms exist. We provide a brief review of belief propagation on general graphical models, then focus on linear Gaussian models for continuous traits. We show how belief propagation techniques can be applied for exact or approximate (but more scalable) likelihood and gradient calculations, and prove novel results for efficient parameter inference of some models. We highlight the possible fruitful interactions between graphical models and phylogenetic methods. For example, approximate likelihood approaches have the potential to greatly reduce computational costs for phylogenies with reticulations.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Topological Models for Phylogenetic Networks and the Mergegram Invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mutations of genetic sequences are often accompanied by their recombinations, known as phylogenetic networks. These networks are typically reconstructed from coalescent processes that may arise from optimal merging or fitting together a given set of phylogenetic trees. Nakhleh formulated the phylogenetic network reconstruction problem (PNRP): Given a family of phylogenetic trees over a common set of taxa, is there a unique minimal phylogenetic network whose set of spanning trees contains the family?
  Inspired by ideas from topological data analysis (TDA), we devise lattice-diagram models for phylogenetic networks and filtrations, the cliquegram and the facegram, both generalizing the dendrogram (filtered partition) model of phylogenetic trees. Both models allow us to solve the PNRP rigorously. The solutions are obtained by taking the join of the dendrograms on the lattice of cliquegrams or facegrams. Furthermore, computing the join-facegram is polynomial in the size and number of the input trees.
  Cliquegrams and facegrams can be challenging to work with when the number of taxa is large. We propose a topological invariant of facegrams and filtrations, called the mergegram, by extending a construction by Elkin and Kurlin defined on dendrograms. We show that the mergegram is invariant of weak equivalences of filtrations which, in turn, implies that it is a 1-Lipschitz stable invariant with respect to M\'emoli's tripod distance. The mergegram, can be used as a computable proxy for phylogenetic networks and filtrations of datasets. We illustrate the utility of these new TDA-concepts to phylogenetics, by performing experiments with artificial and biological data.</description>
