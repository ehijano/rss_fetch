      <title>Generalized break divisors and triangulations of Lawrence polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph of genus $g$. The Picard group of degree $g$, $\text{Pic}^g(G)$, is the set of equivalence classes of divisors on $G$ of degree $g$, where two divisors are equivalent if one can be reached from the other through a sequence of chip-firing moves. We construct sets of representatives of the equivalence classes in $\text{Pic}^g(G)$ by defining a function $I_G$ on the spanning trees of $G$ from a triangulation of the Lawrence polytope of the cographic matroid $\mathcal{M}^\ast(G)$. Additionally, such sets of representatives correspond to stability conditions on the nodal curve dual to the graph $G$. We show that $I_G$ that are constructed from regular triangulations of Lawrence polytope correspond to classical stability conditions, which are induced by generic real-valued divisors on $G$.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary orientations of Hamilton cycles in directed graphs of large minimum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1960, Ghouila-Houri proved that every strongly connected directed graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with minimum degree at least $n$ contains a directed Hamilton cycle. We asymptotically generalize this result by proving the following: every directed graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and with minimum degree at least $(1+o(1))n$ contains every orientation of a Hamilton cycle, except for the directed Hamilton cycle in the case when $G$ is not strongly connected. In fact, this minimum degree condition forces every orientation of a cycle in $G$ of every possible length, other than perhaps the directed cycles.</description>

      <title>On Alternating 6-Cycles in Edge-Coloured Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we use flag algebras to prove that the number of colour alternating 6-cycles in a red/blue colouring of a large clique is asymptotically maximized by a uniformly random colouring. This settles the first open case of a problem of Basit, Granet, Horsley, K\"undgen and Staden.</description>

      <title>$q$-Super Catalan Numbers: Combinatorial identities, Generating Functions, and Narayana Refinements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We begin by deriving a number of combinatorial identities satisfied by the $q$-super Catalan numbers. In particular, we extend some of the known combinatorial identities (Touchard, Koshy, Reed Dawson) to the $q$-super Catalan numbers. Next, we introduce some $q$-convolution identities involving q-central binomial and q-Catalan numbers and derive a generating function for $q$-Catalan numbers. Then we introduce Narayana-type refinements of the super Catalan numbers. We prove algebraically the $\gamma$-positivity of those refinements and give a combinatorial proof in a special case through the type B analog of noncrossing partitions. Then we introduce their natural $q$-analogs, prove their $q$-$\gamma$-positivity and prove some identities they satisfy, generalizing identities of Kreweras and Le Jen-Shoo. Using yet another identity, we prove that these refinements are positive integer polynomials in $q$.</description>

      <title>Bounded cliquewidth graphs are quasi-isometric to bounded treewidth graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cliquewidth is a dense analogue of treewidth. We further this analogy by showing that graphs of bounded cliquewidth admit a partition with `local, but dense' parts whose quotient has bounded treewidth. Specifically, each part is contained within the closed neighbourhood of some vertex. We use this to construct a quasi-isometry between graphs of bounded cliquewidth and bounded treewidth, and to show that graphs of bounded cliquewidth have Assouad-Nagata dimension 1.</description>

      <title>On null completely regular codes in Manhattan metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the class of completely regular codes in graphs with a distance partition C_0,..., C_\rho, where each set C_i, for 0&lt;=i&lt;=r-1, is an independent set. This work focuses on the existence problem for such codes in the n-dimensional infinite grid. We demonstrate that several parameter families of such codes necessarily arise from binary or ternary Hamming graphs or do not exist. Furthermore, employing binary linear programming techniques, we explore completely regular codes in infinite grids of dimensions 3 and 4 for the cases r=1 and r=2.</description>

      <title>A generalization of Ramanujan's sum over finite rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a finite ring with unity. In general, the eigenvalues of the unitary Cayley graph $\text{Cay}(R, R^{\times})$ are not known when $R$ is a non-commutative. In this paper, we present an explicit formula for the eigenvalues of $\text{Cay}(R, R^{\times})$ for any finite ring $R$. However, our focus is on a more general case of the unitary Cayley graph. It is well known that the classical Ramanujan's sum represents the eigenvalues of $\text{Cay}(\mathbb{Z}_n, \mathbb{Z}_n^{\times})$. Consequently, the eigenvalues of $\text{Cay}(R, R^{\times})$ can be view as a generalization of classical Ramanujan's sum in the context of finite rings. Interestingly, the formula we derive for the eigenvalues of $\text{Cay}(R, R^{\times})$ extends the known formula of classical Ramanujan's sum to the context of finite rings.</description>

      <title>Sombor index of clean graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with the vertex set $V (G)$ and edge set $E(G)$. The Sombor index of $G$, $SO(G)$, is defined as $\sum_{uv\in E(G)} \sqrt{deg(u)^2 + deg(v)^2}$, where $deg(u)$ is the degree of vertex $u$ in $V (G)$. The clean graph of a ring R, denoted by $Cl(R)$, is a graph with vertex set $\{(e, u) : e \in Id(R), u \in U(R)\}$ and two distinct vertices $(e, u)$ and$(f, v)$ are adjacent if and only if $ef = 0$ or $uv = 1$ ($Id(R)$ and $U(R)$ are the sets of idempotents and unit elements of R, respectively). The induced subgraph on $\{(e, u) : e \in Id^{*}(R), u \in U(R)\}$ is denoted by $Cl_2(R)$. In this paper, $SO(Cl2(\mathbb{Z}_n))$, for different values of the positive integer $n$, is investigated.</description>

      <title>Odd Hadwiger's conjecture for the complements of Kneser graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalization of the four-color theorem, Hadwiger's conjecture is considered as one of the most important and challenging problems in graph theory, and odd Hadwiger's conjecture is a strengthening of Hadwiger's conjecture by way of signed graphs. In this paper, we prove that odd Hadwiger's conjecture is true for the complements $\overline{K}(n,k)$ of the Kneser graphs $K(n,k)$, where $n\geq 2k \ge 4$. This improves a result of G. Xu and S. Zhou (2017) which states that Hadwiger's conjecture is true for this family of graphs. Moreover, we prove that $\overline{K}(n,k)$ contains a 1-shallow complete minor of a special type with order no less than the chromatic number $\chi(\overline{K}(n,k))$, and in the case when $7 \le 2k+1 \le n \le 3k-1$ the gap between the odd Hadwiger number and chromatic number of $\overline{K}(n,k)$ is $\Omega(1.5^{k})$.</description>

      <title>Ask zeta functions of joins of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work (arXiv:1908.09589), we studied rational generating functions ("ask zeta functions") associated with graphs and hypergraphs. These functions encode average sizes of kernels of generic matrices with support constraints determined by the graph or hypergraph in question, with applications to the enumeration of linear orbits and conjugacy classes of unipotent groups. In the present article, we turn to the effect of a natural graph-theoretic operation on associated ask zeta functions. Specifically, we show that two instances of rational functions, $W^-_\Gamma(X,T)$ and $W^\sharp_\Gamma(X,T)$, associated with a graph $\Gamma$ are both well-behaved under taking joins of graphs. In the former case, this has applications to zeta functions enumerating conjugacy classes associated with so-called graphical groups.</description>

      <title>Some algebraic properties of ASM varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fulton's matrix Schubert varieties are affine varieties that arise in the study of Schubert calculus in the complete flag variety. Weigandt showed that arbitrary intersections of matrix Schubert varieties, now called ASM varieties, are indexed by alternating sign matrices (ASMs), objects with a long history in enumerative combinatorics. It is very difficult to assess Cohen-Macaulayness of ASM varieties or to compute their codimension, though these properties are well understood for matrix Schubert varieties due to work of Fulton. In this paper we study these properties of ASM varieties with a focus on the relationship between a pair of ASMs and their direct sum. We also consider ASM pattern avoidance from an algebro-geometric perspective.</description>

      <title>Determinants of Steiner Distance Hypermatrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing work from the 1970s on the determinants of distance hypermatrices of trees, we consider the hyperdeterminants of order-$k$ Steiner distance hypermatrices of trees on $n$ vertices. We show that they can be nearly diagonalized as $k$-forms, generalizing a result of Graham-Lov\'{a}sz, implying a tensor version of ``conditional negative definiteness'', providing new proofs of previous results of the authors and Tauscheck, and resolving the conjecture that these hyperdeterminants depend only on $k$ and $n$ -- as Graham-Pollak showed for $k=2$. We conclude with some open questions.</description>

      <title>An $\mathcal{O}(n)$ Space Construction of Superpermutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A superpermutation is a sequence that contains every permutation of $n$ distinct symbols as a contiguous substring. For instance, a valid example for three symbols is a sequence that contains all six permutations. This paper introduces a new algorithm that constructs such sequences more efficiently than existing recursive and graph-theoretic methods. Unlike traditional techniques that suffer from scalability and factorial memory demands, the proposed approach builds superpermutations directly and compactly. This improves memory usage, enabling the construction of larger sequences previously considered impractical.</description>

      <title>Taut fillings of the 2-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\sigma$ be a simplicial triangulation of the 2-sphere, $X$ the associated integral 2-cycle. A filling of $X$ is an integral 3-chain $Y$ with $\partial Y = X$; a taut filling is one with minimal $L_1$-norm. We show that any taut filling arises from an extension of $\sigma$ to a shellable simplicial triangulation of the 3-ball. The key to the proof is the general fact that any taut filling of an $n$-cycle splits under disjoint union, connected sum, and more generally what we call almost disjoint union, where summands are supported on sets that overlap in at most $n+1$ vertices. Despite the generality of this result, we have nothing to say about optimal fillings of spheres of dimension 3 or higher.</description>

      <title>Local cohomology and singular cohomology of toric varieties via mixed Hodge modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an affine toric variety $X$ embedded in a smooth variety, we prove a general result about the mixed Hodge module structure on the local cohomology sheaves of $X$. As a consequence, we prove that the singular cohomology of a proper toric variety is mixed of Hodge-Tate type. Additionally, using these Hodge module techniques, we derive a purely combinatorial result on rational polyhedral cones that has consequences regarding the depth of reflexive differentials on a toric variety.
  We then study in detail two important subclasses of toric varieties: those corresponding to cones over simplicial polytopes and those corresponding to cones over simple polytopes. Here, we give a comprehensive description of the local cohomology in terms of the combinatorics of the associated cones, and calculate the Betti numbers (or more precisely, the Hodge-Du Bois diamond) of a projective toric variety associated to a simple polytope.</description>

We give applications beyond tropical geometry, to the cohomology of moduli spaces as well as to the cohomology of arithmetic groups. We study two cases in detail: the case of level structures on the moduli space $\mathcal{A}_{g}$ of abelian varieties, and the special unitary case.</description>

      <title>Semidefinite programming bounds on fractional cut-cover and maximum 2-SAT for highly regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use semidefinite programming to bound the fractional cut-cover parameter of graphs in association schemes in terms of their smallest eigenvalue. We also extend the equality cases of a primal-dual inequality involving the Goemans-Williamson semidefinite program, which approximates \textsc{maxcut}, to graphs in certain coherent configurations. Moreover, we obtain spectral bounds for \textsc{max 2-sat} when the underlying graphs belong to a symmetric association scheme by means of a certain semidefinite program used to approximate quadratic programs, and we further develop this technique in order to explicitly compute the optimum value of its gauge dual in the case of distance-regular graphs.</description>

      <title>On extremal properties of perfect 2-colorings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.03308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A coloring of vertices of a graph is called perfect if, for every vertex, the collection of colors of its neighbors depends only on its own color. The correspondent color partition of vertices is called equitable. We note that a number of bounds (Hoffman bound, Cheeger bound, Bierbrauer--Friedman bound and other) is only reached on perfect $2$-colorings. We show that the Expander Mixing Lemma is another example of an inequality that generates a perfect $2$-coloring. We prove a new upper bound for the size of $S\subset V(G)$ with the fixed average internal degree for an amply regular graph $G$. This bound is reached on the set $S$ if and only if $\{S, V(G)\setminus S\}$ is an equitable partition.</description>

      <title>e-basis Coefficients of Chromatic Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known result of Stanley's shows that given a graph $G$ with chromatic symmetric function expanded into the basis of elementary symmetric functions as $X_G = \sum c_{\lambda}e_{\lambda}$, the sum of the coefficients $c_{\lambda}$ for $\lambda$ with $\lambda_1' = k$ (equivalently those $\lambda$ with exactly $k$ parts) is equal to the number of acyclic orientations of $G$ with exactly $k$ sinks.
  However, more is known. The sink sequence of an acyclic orientation of $G$ is a tuple $(s_1,\dots,s_k)$ such that $s_1$ is the number of sinks of the orientation, and recursively each $s_i$ with $i &gt; 1$ is the number of sinks remaining after deleting the sinks contributing to $s_1,\dots,s_{i-1}$. Equivalently, the sink sequence gives the number of vertices at each level of the poset induced by the acyclic orientation.
  A lesser-known follow-up result of Stanley's determines certain cases in which we can find a sum of $e$-basis coefficients that gives the number of acyclic orientations of $G$ with a given partial sink sequence. Of interest in its own right, this result also admits as a corollary a simple proof of the $e$-positivity of $X_G$ when the stability number of $G$ is $2$.
  In this paper, we prove a vertex-weighted generalization of this follow-up result, and conjecture a stronger version that admits a similar combinatorial interpretation for a much larger set of $e$-coefficient sums of chromatic symmetric functions. In particular, the conjectured formula would give a combinatorial interpretation for the sum of the coefficients $c_{\lambda}$ with prescribed values of $\lambda_1'$ and $\lambda_2'$ for any unweighted claw-free graph (not necessarily an incomparability graph, as in the setting of the Stanley-Stembridge conjecture).</description>

Abstract: We prove that there exists a constant $c &gt; 0$ such that the vertices of every strongly $c \cdot kt$-connected tournament can be partitioned into $t$ parts, each of which induces a strongly $k$-connected tournament. This is clearly tight up to a constant factor, and it confirms a conjecture of K\"uhn, Osthus and Townsend (2016).</description>

      <title>Cherry picking in forests: A new characterization for the unrooted hybrid number of two phylogenetic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08145v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are a special type of graph which generalize phylogenetic trees and that are used to model non-treelike evolutionary processes such as recombination and hybridization. In this paper, we consider {\em unrooted} phylogenetic networks, i.e. simple, connected graphs $\mathcal{N}=(V,E)$ with leaf set $X$, for $X$ some set of species, in which every internal vertex in $\mathcal{N}$ has degree three. One approach used to construct such phylogenetic networks is to take as input a collection $\mathcal{P}$ of phylogenetic trees and to look for a network $\mathcal{N}$ that contains each tree in $\mathcal{P}$ and that minimizes the quantity $r(\mathcal{N}) = |E|-(|V|-1)$ over all such networks. Such a network always exists, and the quantity $r(\mathcal{N})$ for an optimal network $\mathcal{N}$ is called the hybrid number of $\mathcal{P}$. In this paper, we give a new characterization for the hybrid number in case $\mathcal{P}$ consists of two trees. This characterization is given in terms of a cherry picking sequence for the two trees, although to prove that our characterization holds we need to define the sequence more generally for two forests. Cherry picking sequences have been intensively studied for collections of rooted phylogenetic trees, but our new sequences are the first variant of this concept that can be applied in the unrooted setting. Since the hybrid number of two trees is equal to the well-known tree bisection and reconnection distance between the two trees, our new characterization also provides an alternative way to understand this important tree distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tutte polynomial and Derksen's $\mathcal{G}$-invariant are the universal deletion-contraction and valuative matroid and polymatroid invariants, respectively. There are only a handful of well known invariants (like the matroid Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials) between (in terms of fineness) the Tutte polynomial and Derksen's $\mathcal{G}$-invariant. The aim of this study is to define a spectrum of generalized Tutte polynomials to fill the gap between the Tutte polynomial and Derksen's $\mathcal{G}$-invariant. These polynomials are built by taking repeated convolution products of universal Tutte characters studied by Dupont, Fink, and Moci and using the framework of Ardila and Sanchez for studying valuative invariants. We develop foundational aspects of these polynomials by showing they are valuative on generalized permutahedra and present a generalized deletion-contraction formula. We apply these results on chain Tutte polynomials to obtain formulas for the M\"obius polynomial, the opposite characteristic polynomial, a generalized M\"obius polynomial, Ford's expected codimension of a matroid variety, and Derksen's $\mathcal{G}$-invariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymptotic dimension and Assouad-Nagata dimension are measures of the large-scale shape of a class of graphs. Bonamy, Bousquet, Esperet, Groenland, Liu, Pirot, and Scott [J. Eur. Math. Society] showed that any proper minor-closed class has asymptotic dimension 2, dropping to 1 only if the treewidth is bounded. We improve this result by showing it also holds for the stricter Assouad-Nagata dimension. We also characterise when subdivision-closed classes of graphs have bounded Assouad-Nagata dimension.</description>

      <title>Tur\'{a}n problems for star-path forests in hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $r$-uniform hypergraph ($r$-graph for short) is linear if any two edges intersect at most one vertex. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a given family of $r$-graphs. An $r$-graph $H$ is called $\mathcal{F}$-free if $H$ does not contain any member of $\mathcal{F}$ as a subgraph. The Tur\'{a}n number of $\mathcal{F}$ is the maximum number of edges in any $\mathcal{F}$-free $r$-graph on $n$ vertices, and the linear Tur\'{a}n number of $\mathcal{F}$ is defined as the Tur\'{a}n number of $\mathcal{F}$ in linear host hypergraphs. An $r$-uniform linear path $P^r_\ell$ of length $\ell$ is an $r$-graph with edges $e_1,\dots,e_\ell$ such that $|V(e_i)\cap V(e_j)|=1$ if $|i-j|=1$, and $V(e_i)\cap V(e_j)=\emptyset$ for $i\neq j$ otherwise. Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s et al. [\textit{European J. Combin.} (2022) 103435] obtained an upper bound for the linear Tur\'{a}n number of $P_\ell^3$. In this paper, an upper bound for the linear Tur\'{a}n number of $P_\ell^r$ is obtained, which generalizes the known result of $P_\ell^3$ to any $P_\ell^r$. Furthermore, some results for the linear Tur\'{a}n number and Tur\'{a}n number of several linear star-path forests are obtained.</description>

      <title>A classification of overlapping clustering schemes for hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community detection in graphs is a problem that is likely to be relevant whenever network data appears, and consequently the problem has received much attention with many different methods and algorithms applied. However, many of these methods are hard to study theoretically, and they optimise for somewhat different goals. A general and rigorous account of the problem and possible methods remains elusive.
  We study the problem of finding overlapping clusterings of hypergraphs, continuing the line of research started by Carlsson and M\'emoli (2013) of classifying clustering schemes as functors. We extend their notion of representability to the overlapping case, showing that any representable overlapping clustering scheme is excisive and functorial, and any excisive and functorial clustering scheme is isomorphic to a representable clustering scheme.
  We also note that, for simple graphs, any representable clustering scheme is computable in polynomial time on graphs of bounded expansion, with an exponent determined by the maximum independence number of a graph in the representing set. This result also applies to non-overlapping representable clustering schemes, and so may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Connected Partitions via Connected Dominating Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical theorem due to Gy\H{o}ri and Lov\'{a}sz states that any $k$-connected graph $G$ admits a partition into $k$ connected subgraphs, where each subgraph has a prescribed size and contains a prescribed vertex, as long as the total size of target subgraphs is equal to the size of $G$. However, this result is notoriously evasive in terms of efficient constructions, and it is still unknown whether such a partition can be computed in polynomial time, even for $k = 5$.
  We make progress towards an efficient constructive version of the Gy\H{o}ri--Lov\'{a}sz theorem by considering a natural strengthening of the $k$-connectivity requirement. Specifically, we show that the desired connected partition can be found in polynomial time, if $G$ contains $k$ disjoint connected dominating sets. As a consequence of this result, we give several efficient approximate and exact constructive versions of the original Gy\H{o}ri--Lov\'{a}sz theorem:
  1. On general graphs, a Gy\H{o}ri--Lov\'{a}sz partition with $k$ parts can be computed in polynomial time when the input graph has connectivity $\Omega(k \cdot \log^2 n)$;
  2. On convex bipartite graphs, connectivity of $4k$ is sufficient;
  3. On biconvex graphs and interval graphs, connectivity of $k$ is sufficient, meaning that our algorithm gives a ``true'' constructive version of the theorem on these graph classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $K_t$-expansion consists of $t$ vertex-disjoint trees, every two of which are joined by an edge. We call such an expansion odd if its vertices can be two-colored so that the edges of the trees are bichromatic but the edges between trees are monochromatic. A graph contains an odd $K_t$ minor or an odd clique minor of order $t$ if it contains an odd $K_t$-expansion. Gerards and Seymour from 1995 conjectured that every graph $G$ contains an odd $K_{\chi(G)}$ minor, where $\chi(G)$ denotes the chromatic number of $G$. This conjecture is referred to as ``Odd Hadwiger's Conjecture". Let $\alpha(G)$ denote the independence number of a graph $G$. In this paper we investigate the Odd Hadwiger's Conjecture for graphs $G$ with $\alpha(G)\le2$. We first observe that a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\alpha(G)\le2$ contains an odd $K_{\chi(G)}$ minor if and only if $G$ contains an odd clique minor of order $\lceil n/2\rceil$. We then prove that every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\alpha(G)\le 2$ contains an odd clique minor of order $\lceil n/2\rceil$ if $G$ contains a clique of order $n/4$ when $n$ is even and $(n+3)/4$ when $n$ is odd, or $G$ does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph, where $\alpha(H)\le 2$ and $H$ is an induced subgraph of $K_1 + P_4$, $K_2+(K_1\cup K_3)$, $K_1+(K_1\cup K_4)$, $K_7^-$, $K_7$, or the kite graph.</description>

Abstract: In their celebrated paper (arXiv:0906.1238), Caputo, Liggett and Richthammer proved Aldous' conjecture and showed that for an arbitrary finite graph, the spectral gap of the interchange process is equal to the spectral gap of the underlying random walk. A crucial ingredient in the proof was the Octopus Inequality - a certain inequality of operators in the group ring $\mathbb{R}[\mathrm{Sym}_n]$ of the symmetric group. Here we generalize the Octopus Inequality and apply it to generalize the Caputo-Liggett-Richthammer Theorem to certain hypergraphs, proving some cases of a conjecture of Caputo.</description>

Abstract: Endowing the set of functional graphs (FGs) with the sum (disjoint union of graphs) and product (standard direct product on graphs) operations induces on FGs a structure of a commutative semiring R. The operations on R can be naturally extended to the set of univariate polynomials R[X] over R. This paper provides a polynomial time algorithm for deciding if equations of the type AX=B have solutions when A is just a single cycle and B a set of cycles of identical size. We also prove a similar complexity result for some variants of the previous equation.</description>

      <title>Noise Sensitivity and Learning Lower Bounds for Hierarchical Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works explore deep learning's success by examining functions or data with hierarchical structure. To study the learning complexity of functions with hierarchical structure, we study the noise stability of functions with tree hierarchical structure on independent inputs. We show that if each function in the hierarchy is $\varepsilon$-far from linear, the noise stability is exponentially small in the depth of the hierarchy.
  Our results have immediate applications for learning. In the Boolean setting using the results of Dachman-Soled, Feldman, Tan, Wan and Wimmer (2014) our results provide Statistical Query super-polynomial lower bounds for learning classes that are based on hierarchical functions. Similarly, using the results of Diakonikolas, Kane, Pittas and Zarifis (2021) our results provide super-polynomial lower bounds for SQ learning under the Gaussian measure. Using the results of Abbe, Bengio, Cornacchiam, Kleinberg, Lotfi, Raghu and Zhang (2022) our results imply sample complexity lower bounds for learning hierarchical functions with gradient descent on fully connected neural networks.</description>

      <title>A generalization of Ramanujan's sum over finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $x \in G$. Define $[x^G] := \{ y \in G : \langle x^G \rangle = \langle y^G \rangle \}$, where $\langle x^G \rangle$ denotes the normal subgroup of $G$ generated by the conjugacy class of $x$. In this paper, we determine an explicit formula for the eigenvalues of the normal Cayley graph $\text{Cay}(G, [x^G])$. These eigenvalues can be viewed as a generalization of classical Ramanujan's sum in the setting of finite groups. Surprisingly, the formula we derive for the eigenvalues of $\text{Cay}(G, [x^G])$ extends the known formula of classical Ramanujan's sum to the context of finite groups. This generalization not only enrich the theory of Ramanujan's sum but also provide new tools in spectral graph theory, representation theory, and algebraic number theory.</description>

      <title>A family of polynomials and related congruences and series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a family of polynomials $$S_n^{(m)}(x):=\sum_{i,j=0}^n\binom ni^m\binom nj^m\binom{i+j}ix^{i+j}\ \ (m,n=0,1,2,\ldots).$$ For example, we show that $$\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}S_k^{(0)}(x)\equiv\frac x{2x-1}\left(1+\left(\frac{1-4x^2}p\right)\right)\pmod p $$ for any odd prime $p$ and integer $x\not\equiv1/2\pmod p$, where $(\frac{\cdot}p)$ denotes the Legendre symbol. We also formulate some open conjectures on related congruences and series for $1/\pi$. For example, we conjecture that $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty(7k+1)\frac{S_k^{(2)}(1/11)}{9^k}=\frac{5445}{104\sqrt{39}\,\pi}$$ and $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty(1365k+181)\frac{S_k^{(2)}(1/18)}{16^k}=\frac{1377}{\sqrt2\,\pi}.$$</description>

      <title>Majorization and Inequalities among Complete Homogeneous Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inequalities among symmetric functions are fundamental in various branches of mathematics, thus motivating a systematic study of their structure. Majorization has been shown to characterize inequalities among commonly used symmetric functions, except for complete homogeneous symmetric functions (shortened as CHs). In 2011, Cuttler, Greene, and Skandera posed a natural question: Can majorization also characterize inequalities among CHs? Their work demonstrated that majorization characterizes inequalities among CHs up to degree 7 and suggested exploring its validity for higher degrees. In this paper, we show that, for every degree greater than 7, majorization does not characterize inequalities among CHs.</description>
