      <title>Analytical closed-form solution of the Bagley-Torvik equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the solution of the Bagley-Torvik equation for arbitrary initial conditions and arbitrary external force as the sum of two terms. The first one is a linear combination of exponentials with error functions, and the second one is a convolution integral whose kernel is a linear combination of exponentials with error functions. The derivation of the solution is carried out by using the Laplace transform method and the calculation of a new inverse Laplace transform. The aforementioned convolution integral can be calculated for the cases of a sinusoidal- or a potential-type external force. In addition, we calculate the asymptotic behaviour of the solution for $t\rightarrow 0^{+}$ and $t\rightarrow +\infty$. The computation of this new analytical solution is much faster and stable than other analytical solutions found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Integro-differential rings on species and derived structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the theory of species, differential as well as integral operators are known to arise in a natural way. In this paper, we shall prove that they precisely fit together in the algebraic framework of integro-differential rings, which are themselves an abstraction of classical calculus (incorporating its Fundamental Theorem). The results comprise (set) species as well as linear species. Localization of (set) species leads to the more general structure of modified integro-differential rings, previously employed in the algebraic treatment of Volterra integral equations. Furthermore, the ring homomorphism from species to power series via taking generating series is shown to be a (modified) integro-differential ring homomorphism. As an application, a topology and further algebraic operations are imported to virtual species from the general theory of integro-differential rings.</description>

      <title>A primer of the complex WKB method, with application to the ODE/IM correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05957v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these lectures, we provide an introduction to the complex WKB method, using as a guiding example a class of anharmonic oscillators that appears in the ODE/IM correspondence. In the first three lectures, we introduce the main objects of the method, such as the WKB function, the integral equations of Volterra type, the quadratic differential and its horizontal/Stokes lines, the Stokes phenomenon, the notion of asymptotic values, the Fock-Goncharov coordinates and their WKB approximation. In the fourth and last lecture, we compute (and prove) the asymptotic behaviour of the spectrum of the anharmonic oscillators in two asymptotic regimes, when the momentum is fixed and the energy is large, and when the momentum (hence also the energy) is large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear recurrences we consider here include the functions $3x(1-x)$ and $\cos(x)$, which possess attractive fixed points $2/3$ and $0.739...$ (Dottie's number). Detailed asymptotics for oscillatory convergence are found, starting with a 1960 paper by Wolfgang Thron. Another function, $x/(1+x\ln(1+x))$, gives rise to a sequence with monotonic convergence to $0$ but requires substantial work to calculate its associated constant $C$.</description>

      <title>Uniform asymptotic expansions for Bessel functions of imaginary order and their zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bessel and modified Bessel functions of imaginary order $i\nu$ ($\nu &gt;0$) are studied. Asymptotic expansions are derived as $\nu \to \infty$ that are uniformly valid in unbounded complex domains, with error bounds provided. Coupled with appropriate connection formulas the approximations are uniformly valid for all complex argument. The expansions are of two forms, Liouville-Green type expansions only involving elementary functions, and ones involving Airy functions that are valid at a turning point of the defining differential equation. The new results have coefficients and error bounds that are simpler than in prior expansions, and further are used to construct asymptotic expansions for the zeros of Bessel and modified Bessel functions of large imaginary order, these being uniformly valid without restriction on their size (small or large).</description>

      <title>Spectral multipliers for maximally subelliptic operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a non-negative, self-adjoint, maximally subelliptic operator on a compact manifold. We show that the spectral multiplier is a singular integral operator under an appropriate Mihlin-H\"ormander type condition. We establish the equivalence between non-isotropic Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces adapted to the operator and those adapted to a Carnot-Carath\'eodory geometry on the manifold. We also give a Mihlin-H\"ormander type condition for the boundedness of the spectral multiplier on non-isotropic $L^p$ Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>A multiplicative surface signature through its Magnus expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, the concept of path signature has achieved significant success in data science applications. It offers a powerful set of features that effectively capture and describe the characteristics of paths or sequential data. This is partly explained by the fact that the signature of a path can be computed in linear time, using a dynamic programming principle based on Chen's identity. The path signature can be viewed as a specific example of a product or time-/path-ordered integral. In other words, it represents a one-parameter object built on iterated integrals over a path.
  Defining a signature over surfaces requires considering iterated integrals over these surfaces, effectively introducing an additional parameter, resulting in a two-parameter signature. This extended signature is intrinsically connected to a non-commutative generalization of Stokes' theorem, which is fundamentally connected to the concept of crossed modules of groups. The latter provides a well-established framework in higher gauge theory, where crossed modules with feedback maps exhibiting non-trivial kernels, combined with multiparameter iterated integrals, play a pivotal role.
  Building on Kapranov's work, we explore the surface analog of the log-signature for paths by introducing a Magnus-type formula for the logarithm of the surface signature. This expression takes values in a free crossed module of Lie algebras, defined over a free Lie algebra. We furthermore prove a non-commutative sewing lemma applicable to the crossed module setting and give a definition of rough surface in the so-called Young-H\"older regularity regime along with a corresponding continuous extension theorem. This approach enables the analysis and computation of surface features that go beyond what can be expressed by computing line integrals along the boundary of a surface.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal and Tractable Estimation under Shift-Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How hard is it to estimate a discrete-time signal $(x_{1}, ..., x_{n}) \in \mathbb{C}^n$ satisfying an unknown linear recurrence relation of order $s$ and observed in i.i.d. complex Gaussian noise? The class of all such signals is parametric but extremely rich: it contains all exponential polynomials over $\mathbb{C}$ with total degree $s$, including harmonic oscillations with $s$ arbitrary frequencies. Geometrically, this class corresponds to the projection onto $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ of the union of all shift-invariant subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^\mathbb{Z}$ of dimension $s$. We show that the statistical complexity of this class, as measured by the squared minimax radius of the $(1-\delta)$-confidence $\ell_2$-ball, is nearly the same as for the class of $s$-sparse signals, namely $O\left(s\log(en) + \log(\delta^{-1})\right) \cdot \log^2(es) \cdot \log(en/s).$ Moreover, the corresponding near-minimax estimator is tractable, and it can be used to build a test statistic with a near-minimax detection threshold in the associated detection problem. These statistical results rest upon an approximation-theoretic one: we show that finite-dimensional shift-invariant subspaces admit compactly supported reproducing kernels whose Fourier spectra have nearly the smallest possible $\ell_p$-norms, for all $p \in [1,+\infty]$ at once.</description>
