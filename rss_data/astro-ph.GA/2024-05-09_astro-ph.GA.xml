      <title>A too-many dwarf satellite galaxies problem in the MATLAS low-to-moderate density fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxy abundances can serve as discernment tests for models of structure formation. Previous small-scale tensions between observations and dark matter-only cosmological simulations may have been resolved with the inclusion of baryonic processes; however, these successes have been largely concentrated on the Local Group dwarfs the feedback models were initially calibrated on. We investigate whether the $\Lambda$CDM model can reliably reproduce dwarf abundances in the MATLAS low-to-moderate density fields that are centred upon early-type host galaxies beyond the Local Volume. We carried out mock observations of MATLAS-like fields with the high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation IllustrisTNG-50. We used matching selection criteria and compared the properties of dwarfs contained within them with their MATLAS analogues. Although simulated MATLAS-like dwarfs demonstrate photometric properties that are consistent with the observed galaxy population and follow the same scaling relations, TNG50 underestimates the number of dwarf galaxies in isolated MATLAS fields at the 6 sigma level. This significance is maintained within crowded fields containing more than a single bright host. Our 55-62% estimate of the fraction of background galaxies is in agreement with estimates by MATLAS, but is wholly insufficient to alleviate this discrepancy in dwarf abundances. Any incompleteness in the observed fields further exacerbates this tension. We identified a "too-many-satellites" problem in $\Lambda$CDM, emphasising the need for the continued testing and refining of current models of galaxy formation in environments beyond the Local Group.</description>

      <title>The Variation of the Galaxy-Wide IMF for Low-Mass Stars: Modeling and Observational Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) characterizes the mass distribution of newly formed stars in various cosmic environments, serving as a fundamental assumption in astrophysical research. Recent findings challenge the prevalent notion of a universal and static IMF, proposing instead that the IMF's shape is contingent upon the star formation environment. In this study, we analyze the galaxy-wide variation of the IMF for low-mass stars in both dwarf and massive galaxies with diverse observational methods. Despite systematic discrepancies between different approaches, an IMF model with a metallicity-dependent slope for the low-mass stars aligns with the majority of observations, indicating a high degree of uniformity in the star formation processes across the universe. We also emphasize the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the variation of the low-mass IMF, considering measurement biases and factors beyond metallicity.</description>

      <title>The effect of the environment-dependent stellar initial mass function on the photometric properties of star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) Observational estimates of galaxy properties rely on the inherent galaxy-wide initial mass function (gwIMF), which systematically varies with the global SFR and metallicity, as proposed by the integrated-galactic IMF (IGIMF) theory and supported by empirical evidence. We incorporate PARSEC and COLIBRI stellar isochrones into the GalIMF code, a galaxy chemical evolution (GCE) model featuring real-time updates of environment-dependent gwIMFs. This newly developed photometric GalIMF (photGalIMF) code allows the calculation of photometric properties for galaxies with diverse stellar populations. Subsequently, we analyze observed luminosities and metallicities of local star-forming galaxies to deduce their stellar masses assuming that they have constant SFRs over 13.6 Gyr. We also compute SFR$-$H$\alpha$ luminosity relations for varying stellar metallicities using a separate stellar population synthesis code based on PEGASE. Comparing the IGIMF theory to the canonical universal IMF, our analysis reveals that estimates of the stellar masses and SFRs for local star-forming galaxies differ by factors of $\approx 2$ and 10, respectively. The computed gas-depletion timescale increases with gas mass, implying lower star formation efficiencies in more massive galaxies, possibly due to stronger feedback regulation, aligning with theoretical expectations. Additionally, the characteristic stellar mass buildup timescale increases with stellar mass, indicating that massive disk galaxies initiate star formation earlier than their low-mass counterparts. The photGalIMF code enables self-consistent computations of galactic photometry, self-consistently with GCE modelling within the context of an environment-dependent gwIMF. Utilizing Ks-band and H$\alpha$ luminosities of galaxies, the outcomes include galaxy mass, SFR, and fitting functions for the SFR correction factor.</description>

      <title>First detection of CO isotopologues in a high-redshift main-sequence galaxy: evidence of a top-heavy stellar initial mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations and theories have presented a strong challenge to the universality of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in extreme environments. A notable example has been found for starburst conditions, where evidence favours a top-heavy IMF, i.e. there is a bias toward massive stars compared to the IMF that is responsible for the stellar mass function and elemental abundances observed in the Milky Way. Local starburst galaxies have star-formation rates similar to those in high-redshift main-sequence galaxies, which appear to dominate the stellar mass budget at early epochs. However, the IMF of high-redshift main-sequence galaxies is yet to be probed. Since $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O isotopologues are sensitive to the IMF, we have observed these lines towards four strongly-lensed high-redshift main-sequence galaxies using the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array. Of our four targets, SDSS J0901+1814, at $z \approx 2.26$, is seen clearly in $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O, the first detection of CO isotopologues in the high-redshift main-sequence galaxy population. The observed $^{13}$C/$^{18}$O ratio, $2.4 \pm 0.8$, is significantly lower than that of local main-sequence galaxies. We estimate the isotope ratio, oxygen abundance and stellar mass using a series of chemical evolution models with varying star-formation histories and IMFs. All models favour an IMF that is more top-heavy than that of the Milky Way. Thus, as with starburst galaxies, main-sequence galaxies in the high-redshift Universe have a greater fraction of massive stars than a Milky-Way IMF would imply.</description>

      <title>Is the James Webb Space Telescope detecting too many AGN candidates?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In less than two years of operation, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has already accelerated significantly our quest to identify active massive black holes (BHs) in the first billion years of the Universe's history. At the time of writing, about 50 AGN detections and candidates have been identified through spectroscopy, photometry, and/or morphology. Broad-line AGN are about a hundred times more numerous than the faint end of the UV-bright quasar population at z~5-6. In this paper, we compare the observational constraints on the abundance of these AGN at z~5 to the populations of AGN produced in large-scale cosmological simulations. Assuming a null fraction of obscured simulated AGN, we find that while some simulations produce more AGN than discovered so far, some others produce a similar abundance or even fewer AGN in the bolometric luminosity range probed by JWST. Keeping in mind the large uncertainty on the constraints, we discuss the implications for the theoretical modeling of BH formation and evolution in case similar constraints continue to accumulate. At the redshift of interest, the simulated AGN populations diverge the most at Lbol~1e44 erg/s (by more than a dex in the bolometric luminosity function). This regime is most affected by incompleteness in JWST surveys. However, it holds significant potential for constraining the physical processes determining the assembly of BHs (e.g., seeding, feedback from supernova and AGN) and the current abundance of broad-line AGN with &gt;1e44.5 erg/s.</description>

      <title>Kinematic substructure in star clusters constrains star cluster formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial-kinematic structure of 48 young star clusters and associations is investigated. Moran's $I$ statistic is used to quantify the degree of kinematic substructure in each region, and the results are compared to those expected assuming the hierarchical or monolithic models of star cluster formation. Of the observed regions, 39 are found to have significant kinematic substructure, such that they are compatible with the hierarchical model and incompatible with the monolithic model. This includes multiple regions whose $Q$ parameter shows the region to be centrally concentrated and clustered. The remaining nine are compatible with both models. From this it is concluded that the kinematic substructure of the observed star clusters represents strong evidence in favour the hierarchical model of star cluster formation over the monolithic model.</description>

      <title>Chemo-dynamical Evolution of Simulated Satellites for a Milky Way-like Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical abundances of Milky Way's satellites reflect their star formation histories (SFHs), yet, due to the difficulty of determining the ages of old stars, the SFHs of most satellites are poorly measured. Ongoing and upcoming surveys will obtain around ten times more medium-resolution spectra for stars in satellites than are currently available. To correctly extract SFHs from large samples of chemical abundances, the relationship between chemical abundances and SFHs needs to be clarified. Here, we perform a high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy with detailed models of star formation, supernova feedback, and metal diffusion. We quantify SFHs, metallicity distribution functions, and the $\alpha$-element (Mg, Ca, and Si) abundances in satellites of the host galaxy. We find that star formation in most simulated satellites is quenched before infalling to their host. Star formation episodes in simulated satellites are separated by a few hundred Myr owing to supernova feedback; each star formation event produces groups of stars with similar [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe/H]. We then perform a mock observation of the upcoming Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) observations. We find that Subaru PFS will be able to detect distinct groups of stars in [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] space, produced by episodic star formation. This result means that episodic SFHs can be estimated from the chemical abundances of $\gtrsim$ 1,000 stars determined with medium-resolution spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Feeding Hidden Monsters: a Super-Eddington accreting Black Hole ~1.5 Gyr after the Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revealed a surprisingly abundant population of faint, dusty active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z~4-7. Together with the presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at z&gt;6, this raises questions about the formation and growth histories of early black holes. Current theories for the formation of seed black holes from the death of the first stars (i.e. light seeds) and/or the direct collapse of primordial gas clouds (i.e. heavy seeds) still lack observational confirmation. Here, we present LID-568, a low-mass (7.2e6Msun) black hole hosting powerful outflows that is observed in an extreme phase of rapid growth at z~4. This object is similar to other JWST-discovered faint AGN populations, but is bright in X-ray emission and accreting at more than 4000% of the limit at which radiation pressure exceeds the force of gravitational attraction of the black hole (i.e. super-Eddington accretion). Analysis of JWST NIRSpec/IFU data reveals spatially extended Ha emission with velocities of ~ -600 - -500 km/s relative to the central black hole, indicative of robust nuclear-driven outflows. LID-568 represents an elusive low-mass black hole experiencing super-Eddington accretion as invoked by models of early black hole formation. This discovery showcases a previously undiscovered key parameter space and offers crucial insights into rapid black hole growth mechanisms in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Do spiral arms enhance star formation efficiency?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiral arms are some of the most spectacular features in disc galaxies, and also present in our own Milky Way. It has been argued that star formation should proceed more efficiently in spiral arms as a result of gas compression. Yet, observational studies have so far yielded contradictory results. Here we examine arm/interarm surface density contrasts at ~100 pc resolution in 28 spiral galaxies from the PHANGS survey. We find that the arm/interarm contrast in stellar mass surface density (Sigma_*) is very modest, typically a few tens of percent. This is much smaller than the contrasts measured for molecular gas (Sigma_mol) or star formation rate (Sigma_SFR) surface density, which typically reach a factor of ~2-3. Yet, Sigma_mol and Sigma_SFR contrasts show a significant correlation with the enhancement in Sigma_*, suggesting that the small stellar contrast largely dictates the stronger accumulation of gas and star formation. All these contrasts increase for grand-design spirals compared to multi-armed and flocculent systems (and for galaxies with high stellar mass). The median star formation efficiency (SFE) of the molecular gas is 16% higher in spiral arms than in interarm regions, with a large scatter, and the contrast increases significantly (median SFE contrast 2.34) for regions of particularly enhanced stellar contrast (Sigma_* contrast &gt;1.97). The molecular-to-atomic gas ratio (Sigma_mol/Sigma_atom) is higher in spiral arms, pointing to a transformation of atomic to molecular gas. In conclusion, the boost in the star formation efficiency of molecular gas in spiral arms is generally modest or absent, except for locations with exceptionally large stellar contrasts.

      <title>From Young Massive Clusters to Old Globular Clusters: Density Profile Evolution and IMBH Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface brightness profiles of globular clusters are conventionally described with the well-known King profile. However, observations of young massive clusters (YMCs) in the local Universe suggest that they are better fit by simple models with flat central cores and simple power-law densities in their outer regions (such as the Elson-Fall-Freeman, or EFF, profile). Depending on their initial central density, these YMCs may also facilitate large numbers of stellar collisions, potentially creating very massive stars that will directly collapse to intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). Using Monte Carlo $N$-body models of YMCs, we show that EFF-profile clusters transform to Wilson or King profiles through natural dynamical evolution, but that their final $W_0$ parameters do not strongly correlate to their initial concentrations. The most centrally-dense YMCs can produce runaway stellar mergers as massive as $4000\,M_{\odot}$ (the largest resolved mass in our simulations) which can collapse to produce IMBHs of similar masses. In doing so, these runaway collisions also deplete the clusters of their primordial massive stars, reducing the number of stellar-mass BHs by as much as $\sim$ 40\%. This depletion will accelerate the core collapse of clusters, suggesting that the process of IMBH formation itself may produce the high densities observed in some core-collapsed clusters.</description>

      <title>Discovery of RR Lyrae in the Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxy Virgo III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virgo III is a newly discovered ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) candidate, and finding RR Lyrae associated with this galaxy is important to constrain its distance. In this work, we present a search of RR Lyrae in the vicinity of Virgo III based on the time-series $r$-band images taken from the Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT). We have identified three RR Lyrae from our LOT data, including two fundamental mode (ab-type) and a first-overtone (c-type) RR Lyrae. Assuming these three RR Lyrae are members of Virgo III, we derived the distance to this UFD as $154\pm25$ kpc, fully consistent with the independent measurements given in the literature. We have also revisited the relation between absolute $V$-band magnitude ($M_V$) and the number of RR Lyrae (of all types, $N_{RRL}$) found in local galaxies, demonstrating that the $M_V$-$N_{RRL}$ relation is better described with the specific RR Lyrae frequency.</description>

      <title>Modelling the galaxy radio continuum from star formation and active galactic nuclei in the Shark semi-analytic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model of radio continuum emission associated with star formation (SF) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) implemented in the Shark semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. SF emission includes free-free and synchrotron emission, which depend on the free-electron density and the rate of core-collapse supernovae with a minor contribution from supernova remnants, respectively. AGN emission is modelled based on the jet production rate, which depends on the black hole mass, accretion rate and spin, and includes synchrotron self-absorption. Shark reproduces radio luminosity functions (RLFs) at 1.4 GHz and 150 MHz for 0 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 4, and scaling relations between radio luminosity, star formation rate and infrared luminosity of galaxies in the local and distant universe in good agreement with observations. The model also reproduces observed number counts of radio sources from 150 MHz to 8.4 GHz to within a factor of two on average, though larger discrepancies are seen at the very bright fluxes at higher frequencies. We use this model to understand how the radio continuum emission from radio-quiet AGNs can affect the measured RLFs of galaxies. We find current methods to exclude AGNs from observational samples result in large fractions of radio-quiet AGNs contaminating the "star-forming galaxies" selection and a brighter end to the resulting RLFs. We investigate how this effects the infrared-radio correlation (IRRC) and show that AGN contamination can lead to evolution of the IRRC with redshift. Without this contamination our model predicts a redshift- and stellar mass-independent IRRC, except at the dwarf-galaxy regime.</description>

      <title>Exploration of morphological coherence in open clusters with "core-shell'' structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of their morphological coherence allows for a better understanding of the morphological evolution of open clusters. We employ the ellipsoid fitting method to delineate the 3D spatial structure of the sample clusters while using the morphological dislocation (MD) defined in our previous work and the ellipticity ratio (ER) of the clusters' inner and outer structures to characterize the morphological coherence of the sample clusters. The results show an inverse correlation between the ER of the sample clusters and the number of their members, indicating that sample clusters with much more elliptical external morphology than internal shape have generally a large number of members. Meanwhile, a slight shrinking of the MD of the sample clusters with their members' number may shed light on the significant role of the gravitational binding of the sample clusters in maintaining their morphological stability. Moreover, there are no correlations between the MD and ER of the sample clusters and their age. They are also not significantly correlated with the X-axis, the Y-axis, their orbital eccentricities, and the radial and vertical forces on them. However, the ER of the sample clusters displays some fluctuations in the distributions between it and the above covariates, implying that the morphologies of the sample clusters are sensitive to the external environment if sample effects are not taken into account. Finally, the analysis of the 3D spatial shapes of sample clusters with a small ER or a large ER demonstrates that the number of members lays an important foundation for forming a dense internal system for sample clusters. At the same time, the MD of the sample clusters can serve well as an indicator of their morphological stability, which is built on a certain amount of member stars.</description>

      <title>JADES - The small blue bump in GN-z11: insights into the nuclear region of a galaxy at z=10.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of continuum excess in the rest-frame UV between 3000 {\AA} and 3550 {\AA} in the JWST/NIRSpec spectrum of GN-z11, a galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z = 10.603. The shape of the continuum excess resembles a Balmer continuum but has a break around 3546 {\AA} in the rest frame, which is 100 {\AA} bluewards to the Balmer limit at 3646 {\AA}. A Balmer continuum model alone cannot fit the spectrum, implying a different origin for the continuum excess. The absence of the Balmer jump indicates an electron temperature of $\sim 3\times 10^4$ K, which is significantly higher than the temperature of $T_{e}({\rm O^{2+}}) \approx 1.3\times 10^{4}$ K inferred from [OIII]$\lambda 4363$. The temperature difference must result from mixing of different ionized regions: the Balmer emission mainly arises from dense and hot clouds in the Broad Line Region, close to the accreting black hole, whereas the forbidden lines originate from less dense and colder gas in the host galaxy (although these ionized regions are kinematically similar in GN-z11 due to its small BH mass). We propose a potential explanation for the observed continuum excess to come from a complex of FeII emission, which shows a characteristic jump bluewards to the Balmer limit as previously seen in the spectra of many lower-redshift quasars. Through comparisons with Cloudy models, we show an Fe abundance or an overall metallicity above $\sim 1/3$ solar is likely needed. Besides the FeII emission, part of the small blue bump might also be associated with an OIII Bowen fluorescent line, a line often enhanced in dense AGN-ionized gas. Finally, the spectrum provides further evidence against Wolf-Rayet or massive stars dominating the nebular emission in GN-z11.</description>

      <title>A Sagittarius-like simulated dwarf spheroidal galaxy from TNG50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Sgr dSph) galaxy provides one of the most convincing examples of tidal interaction between satellite galaxies and the Milky Way (MW). The main body of the dwarf was recently demonstrated to have an elongated, prolate, bar-like shape and to possess some internal rotation. Whether these features are temporary results of the strong tidal interaction at the recent pericenter passage or are due to a disky progenitor is a matter of debate. I present an analog of Sgr selected among bar-like galaxies from the TNG50 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project. The simulated dwarf is initially a disky galaxy with mass exceeding $10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ and evolves around a MW-like host on a tight orbit with seven pericenter passages and a period of about 1 Gyr. At the second pericenter passage, the disk transforms into a bar and the bar-like shape of the stellar component is preserved until the end of the evolution. The morphological transformation is accompanied by strong mass loss, leaving a dwarf with a final mass of below $10^{9}$ M$_\odot$. The gas is lost completely and the star formation ceases at the third pericenter passage. At the last pericenters, the dwarf possesses a bar-like shape, a little remnant rotation, and the metallicity gradient, which are consistent with observations. The more concentrated metal-rich stellar population rotates faster and has a lower velocity dispersion than the more extended metal-poor one. The metallicity distribution evolves so that the most metal-poor stars are stripped first, which explains the metallicity gradient detected in the Sgr stream. This study demonstrates that a dSph galaxy with properties akin to the Sgr dwarf can form from a disky progenitor with a mass of above $10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ by tidal evolution around the MW in the cosmological context.</description>

      <title>X-ray signatures of galactic outflows into the circumgalactic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a set of controlled hydrodynamical simulations to study the effects of strong galactic outflows on the density and temperature structures, and associated X-ray signatures, of extra-planar and circumgalactic gas. We consider three initial state models, isothermal, isentropic, and rotating cooling-flow, for the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) into which the outflows are driven. The energy sources are either stellar winds and supernovae, or active galactic nuclei. We consider energy injection rates in the range $10^{40} &lt; \dot{E}_{\rm inj} &lt;10^{44.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and compute the time-dependent soft X-ray (0.5-2 keV) surface brightness. For $\dot{E}_{\rm inj} \gtrsim 10^{41} - 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with the exact threshold depending on the initial CGM state, the X-ray response is dominated by dense hot gas in the forward shock that eventually fades into the CGM as a sound wave. The shock surrounds an inner hot bubble leading to a radial flattening of the X-ray surface brightness. For lower energy injection rates, the X-ray surface brightness of the initial CGM state is almost unaffected. We present analytic approximations for the outflow shock propagation and the associated X-ray emissions.</description>

      <title>The effects of bar strength and kinematics on galaxy evolution: slow strong bars affect their hosts the most</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how bar strength and bar kinematics affect star formation in different regions of the bar by creating radial profiles of EW[H$\alpha$] and D$_{\rm n}$4000 using data from SDSS-IV MaNGA. Bars in galaxies are classified as strong or weak using Galaxy Zoo DESI, and they are classified as fast and slow bars using the Tremaine-Weinberg method on stellar kinematic data from the MaNGA survey. In agreement with previous studies, we find that strong bars in star forming galaxies have enhanced star formation in their centre and beyond the bar-end region, while star formation is suppressed in the arms of the bar. This is not found for weakly barred galaxies, which have very similar radial profiles to unbarred galaxies. In addition, we find that slow bars in star forming galaxies have significantly higher star formation along the bar than fast bars. However, the global star formation rate is not significantly different between galaxies with fast and slow bars. This suggests that the kinematics of the bar do not affect star formation globally, but changes where star formation occurs in the galaxy. Thus, we find that a bar will influence its host the most if it is both strong and slow.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the decametre sky at subarcminute resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The largely unexplored decameter radio band (10-30 MHz) provides a unique window for studying a range of astronomical topics, such as auroral emission from exoplanets, inefficient cosmic ray acceleration mechanisms, fossil radio plasma, and free-free absorption. The scarcity of low-frequency studies is mainly due to the severe perturbing effects of the ionosphere. Here we present a calibration strategy that can correct for the ionosphere in the decameter band. We apply this to an observation from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) between 16 to 30 MHz . The resulting image covers 330 square degrees of sky at a resolution of 45", reaching a sensitivity of 12 mJy/beam. Residual ionospheric effects cause additional blurring ranging between 60 to 100". This represents an order of magnitude improvement in terms of sensitivity and resolution compared to previous decameter band observations. In the region we surveyed, we have identified four fossil plasma sources. These rare sources are believed to contain old, possibly re-energised, radio plasma originating from previous outbursts of active galactic nuclei. At least three of them are situated near the center of low-mass galaxy clusters. Notably, two of these sources display the steepest radio spectral index among all the sources detected at 23 MHz. This indicates that fossil plasma sources constitute the primary population of steep-spectrum sources at these frequencies, emphasising the large discovery potential of ground-based decameter observations.</description>

      <title>Spelunker: A quick-look Python pipeline for JWST NIRISS FGS Guide Star Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope produces some of the highest sensitivity imaging of the cosmos across all instruments. One of them, the NIRISS Fine Guidance Sensor, provides guide star imaging with a passband of 0.6 to 5 microns through two separate channels, each with a 2.3' x 2.3' field of view (FOV) and a sampling rate of 64 ms$-$data that is taken in parallel and is thus available for every JWST observing program. While the onboard system uses guide stars to provide information to the attitude control system (ACS), which stabilizes the observatory, the astronomical community can also use the data products associated with these 64 ms cadence images as science products. Usages range from studying guide star photometry in search of transient phenomena to using these data to identify and investigate technical anomalies that might occur during scientific observations with the rest of the JWST instruments. Despite this wide range of possible usages, these data products are not straightforward to manipulate and analyze, and there is no publicly available package to download, investigate, and research guide star data. Spelunker is a Python library that was developed to enable access to these guide star data products and their analysis.</description>

      <title>Massive interacting binaries as an enrichment source for multiple populations in star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a suite of binary evolution models with massive primaries (10 $\leq$ M$_1$ $\leq$ 40 M$_\odot$) and periods and mass ratios chosen such that the systems undergo non-conservative mass transfer while the primaries have helium cores. We track the total mass and chemical composition of the ejecta from these systems. This material shows the abundance signatures of hot hydrogen burning which are needed to explain the abundance patterns seen in multiple populations in massive star clusters. We then calculate the total yield of a population of binary stars with masses, mass ratios, and periods consistent with their distribution in a field population. We show that the overall abundance of this material is enriched in helium, nitrogen, sodium, and aluminum, and depleted in carbon, oxygen, and magnesium, by amounts that are consistent with observations. We also show that such a population of binaries will return approximately 25% of its mass in this ejecta (compared to 4% if all the stars were single), over a characteristic timescale of about 12 Myr. We argue that massive binaries must be seriously considered as a contributor to the source of enriched material needed to explain the multiple populations in massive clusters, since essentially all massive stars are formed in binaries or higher order multiples, massive binaries are primarily formed in clusters, and massive binaries naturally produce material of the right composition.</description>

      <title>A strong He II $\lambda$1640 emitter with extremely blue UV spectral slope at $z=8.16$: presence of Pop III stars?</title>

Abstract: Cosmic hydrogen reionization and cosmic production of first metals are major phase transitions of the universe occurring during the first billion years after the Big Bang, however these are still underexplored observationally. Using the JWST NIRSpec prism spectroscopy, we report the discovery of a sub-$L_\ast$ galaxy at $z_{\rm spec}=8.1623\pm0.0007$, dubbed RXJ2129-z8HeII, via the detection of a series of strong rest-frame UV/optical nebular emission lines and the clear Lyman break. RXJ2129-z8HeII shows a pronounced UV continuum with an extremely steep (i.e. blue) spectral slope of $\beta=-2.53_{-0.07}^{+0.06}$, the steepest amongst all spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at $z_{\rm spec}\gtrsim7$, in support of its very hard ionizing spectrum that could lead to a significant leakage of its ionizing flux. Therefore, RXJ2129-z8HeII is representative of the key galaxy population driving the cosmic reionization. More importantly, we detect a strong He II $\lambda$1640 emission line in its spectrum, one of the highest redshifts at which such a line is robustly detected. Its high rest-frame equivalent width (${\rm EW}=21\pm4$ Angstrom) and extreme flux ratios with respect to UV metal and Balmer lines raise the possibility that part of RXJ2129-z8HeII's stellar populations could be Pop III-like. Through careful photoionization modeling, we show that the physically calibrated phenomenological models of the ionizing spectra of Pop III stars with strong mass loss can successfully reproduce the emission line flux ratios observed in RXJ2129-z8HeII. Assuming the Eddington limit, the total mass of the Pop III stars within this system is estimated to be $7.8\pm1.4\times10^5 M_\odot$. To date, this galaxy presents the most compelling case in the early universe where trace Pop III stars might coexist with metal-enriched populations.</description>

Abstract: The exquisite angular resolution and sensitivity of JWST is opening a new window for our understanding of the Universe. In nearby galaxies, JWST observations are revolutionizing our understanding of the first phases of star formation and the dusty interstellar medium. Nineteen local galaxies spanning a range of properties and morphologies across the star-forming main sequence have been observed as part of the PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1 Treasury program at spatial scales of $\sim$5-50pc. Here, we describe pjpipe, an image processing pipeline developed for the PHANGS-JWST program that wraps around and extends the official JWST pipeline. We release this pipeline to the community as it contains a number of tools generally useful for JWST NIRCam and MIRI observations. Particularly for extended sources, pjpipe products provide significant improvements over mosaics from the MAST archive in terms of removing instrumental noise in NIRCam data, background flux matching, and calibration of relative and absolute astrometry. We show that slightly smoothing F2100W MIRI data to 0.9" (degrading the resolution by about 30 percent) reduces the noise by a factor of $\approx$3. We also present the first public release (DR1.1.0) of the pjpipe processed eight-band 2-21 $\mu$m imaging for all nineteen galaxies in the PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1 Treasury program. An additional 55 galaxies will soon follow from a new PHANGS-JWST Cycle 2 Treasury program.</description>

      <title>Merge and strip: dark matter-free dwarf galaxies in clusters can be formed by galaxy mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations of galaxy mergers inside galaxy cluster environments report high star formation rates in the ejected tidal tails, which point towards currently developing tidal dwarf galaxies. We test whether these dwarf objects could get stripped from the galaxy potential by the galaxy cluster and thus populate it with dwarf galaxies. To this end, we perform three high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of mergers between spiral galaxies in a cluster environment, varying the initial orbit of the infalling galaxies with respect to the cluster center. We demonstrate that cluster environments are indeed capable of stripping tidal dwarf galaxies from the host potential in all tested setups. In the three orbit scenarios, we find 3, 7, and 8 tidal dwarf galaxies per merger, respectively, which survive longer than 1 Gyr after the merger event. Exposed to ram pressure, these gas dominated dwarf galaxies exhibit high star formation rates while also losing gas to the environment. Experiencing a strong headwind due to their motion through the intracluster medium, they quickly lose momentum and start spiraling towards the cluster center, reaching distances on the order of ~Mpc from their progenitor. About 4 Gyr after the merger event, we still find several intact dwarf galaxies, demonstrating that such objects can prevail for a significant fraction of the Hubble time. Comparing their contribution to the observed galaxy mass function in clusters, our results indicate that ~30% of dwarf galaxies in clusters could have been formed by stripping from galaxy mergers.</description>

      <title>The Core Mass Function Across Galactic Environments. IV. The Galactic Center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) and how it may vary with galactic environment is a matter of debate. Certain star formation theories involve a close connection between the IMF and the Core Mass Function (CMF) and so it is important to measure this CMF in a range of locations in the Milky Way. Here we study the CMF of three Galactic Center clouds: G0.253+0.016 ("The Brick"), Sgr B2 (Deep South field) and Sgr C. We use ALMA 1 mm continuum images and identify cores as peaks in thermal dust emission via the dendrogram algorithm. We develop a completeness correction method via synthetic core insertion, where a realistic mass-dependent size distribution is used for the synthetic cores. After corrections, a power law of the form $\text{d}N/\text{d}\log M \propto M^{-\alpha}$ is fit to the CMFs above 2 M$_\odot$. The three regions show disparate CMFs, with the Brick showing a Salpeter-like power law index $\alpha=1.21\pm0.11$ and the other two regions showing shallower indices ($\alpha=0.92\pm0.09$ for Sgr C and $\alpha=0.66\pm0.05$ for Sgr B2-DS). Furthermore, we analyze the spatial distribution and mass segregation of cores in each region. Sgr C and Sgr B2-DS show signs of mass segregation, but the Brick does not. We compare our results to several other CMFs from different Galactic regions derived with the same methods. Finally, we discuss how these results may help define an evolutionary sequence of star cluster formation and can be used to test star formation theories.</description>

      <title>JWST's first glimpse of a z &gt; 2 forming cluster reveals a top-heavy stellar mass function</title>

Abstract: Clusters and their progenitors (protoclusters) at z = 2-4, the peak epoch of star formation, are ideal laboratories to study the formation process of both the clusters themselves and their member galaxies. However, a complete census of their member galaxies has been challenging due to observational difficulties. Here we present new JWST/NIRCam observations targeting the distant cluster CLJ1001 at z = 2.51 from the COSMOS-Webb program, which, in combination with previous narrow-band imaging targeting H-alpha emitters and deep millimeter surveys of CO-emitters, provide a complete view of massive galaxy assembly in CLJ1001. In particular, JWST reveals a population of massive, extremely red cluster members in the long-wavelength bands that were invisible in previous HST/F160W imaging (HST-dark). Based on this highly complete spectroscopic sample of member galaxies, we show that the spatial distribution of galaxies in CLJ1001 exhibits a strong central concentration, with the central galaxy density already resembling that of low-z clusters. Moreover, we reveal a "top-heavy" stellar mass function for the star-forming galaxies (SFGs), with an overabundance of massive SFGs piled up in the cluster core. These features strongly suggest that CLJ1001 is caught in a rapid transition, with many of its massive SFGs likely soon becoming quiescent. In the context of cluster formation, these findings suggest that the earliest clusters form from the inside out and top to bottom, with the massive galaxies in the core assembling first, followed by the less-massive ones in the outskirts.</description>

Abstract: Feedback is the key physical mechanism regulating galaxy formation. Stars in galaxies form when baryons radiatively cool down and fall into gravitational wells. Eventually, star formation quenches as gas is depleted and/or perturbed by feedback processes, no longer being able to collapse and condense. For massive galaxies, astronomers identify feedback from accreting supermassive black holes (active galactic nuclei, AGN) as the main agent responsible for quenching. We report the first spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of a massive, completely quiescent galaxy at $z=3.714$ (Jekyll) and its neighborhood. Jekyll is part of a galaxy pair with a compact, dusty, massive star-forming companion (Hyde). We find large amounts of ionized and neutral gas in the intergalactic medium around the pair, yet Jekyll has remained quiescent for more than 500~Myr. The emitting gas is consistent with AGN photoionization, but no AGN is observed in Jekyll. We find that, in contrast to standard scenarios, AGN in satellite galaxies can be critical contributors for keeping massive galaxies quiescent in the early Universe. After the accelerated formation and quenching of the massive central galaxy, tidally induced gas stripping additionally contributes to the star-formation regulation on subsequent satellite galaxy generations.</description>

Abstract: Lensing reconstruction maps from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide direct observations of the matter distribution of the universe without the use of a biased tracer. Such maps, however, constitute projected observables along the line of sight that are dominated by their low-redshift contributions. To cleanly access high-redshift information, Maniyar et al. showed that a linear combination of lensing maps from both CMB and line intensity mapping (LIM) observations can exactly null the low-redshift contribution to CMB lensing convergence. In this paper we explore the scientific returns of this nulling technique. We show that LIM-nulling estimators can place constraints on standard $\Lambda$CDM plus neutrino mass parameters that are competitive with traditional CMB lensing. Additionally, we demonstrate that as a clean probe of the high-redshift universe, LIM-nulling can be used for model-independent tests of cosmology beyond $\Lambda$CDM and as a probe of the high-redshift matter power spectrum.</description>

      <title>A New Probe of the High-z BAO scale: BAO tomography With CMB $\times$ LIM-Nulling Convergence</title>

Abstract: Standard rulers such as the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale serve as workhorses for precision tests of cosmology, enabling distance measurements that probe the geometry and expansion history of our Universe. Aside from BAO measurements from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), most standard ruler techniques operate at relatively low redshifts and depend on biased tracers of the matter density field. In a companion paper, we explored the scientific reach of nulling estimators, where CMB lensing convergence maps are cross-correlated with linear combinations of similar maps from line intensity mapping (LIM) to precisely null out the low-redshift contributions to CMB lensing. We showed that nulling estimators can be used to constrain the high redshift matter power spectrum and showed that this spectrum exhibits discernible BAO features. Here we propose using these features as a standard ruler at high redshifts that does not rely on biased tracers. Forecasting such a measurement at $z \sim 5$, we find that next-generation instruments will be able to constrain the BAO scale to percent-level precision at $7.2 \%$, while our futuristic observing scenario can constrain the BAO scale to $4\%$ precision. This constitutes a fundamentally new kind of BAO measurement during early epochs in our cosmic history.</description>

      <title>Double white dwarf binary population in MOCCA star clusters -- Comparisons with observations of close and wide binaries</title>

Abstract: There could be a significant population of double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) inside globular clusters (GCs), however, these are often too faint to be individually observed. We have utilized a large number GC models evolved with the Monte Carlo Cluster Simulator (MOCCA) code, to create a large statistical dataset of DWDs. These models include multiple-stellar populations, resulting in two distinct initial populations: one dense and another less dense. Due to the lower density of one population, a large number of objects escape during the early GC evolution, leading to a high mass-loss rate. In this dataset we have analysed three main groups of DWDs, namely in-cluster binaries, escaped binaries, and isolated evolution of primordial binaries. We compared the properties of these groups to observations of close and wide binaries. We find that the number of escaping DWDs is significantly larger than the number of in-cluster binaries and those that form via the isolated evolution of all promiridial binaries in our GC models. This suggests that dynamics play an important role in the formation of DWDs. For close binaries, we found a good agreement in the separations of escaped binaries and isolated binaries, but in-cluster binaries showed slight differences. We could not reproduce the observed extremely low mass WDs due to the limitations of our stellar and binary evolution prescriptions. For wide binaries, we also found a good agreement in the separations and masses, after accounting for observational selection effects. We conclude that, even though the current observational samples of DWDs are extremely biased and incomplete, our results compare reasonably well with observations.</description>
