      <title>Improving the Scan-rescan Precision of AI-based CMR Biomarker Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantification of cardiac biomarkers from cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data using deep learning (DL) methods offers many advantages, such as increased accuracy and faster analysis. However, only a few studies have focused on the scan-rescan precision of the biomarker estimates, which is important for reproducibility and longitudinal analysis. Here, we propose a cardiac biomarker estimation pipeline that not only focuses on achieving high segmentation accuracy but also on improving the scan-rescan precision of the computed biomarkers, namely left and right ventricular ejection fraction, and left ventricular myocardial mass. We evaluate two approaches to improve the apical-basal resolution of the segmentations used for estimating the biomarkers: one based on image interpolation and one based on segmentation interpolation. Using a database comprising scan-rescan cine CMR data acquired from 92 subjects, we compare the performance of these two methods against ground truth (GT) segmentations and DL segmentations obtained before interpolation (baseline). The results demonstrate that both the image-based and segmentation-based interpolation methods were able to narrow Bland-Altman scan-rescan confidence intervals for all biomarkers compared to the GT and baseline performances. Our findings highlight the importance of focusing not only on segmentation accuracy but also on the consistency of biomarkers across repeated scans, which is crucial for longitudinal analysis of cardiac function.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Generalizable TBI Phenotypes Using Multivariate Time-Series Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) presents a broad spectrum of clinical presentations and outcomes due to its inherent heterogeneity, leading to diverse recovery trajectories and varied therapeutic responses. While many studies have delved into TBI phenotyping for distinct patient populations, identifying TBI phenotypes that consistently generalize across various settings and populations remains a critical research gap. Our research addresses this by employing multivariate time-series clustering to unveil TBI's dynamic intricates. Utilizing a self-supervised learning-based approach to clustering multivariate time-Series data with missing values (SLAC-Time), we analyzed both the research-centric TRACK-TBI and the real-world MIMIC-IV datasets. Remarkably, the optimal hyperparameters of SLAC-Time and the ideal number of clusters remained consistent across these datasets, underscoring SLAC-Time's stability across heterogeneous datasets. Our analysis revealed three generalizable TBI phenotypes ({\alpha}, \b{eta}, and {\gamma}), each exhibiting distinct non-temporal features during emergency department visits, and temporal feature profiles throughout ICU stays. Specifically, phenotype {\alpha} represents mild TBI with a remarkably consistent clinical presentation. In contrast, phenotype \b{eta} signifies severe TBI with diverse clinical manifestations, and phenotype {\gamma} represents a moderate TBI profile in terms of severity and clinical diversity. Age is a significant determinant of TBI outcomes, with older cohorts recording higher mortality rates. Importantly, while certain features varied by age, the core characteristics of TBI manifestations tied to each phenotype remain consistent across diverse populations.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph: A Unified and Uniform Definition with Application to Chemical Hypergraph and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12235v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conventional definition of hypergraph has two major issues: (1) there is not a standard definition of directed hypergraph and (2) there is not a formal definition of nested hypergraph. To resolve these issues, we propose a new definition of hypergraph that unifies the concepts of undirected, directed and nested hypergraphs, and that is uniform in using hyperedge as a single construct for representing high-order correlations among things, i.e., nodes and hyperedges. Specifically, we define a hyperedge to be a simple hyperedge, a nesting hyperedge, or a directed hyperedge. With this new definition, a hypergraph is nested if it has nesting hyperedge(s), and is directed if it has directed hyperedge(s). Otherwise, a hypergraph is a simple hypergraph. The uniformity and power of this new definition, with visualization, should facilitate the use of hypergraph for representing (hierarchical) high-order correlations in general and chemical systems in particular. Graph has been widely used as a mathematical structure for machine learning on molecular structures and 3D molecular geometries. However, graph has a major limitation: it can represent only pairwise correlations between nodes. Hypergraph extends graph with high-order correlations among nodes. This extension is significant or essential for machine learning on chemical systems. For molecules, this is significant as it allows the direct, explicit representation of multicenter bonds and molecular substructures. For chemical reactions, this is essential since most chemical reactions involve multiple participants. We propose the use of chemical hypergraph, a multilevel hypergraph with simple, nesting and directed hyperedges, as a single mathematical structure for representing chemical systems. We apply the new definition of hypergraph to chemical hypergraph and, as simplified versions, molecular hypergraph and chemical reaction hypergraph.</description>
