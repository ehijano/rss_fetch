      <title>Sensing the binding and unbinding of anyons at impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anyons are quasiparticles with fractional charge and statistics that arise in strongly correlated two-dimensional systems such as the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect and fractional Chern insulators (FCI). Interactions between anyons can lead to emergent phenomena, such as anyon superconductivity as well as anyon condensation which allows for a hierarchical construction of quantum Hall states. In this work, we study how quasihole anyons in a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin fractional quantum Hall state can be bound together by a sufficiently strong attractive impurity potential. The competition between the repulsive interaction between the quasiholes themselves and the attractive interaction between the quasiholes and the impurity leads to states with different numbers of quasiholes bound to the impurity. Tuning the chemical potential via gating while remaining within a quantum Hall plateau changes the number of quasiholes bound to the impurity. We propose methods for studying these states experimentally, for example using scanning tunneling microscopy and exciton spectroscopy. While the impurities in traditional platforms such as GaAs heterostructures are typically too weak to observe the binding of anyons, the recently discovered zero-field fractional Chern insulators in twisted MoTe$_2$ offer a platform which may realize the strong-impurity regime.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Infinite Variance Problem in Fermionic Monte Carlo Simulations: Retrospective Error Remediation and the Exact Bridge Link Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the infinite variance problem in fermionic Monte Carlo simulations, which is widely encountered in areas ranging from condensed matter to nuclear and high-energy physics. The different algorithms, which we broadly refer to as determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), are applied in many situations and differ in details, but they share a foundation in field theory, and often involve fermion determinants whose symmetry properties make the algorithm sign-problem-free. We show that the infinite variance problem arises as the observables computed in DQMC tend to form heavy-tailed distributions. To remedy this issue retrospectively, we introduce a tail-aware error estimation method to correct the otherwise unreliable estimates of confidence intervals. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to perform DQMC calculations that eliminate the infinite variance problem for a broad class of observables. Our approach is an exact bridge link method, which involves a simple and efficient modification to the standard DQMC algorithm. The method introduces no systematic bias and is straightforward to implement with minimal computational overhead. Our results establish a practical and robust solution to the infinite variance problem, with broad implications for improving the reliability of a variety of fundamental fermion simulations.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic magnetism of polymorphic ErAl3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ErAl$_3$ can form in either a trigonal ($\alpha$) or cubic ($\beta$) polymorph and this paper investigates the physical properties of these polymorphs through characterizations of single crystals grown in an aluminum flux. We demonstrate that polymorph selection can be achieved based on the nominal composition of the crystal growth. Magnetic measurements confirm that both $\beta$-ErAl$_3$ and $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$ order antiferromagnetically at low temperatures. $\beta$-ErAl$_3$ undergoes AFM ordering at a N\'eel temperature T$_N$ = 5.1 K, and the transition is suppressed continually with applied field. $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$ displays more complex behavior, with successive magnetic transitions at T$_N$ = 5.7 K and T$_2$ = 4.6 K for zero field, where heat capacity and dilatometry measurements evidence that these transitions are second- and first-order, respectively. Under magnetic field, strong anisotropy is revealed in $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$, with several step-like metamagnetic transitions observed below T$_2$ for H$\parallel$c. These transitions produce sequential magnetization plateaus near one-half of the apparent saturation magnetization. The electrical resistivity of $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$ is strongly coupled to its magnetism. At $T$ = 2 K, we observe a positive magnetoresistance reaching 60\%, with distinct anomalies at the metamagnetic transitions. The results are summarized in $H$- $T$ phase diagrams that demonstrate complex magnetic behavior for $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$, suggesting an important role of competing interactions in this metallic system that possesses characteristics of Ising physics.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Magneto-Phononic Coupling and Photoinduced Magnetic Control in Antiferromagnetic Kondo Semimetal CeBi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an ultrafast optical spectroscopy study on the coherent phonon dynamics in the topological semimetal CeBi and its nonmagnetic isostructural compound LaBi, revealing profound insights into their electronic and magnetic interactions. Both materials exhibit prominent $A_{1g}$ longitudinal optical phonons with characteristic anharmonic temperature dependencies. However, in CeBi, the $A_{1g}$ phonon frequency and amplitude show clear anomalies near its antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering temperatures ($T_{N1}$ $\simeq$ 25 K and $T_{N2}$ $\simeq$ 12 K), which unequivocally demonstrate strong magneto-phononic coupling. Crucially, in the AFM state at 4 K, CeBi exhibits a pump fluence threshold of $F_C$ $\approx$ 44 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, above which the rate of phonon softening accelerates and the amplitude increases sharply. This unique threshold, absent in paramagnetic CeBi and LaBi, points to a photoinduced, non-thermal quenching of the AFM order. Our findings establish coherent phonons as highly sensitive probes of intertwined orders in heavy fermion systems, highlighting the transformative potential of ultrafast pulses in dynamically controlling magnetic states in correlated electron materials and paving the way for the manipulation of emergent quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Evidence for magnetoelastic coupling and chiral magnetic ground state in quasi-van der Waals tr-Cr$_{1.22}$Te$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trigonal tr-Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_{2}$ is a well-known ferromagnetic material that has recently drawn much attention due to the discovery of zero-field skyrmion state, unusual anomalous Hall effect, topological Hall effect, and topological Nernst effect. This quasi-van der Waals (vdW) layered material with intercalated Cr atoms possesses many peculiar features that depend on the amount of Cr intercalation, although the microscopic magnetic ground state is still elusive. We reveal the structural and magnetic properties of tr-Cr$_{1.22}$Te$_{2}$ by low-temperature x-ray diffraction, magnetization, temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy, and single-crystal neutron diffraction studies. Magnetization measurements under small applied magnetic field indicate two successive magnetic transitions, one from a ferromagnetic (FM) state to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) state (T$_\mathrm{C}=197$ K), and second from AFM to a paramagnetic state (T$_\mathrm{N}=211$ K). The FM transition is sharp with a strong presence of magnetoelastic coupling, but is not accompanied by any structural phase transition. The magnetic structure obtained from zero-field single crystal neutron diffraction reveals that the Cr1 and Cr2 moments are ferromagnetically aligned along the c-axis, while the Cr3 and intercalated Cr4 atoms induce an AFM component in the ab-plane leading to an umbrella-like spin structure which possesses a finite spin chirality. The presence of a finite spin chirality is responsible for the observation of the topological Hall effect (THE).</description>

      <title>Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Flat Bands with Paramagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall effect has been widely explored in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems. Here, we propose an interaction-driven paramagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect emerging in the Fermion-Hubbard model on a dice lattice with weak spin-orbit coupling. Based on exact diagonalization calculations, the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the ground state is evidenced by nonuniform loop currents between nearest-neighbor sites. The many-body ground state possesses a Chern number of $\mathcal{C}=2$ or $6$, and strong correlation effects in the half-filled flat bands lead to a well-defined first excitation gap and a clear insulating gap, ensuring the robustness against thermal fluctuations and external perturbations. The interplay between spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interaction allows tunability of various magnetic ground states, generating a rich phase diagram with competing ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic orders.</description>

      <title>Electronic and magnetic ground states of {112} grain boundary in graphene in the extended Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ground state phase diagram of the extended Hubbard model in a half-filled 5/7 skewed ladder, which is topologically equivalent to a \{112\} grain boundary in graphene and related systems. Using the mean-field method, we identify various electronic and magnetic phases in the U-V plane, by calculating the site charge and spin densities. The electronic phases include partially charge-ordered metal or insulator, and fully charge-ordered insulator. The different magnetic phases of the model are non-magnet, spin density wave, spin split compensated ferrimagnet or partial antiferromagnet. Analysis of the electronic band structure reveals that the partially charge-ordered compensated ferrimagnetic phase exhibits spin polarisation, which can be quite interesting for spintronics applications. We also compute the polarisation as a function of $U$ using the Berry phase formalism and show that the system exhibits multiferroicity with coexisting compensated ferrimagnetic spin order alongside electronic polarisations.</description>

      <title>Pseudogap in the lightly hole-doped triangular-lattice moir\'e Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic structure of the lightly hole-doped triangular-lattice moir\'e Hubbard model is studied within cluster perturbation theory (CPT) using 13-site clusters for a fixed doping concentration $p=1/13$ varying the Coulomb parameter $U$ and the hopping phase parameter $\phi$ related to the spin-orbital interaction. We have also developed a rather simple generalized mean-field approximation (GMFA) containing the amplitude of the spin correlations as a free parameter to fit the CPT data.The evolution of the Fermi surface and the pseudogap with the parameters $\phi$ and $U$ is explained from the viewpoint of the short-range magnetic order. The geometric frustration and the additional model parameter related to the spin-orbital interaction result in a more rich physics of the pseudogap state compared to the case of a more conventional square lattice.</description>

      <title>A Novel Surface-confined Spiral State With The Double Period In The Cubic Chiral Helimagnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral magnetoelectric insulator Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ hosts a rich and anisotropic magnetic phase diagram that includes helical, conical, field-polarized, tilted conical, and skyrmion lattice phases. Using resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS), we uncover a new spiral state confined to the surface of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. This surface-confined spiral state (SSS) displays a real-space pitch of $\sim$120 nm, which remarkably is twice the length of the incommensurate structures observed to-date in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. The SSS phase emerges at temperatures below 30~K when the magnetic field is applied near the $\langle110\rangle$ crystallographic axis. Its surface localization is demonstrated through a combination of REXS in reflection and transmission geometries, with complementary small-angle neutron scattering measurements suggesting its absence from the bulk. We attribute the stabilization of the SSS to competing anisotropic interactions at the crystal surface. The discovery of a robust, surface-confined spiral paves the way for engineering energy-efficient, nanoscale spin-texture platforms for next-generation devices.</description>

      <title>Intertwined charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom under electronic correlations in the one-dimensional Fe$^{3+}$ chalcogenide chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the study of quasi-one-dimensional iron systems with Fe$^{2+}$, we comprehensively study the Fe$^{3+}$ chalcogenide chain system. Based on first-principles calculations, the Fe$^{3+}$ chain has a similar electronic structure as discussed before in the iron 2+ chain, due to similar Fe$X_4$ ($X$ = S or Se) tetrahedron chain geometry. Furthermore, a three-orbital electronic Hubbard model for this chain was constructed by using the density matrix renormalization group method. A robust antiferromagnetic coupling was unveiled in the chain direction. In addition, in the intermediate electronic correlation $U/W$ region, we found an interesting orbital-selective Mott phase with the coexistence of localized and itinerant electrons ($U$ is the on-site Hubbard repulsion, while $W$ is the electronic bandwidth). Furthermore, we do not observe any obvious pairing tendency in the Fe$^{3+}$ chain in the electronic correlation $U/W$ region, where superconducting pairing tendencies were reported before in iron ladders. This suggests that superconductivity is unlikely to emerge in the Fe$^{3+}$ systems. Our results establish with clarity the similarities and differences between Fe$^{2+}$and Fe$^{3+}$ iron chains, as well as iron ladders.</description>

      <title>Emerging kinetic-exchange for the enhanced metallic ferromagnetism in CrGeTe$_3$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic origin of ferromagnetism in correlated materials remains heavily debated, particularly for the competing mechanisms governing insulating versus metallic phases. In this work, we theoretically study the electronic structure evolution of CrGeTe$_{3}$ under pressure and provide a consistent explanation to three unique features of this system, i.e. the semiconducting ferromagnetism at low pressure, the metallic ferromagnetism at high pressure, and the enhanced Curie temperature in the metallic phase. We propose that it is the reduced electronic correlation and enhanced $d$-$p$ hybridization that universally drive the continuous evolution of CrGeTe$_{3}$ under pressure and glue the three distinct experimental observations. Central to our discovery is the dual role of metallicity -- it simultaneously establishes kinetically driven exchange via $d$-$p$ hybridization and enables Stoner-type magnetic instability, with the contribution also from the residual super-exchange. Our analyses reveal that {\it intraband} excitations dominate the pressure-enhanced $\omega_p^2$ and $T_c$ correlation. These findings establish $d$-$p$ hybridization and electronic correlation as the bridge between localized and itinerant magnetism, at least, in CrGeTe$_{3}$.</description>

      <title>The electronic and transport properties in the Haldane-Hubbard with odd-parity altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sublattice current is recently proposed as a feasible scheme to realize the odd-parity altermagnetism(ALM) by breaking the nonmagnetic time reversal symmetry. We first adopt the spin group method to analyze why the broken nonmagnetic time reversal symmetry(TRS) is the sufficient condition for the odd-parity ALM, and find that it is the symmetry $[\bar{C}_2||\bar{E}]$ that allows the appearance of the odd-parity ALM where $\bar{C}_2$ represents a $180^\circ$ rotation around an axis perpendicular to the spins combined with the spin-space inversion, and $\bar{E}$ is the inversion in real space. As a representative example with the presence of sublattice currents, the optical conductivity of Haldane-Hubbard model is further studied using the Kubo formula. It is shown that there is no spin-polarized electrical current in both the longitudinal and traverse directions because of TRS in the odd-parity ALM, and they display a significant peak in the vicinity of the single-particle direct energy gap which reflects that both the longitudinal and traverse optical conductivities are dominated by the quasiparticle excitations around the Dirac points. We also study the hole doping dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{\rm Hall}$ as well as the staggered magnetization $M$, and find that they display opposite behaviors, i.e., $\sigma_{\rm Hall}$ in the ALM CI state is diminished monotonically from its initial value $C=2$ at half-filling as the hole doping is increased, while in the ALMI state exhibits a non-monotonous behavior.</description>

      <title>Observation of Integer and Fractional Chern insulators in high Chern number flatbands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intertwined electron correlation and topology give birth to emergent quantum phenomena with fractionalized phases in condensed matter physics. Recently, Chern insulators and fractional ones with C smaller than one have been observed in twisted MoTe2 and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene-hBN moire systems at zero magnetic fields, resembling the fractional quantum Hall phases at high magnetic fields. Here, we target topological phases with high Chern number C &gt; 1 by designing a new moire system, i.e. twisted rhombohedral trilayer-bilayer graphene. We observe Chern insulators with C = 3 at both v = 1 and v = 3. In particular, quantized anomalous Hall effect with C = -3 is observed at v = 3 for device D2. Most importantly, by fractionally filling the high Chern number flat band, we observe evidence of a fractional Chern insulator with C = -3/2 developing from even-denominator fractional filling v = 5/2 at zero magnetic fields, which reaches a fractionally quantized Hall effect with C = -3/2 (a quantization accuracy of 96%) at B = 4T. We have observed another FCI with C = -6/5 at v = 12/5, supported by the Streda formula and anomalous Hall effects induced time reversal symmetry breakings. In addition, we observe Chern insulators with C = 1 and 2 at even-denominator fractional filling v = 1/2 and 3/2, respectively, and strikingly, the signatures of anomalous Hall crystal phases with high Chern numbers (C &gt; 1) that develops continuously from v = 1 to the even-denominator v = 3/2 at zero magnetic fields in device D1 and D3. Our results demonstrate the tRTBG, which can be naturally extended to other twisted graphene moire superlattices based on rhombohedral graphene multilayers, as a novel platform for hosting unconventional high Chern number correlated topology in the ultra-strong correlated regime that is beyond the paradigm of the fractional phases with C &lt; 1.</description>

      <title>Evidence of rotational and tilting disorder of ReO6 octahedra in single crystals of a 5d1 double perovskite Ba2CaReO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of an experimental study on single crystals of a 5d1 double perovskite Ba2CaReO6. Magnetization measurements reveal a weak splitting between zero-field-cooled and field-cooled protocols below 12 K. At magnetic fields above 1 T the splitting is absent and the magnetic susceptibility is featureless. A detailed specific heat study in a wide temperature range and comprising different heat pulses did not reveal any indication of a thermodynamic phase transition. At low temperatures we do observe specific heat deviating from a phonon background, leading to a total electronic entropy release of ~Rln2. Resonant and non-resonant x-ray diffraction of characteristic Bragg peaks indicates a significant presence of disorder, potentially related to random tilts and rotations of rigid ReO6 octahedra.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field Induced Spin Wave Nonreciprocity in Noncoplanar Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that an electric field can induce nonreciprocal spin wave dispersion in magnetic insulators with negligible spin-orbit coupling. The electric field controls the direction and magnitude of nonreciprocity through a nonlinear magnetoelectric effect without switching the magnetic ground state. By deriving spin space group symmetry constraints, we find only a subset of noncoplanar magnets exhibits this property, and identify a few candidates. For the example of hexagonal lattice tetrahedral antiferromagnet, our effective field theory analysis and microscopic model calculation yield results that are fully consistent with the symmetry analysis.</description>

      <title>Single-site diagonal quantities capture off-diagonal long-range order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are typically marked by changes in quantum correlations across various spatial scales within the system. A key challenge lies in the fact that experimental probes are generally restricted to diagonal quantities at the single-site scale, which are widely believed to be insufficient for detecting phases with off-diagonal long-range order, such as superconducting states. In a striking departure from conventional expectations, we show that single-site diagonal descriptors -- charge and spin fluctuations, occupation probabilities, and entanglement -- can capture the emergence of off-diagonal long-range order in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at half-filling. These single-site quantities display clear critical signatures of the superconducting transition, preceded by a continuous breaking of particle-hole symmetry, consistent with a second-order phase transition. While this symmetry breaking has a negligible effect on single-site descriptors, it allows a direct connection between local fluctuations and nonlocal correlations.</description>

      <title>Hole distribution and self-doping enhanced electronic correlation in hole-doped infinite-layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimal model for infinite-layer nickelates remains under debate, particularly regarding the hybridization between itinerant interstitial-$s$ and the correlated Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as well as the interaction between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and other $3d$ orbitals. Additionally, how the doped holes in La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ are distributed among different orbitals remain unresolved. Motivated by recent angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, we theoretically study the electronic structure of infinite-layer La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ at various doping levels. We find that, unlike the expectation from a rigid band shift, holes are equally distributed to Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and interstitial-$s$ orbitals. The role of interstitial-$s$ orbital is further confirmed from the renormalization of Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band, for which the coupling between interstitial-$s$ and Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ exerts a non-negligible impact on the orbital-selective renormalization observed in ARPES. We also discuss the implication of our results to the single-band model, where the interstitial-$s$ orbital in the normal state of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ acts as charge donator enhancing the correlation of Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ by increasing its concentration close to half-filling.</description>

      <title>Resonant Valance Bond and Bethe Ansatz on Quasi-1D Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubbard model at $U\to\infty$ has recently been shown to have resonant valence bond (RVB) ground states on the corner-sharing sawtooth and pyrochlore lattices in the dilute doping limit of a single vacancy. In an effort to further generalize those results, I study how the ground state is modified when not all corners are shared between two tetrahedra as in the quasi-1D lattices of a pyrochlore stripe, and how to approach the problem in the case of finite doping. Using a non-Abelian version of the flux inequality, the tetrahedron chain is shown to have degenerate RVB-like ground states. The Bethe ansatz (BA) is adapted to solve the sawtooth chain with spinless or spin-polarized fermions and multiple holons, which is the first example of applying BA to a quasi-1D lattice.</description>

      <title>Topological phases and Edge states in an exactly solvable Gamma matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phases of an exactly solvable one dimensional model with $4-$dimensional $\Gamma-$matrix degrees of freedom on each site. The $\Gamma-$matrix model has a large set of competing interactions and displays a rich phase diagram with critical lines and multi-critical points. We work with the model with certain $Z_2$ symmetries and identify the allowed symmetry protected topological phases using the winding number as the topological invariant. The model belongs to the CII-class of the $10-$fold classification and allows for integer values of the winding number. We confirm that the system also hosts localized zero energy Majorana edge modes, consistent with the integer value of the winding number of the corresponding phase. We further study scaling and universality behaviour of the various topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Gaussian pseudo-Orthogonal Ensemble of Real Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04588</link>
      <description>arXiv:1802.04588v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct Gaussian pseudo-orthogonal ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$ even and large) real pseudo-symmetric matrices under the metric $\eta$ using $ \altmathcal {N}=n(n+1)/2$ elements independently drawn from a Gaussian random population and investigate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues. When $\lambda \mu &gt;0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently, all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu &lt;0$ the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues exhibit intermediate statistics. We show that the diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \altmathcal{D}^t \zeta \altmathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to a pseudo-orthogonal group. These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.</description>

      <title>Anyon-trions in atomically thin semiconductor heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of anyons in topologically ordered quantum systems has mainly relied on edge-state interferometry. However, realizing controlled braiding of anyons necessitates the ability to detect and manipulate individual anyons within the bulk. Here, we propose and theoretically investigate a first step toward this goal by demonstrating that a long-lived, optically generated interlayer exciton can bind to a quasihole in a fractional quantum Hall state, forming a composite excitation we term an anyon-trion. Using exact diagonalization, we show that mobile anyon-trions possess a binding energy of approximately 0.5 meV, whereas static anyon-trions exhibit a binding energy of about 0.9 meV, that is linearly proportional to the quasiholes fractional charge. An experimental realization based on photoluminescence from localized interlayer excitons in a quantum twisting microscope setup should allow for a direct optical observation of anyon-trions.</description>

      <title>Robust Chiral Edge Dynamics of a Kitaev Honeycomb on a Trapped Ion Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kitaev's honeycomb model is a paradigmatic exactly solvable system hosting a quantum spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and topologically protected edge modes, offering a platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for ground-state preparation, then apply controlled perturbations and measure time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a nonzero Chern number -- a hallmark of topological order -- which vanishes upon transition to the Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics, while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy of intervals in $1+1$ interface CFTs is modified in two ways compared to a CFT without interface: there is a finite boundary entropy contribution, and, for an interval with an endpoint at the interface, the coefficient of the logarithmically divergent contribution -- which is usually proportional to the central charge of the CFT -- is modified to an effective central charge. We show that the latter modification can be understood as a limit of the former using holographic duals of interface CFTs. Furthermore, we show that a finite "boundary entropy" contribution also appears in intervals that do not cross the interface and it is needed to ensure strong subbaditivity of the entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Dual-circular Raman optical activity of axial multipolar order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multipolar order, such as octupolar order, is one of the key concepts of condensed matter physics, particularly in light of elusive hidden orders. However, its experimental identification remains challenging due to the absence of direct coupling to conventional external stimuli. In this study, we propose that dual-circular Raman scattering serves as a detection of multipolar anisotropies. By combining symmetry analysis with microscopic tight-binding calculations, we demonstrate that both time-reversal-even ($\theta$-even) and time-reversal-odd ($\theta$-odd) axial multipolar phases exhibit the Raman optical activity as a direct consequence of mirror symmetry breaking. Furthermore, we find that the Stokes and anti-Stokes spectra encode the time-reversal parity of the multipolar order, providing an all-optical means to distinguish multipolar phases. Our findings open a pathway for identifying multipolar orders in various materials through dual-circular Raman spectroscopy as a sensitive and versatile probe.</description>

      <title>Expansion dynamics of strongly correlated lattice bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spatio-temporal dynamics of interacting bosons on a two-dimensional Hubbard lattice in the strongly interacting regime, taking into account the dynamics of condensate amplitude as well as the direct transport of non-condensed fluctuations. To that end we develop a selfconsistent density-matrix approach which goes beyond the standard Gutzwiller mean-field theory. Starting from the Liouville-von-Neumann equation we derive a quantum master equation for the time evolution of the system's local density matrix at each lattice site, with a dynamical bath that represents the rest of the system. We apply this method to the expansion dynamics of an initially prepared cloud of interacting bosons in an optical lattice. We observe a ballistic expansion of the condensate, as expected, followed by slow, diffusive transport of the normal bosons. We discuss, in particular, the robustness of the Mott insulator phase as well as its melting due to incoherent transport. The method should be applicable to various models of lattice bosons in the strongly correlated regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that a spatially random Yukawa-type interaction between a Fermi surface and critical bosons can produce linear-in-temperature resistivity, the defining signature of strange metals. In this article, we systematically classify all scalar couplings of the form $(\psi^{\dagger}\psi)^n\phi^m$ in arbitrary dimensions to identify possible candidates for strange-metal behaviour within this disordered framework. We find that only the Yukawa-type interaction in $(2+1)$ dimensions yields linear resistivity. Combined with previous results showing that spatially random QED-type couplings also produce such linearity, we conclude that spatially random Yukawa and QED-type interactions exhaust the class of random couplings capable of producing linear resistivity.</description>

      <title>Topological Magneto-optical Kerr Effect without Spin-orbit Coupling in Spin-compensated Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), the differential reflection of oppositely circularly polarized light, has traditionally been associated with relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which links a particle's spin with its orbital motion. In ferromagnets, large MOKE signals arise from the combination of magnetization and SOC, while in certain coplanar antiferromagnets, SOC-induced Berry curvature enables MOKE despite zero net magnetization. Theoretically, large MOKE can also arise in a broader class of magnetic materials with compensated spins, without relying on SOC - for example, in systems exhibiting real-space scalar spin chirality. The experimental verification has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate such a SOC- and magnetization-free MOKE in the noncoplanar antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2. Using a Sagnac interferometer microscope, we image domains of scalar spin chirality and their reversal. Our findings establish experimentally a new mechanism for generating large MOKE signals and position chiral spin textures in compensated magnets as a compelling platform for ultrafast, stray-field-immune opto-spintronic applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of noise on the dynamics of a transverse field Ising model when quenched across a quantum critical point. To quantify two-spin correlations properties, we employ the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) as measures of quantum coherence. In the absence of noise, despite the entanglement, both QFI and WYSI increase monotonically with the ramp quench time, approaching their adiabatic limits without exhibiting any Kibble-Zurek type scaling with quench duration. When noise is added to the quench protocol, the coherence dynamics change dramatically: QFI and WYSI both decay exponentially with time scale of a ramp quench, with the exponent depending on the noise intensity. Furthermore, the maximum ramp time, at which either of these measures reach their maximum, scales linearly with the noise variance, featuring the same exponent that determines the optimal annealing time for minimizing defect production in noisy quantum annealing.</description>

      <title>Rigid-Body Anisotropy in Noncollinear Antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the anisotropic structure in noncollinear antiferromagnets is essential for antiferromagnetic spintronics. In this work, we provide a microscopic theory linking the anisotropy effects induced by the rigid-body rotation of spin order to spin-orbit coupling. Our method goes beyond the conventional magnetic group theory, offering a concise yet powerful tool to characterize diverse anisotropy effects in complex magnetic systems. Using the group representation theory of the spin group, we obtain a set of basis functions formed from tensor elements of spin-orbit vector--which originates from spin-orbit coupling and is tied to the rigid-body rotation of the spin order--to systematically describe the structure of anisotropy effects. As a concrete example, we apply our framework to coplanar antiferromagnets Mn$_3$Sn and Mn$_3$Ir, demonstrating that the corresponding basis functions can well capture both the geometric and magnitude dependencies of the magnetic anisotropy energy and anomalous Hall conductivity. Finally, we discuss the generalization of our framework to broader classes of anisotropy phenomena in magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of fractional quantum Hall Liquids with a pulse at the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental advancements in scanning optical stroboscopic confocal microscopy and spectroscopy measurements, which have facilitated exceptional energy-space-time resolution for investigating edge and bulk dynamics in fractional quantum Hall systems, we formulated a model for the pump-probe process on the edge. Starting with a ground state, we applied a tip potential near the fractional quantum Hall liquid edge, which was subsequently turned off after a defined time duration. By examining how the specific nature of the tip potential influences the evolution of the wave function and its distribution in energy spectrum, we identify that quench dynamics of the edge pulse leads to excitations that spread both along the edge and perpendicularly into the bulk. Moreover, magnetoroton excitations are predominant among the bulk excitations. These results align well with the experimental observations. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of the tip's position, intensity, and duration on the dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a recent experimental study on the quantum Ising magnet $\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$ that presented spectroscopic evidence of zero-field supersolidity (Chen et al., arXiv:2402.15869), we simulate the excitation spectrum of the corresponding microscopic $XXZ$ model for the compound, using the recently developed excitation ansatz for infinite projected entangled-pair states. We map out the ground state phase diagram and compute the dynamical spin structure factors across a range of magnetic field strengths, focusing especially on the two supersolid phases found near zero and saturation fields. Our simulated excitation spectra for the zero-field supersolid "Y" phase are in excellent agreement with the experimental data - recovering the low-energy branches and integer quantized excited energy levels $\omega_n=nJ_{zz}$. Furthermore, we demonstrate the nonlocal multi-spin-flip features for modes at $\omega_2$, indicative of their multi-magnon nature. Additionally, we identify characteristics of the high-field supersolid "$\Psi$" phase in the simulated spectra, which should be compared with future experimental results.</description>

      <title>Destabilisation of local magnetic anisotropy in heavy-fermion compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local magnetic anisotropy of a typical crystalline compound is usually attributed to the combined effect of crystal electric fields and spin-orbit coupling. We show that this simple local picture is transformed in heavy-fermion compounds by the development of coherent electron scattering from local spin degrees of freedom. Provided the dominance of the coherence energy scale over the magnetic energy scale is strong enough, the fractionalisation and delocalisation of the spins destabilises their single-ion anisotropy by generating an opposing anisotropy in the exchange. Experimentally, this can manifest as competing splittings in the Curie-Weiss constants and effective moments. We show that the destabilisation of the anisotropy can result in either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order that is perpendicular to the high-temperature easy axis. In the absence of destabilisation, we show that the order is more likely to be antiferromagnetic. In agreement with our theory -- an extension of Read-Newns theory to the underscreened Kondo lattice -- we observe in a wide range of actinide and lanthanide compounds that the temperature at which the anisotropy of the uniform magnetic response changes tracks the coherence energy scale. We also notice that in some compounds the destabilisation of local crystalline anisotropy can be the beginning of a cascade of decreasing energy scales. Once the anisotropy changes, further growth of magnetic correlations with cooling can lead to a rapid quenching of the hard-axis susceptibility, and at even lower temperatures, the high-temperature easy axis is revealed via a metamagnetic jump when a high magnetic field is applied along it.</description>

      <title>Instability of metals with respect to strong electron-phonon interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that thermal equilibrium between conduction electrons and phonons becomes kinetically unstable when the renormalized electron-phonon coupling exceeds a certain threshold. We prove that negative electronic specific heat, $C_\mathrm{el} &lt; 0$, is sufficient to trigger the instability. Specifically, the instability sets in as soon as the quasiparticle weight becomes negative over a range of energies, even before $C_\mathrm{el}$ turns negative. This is an inherently nonequilibrium phenomenon, occurring prior to the formation of any equilibrium phase. Depending on the system, it can proceed along different pathways, ultimately resulting in a structural transition to an insulating or metallic state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a large class of non-relativistic continuum field theories where the Euclidean spatial symmetry of the classical theory is violated in the quantum theory by an Adler-Bell-Jackiw-like anomaly. In particular, the continuous translation symmetry of the classical theory is broken in the quantum theory to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, that discrete symmetry is extended by an internal symmetry, making it non-Abelian. This presentation streamlines and extends the discussion in [1]. In an Appendix, we present an elementary introduction to 't Hooft and Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies using a well-known system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of the periodic Anderson model on the square lattice across various band fillings. Employing the infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) technique, we can determine the magnetic ground states accurately and compare them to mean-field predictions to highlight the effects of quantum fluctuations. At half-filling, we analyze the transition between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic (Kondo singlet) phases as a function of hybridization and $f$-level energy, finding excellent agreement with existing quantum Monte Carlo studies in the case of hybridization. For $n = 1.5$ electrons per site, we identify a novel correlated antiferromagnetic diagonal stripe phase as the ground state, which competes with its ferromagnetic partner state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel theoretical approach for computing and analyzing two-dimensional spectroscopy of bosonic collective excitations in disordered many-body systems. Specifically, we employ the Keldysh formalism to derive, within a non-pertubative treatment of disorder effects, the third-order nonlinear response and obtain two-dimensional spectroscopy maps. In the weak nonlinear regime of our formalism, we demonstrate the ability of the echo peak to distinguish between elastic and inelastic scattering processes, in perfect agreement with the intuition developed in isolated two-level systems. Furthermore, we discuss unique many-body effects on the echo peak signature arising from interaction induced quantum fluctuations. In particular, we show that these quantum fluctuations induce a finite nonrephasable broadening and examine how the echo peak is influenced by the attractive or repulsive nature of the collective excitations.</description>

      <title>Intermediate phases in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ under in-plane magnetic field via interlayer spin interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has attracted significant attention as a prime candidate for the spin-1/2 Kitaev spin liquid in two-dimensional honeycomb lattices. Although its ground state is magnetically ordered, the order is suppressed under a moderate in-plane magnetic field. The intermediate regime of the field has exotic behaviors, some of which are claimed to originate from a Kitaev spin liquid. In resolving debates surrounding these behaviors, interlayer interactions in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ have been largely overlooked due to their perceived weakness in van der Waals materials. However, near the transition, they may become significant as the field energy approaches the interlayer coupling scale. Here we investigate the effects of interlayer couplings in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ with $R\bar{3}$ and $C2/m$ structures. We first examine their effects on the transition temperature ($T_N$) using classical Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the interlayer couplings have minimal effects on $T_N$, and the different $T_N$ between the two structures are mainly due to the anisotropy in intralayer interactions. Focusing on the $R{\bar 3}$ structure, we show that the nearest neighbor interlayer interaction is the XXZ type due to the symmetry, and the next nearest neighbor interaction of the Kitaev type is crucial for the transition between two zigzag orders under an in-plane field. Furthermore, an intermediate phase with a large unit cell emerges due to the interlayer interactions. Our findings provide insights into the exotic behaviors and sample dependence reported in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) give rise to exotic emergent particles by weaving intricate entanglement patterns in the underlying electrons. Bipartite measures between subregions can detect the presence of anyons, but little is known about the full entanglement structure of QSLs. Here, we study the multiparty entanglement of QSLs via entanglement microscopy. We find that in contrast to conventional matter, the genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) between spins is absent in the smallest subregions, a phenomenon we call "entanglement frustration". Instead, GME is more collective, and arises solely in loops. By exploiting exact results and large-scale numerics, we confirm these properties in various gapped and gapless QSLs realised in physically motivated Hamiltonians, as well as with string-net wavefunctions hosting abelian or non-abelian anyons. Our results shed new light on the phase diagram of Kitaev's honeycomb model in a Zeeman field, and the Kagome Heisenberg model under various perturbations. Going beyond QSLs, we provide evidence that entanglement loops are a universal property of quantum gauge theories. This leads to a new understanding of fractionalization, and the means by which gauge bosons encode quantum information.</description>

Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of longitudinal magneto-thermal transport in the $S=1/2$ ferromagnetic XXZ model with easy-axis exchange anisotropy ($\Delta&gt;1$) on a face-centered cubic lattice consisting of four sublattices. We employ linear spin-wave theory and the Kubo formalism to evaluate the longitudinal spin and thermal conductivities, both of which exhibit activated temperature dependence in the low-temperature regime, and to determine their magnetic-field dependence. Our analysis indicates that a magnon gap is crucial for ensuring the convergence of these conductivities. Furthermore, by examining the ratio of thermal conductivity to spin conductivity, we identify an analog of the Wiedemann-Franz law for magnon transport at low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be generalized to systems with arbitrary spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium control of electronic properties in condensed matter systems can result in novel phenomena. In this work, we provide a novel non-equilibrium route to realize half-metallic phases. We explore the periodically driven Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice and demonstrate that a periodic drive can transform a weakly interacting metal into a ferrimagnetic half-metal. We consider a Fermi-Hubbard model with only nearest-neighbour hopping and stabilize the elusive phase simply by driving the site potentials periodically. The drive induces staggered second and third-neighbor hopping and a staggered potential between two sublattices in the Floquet Hamiltonian, whose ground state is explored in this work. Close to the dynamical freezing point, due to the suppression of nearest neighbor hopping in the driven system, an effective enhancement of various terms in the Floquet Hamiltonian, including the e-e interactions, occurs. This helps in stabilizing a broad ferrimagnetic half-metallic phase for a wide range of system parameters. The half-metallic phase achieved in the presence of high drive frequency should be stable for exponentially large time scales in drive frequency and could be perpetually stable beyond a strong enough drive amplitude owing to dynamical freezing. It can hence have potential applications in stable spintronics and other upcoming quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the effective theory for fluctuating spin stripes coupled to a Fermi surface, and consider the parameter regime where a spin nematic phase intervenes between the spin density wave state and the symmetric state. It is shown that adding potential disorder to this theory, which acts as an unconventional type of random-field disorder, naturally gives rise to the universal theory of strange metals with spatial disorder in both the magnitude and sign of the electron-boson coupling term [A.A. Patel, H. Guo, I. Esterlis and S. Sachdev, Science 381, 790 (2023)]. One difference compared to the original theory, however, is that at non-zero temperatures the disordered spin-stripe model automatically self-averages over the sign of the coupling. We also study the effects of thermal fluctuations in a phenomenological model for the disordered spin density wave state, and find from Monte Carlo simulations that a short anti-ferromagnetic correlation length (order 4-5 lattice constants) already leads to pronounced Fermi arcs in the electronic spectral weight.</description>

Abstract: We show that the hydrodynamics of a perfect fluid admits a natural modification that incorporates a chiral gravitational anomaly (also known as a mixed gauge-gravity anomaly) alongside the chiral current anomaly. This modification introduces in parallel a gravitational and gauge Chern-Simons terms in a manner analogous to the Jackiw-Pi Chern-Simons modification of gravity, and features an axion in fluid mechanics. As a result, flows of a spinless perfect fluid acquire spin through motion, with the spin being equal to the fluid helicity. Furthermore, spacetime curvature induces an analogue of the Mathisson-Papapetrou force and a geometric counterpart of the chiral magnetic effect.</description>

Abstract: Monte Carlo methods have led to profound insights into the strong-coupling behaviour of lattice gauge theories and produced remarkable results such as first-principles computations of hadron masses. Despite tremendous progress over the last four decades, fundamental challenges such as the sign problem and the inability to simulate real-time dynamics remain. Neural network quantum states have emerged as an alternative method that seeks to overcome these challenges. In this work, we use gauge-invariant neural network quantum states to accurately compute the ground state of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories in $2+1$ dimensions. Using transfer learning, we study the distinct topological phases and the confinement phase transition of these theories. For $\mathbb{Z}_2$, we identify a continuous transition and compute critical exponents, finding excellent agreement with existing numerics for the expected Ising universality class. In the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ case, we observe a weakly first-order transition and identify the critical coupling. Our findings suggest that neural network quantum states are a promising method for precise studies of lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss anyon condensation in mixed-state topological order. The phases were recently conjectured to be classified by pre-modular fusion categories. Just like anyon condensation in pure-state topological order, a bootstrap analysis shows condensable anyons are given by connected \'etale algebras. We explain how to perform generic anyon condensation including non-invertible anyons and successive condensations. Interestingly, some condensations lead to pure-state topological orders. We clarify when this happens. We also compute topological invariants of equivalence classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of undecidability in problems arising from physics has experienced a renewed interest, mainly in connection with quantum information problems. The goal of this review is to survey this recent development. After a historical introduction, we first explain the necessary results about undecidability in mathematics and computer science. Then we briefly review the first results about undecidability in physics which emerged mostly in the 80s and early 90s. Finally we focus on the most recent contributions, which we divide in two main categories: many body systems and quantum information problems.</description>

      <title>Design and construction of the multiplexing cold neutron spectrometer BOYA with double-column Rowland focusing analyzers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing neutron spectrometers with higher counting efficiency has been an essential pursuit in neutron instrumentation. In this work, we present BOYA, a multiplexing cold neutron spectrometers designed and implemented at the China Advanced Research Reactor. Equipped with 34 angular analyzing channels spanning 119{\deg}, each containing 5 inelastic channels and 1 diffraction channel, BOYA enhances the measurement efficiency by two orders of magnitude over a traditional triple-axis spectrometer. To optimize both intensity and energy resolution, innovative double-column Rowland focusing analyzers have been developed. By filling the crystal gaps in the traditional Rowland focusing geometry, our design enhances the neutron beam coverage without introducing appreciable double-scattering. Our commissioning results on vanadium and MnWO4 have confirmed the success of the design, establishing BOYA as a successful multiplexing instrument for neutron spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Quantum Metrology Singularity through Sequential Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simultaneous estimation of multiple unknown parameters is the most general scenario in quantum sensing. Quantum multi-parameter estimation theory provides fundamental bounds on the achievable precision of simultaneous estimation. However, these bounds can become singular (no finite bound exists) in multi-parameter sensing due to parameter interdependencies, limited probe accessibility, and insufficient measurement outcomes. Here, we address the singularity issue in quantum sensing through a simple mechanism based on a sequential measurement strategy. This sensing scheme overcomes the singularity constraint and enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters with a local and fixed measurement throughout the sensing protocol. This is because sequential measurements, involving consecutive steps of local measurements followed by probe evolution, inherently produce correlated measurement data that grows exponentially with the number of sequential measurements. Finally, through two different examples, namely a strongly correlated probe and a light-matter system, we demonstrate how such singularities are reflected when inferring the unknown parameters through Bayesian estimation.</description>

      <title>Mesons in a quantum Ising ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When two transverse-field Ising chains (TFICs) with magnetic order are coupled, the original free excitations become confined, giving rise to meson-like bound states. In this work, we study such bound states systematically. The mesons are characterized by their fermion number parity and chain-exchanging properties, which lead to distinct sets of mesonic states. The meson masses are determined by solving the Bethe-Salpter equation. An interesting observation is the additional degeneracy in the chain-exchanging odd sectors. Beyond the two particle approximation, we exploit the truncated free fermionic space approach to calculate the spectrum numerically. Corrections to the meson masses are obtained, and the degeneracy is further confirmed. The characterization and degeneracy can be connected to the situation when each chain is tuned to be quantum critical, where the system is described by the Ising$_h^2$ integrable model, a sine-Gordon theory with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold. Here we establish a clear correspondence between the particles in the bosonized form and their fermionic counterparts. Near this point, the stability of these particles is analyzed using the form factor perturbation scheme, where four particles are always present. Additionally, we calculate the evolution of the dominant dynamical structure factor for local spin operators, providing further insight into the low-energy excitations and their role in the system's behavior. The two-particle confinement framework as well as the parity classifications may inspire the study for other coupled bi-partite systems.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Induced Higher-Order Topological Insulator via Floquet Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators have attracted significant interest in both static single-particle and many-body lattice systems. While periodically driven (Floquet) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in such systems remains less understood. In this paper, we extend previous studies by investigating interaction-induced higher-order topological phases through Floquet engineering. To achieve this, we construct an extended Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice subjected to periodic driving. We demonstrate the emergence of interaction-induced normal Floquet second-order topological corner states for doublons (i.e., bound boson pairs) from a trivial phase, which exhibit robustness against disorder. Notably, beyond the normal phase, we reveal an interaction-induced anomalous Floquet second-order topological phase, where in-gap corner states of doublons emerge within the $\pi/T$ gap ($T$ being the driving period). Our model, accessible with state-of-the-art ultracold atom techniques, provides a platform for realizing interaction-driven higher-order topological phases uniquely enabled by periodic driving, with no direct counterparts in static or single-particle systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence of Topologically Frustrated Spin Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of entanglement and magic properties in topologically frustrated systems suggests that, in the thermodynamic limit, these quantities decompose into two distinct contributions. One is determined by the specific nature of the model and its Hamiltonian, and another arises from topological frustration itself, resulting in being independent of the Hamiltonian's parameters. In this work, we test the generality of this picture by investigating an additional quantum resource, namely quantum coherence, in two different models where topological frustration is induced through an appropriate choice of boundary conditions. Our findings reveal a perfect analogy between the behavior of quantum coherence and that of other quantum resources, particularly magic, providing further evidence in support of the universality of this picture and the topological nature of this source of frustration.</description>

      <title>Reducing Self-Interaction Error in Transition-Metal Oxides with Different Exact-Exchange Fractions for Energy and Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DFT is vital for materials discovery, materials databases, chemical reaction predictions, and machine learning potentials. The widespread use of DFT in materials science aims for "chemical accuracy," but this is limited by the unknown exchange and correlation (XC) functional. A meta-GGA, the restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed, r$^2$SCAN XC functional, fulfils 17 exact constraints of the XC energy. r$^2$SCAN still appears inadequate at predicting material properties of strongly correlated compounds. Inaccuracies of r$^2$SCAN arise from functional and density-driven errors, linked to the self-interaction error. We introduce a new method, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX, for simulating transition metal oxides accurately. r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX uses different fractions of exact exchange: X to set the electronic density, and Y to set the energy density functional approximation. r2SCANY@r2SCANX addresses functional-driven and density-driven inaccuracies. Using just one or two universal parameters, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX enhances the r$^2$SCAN predictions of the properties of 18 correlated oxides, outperforming the highly parameterized DFT+$U$. The O$_2$ overbinding in r$^2$SCAN (~0.3 eV/O$_2$) reduces to just ~0.03 eV/O$_2$ with any X in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCANX. Uncertainties for oxide oxidation energies and magnetic moments are reduced by r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN50, minimizing r$^2$SCAN density-driven errors. The computationally efficient r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN is nearly as accurate as the hybrid r$^2$SCAN10 for oxidation energies. Thus, accurate energy differences can be achieved by rate-limiting self-consistent iterations and geometry optimizations with the efficient r$^2$SCAN. Subsequently, expensive hybrid functionals can be applied in a fast-to-execute single post-self-consistent calculation, as in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN, which is 10 to 300x faster than r$^2$SCAN10.</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconductivity via layer differentiation in trilayer Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the highest superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in multilayer cuprates,we investigated the trilayer Hubbard model by adopting the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Focusing on the systems with hole dopings within the two outer layers (OL) higher than the inner layer (IL), which is believed to be relevant to the realistic multilayer cuprates, our exploration discovered that the IL and OL manifest strong differentiation in a wide range of hole doping combinations. Specifically, the OLs remain metallic while the IL shows a distinct transition from the pseudogap to superconducting state. More importantly, the highest $T_c$ of the composite trilayer system can be largely enhanced compared to the single layer model and the imbalanced hole dopings between IL and OL are generically beneficial for global SC. We further provide strong numerical evidence on the possibility of $d$-wave superconductivity solely hosted in the IL. Our investigation provides new insight into the origin of highest $T_c$ in multilayer cuprates.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time parametrization of neural quantum states for quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schr\"odinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state ($s$-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using simply a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the parameterization is efficient in the number of parameters and the smooth neural quantum state allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.</description>
