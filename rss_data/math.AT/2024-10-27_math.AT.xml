      <title>Model structures for diagrammatic $(\infty, n)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagrammatic sets admit a notion of internal equivalence in the sense of coinductive weak invertibility, with similar properties to its analogue in strict $\omega$-categories. We construct a model structure whose fibrant objects are diagrammatic sets in which every round pasting diagram is equivalent to a single cell -- its weak composite -- and propose them as a model of $(\infty, \infty)$-categories. For each $n &lt; \infty$, we then construct a model structure whose fibrant objects are those $(\infty, \infty)$-categories whose cells in dimension $&gt; n$ are all weakly invertible. We show that weak equivalences between fibrant objects are precisely morphisms that are essentially surjective on cells of all dimensions. On the way to this result, we also construct model structures for $(\infty, n)$-categories on marked diagrammatic sets, which split into a coinductive and an inductive case when $n = \infty$, and prove that they are Quillen equivalent to the unmarked model structures when $n &lt; \infty$ and in the coinductive case of $n = \infty$. Finally, we prove that the $(\infty, 0)$-model structure is Quillen equivalent to the classical model structure on simplicial sets. This establishes the first proof of the homotopy hypothesis for a model of $\infty$-groupoids defined as $(\infty, \infty)$-categories whose cells in dimension $&gt; 0$ are all weakly invertible.</description>

      <title>Identifying the homotopy fiber of a map of semi-Segal spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a version of Quillen's theorems for a map of semi-Segal spaces. We construct a bi-semi-simplicial resolution similar to the one associated to a functor of non-unital topological categories. As a consequence we can represent the homotopy fiber of a map of semi-Segal spaces as the geometric realization of a certain semi-simplicial space.</description>

      <title>Real moduli space of stable rational curves revised</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04499</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.04499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The real locus of the moduli space of stable genus-zero curves with marked points, $\overline{{\mathcal M}_{0,{n+1}}}({\mathbb R})$, is known to be a smooth manifold and is the Eilenberg-MacLane spaces for the so-called pure Cactus groups. We describe the operad formed by these spaces in terms of a homotopy quotient of an operad of associative algebras. Using this model, we identify various Hopf models for the algebraic operad of chains and homologies of $\overline{{\mathcal M}_{0,{n+1}}}({\mathbb R})$. In particular, we show that the operad $\overline{{\mathcal M}_{0,{n+1}}}({\mathbb R})$ is not formal. As an application of these operadic constructions, we prove that for each $n$, the cohomology ring $H^{\bullet}(\overline{{\mathcal M}_{0,{n+1}}}({\mathbb R}), {\mathbb{Q}})$ is a Koszul algebra, and that the manifold $\overline{{\mathcal M}_{0,{n+1}}}({\mathbb R})$ is not formal for $n\geq 6$ but is a rational $K(\pi,1)$-space. Additionally, we describe the Lie algebras associated with the lower central series filtration of the pure Cactus groups.</description>

      <title>Algebraic models for classifying spaces of fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.02462v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new structural results for the rational homotopy type of the classifying space $B\operatorname{aut}(X)$ of fibrations with fiber a simply connected finite CW-complex $X$.
  We first study nilpotent covers of $B\operatorname{aut}(X)$ and show that their rational cohomology groups are algebraic representations of the associated transformation groups. For the universal cover, this yields an extension of the Sullivan--Wilkerson theorem to higher homotopy and cohomology groups. For the cover corresponding to the kernel of the homology representation, this proves algebraicity of the cohomology of the homotopy Torelli space.
  For the cover that classifies what we call normal unipotent fibrations, we then prove the stronger result that there exists a nilpotent dg Lie algebra $\mathfrak g(X)$ in algebraic representations that models its equivariant rational homotopy type. This leads to an algebraic model for the space $B\operatorname{aut}(X)$ and to a description of its rational cohomology ring as the cohomology of a certain arithmetic group $\Gamma(X)$ with coefficients in the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of $\mathfrak g(X)$. This has strong structural consequences for the cohomology ring and, in certain cases, allows it to be completely determined using invariant theory and calculations with modular forms. We illustrate these points with concrete examples.
  As another application, we significantly improve on certain results on self-homotopy equivalences of highly connected even-dimensional manifolds due to Berglund--Madsen, and we prove parallel new results in odd dimensions.</description>

      <title>Koszul duality and Calabi-Yau structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Koszul duality between differential graded categories and pointed curved coalgebras interchanges smooth and proper Calabi-Yau structures. This result is a generalization and conceptual explanation of the following two applications. For a finite-dimensional Lie algebra a smooth Calabi-Yau structure on the universal enveloping algebra is equivalent to a proper Calabi-Yau structure on the Chevalley-Eilenberg chain coalgebra, which exists if and only if Poincare duality is satisfied. For a topological space X having the homotopy type of a finite complex we show an oriented Poincare duality structure (with local coefficients) on X is equivalent to a proper Calabi-Yau structure on the dg coalgebra of chains on X and to a smooth Calabi-Yau structure on the dg algebra of chains on the based loop space of X.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of units of algebraic $K$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the $[0,1]$ and $[0,2]$ Postnikov truncations of the units of the topological $K$-theories $\glone \KO$ and $\glone \KU$, respectively, are split, and that the splitting is provided by the ($\Z/2$-graded) line bundles. In this paper we give a similar splitting for the $[0,1]$-truncation of the units of algebraic $K$-theory, considered as a sheaf on affine schemes. A crucial step is to produce the splitting for $\glone K(\Z)$. Along the way we also give a complete calculation of the connective spectrum of strict units of $K(\Z)$ and $K(\F_\ell)$ for a prime $\ell$. Finally, we show that the units of algebraic $K$-theory do not split as a presheaf. In fact we show they do not even split pointwise.</description>
