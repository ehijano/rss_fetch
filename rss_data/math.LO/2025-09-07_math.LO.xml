      <title>Subvarieties of pointed Abelian l-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a complete classification of the subvarieties and subquasivarieties of pointed Abelian lattice-ordered groups ($\ell$-groups) that are generated by chains. We present two complementary approaches to achieve this classification.
  First, using purely $\ell$-group-theoretic methods, we analyze the structure of lexicographic products and radicals to identify all join-irreducible members of the lattice of subvarieties of positively pointed $\ell$-groups. We provide a novel equational basis for each of these subvarieties, leading to a complete description of the entire subvariety lattice. As a direct application, our $\ell$-group-theoretic classification yields an alternative, self-contained proof of Komori's celebrated classification of subvarieties of MV-algebras.
  Second, we explore the connection to MV-algebras via Mundici's $\Gamma$ functor. We prove that this functor preserves universal classes, a result of independent model-theoretic interest. This allows us to lift the classification of universal classes of MV-chains, due to Gispert, to a complete classification of universal classes of totally ordered pointed Abelian $\ell$-groups. As a direct consequence, we obtain a full description of the corresponding lattice of subquasivarieties. These results offer a comprehensive structural understanding of one of the most fundamental classes of ordered algebraic structures.</description>

      <title>Hyperfiniteness of the boundary action of virtually special groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any countable group acting virtually specially on a CAT(0) cube complex, the orbit equivalence relation induced by its action on the Roller boundary is hyperfinite. This can be considered as a generalization of hyperfiniteness of the boundary action of cubulated hyperbolic groups by Huang-Sabok-Shinko.</description>

      <title>The Uniform Functional Interpretation with Informative Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a new approach to functional interpretations based on uniform quantification and relativization. The uniform quantification in the background permits a more penetrating analysis of principles related to collection and contra-collection. Relativization comes from a computationally informative notion of being an element of a given type. The approach is flexible. When the information takes the shape of bounds, we can recapture a form of the combination of G\"odel's functional dialectica interpretation with majorizability. When the information is "canonical" in function types, we obtain new functional interpretations and new models of G\"odel's theory T.</description>

      <title>Ordinal Exponentiation in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14542v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two seemingly different definitions of constructive ordinal exponentiation, where an ordinal is taken to be a transitive, extensional, and wellfounded order on a set. The first definition is abstract, uses suprema of ordinals, and is solely motivated by the expected equations. The second is more concrete, based on decreasing lists, and can be seen as a constructive version of a classical construction by Sierpi{\'n}ski based on functions with finite support. We show that our two approaches are equivalent (whenever it makes sense to ask the question), and use this equivalence to prove algebraic laws and decidability properties of the exponential. Our work takes place in the framework of homotopy type theory, and all results are formalized in the proof assistant Agda.</description>

      <title>Totally Disconnected (non-metric) Gelfand Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize those algebras over a disconnected uniformly complete topological field which are representable as algebras of continuous functions on compact topological spaces, generalizing thus Gelfand duality for non-archimedean normed fields (Van der Put theorem). More generally, we establish for any topological field F a (dual) adjunction between the category of compact F-Tychonoff spaces and a natural category of commutative F-algebras, which becomes a duality for fields satisfying the Stone-Weierstrass theorem. To obtain these results we do not utilize analytic tools, but the canonical group uniformity of the field and intrinsic properties of the algebras.</description>
