      <title>Approximate Ricci-flat Metrics for Calabi-Yau Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline a method to determine analytic K\"ahler potentials with associated approximately Ricci-flat K\"ahler metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds. Key ingredients are numerically calculating Ricci-flat K\"ahler potentials via machine learning techniques and fitting the numerical results to Donaldson's Ansatz. We apply this method to the Dwork family of quintic hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^4$ and an analogous one-parameter family of bi-cubic CY hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^2\times\mathbb{P}^2$. In each case, a relatively simple analytic expression is obtained for the approximately Ricci-flat K\"ahler potentials, including the explicit dependence on the complex structure parameter. We find that these K\"ahler potentials only depend on the modulus of the complex structure parameter.</description>

      <title>How to Count States in Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gibbons and Hawking proposed that the Euclidean gravity path integral with periodic boundary conditions in time computes the thermal partition sum of gravity. As a corollary, they argued that a derivative of the associated free energy with respect to the Euclidean time period computes gravitational entropy. Why is this interpretation is correct? That is, why does this path integral compute a trace over the Hilbert space? Here, we show that the quantity computed by the Gibbons-Hawking path integral is equal to an {\it a priori} different object -- an explicit thermal trace over the Hilbert space spanned by states produced by the Euclidean gravity path integral. This follows in two ways: (a) if the Hilbert space with two boundaries factorizes into a product of two single boundary Hilbert spaces, as we have previously shown; and (b) via explicit resolution of the trace by a spanning basis of states. We similarly show how a replicated Euclidean gravity path integral with a single periodic boundary computes a Hilbert space trace of powers of the density matrix, explaining why this approach computes the entropy of states entangled between two universes.</description>

      <title>D-Branes in $\textbf{AdS}_3\times \textbf{S}^3 \times \textbf{S}^3 \times \textbf{S}^1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String theory on $\mathrm{ AdS}_3\times \mathrm{ S}^3 \times \mathrm{ S}^3 \times \mathrm{S}^1$ with two units of NS flux through each of the two $3$-spheres (and one unit of NS flux supporting the $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ factor) was recently argued to be exactly dual to the symmetric orbifold of eight free fermions and two bosons. This setup is interesting since it allows for a simple NS-R description. In this paper we study the spherical D-branes of this theory, and identify them with branes in the dual symmetric orbifold theory. We also comment briefly on the $\mathrm{ AdS}_2$ branes.</description>

      <title>Twisted-Circle Compactifications of SQCD-like Theories and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and analyse holographic duals to a class of four-dimensional N = 1 SU($N_c$) SQCD-like theories compactified on a circle with an R-symmetry twist. The setup originates from type IIB backgrounds previously proposed as duals to SQCD with $N_f$ fundamental flavours. The U(1) R-symmetry is anomaly-free only if $ N_f = 2N_c$. We implement a supersymmetric twisted-circle reduction, holographically realised through a smoothly shrinking $S^1$ fibered over the internal U(1)$_R$ direction. We obtain new regular type IIB supergravity backgrounds that are valid only if the condition $N_f = 2N_c$ is satisfied--mirroring the anomaly cancellation requirement in the field theory. We compute various field-theoretic observables--including the Chern-Simons level, Wilson loop and the holographic central charge--showing the emergence of a 3D ${\cal N} = 2$ gapped phase consistent with a Chern-Simons TQFT. This work highlights the interplay between anomalies, supersymmetry, and geometry in the holographic realisation of compactified gauge theories with fundamental matter.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Symmetries of Yang-Mills Theory in (3+1)-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that classical, non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories coupled to spin-1/2 and spin-0 elementary matter fields, in (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski space-time, possess an exact integrability structure with an infinite number of conserved charges in involution. Such an integrability lives on the space of non-abelian electric and magnetic charges, and is based on flat connections in generalized loop spaces, presenting an R-matrix, and Sklyanin relation. We present two novel symmetries of Yang-Mills theories. The first one corresponds to global transformations generated by the infinity of those conserved charges under the Poisson brackets. The gauge and matter fields, as well as Wilson lines and fluxes have interesting transformation laws under such a global symmetry. The second one corresponds to symmetries of the integral Yang-Mills equations, which lead to the conserved charges. They generate an infinite dimensional group, where the elements are holonomies of connections on the loop space of functions from the circle $S^1$ to the space-time. Our approach certainly applies to the Standard Model of the Fundamental Interactions. The conserved charges are gauge invariant, and so, in the case of QCD they are color singlets, and perhaps are not confined. Therefore, the hadrons may carry such charges. Our results open up the way for the construction of non-perturbative methods for Yang-Mills theories.</description>

      <title>The Komar charge in presence of the Holst term and the gravitational Witten effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first-order formalism, the Einstein--Hilbert action can be modified by the addition of a Holst term multiplied by the Barbero parameter $\alpha$. This modification breaks parity although it does not affect the equations of motion. We show that the standard Komar charge is also modified by the addition of a topological term multiplied by the Barbero parameter $\alpha$. For the Killing vector that generates time translations, the value of the Komar integral at infinity is modified by the addition of a term proportional to the NUT charge $N$ and the parity-breaking Barbero parameter. Thus, as in the standard Witten effect, a non-vanishing NUT charge $N$ induces a non-vanishing mass $\alpha N$.</description>

      <title>Observer Time from Causality in Perturbative Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is unclear whether an observable notion of time exists in quantum gravity even in principle because spacetime itself fluctuates. We propose a form of observable time in perturbative quantum gravity. First, we define an elapsed proper time in curved space using intersections of worldlines and future light cones. Here, time arises from causality via the dependence on light cones. We then propose that performing the gravitational path integral describes quantum gravity corrections to this notion of proper time at all orders in $G_N$. Using this prescription, we compute the leading quantum gravity corrections to two-point correlation functions of elapsed time. We find that the commutators can be nonzero, showing this notion of time is a quantum operator in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>The Carrollian Kaleidoscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Carroll group arises in the vanishing speed of light limit of the Poincar\'{e} group and was initially discarded as just a mathematical curiosity. However, recent developments have proved otherwise. Carroll and conformal Carroll symmetries are now ubiquitous, appearing in diverse physical phenomena starting from condensed matter physics to quantum gravity. This review aims to provide the reader a gateway into this fast-developing field. After an introduction and setting the stage with basics of the symmetry in question, we detail the construction of Carrollian and Carrollian Conformal field theories (CCFT).
  We then focus on applications. By far the most popular of these applications is in the context of the construction of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes (AFS) in terms of a co-dimension one dual CCFT. We review the early work on AFS$_3$ /CCFT$_2$ before delving into an in-depth analysis for the construction of the dual to 4D AFS.
  Two other important sets of applications are in hydrodynamics and in condensed matter physics, which we discuss in detail. Carroll hydrodynamics is introduced as the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics first and then reconstructed from a symmetry based approach. Relations to ultrarelativistic flows and connections to the quark-gluon plasma are discussed with concrete examples of the Bjorken and Gubser flow models. In condensed matter applications, we cover connections to fractons, flat bands, and phase separation in Luttinger liquid models. To conclude, we give very brief outlines of other topics of interest including string theory and black hole horizons.</description>

      <title>Holographic Baryons as Quantum Hall Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a first-principle construction of baryons as quantum Hall droplets in single-flavor holographic QCD. The baryons are described as charged D6-branes with a circular boundary on a flavor D8-brane in the Type IIA backgrounds dual to the confining and non-confining phases. The holographic description allows us to calculate precisely their properties, such as mass and size. We also consider other objects with baryonic charge, such as vortons, domain walls with holes, and "sandwich vortons", and discuss the relative (meta)stability of all these configurations.</description>

      <title>Dislocations and crystallization dynamics of chiral soliton lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocations, as topological defects in crystal lattices, are fundamental to understanding plasticity in materials. Similar periodic structures also arise in continuum field theories, such as chiral soliton lattices (CSLs), which appear in condensed matter systems like chiral magnets and in high-energy contexts such as quantum chromodynamics in strong magnetic field or under rapid rotation. This work investigates whether dislocations can dynamically form within such emergent CSLs. The chiral sine-Gordon model, reduced from the aforementioned examples by certain truncations, is useful to determine the ground state but it cannot describe time evolution, lacks dynamical formation or leads to singular dislocations, because its equations of motion do not contain a topological term. We propose a field-theoretical model including the topological term coupled to external fields resolving these issues by modifying the topological term so it affects the dynamics. Using numerical simulations, we study the real-time formation of CSLs in two and three spatial dimensions. In 2D, edge dislocations emerge spontaneously, guiding soliton growth and later annihilating to leave a stable CSL. In 3D, both edge and screw dislocations form; the latter exhibits helical structure influenced by the external field. We find stable double helical screw dislocations looking like a double helix staircase or DNA. We then demonstrate the formation of helical dislocations and analyze how the external field strength affects CSL density and formation speed. Our results provide a novel theoretical framework for understanding dislocations in solitonic structures, connecting high-energy field theory with materials science phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-loop correction to eleven-dimensional supergravity involves a term $t_8t_8R^4$, with four Riemann tensors. With a suitable UV regularization, this term is expected to reduce to a similar one-loop term present in the type IIA effective action. We show that, while this is indeed the case in the NSNS sector, it fails when one includes the RR fields. Specifically, we identify 4-point couplings involving the dilaton, the graviton and two RR one-forms which lead to amplitudes that disagree with one-loop string amplitudes. We conclude that the eleven-dimensional $R^4$ superinvariant must split into more than one upon dimensional reduction. We give a complete analysis of 4-point terms in eleven dimensions computed from superparticle amplitudes, and show that, again, extra terms involving RR fields arise from these. We also present a simplified form for the 4-point couplings in eleven dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed differential homotopy approach to the analysis of nonlinear higher spin theory is developed. The Ansatz is extended to the form applicable in the second order of the perturbation theory and general star-multiplication formulae are derived. The relation of the shifted homotopy and differential homotopy formalisms is worked out. Projectively-compact spin-local quadratic (anti)holomorphic vertices in the one-form sector of higher-spin equations are obtained within the differential homotopy formalism.</description>

The other phase is non-regular, i.e. there is no clear separation between the gauge and the matter sectors.

      <description>arXiv:2506.16765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermion zero modes of Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield monopole-string-domain wall composites in three spatial dimensions are studied. We analytically solve the Dirac equation and prove the existence of one fermion zero mode. Depending on mass parameters of bosons/fermions in the model, the zero modes are localized either on the monopoles, strings or domain walls, which we call monopole-string-domain wall fermions. We also show that in special cases, the zero modes can be confined within a finite vacuum region in the shape of an arbitrary convex polyhedron, which we call the polyhedral vacuum fermions. Furthermore, we show that fermionic superconducting currents do not generally flow on the host solitons except for the cases that the soliton network consists only of strings and domain walls and has translational symmetry about a spatial axis.</description>

      <title>Integrated correlators of coincident Wilson lines in $SU(N)$ gauge theories at strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two four-dimensional gauge theories with gauge group $SU(N)$: the $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory and the $\mathcal{N}=2$ quiver gauge theory obtained as a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. In this context, we study a novel class of integrated correlators, namely those involving $n$-coincident Wilson lines and two moment map operators of conformal dimension two. By exploiting supersymmetric localization, we obtain exact expressions for these observables valid in the large-$N$ limit. Furthermore, using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we derive their strong coupling expansions.</description>

      <title>The (No) Boundary Proposal and excited states in de Sitter holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the AdS/CFT framework, vacuum and excited states are systematically described by imposing arbitrary Dirichlet boundary conditions at the AdS boundary. Furthermore, there are explicit relations connecting the quantum states to their corresponding dual Euclidean AdS geometries, in line with the Hartle-Hawking (HH) construction. The ground state therefore corresponds to the dominant saddle point under trivial conditions on the asymptotic boundary, which is the exact Euclidean AdS geometry. In contrast, the situation in de Sitter spacetime differs significantly, as there is no natural region analogous to the AdS boundary. Thus, the Hartle Hawking approach precisely defines the ground state as a path integral over smooth (Euclidean) geometries ending on a spatial Cauchy surface, with \textit{no} additional boundary or past singularity, known as the no boundary proposal.
  In this work, we revisit the no boundary proposal to describe excited states within the framework of de Sitter Holography. Specifically, we investigate the possibility of defining a family of excited states by introducing an additional boundary in the Euclidean region and imposing arbitrary Dirichlet boundary conditions on it. As a result, we demonstrate that the computation of $n$ point correlation functions is consistent with the presence of excited states, and furthermore, show that cosmological late-time observables in these states undergo non-trivial modifications. This study may have significant implications for the development of the holographic dictionary for de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the invariance of the Abelian Stueckelberg-like model under gauge and $N=1$ supersymmetric (SUSY) transformations in (3+1) spacetime. We show that the Stueckelberg-like mass term explicitly breaks $N=1$ supersymmetry under the Wess-Zumino (WZ) gauge condition. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the WZ gauge is not needed in order to construct an action independent of compensating fields, manifestly supersymmetric and gauge invariant.</description>

      <title>Cosmographical analysis of sign-switching dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the well-studied $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, we propose and investigate a class of dynamical dark energy models that evolve from a negative cosmological constant, transitioning to a positive value at low redshifts. Specifically, we introduce a dark energy framework based on a generalised ladder-step function for the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we present two additional models in which the cosmological constant undergoes a smooth sign change at a specified redshift. We provide a detailed discussion of the construction and theoretical properties of these models, analysing their background cosmological evolution using a cosmographic approach and the statefinder hierarchy parameters. Our results are compared with those obtained for the standard $\Lambda$CDM and $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM models. We also perform a careful analysis of the types of singularities that may arise in these models due to a sign change in the cosmological constant. Notably, we show that a continuous sign change removes the sudden singularity present in the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, replacing it with a milder $w$-singularity.</description>

      <title>Positional numeral systems over polyadic rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12930v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct positional numeral systems that work natively over nonderived polyadic $\left( m,n\right) $-rings whose addition takes $m$ arguments and multiplication takes $n$. In such rings, the length of an admissible additive word and a multiplicative tower are not arbitrary (as in the binary case), but "quantized". Our main contributions are the following. Existence: every commutative $\left( m,n\right) $-ring admits a base-$p$ place-value expansion that respects the word length constraint in terms of numbers of operation compositions $\ell_{mult}=\ell_{add}(m-1)+1$. Lower bound: the minimum number of digits is greater than or equal to the arity of addition $m$. Representability gap: for $m,n\geq3$ only a proper subset of ring elements possess finite expansions, characterized by congruence-class arity shape invariants $I^{(m)}$ and $J^{(n)}$. Mixed-base "polyadic clocks": allowing a different base at each position enlarges the design space quadratically in the digit count. Catalogues: explicit tables for the integer rings $\mathbb{Z}_{4,3}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{6,5}$ illustrate how ordinary integers lift to distinct polyadic variables. These results lay the groundwork for faster arity-aware arithmetic, exotic coding schemes, and hardware that exploits operations beyond the binary pair.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an error in the proof (but not the truth) of Theorem 3.2 in the author's 1985 paper "The Double-Wedge Algebra for Quantum Fields on Schwarzschild and Minkowski Spacetimes" in "Communications in Mathematical Physics". The author became aware of that error and of how it may be corrected soon after it went to print, and two companion papers published soon afterwards (in Helvetica Physica Acta) refer to an "erratum to appear". This is that erratum. We also take the opportunity to note a few (unrelated and minor) corrections to those two companion papers and also to very briefly mention related more recent work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that there are no scale-invariant one-loop corrections to the superhorizon tensor perturbations from small-scale (potentially enhanced) scalar perturbations, irrespective of the details of inflationary background time evolution. For this purpose we derive a soft tensor effective field theory at leading order in the gradient expansion by integrating out small-scale scalar fluctuations in a general time-dependent background over the Schwinger-Keldysh contour, i.e., we perform loop calculations in the soft limit of external momentum. The absence of scale-invariant corrections originates from the diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity and is therefore unavoidable.</description>

      <title>Charged, rotating black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The asymptotically flat, electrically charged, rotating black holes (BHs) in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMd) theory are known in closed form for \textit{only} two particular values of the dilaton coupling constant $\gamma$: the Einstein-Maxwell coupling ($\gamma=0$), corresponding to the Kerr-Newman (KN) solution, and the Kaluza-Klein coupling ($\gamma=\sqrt{3}$). Rotating solutions with arbitrary $\gamma$ are known only in the slow-rotation or weakly charged limits. In this work, we numerically construct such EMd BHs with arbitrary $\gamma$. We present an overview of the parameter space of the solutions for illustrative values of $\gamma$ together with a study of their basic properties. The solutions are in general KN-like; there are however, new features. The data suggest that the spinning solutions with $0&lt;\gamma&lt;\sqrt{3}$ possess a zero temperature limit, which, albeit regular in terms of curvature invariants, exhibits a $pp$-singularity. A different limiting behaviour is found for $\gamma&gt;\sqrt{3}$, in which case, moreover, we have found hints of BH non-uniqueness for the same global charges.</description>

      <title>Generalized Spectral Statistics in the Kicked Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kicked Ising model has been studied extensively as a model of quantum chaos. Bertini, Kos, and Prosen studied the system in the thermodynamic limit, finding an analytic expression for the spectral form factor, $K(t)$, at the self-dual point with periodic boundary conditions. The spectral form factor is the 2nd moment of the trace of the time evolution operator, and we study the higher moments of this random variable in the kicked Ising model. A previous study of these higher moments by Flack, Bertini, and Prosen showed that, surprisingly, the trace behaves like a real Gaussian random variable when the system has periodic boundary conditions at the self dual point. By contrast, we investigate the model with open boundary conditions at the self dual point and find that the trace of the time evolution operator behaves as a complex Gaussian random variable as expected from random matrix universality based on the circular orthogonal ensemble. This result highlights a surprisingly strong effect of boundary conditions on the statistics of the trace. We also study a generalization of the spectral form factor known as the Loschmidt spectral form factor and present results for different boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Flavor-Dependent Entanglement Entropy in the Veneziano Limit from Light-Front Holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel application of light-front holographic QCD (LFHQCD) to compute the flavor-dependent entanglement entropy of QCD subsystems in the Veneziano limit ($N_c, N_f \to \infty$, $\lambda = N_f / N_c$ fixed), probing quantum correlations in confined and quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phases. Our model extends the soft-wall LFHQCD framework with a lattice-constrained, flavor-modified dilaton potential, $\phi(z) = \kappa^2 z^2 + \lambda \phi_f(z)$, and flavor-specific scalar fields to capture distinct light and heavy quark contributions. Using a Ryu-Takayanagi-like prescription adapted to light-front coordinates, we calculate the entanglement entropy $S_A$ for spatial and flavor subsystems as a function of $\lambda$, temperature $T$, and chemical potential $\mu$. The approach leverages LFHQCD's real-time dynamics to reveal flavor-driven entanglement asymmetries, particularly near confinement/deconfinement transitions. Results are benchmarked against lattice QCD data and linked to heavy-ion collision observables, such as multiplicity fluctuations and two-particle correlations at RHIC and LHC. This work pioneers the study of quantum information in LFHQCD, offering unique insights into QCD's quantum structure and testable predictions for QGP dynamics, distinct from existing holographic models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The naturalness principle has long guided efforts to understand what lies beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, with the hierarchy problem being a prominent example. In this work, we revisit the impact of quantum corrections on the fine-tuning of the low-energy effective theory and its phase structure. For this purpose, we employ the Wilsonian functional renormalization group which conveniently captures both, logarithmic and polynomial, scalings in dimensionful parameters along the flow and allows for an interpretation in terms of critical phenomena. Within this framework, we show that crucial and scheme-independent information about the infrared Higgs phases and the associated quantum phase transition can be directly extracted. We build on the connection between the hierarchy problem and the near-criticality of the Standard Model, identifying a particularly enhanced tuning, and perform a comprehensive and model-independent analysis of the sensitivity to heavy new physics. Finally, we illustrate the versatility of this framework by performing a simplified search for new physics coupled to the Higgs sector which can soften the sensitivity to high-energy scales, rediscovering also the large-anomalous-dimension solution to the hierarchy problem.</description>

      <title>Effects of acceleration on interatomic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Unruh effect establishes a fundamental equivalence between acceleration and thermality by demonstrating that a uniformly accelerated ground-state detector undergoes excitation as if immersed in a thermal bath. In this paper, we investigate how acceleration influences the interaction between two ground-state atoms that are synchronously and uniformly accelerated in vacuum with proper acceleration $a$ and coupled to a fluctuating electromagnetic field. We find that the resulting interaction potential comprises both diagonal components $(\delta E)^{jk}$ with $j=k$, which are present in both inertial and acceleration cases, and off-diagonal components $(\delta E)^{jk}$ with $j\neq k$, which arise exclusively due to acceleration and vanish in the inertial case. The dependence of each component on acceleration and interatomic separation $L$ generally differs. For small accelerations, the leading-order diagonal components of the van der Waals (vdW) and Casimir-Polder (CP) interaction potentials remain unchanged from their inertial counterparts, exhibiting the standard scaling behaviors $\sim L^{-6}$ and $\sim L^{-7}$, respectively. In contrast, the off-diagonal components scale as $\sim a^2L^{-4}$ in the vdW subregions and $\sim a^2L^{-5}$ in the CP subregion. However, when the acceleration becomes sufficiently large, both diagonal and off-diagonal components of the vdW and CP interaction potentials are significantly modified, giving rise to entirely new interaction behaviors that deviate from those observed in the inertial case, whether in vacuum or thermal environments, indicating a breakdown of the acceleration-thermality equivalence established by the Unruh effect for single detectors.</description>

      <title>A Photon Cloud Induced from an Axion Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the axion-photon coupling can lead to quantum stimulated emission of photons and classic exponential amplification of electromagnetic (EM) fields at half the axion mass frequency, when the axion density or the coupling constant is sufficiently large. In this work, we studied the EM photon cloud induced from an axion cloud around a Kerr black hole in the first order of the coupling constant classically. In the presence of a static EM background (like Wald extended solution) valid in realistic astrophysical environment, we found that an EM photon cloud emerges, oscillating at the same frequency as the axion cloud and growing exponentially in accordance with the axion cloud when the superradiant condition for the axion field is satisfied. Notably, the first-order study indicates that this photon cloud exists with no threshold for the coupling constant. The evolution of the EM photon cloud with time and azimuthal angle is obtained analytically while the cross-sectional distribution is solved numerically. Intriguingly, the induced EM field exhibits significantly different symmetries in contrast to the background EM field, which may serve as an indication of the existence of both an axion cloud and axion-photon coupling. Furthermore, in the near horizon region, the induced EM field has some overlap with the photon region as expected.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on Scalar Field--Matter Interaction in Weyl Integrable Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test an analytic cosmological solution within the framework of Weyl Integrable Spacetime using current observational data. In this model, dark energy is described by a pressureless fluid, while a scalar field arises naturally through the definition of the connection. This gravitational theory reveals a Chameleon Mechanism leading to a nonzero interaction between the scalar field and the matter sector. This model extends the standard $\Lambda $CDM cosmology by introducing one additional degree of freedom, allowing for deviations from $\Lambda$CDM dynamics. For the observational constraints we consider the Supernova data of Pantheon+ collaboration, the Cosmic Chronometers, the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillators of DESI DR2 collaboration and the gamma-ray bursts. We find that Weyl Integrable Spacetime fits the data in a better way than the $\Lambda$CDM. When all datasets are considered, the statistical comparison indicates a weak to moderate preference for Weyl Integrable Spacetime according to the Akaike Information Criterion and Jeffrey's scale for the Bayesian evidence.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of open confining strings in the large-Nc limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we conduct a thorough examination of the spectrum of the open confining string in 3+1 dimensions, commonly referred to as the open flux-tube, across various gauge groups of $SU(N_c)$. Our primary objective is to explore its behaviour as we approach the large-$N_c$ limit and the identification of possible world-sheet axion states. Specifically, we undertake a detailed analysis of the associated spectrum for $N_c=3, 4, 5, 6$. This marks the first systematic investigation of the open flux-tube spectrum within the context of the large-$N_c$ limit. More specifically, we analyse the spectra of flux-tubes that form between a static quark-antiquark pair, considering a significant number of radial excitations and eight irreducible representations characterized by the quantum numbers of angular momentum $\Lambda$, charge conjugation and parity $\eta_{CP}$ and the reflection symmetry $\epsilon$ for $\Lambda=0$. To this purpose we employ a diverse set of suitable operators, an anisotropic action, smearing techniques, and solve the generalized eigenvalue problem. We compare our findings with predictions from the Nambu-Goto string model to assess potential tensions indicative of novel phenomena such as the existence of axion-like state along the flux-tube world-sheet. Notably, we provide undoubted evidence of the existence of a massive axion-like particle with the same mass as the corresponding axion extracted within the context of closed flux-tube. This strengthens the conjecture that the axion is a property of the world-sheet of the QCD string.</description>

      <title>Pseudocriticality in antiferromagnetic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak first-order pseudocriticality with approximate scale invariance has been observed in a variety of settings, including the intriguing case of deconfined criticality in 2+1 dimensions. Recently, this has been interpreted as extremely slow flows ("walking behavior") for real-valued couplings in proximity to a bona fide critical point with complex-valued couplings, described by a complex conformal field theory (CFT). Here we study an SU($N$) generalization of the the Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which is a familiar model for deconfined criticality in 2+1 dimensions. We show that in 1+1 dimensions the model is located near a complex CFT, whose proximity can be tuned as a function of $N$. We employ state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo simulations for continuous $N$ along with an improved loop estimator for the R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy based on a nonequilibrium work protocol. These techniques allow us to track the central charge of this model in detail as a function of $N$, where we observe excellent agreement with CFT predictions. Notably, this includes the region $N&gt;2$, where the CFT moves into the complex plane and pseudocritical drifts enable us to recover the real part of the complex central charge with remarkable accuracy. Since the present model with $N=3$ is also equivalent to the spin-1 biquadratic model, our work sheds new light on the dimerized phase of the spin-1 chain, demonstrating that it is pseudocritical and proximate to a complex CFT.</description>

      <title>Multi-partonic interactions, iterated discontinuities and the virtuality expansion in deep inelastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a perturbative model that accounts for the contribution of multi-partonic interactions to collider observables. A key feature of this multi-parton model is that cross sections are organised in terms of building blocks that are separately infrared-finite in virtue of the KLN theorem. We find compact expressions for these building blocks in terms of double discontinuities of Feynman-type integrals obtained by endowing a vacuum graph with additional topological information. The framework is applied to the computation of next-to-leading order structure functions in deep inelastic scattering. We comment on the scale dependence of these structure functions and discuss the possibility of relating them by a scheme change to those computed in the parton model. Finally we lay down next steps for analogous computations for deep inelastic scattering at NNLO and Drell-Yan at NLO.</description>

      <title>One Membrane to Love them all: Tidal deformations of compact objects from the membrane paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tidal deformability is a key observable to test the nature of compact objects in a binary coalescence. Within vacuum General Relativity, the tidal Love numbers of a four-dimensional black hole are strictly zero, while they are non-zero and model-dependent for material objects, matter distributions around black holes, or in alternative theories of gravity. Here, we develop a model-agnostic framework based on the membrane paradigm, where the tidal properties of a spherically symmetric object are encoded in the response of a fictitious membrane in terms of viscosity coefficients. We show that both neutron stars and exotic compact objects (in particular, we provide an explicit example for thin-shell gravastars) are included in this framework, provided that the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients of the membrane have a nontrivial frequency dependence. We derive a general result for the electric and magnetic tidal Love numbers for non-rotating and spherically symmetric compact objects in terms of the viscosity coefficients, discussing their behavior with the compactness of the object, and identifying the conditions for the logarithmic behavior found in previous literature for various ultracompact objects. Finally, we show that the membrane shear viscosity coefficients associated with neutron star models feature novel quasi-universal relations, which depend only mildly on the neutron-star equation of state.</description>

      <title>Theories of the gravity+gauge type in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study theories of the "General Relativity + Yang-Mills" type in 4d spacetime with cosmological constant, focusing on formulations where the basic variables are connections and curvatures (but no metric). We present a new Lagrangian for GR coupled to Yang-Mills, which uses the same kind of variables for both sectors, and has a manifest double-copy structure. This Lagrangian comes in both non-chiral (real) and chiral (complex) versions. The chiral version makes it easy to isolate the self-dual sector. The latter lends itself to a higher-spin (HS) generalization, which combines the HS Self-Dual GR and HS Self-Dual Yang-Mills of Krasnov, Skvortsov and Tran. We then descend from the covariant formulation to lightcone gauge, and construct a cubic-exact lightcone action. For HS Self-Dual Yang-Mills, we solve the lightcone field equations to all orders in perturbation theory. Finally, we discuss the relation between lightcone foliations that share a lightray -- a setup relevant for the scattering problem in the de Sitter static patch. We derive this relation at the linearized level, and argue from causality+symmetry that it cannot receive non-linear corrections. We explore the associated gauge transformations in the non-linear covariant theory.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, first we show that a central Leibniz 2-algebra naturally gives rise to a solution of the Zamolodchikov Tetrahedron equation. Then we introduce the notion of linear 2-racks and show that a linear 2-rack also gives rise to a solution of the Zamolodchikov Tetrahedron equation. We show that a central Leibniz 2-algebra gives rise to a linear 2-rack if the underlying 2-vector space is splittable. Finally we discuss the relation between linear 2-racks and 2-racks, and show that a linear 2-rack gives rise to a 2-rack structure on the group-like category. A concrete example of strict 2-racks is constructed from an action of a strict 2-group.</description>

      <title>A Josephson wormhole in coupled superconducting Yukawa-SYK metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that two Yukawa-SYK models with a weak tunneling contact can have an exotic hybrid superconducting thermofield-double-like state that is holographically dual to a traversable wormhole connecting two black holes with charged scalar hair. The hybrid superconducting thermo-field-double/wormhole state is distinguishable by anomalous scaling of revival oscillations in the fermionic Green's function, but also in a unique Andreev-revival in the anomalous Green's function. The existence of this TFD/wormhole state surprisingly shows that the some quantum critical effects can survive the phase transition to superconductivity. This Andreev-revival is in principle an accessible signature of the transition to the TFD/wormhole phase detectable in the ac-Josephson current.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, quasilocal Brown-York charges are derived that coincide in the large sphere limit with the conserved supertranslation hair and superrotation charges introduced by Hawking, Perry and Strominger in [45, 46]. Given these charges, a general scenario is outlined in which a non-rotating black hole completely evaporates after its collapse due to particle creation effects, whereby a genuine one-way traversable event horizon is never formed, but merely a two-way traversable dynamical (resp. future trapping) horizon. The formation of such a dynamical horizon has the consequence, as is demonstrated, that quasilocal energy transported by the considered charges, and thus information, can continuously escape through the black hole horizon to infinity; a mechanism which, as is argued, could possibly prevent information loss once the black hole formation and evaporation process comes to an end.</description>

Abstract: We study a $U(1)\otimes U(1)$ system coupled to scalar fields. Initially the model is studied in a novel continuum formulation and study of the appropriate diagonalizations is performed. Three models are examined, in two of which the scalar field couples with both gauge fields while in the third one the scalar field couples only to the dark photon. The model is then treated on a space-time lattice. We determine the phase diagram for various values of the kinetic coupling parameter. Then there follows the determination of masses for the scalar fields and the massive gauge fields, as well as the fine structure constants for the massless gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Probing dynamical axion quasiparticles with two-photon correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical axion (quasi) particles are emergent collective excitations in topological magnetic insulators that break parity and time reversal invariance or in Weyl semimetals. They couple to electromagnetism via a topological Chern-Simons term, leading to their decay into two photons. We extend the Weisskopf-Wigner formulation of atomic spontaneous emission to the quantum field theory of dynamical axion quasiparticles, allowing us to obtain the quantum two-photon state emerging from axion decay in real time. This state features \emph{hyperentanglement} in momentum and polarization with a distinct polarization pattern, a consequence of the parity and time reversal breaking of the axion-photon interaction. Polarization aspects of this two-photon state are studied by introducing quantum Stokes operators. Whereas the two-photon quantum state features vanishing \emph{averages} of the degree of polarization and polarization asymmetry, there are non-trivial momentum correlations of the Stokes operators. In particular momentum correlations of the \emph{polarization asymmetry} can be obtained directly from coincident momentum and polarization resolved two photon detection. Correlations of Stokes operators are directly related to momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury-Brown Twiss second order coherences. This relationship suggests two-photon correlations as a direct probe of dynamical axion quasiparticles. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons and other systems where spontaneous emission yield hyperentangled two photon states are recognized, suggesting experimental avenues similar to tests of Bell inequalities to probe dynamical axion quasiparticles with coincident two photon detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy effective description of Weyl semimetals is defined by the axion electrodynamics, which captures the effects arising due to the presence of nodes of opposite chirality in the electronic structure. Here we explore the magnetoelectric response of time-reversal breaking (TRB) Weyl superconductors in the London regime. The influence of the axion contribution leads to an increase in the London penetration depth$-$a behavior that can be anticipated by first considering the photon spectrum of a TRB Weyl semimetal. Moreover, we find that both the Meissner state and the vortex phase feature an interplay between the electric and magnetic fields. This leads to a nonvanishing electromagnetic angular momentum, which we calculate for a number of geometrical configurations.</description>

      <title>GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole binary merger: properties and astrophysical implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting orbital eccentricity in a stellar-mass black-hole merger would point to a non-isolated formation channel. Eccentric binaries can form in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters or active galactic nuclei, or from triple stellar systems in the Galactic field. However, confidently measuring eccentricity is challenging -- short signals from high-mass eccentric mergers can mimic spin-induced precession, making the two effects hard to disentangle. This degeneracy weakens considerably for longer-duration signals. Here, GW200208_222617 provides a rare opportunity. Originating from a relatively low-mass binary with source-frame chirp mass $\sim20$ M$_\odot$, its gravitational-wave signal spanned $\sim14$ orbital cycles in band, with no indication of data quality issues. Previous analyses for quasi-circular binaries found no evidence for spin precession and, multiple subsequent studies found the data to favour an eccentric merger despite notable technical differences. All in all, we believe GW200208_222617 is the black-hole merger event from GWTC-3 with the least ambiguous detection of eccentricity. We present a critical discussion of properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole merger using models of field triples, globular clusters, and active galactic nuclei. We find that if GW200208_222617 was indeed eccentric, its origin is consistent with a field triple or globular cluster. Formation in the inner regions of an active galactic nucleus is disfavoured. The outer regions of such a disk remain a viable origin for GW200208_222617; we demonstrate how future detections of eccentric mergers formed in such environments could be powerful tools for constraining the disk geometry.</description>

      <title>Searching for strongly coupled AdS matter with multi-trace deformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic CFTs admit a dual emergent description in terms of semiclassical general relativity minimally coupled to matter fields. While the gravitational interactions are required to be suppressed by the Planck scale, the matter sector is allowed to interact strongly at the AdS scale. From the perspective of the dual CFT, this requires breaking large-$N$ factorization in certain sectors of the theory. Exactly marginal multi-trace deformations are capable of achieving this while still preserving a consistent large-$N$ limit. We probe the effect of these deformations on the bulk theory by computing the relevant four-point functions in conformal perturbation theory. We find a simple answer in terms of a finite sum of conformal blocks, indicating that the correlators display no bulk-point singularities. This implies that the matter of the bulk theory is made strongly coupled by boundary terms rather than local bulk interactions. Our results suggest that holographic CFTs that describe strongly coupled AdS matter must be isolated points on the CFT landscape or sit infinitely far away on the conformal manifold from conventional holographic CFTs.</description>

      <title>Gravitational instantons and the quality problem of the QCD axion: Facts, speculations, and statements in between</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we critically reanalyze the explicit breaking of the Peccei-Quinn global symmetry -- and the corresponding corrections to the QCD axion potential -- induced by gravity. Specifically, we examine the role of gravitational instantons, which are non-perturbative, finite-action solutions to the Euclidean Einstein equations. These instantons represent topologically nontrivial configurations of spacetime and are analogous to instantons in gauge theory. The amount of symmetry breaking induced by gravitational instantons can be computed in a controlled way within the framework of semi-classical gravity, using 't Hooft operators, in full analogy to the computation of the axion potential arising from QCD small instanton effects. Contrary to previous results in the literature, we find that the effects of gravitational instantons are extremely small and therefore do not give rise to a significant quality problem for the axion solution to the strong CP problem, both within the Standard Model and in beyond-the-Standard-Model scenarios that involve multiple copies of the Standard Model. In conclusion, we argue that, assuming the ultraviolet completion of gravity is weakly coupled, the axion solution to the strong CP problem remains free from any quality issues due to gravity. Along the way, we derive the effective Lagrangian of the QCD axion, including its gravitational coupling.</description>

Abstract: The non-linear $\Sigma$-Model minimally coupled with Maxwell theory in $3+1$ dimensions possesses a topologically non-trivial sector characterized by ``lasagna''-like configurations. We demonstrate that, when a specific quantization condition is met, the associated second-order field equations admit a first-order Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield system. This discloses a hidden $(1+1)$-dimensional supersymmetry with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supercharges. We examine the supersymmetric imprint on the time-dependent regime, with particular emphasis on the transition from integrability to chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a plethora of type-II supergravity solutions featuring AdS factors in their geometries, derived from integrable deformations of coset CFTs. Specifically, we uplift the $\lambda$-deformed models of $SO(4)_k/SO(3)_k$ and $SO(5)_k/SO(4)_k$, including the non-compact version of the latter. Requiring reality for the backgrounds imposes bounds on the deformation parameter. As a result, some of the solutions do not admit non-Abelian T-dual limit.</description>

      <title>Holographic thermal correlators from recursions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We express holographic thermal correlators using a recurrence relation of $\{a_n\}$ at $n\to\infty$, building on recent advances in the connection formula for the Heun equation. We consider two gravitational solutions that correspond to distinct states in different subsectors of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature and density. The first is the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-AdS$_5$ black hole, which has finite entropy at zero temperature, and the second is a charged dilatonic black hole in AdS$_5$, which has zero entropy at zero temperature. In both cases, we perturb the system with a charged scalar field and express the perturbation equation in terms of the Heun equation. We find interesting moving patterns of the poles of the correlators including eigenvalue repulsions. We discuss the relation between the recurrence relation and the Virasoro conformal block as two equivalent approaches to write the connection formula for the Heun equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how certain types of magnetic asymptotically Anti-de Sitter Euclidean wormholes can catalyze the onset of inflation. These wormholes can be embedded as saddle point solutions of General Relativity coupled to the Standard Model, the inflaton being identified with the Higgs particle. Our scenario is based on the assumption that the quantum effective potential for the Higgs turns negative at a certain high energy window, in line with current measured values for the Higgs and Top quark masses. Within our proposal, we can estimate various parameters and physical quantities of interest, in consistency with current observational bounds.</description>

      <title>Quantum aspects of heterotic $G_2$ systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compactifications of the heterotic string, to first order in the $\alpha'$ expansion, on manifolds with integrable $G_2$ structure give rise to three-dimensional ${\cal N} = 1$ supergravity theories that admit Minkowski and AdS ground states. As shown in arXiv:1904.01027, such vacua correspond to critical loci of a real superpotential $W$. We perform a perturbative study around a supersymmetric vacuum of the theory, which confirms that the first order variation of the superpotential, $\delta W$, reproduces the BPS conditions for the system, and furthermore shows that $\delta^2 W=0$ gives the equations for infinitesimal moduli. This allows us to identify a nilpotent differential, and a symplectic pairing, which we use to construct a bicomplex, or a double complex, for the heterotic $G_2$ system. Using this complex, we determine infinitesimal moduli and their obstructions in terms of related cohomology groups. Finally, by interpreting $\delta^2 W$ as an action, we compute the one-loop partition function of the heterotic $G_2$ system and show it can be decomposed into a product of one-loop partition functions of Abelian and non-Abelian instanton gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19324v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently proposed $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The slope of the potential in the inflaton direction is exponentially suppressed at large values of the inflaton field, but the slope of the potential in the axion direction is double-exponentially suppressed. Therefore, the axion field remains nearly massless and practically does not change during inflation. The inflationary trajectory in such models is stable with respect to quantum fluctuations of the axion field. We show that isocurvature perturbations do not feed into the curvature perturbations during inflation, and discuss the possibility of such transfer at the post-inflationary stage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the renormalized expectation value of the stress-energy tensor operator for a quantum scalar field propagating on three-dimensional global anti-de Sitter space-time. The scalar field has general mass and nonminimal coupling to the Ricci scalar curvature, and is subject to Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin boundary conditions at the space-time boundary. We consider both vacuum and thermal states, and explore whether the weak and null energy conditions are satisfied by the quantum stress-energy tensor. We uncover a rather complicated picture: compliance with these two energy conditions depends strongly on the mass and coupling of the scalar field to the curvature, and the boundary conditions applied.</description>

Abstract: We construct, for the first time, a three-family $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam model from rigid intersecting D6-branes on a factorizable $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2')$ orientifold with discrete torsion. The factorizable geometry allows for explicit control over rigid cycles and moduli stabilization. We can break the Pati-Salam gauge symmetry down to the Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetry via the supersymmetry preserving Higgs mechanism, generate the SM fermion masses and mixings, and break the supersymmetry via gaugino condensations in the hidden sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiclassical quantization techniques are unreliable, if the magnitude of the quantum fluctuations becomes comparable with a classical background scale. This is the case, for example, for superstrings at temperatures close to the Hagedorn temperature. Here, we propose a non-standard treatment which aims to extend the semiclassical approach for type-II superstrings to such cases. This allows us to provide a well-posed reformulation of recent computations of the Hagedorn temperature in a large class of confining gauge theories. Along the way, we fill a gap in the literature by proving that the standard semiclassical one-loop partition function of the Green-Schwarz superstring can be made finite, by means of a suitable choice of integration measures, for any background worldsheet in a target spacetime satisfying the (type-IIA) supergravity field equations.</description>

Abstract: Recent Bayesian analyses of heavy ion collision data have established a non-trivial temperature dependence of the shear and bulk viscosity per entropy. Motivated by this, we consider higher derivative corrections to realistic, bottom-up holographic models of quark-gluon plasma based on five-dimensional Einstein-dilaton theories and determine the dilaton potentials in the higher derivative terms by matching the Bayesian analyses. A byproduct of our analysis is the bulk viscosity that follows from the holographic V-QCD theory. Higher derivative corrections when treated perturbatively lead to tension with existing data. We investigate possible resolutions.</description>

      <title>Investigating (Non)-Integrability and Pulsating String in D3-Brane Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the (non)-integrability and chaotic dynamics of classical strings in the background of a D3-brane with a non-commutative parameter, within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Using the Polyakov action, we derive the equations of motion and constraints for pulsating strings and analyze their stability through perturbation theory. In the high-energy limit, the first-order perturbed equation simplifies to the P\"oschl-Teller equation, solvable via associated Legendre or hypergeometric functions, while numerical methods are employed for generic energy values. We demonstrate that the non-commutative parameter enhances chaotic behavior, as evidenced by the Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE). Furthermore, we investigate the integrability of geodesic motion and identify two distinct string modes: captured at and escape to infinity. Finally, we study pulsating strings in the deformed $(AdS_{3} \times S^{2})_{\varkappa}$ background, deriving dispersion relations for both short and long strings.</description>

      <title>Continuous and Discrete Symmetries in a 4D Field-Theoretic Model: Symmetry Operators and Their Algebraic Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism, we show the existence of (i) a couple of off-shell nilpotent (i.e. fermionic) BRST and co-BRST symmetry transformations, and (ii) a full set of non-nilpotent (i.e. bosonic) symmetry transformations for an appropriate Lagrangian density that describes the combined system of the free Abelian 3-form and 1-form gauge theories in the physical four (3 + 1)-dimensions of the flat Minkowskian spacetime. This combined BRST-quantized field-theoretic system is essential for the existence of the off-shell nilpotent co-BRST and non-nilpotent bosonic symmetry transformations in the theory. We concentrate on the full algebraic structures of the above continuous symmetry transformation operators along with a couple of very useful discrete duality symmetry transformation operators existing in our four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) field-theoretic model. We establish the relevance of the algebraic structures, respected by the above discrete and continuous symmetry operators, to the algebraic structures that are obeyed by the de Rham cohomological operators of differential geometry. One of the highlights of our present endeavor is the observation that there are no ``exotic'' fields with the negative kinetic terms in our present 4D field-theoretic example for Hodge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the proposed duality between superstring on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times\mathbb{T}^4$ with pure NS-NS flux and a deformed symmetric orbifold CFT. We extract the residues of 3-point string correlators at their next-to-leading poles, which can be expressed as integrals. Because of picture changing, the integrand is not unique. We make an ansatz for its proper form which linearly combines three different picture choices. On the CFT side, we obtain the corresponding residues by doing a conformal perturbation computation at the second order. The result can also be expressed as integrals, with the integrand being a five point function in the symmetric orbifold theory, which is calculated using covering maps. After unifying the integration variables of the two sides, we find that the two integrands match precisely, due to some novel mathematical identities of covering maps. Our calculation verifies the proposed marginal operator in the dual CFT of superstring on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times\mathbb{T}^4$ and could be generalized to the CFT duals of superstrings on general backgrounds AdS$_3\times X$ with few modifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal two-point functions in holographic CFTs receive contributions from two parts. One part comes from the identity, the stress tensor and multi-stress tensors and constitutes the stress-tensor sector. The other part consists of contributions from double-trace operators. The sum of these two parts must satisfy the KMS condition -- it has to be periodic in Euclidean time. The stress-tensor sector can be computed by analyzing the bulk equations of motions near the AdS boundary and is not periodic by itself. We show that starting from the expression for the stress-tensor sector one can impose the KMS condition to fix the double-trace part, and hence the whole correlator. We perform explicit calculations in the asymptotic approximation, where the stress-tensor sector can be computed exactly. One can either sum over the thermal images of the stress-tensor sector and subtract the singularities or solve for the KMS condition directly and perform the Borel resummation of the resulting double-trace data -- the results are the same.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is expected that when the string coupling is taken to be sufficiently small, a black hole turns into a bound state of self-gravitating fundamental strings. This state would be described by winding strings wrapping around the Euclidean time circle, known as the Horowitz-Polchinski solution. In this paper, we study such a self-gravitating string configuration in two-dimensional dilaton gravity theories. We first derive an analytic expression of the solution describing a winding string in two-dimensions and investigate in detail the geometry of this solution. Our winding string solution in two dimensions describes the geometry near the surface of the bound state of self-gravitating strings in the large-dimension limit, much like a two-dimensional black hole describes the near horizon geometry of the Schwarzschild black hole in the large-dimension limit. To study quantum effects around self-gravitating strings, we obtain an analytic solution of winding strings in the RST model. In a similar fashion to the Hartle-Hawking vacuum around a black hole, our string solution in the RST model contains the background radiation, whose temperature is the same as that of the winding strings.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the tree-level generation of entanglement through some key scattering processes in massless quantum electrodynamics on canonical noncomutative spacetime with space-space type of noncommutativity. The fermions in the noncommutative theory will be zero charge fermions. The scattering processes we shall study do not occur in ordinary Minkowski spacetime. We shall use the concurrence to characterize the amount of entanglement generated through a given scattering process. We shall show that, at tree-level, the concurrence for the scattering of two photons of opposite helicity is given by the same expression as in the case of the scattering of gluons in ordinary Minkowski spacetime. Thus, maximal entanglement is achieved if and only if the polar scattering angle is equal to $\pi/2$. We also compute the concurrence for the head-on collision in the laboratory reference frame of two fermions of opposite helicity to obtain the same result as in the case of photon scattering. Finally, we shall study a type of collision at right angles in the laboratory frame of fermions with opposite helicity. We show that in the latter case the concurrence depends on energy of the incoming fermions, the noncommutativity matrix $\theta^{ij}$, the polar, $\theta$, and azimuth angle, $\phi$, of the zero-momentum frame of the incoming fermions. In this latter case we see that when $\theta=\pi/2$ there are values of $\phi$ for which no entanglement is generated.</description>

      <title>Nonassociative geometry of nonholonomic phase spaces with star R-flux string deformations and (non) symmetric metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.01320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on nonassociative differential geometry of phase spaces endowed with nonholonomic (non-integrable) distributions and frames, nonlinear and linear connections, symmetric and nonsymmetric metrics, and correspondingly adapted quasi-Hopf algebra structures. The approach is based on the concept of nonassociative star product introduced for describing closed strings moving in a constant R-flux background. Generalized Moyal-Weyl deformations are considered when, for nonassociative and noncommutative terms of star deformations, there are used nonholonomic frames (bases) instead of local partial derivatives. In such modified nonassociative and nonholonomic spacetimes and associated complex/ real phase spaces, the coefficients of geometric and physical objects depend both on base spacetime coordinates and conventional (co) fiber velocity/ momentum variables like in (non) commutative Finsler-Lagrange-Hamilton geometry. For nonassociative and (non) commutative phase spaces modelled as total spaces of (co) tangent bundles on Lorentz manifolds enabled with star products and nonholonomic frames, we consider associated nonlinear connection, N-connection, structures determining conventional horizontal and (co) vertical (for instance, 4+4) splitting of dimensions and N-adapted decompositions of fundamental geometric objects. There are defined and computed in abstract geometric and N-adapted coefficient forms the torsion, curvature and Ricci tensors. We extend certain methods of nonholonomic geometry in order to construct R-flux deformations of vacuum Einstein equations for the case of N-adapted linear connections and symmetric and nonsymmetric metric structures.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping entanglement in quantum spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the bootstrap method, a technique that relies on consistency relations instead of direct diagonalization, to determine the expectation values in quantum many-body systems. We then use these values to assess the entanglement content of the system. Our work extends the bootstrap approach to quantum many-body systems, rather than single-body or few-body systems, concentrating on the well-known Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model with both transverse and longitudinal external magnetic fields. In the bootstrap method we solve the LMG model with up to 16 sites. Unlike previous studies that have focused mainly on ground-state properties, our methodology allows for the calculation of a broad range of properties, including energy spectrum, angular momentum, concurrence, tangle, residual tangle, and quantum Fisher information (QFI), for all eigenstates or a particular sector of the eigenstates, without referring to the explicit wavefunctions of these states. We show that this approach offers not only a new computational methodology but also a comprehensive view of both bipartite and multipartite entanglement properties across the entire spectrum of eigenstates. Specifically, we demonstrate that states typically found in the central region of the spectrum exhibit greater multipartite entanglement, as indicated by larger QFI values, compared to states at the edges of the spectrum. In contrast, concurrence displays the opposite trend. This observed behavior is in line with the monogamy principle governing quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Spin-2 Green's Functions on Kerr in Radiation Gauge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct retarded and advanced Green's functions for gravitational perturbations in Kerr in an ingoing radiation gauge. Our Green's functions have a frequency domain piece that has previously been obtained by Ori [Phys. Rev. D 67 (2003)] based on the Chrzanowski-Cohen-Kegeles metric reconstruction method. As is well known, this piece by itself is not sufficient to obtain an actual Green's function. We show how to complete it with a piece based on a method by Green et al. [Class. Quant. Grav. 37 (2020)]. The completion piece has a completely explicit form in the time-domain and is supported on pairs of points on the same outgoing principal null geodesic which are in the appropriate causal order. We expect our Green's functions to be useful for gravitational self-force calculations and other perturbation problems on Kerr spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the expansion of the universe can create particles. However, due to ambiguities when defining particles during the expansion, there are still debates about how to choose vacuum and particle states. To clarify how particles are produced in an expanding universe, we study the creation of real scalar particles in flat FLRW spacetimes by using a recently developed equal-time Wigner formalism. By comparing this quantum kinetic formalism with the standard Bogoliubov approach, we make a natural definition of a particle number in terms of kinetic phase-space functions, which we then compare with common adiabatic particle numbers. With inspiration from flat spacetime QED, we perform numerical calculations and discuss the interpretation of the particle numbers in terms of a hypothetical switch-off in the expansion rate. Finally, we consider how this interpretation is affected by regularization.</description>

      <title>Vortex wall phase in fractonic XY-plaquette model on square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The XY-plaquette model is the most straightforward lattice realization of a broad class of fractonic field theories that host quasiparticles with restricted mobility. The plaquette interaction appears naturally as a ring-exchange term in the low-energy description of exciton Bose liquids, cold atomic gases, and quantum dimer models. Using first-principle Monte Carlo simulations, we study the phase diagram and the vortex dynamics in the XY-plaquette model on a square lattice in two spatial dimensions. In its minimal formulation, the model contains a ring-exchange plaquette term in two spatial dimensions and a standard XY-link term in the (imaginary) time direction. We show that the phase diagram of the minimal XY-plaquette model possesses two phases: (i) a disordered vortex-dominated phase in which a single percolating vortex trajectory occupies the whole 3d spacetime; (ii) a partially disordered phase in which the vortices become partially immobile, with their worldlines strictly confined to one or several infinite two-dimensional planes. The spatial positions and spatial orientations (along $x$ or $y$ axis) of these vortex domain walls appear to be spontaneous. Individual vortices form a disordered system within each vortex domain wall, so the fractal spacetime dimension of vortex trajectories approaches $D_f = 2$. We argue that the appearance of the vortex walls could be interpreted as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of a global internal symmetry in the compact XY-plaquette model.</description>

      <title>Boundary choices and one-loop complex gravitational path integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The path integral of 4D Einstein-Hilbert gravity for the de Sitter-like Universe with fluctuations is investigated, and the transition amplitude from one boundary configuration to another is computed. The gravitational system is described by lapse, scale factor and metric-fluctuation field. Variational consistency demands augmenting the bulk theory with suitable boundary action. A given boundary choice on scale factor is seen to be achievable via an infinite family of covariant boundary actions, each restricting the boundary choices for the fluctuation field. General covariance intimately ties the two boundary choices, which no longer can be chosen independently. For vanishing metric fluctuations at the boundaries, the gauge-fixed gravitational path integral disintegrates into path integral over scale factor and metric-fluctuation field, connected via only lapse integration. While the former is exactly doable, the latter is computed up to one loop, leading to one-loop corrected lapse action. Ultraviolet (UV) divergences are systematically extracted and removed by the addition of suitable counterterms, leading to finite effective action for the lapse. The lapse effective action is then utilized for computing finite transition amplitude. Contributions from virtual gravitons are seen to be secularly growing with Universe size, leading to an infrared divergent transition amplitude. The presence of nonvanishing metric fluctuation at the boundaries implies that the ``no-boundary'' saddles of the theory without metric fluctuations are no longer the saddles of the one-loop corrected action. The corrected saddles have the Universe starting from a nonzero size.</description>

      <title>Static spheres and Aschenbach effect for black holes in massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the trajectories of massive and massless particles in four dimensional static and spherically symmetric black holes in de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity theory via phase-plane analysis and point out several novel features. In particular, we show the existence of a static sphere, a finite radial distance outside the black holes in these theories, where a massive particle can be at rest, as seen by an asymptotic zero angular momentum observer. Topological arguments show that the stable and unstable static spheres, which come in pairs, have opposite charges. In the presence of angular momentum, we first study the behaviour of massless particles and find the presence of stable and unstable photon spheres in both neutral and charged black holes. Subsequently, we study the motion of massive test particles around these black holes, and find one pair of stable and unstable time-like circular orbits (TCOs), such that the stable and unstable TCO's are disconnected in certain regions. Computing the angular velocity $\Omega_{\text{\tiny CO}}$ of the TCOs, measured by a static observer at rest, shows the unusual nature of its monotonic increase with the radius of TCO, near the location of stable photon sphere. This confirms the existence of Aschenbach effect for spherically symmetric black holes in massive gravity, which was only found to exist in rapidly spinning black holes, with the only other exception being the rare example of gravity coupled to quasi-topological electromagnetism.</description>

Abstract: We consider near-horizon collisions between two particles moving freely in the Schwarzschild metric in the region outside the horizon. One of them emerges from a white hole. We scrutiny when such a process can lead to the indefinitely large growth of the energy in the center of mass frame in the point of collision. We also trace how the kinematics of collision manifests itself in preserving the principle of kinematic censorship according to which the energy released in any event of collision cannot be literally infinite. According to this principle, the energy released in any event of collision, must remain finite although it can be made as large as one likes. Also, we find that particle decay near the singularity leads to unbounded release of energy independently of its initial value.</description>

Abstract: We study radiation by a fast particle in a medium with a finite chiral chemical potential. The medium's anomalous response encompasses the chiral magnetic effect, enabling novel chiral Cherenkov and pair production processes. The kinematics of the corresponding cascades is fundamentally different from conventional cascades. Notably, it is not dominated by the strong ordering of momenta. Employing the effective Chern-Simons extensions of QED and QCD to incorporate the chiral magnetic effect, we derive and solve the evolution equations describing the cascades in a chiral medium, presuming that the anomalous contributions are dominant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalizing quantum chromodynamics (QCD) from three to arbitrarily many color degrees of freedom suggests that baryons can be described as solitons in an effective meson theory whose interaction strength decreases with the number of colors. The exact form of that theory is unknown, but at low energies chiral symmetry and its breaking are considered as the construction recipes for modeling the theory. The Skyrmion is a static, localized solution in a non-linear field theory for pions and it is the most prominent version of a soliton in a chirally symmetric meson theory. Upon quantization it reproduces the spectrum of the low-lying baryons and their static properties reasonably well. Extending that theory by vector mesons improves on the agreement between predicted and empirical data. Chiral solitons within models for the quark flavor dynamics facilitate the investigation of nucleon structure functions. Here we provide a pedagogical overview of these facets.</description>

      <title>Bouncing completion of eternal inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a purely kinematical argument, the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin (BGV) theorem states that any maximal space-time with average positive expansion is geodesically incomplete, hence past eternal inflation would be necessarily singular. Recently, discussions about the broadness of this theorem have been resurfaced by applying it to new models and/or challenging the space-time maximality hypothesis. In the present work, we use reference frames of non co-moving observers and their kinematical properties in order to inquire into the nature of such possible singular beginnings. Using the spatially flat de Sitter (dS) space-time as a laboratory, this approach allows us to exhaust all possibilities bounded by the BGV theorem in the case of general spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometries. We show that either there exists a scalar or parallelly propagated curvature singularity, or the space-time must be past asymptotically dS (with a definite non-zero limit of the Hubble parameter when the scale factor becomes null, hence excluding certain cyclic models) in order to be extensible. We are able to present this local extension without violating the null energy condition, and we show that this extension must contain a bounce. This is a mathematical result based on purely kinematical arguments and intuition. The possible physical realization of such extensions are also discussed. As a side product, we present a new chart that covers all de Sitter space-time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01744v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An alternative method to invert the Radon transforms without the use of Courant-Hilbert's identities has been proposed and developed independently from the space dimension. For the universal representation of inverse Radon transform, we study the consequences of inhomogeneity of outset function without the restrictions on the angular Radon coordinates. We show that this inhomogeneity yields a natural evidence for the presence of the extra contributions in the case of the full angular region. In addition, if the outset function is well-localized in the space, we demonstrate that the corresponding boundary conditions and the angular restrictions should be applied for both the direct and inverse Radon transforms. Besides, we relate the angular restrictions on the Radon variable to the boundary exclusion of outset function and its Radon image.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applying the holographic 2-flavor Einstein--Maxwell-dilaton model, the parameters of which are fixed by lattice QCD, we extract the equations of state for hot quark--gluon plasma around the critical point at T=182 MeV, and have corresponding quark star cores constructed. By further adding hadron shells, the mass range of the whole stars spans from 2 to 17 solar masses, with the maximum compactness around 0.22. This result allows them to be black hole mimickers and candidates for gap events. The I--Love--Q--C relations are also analyzed, which show consistency with the neutron star cases when the discontinuity at the quark--hadron interface is not large. Furthermore, we illustrate the full parameter maps of the energy density and pressure as functions of the temperature and chemical potential and discuss the constant thermal conductivity case supposing a heat source inside.</description>

      <title>Construction of Metaplectic Representations of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}_{2^n})$ and Twisted Magnetic Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitary metaplectic representations of the group $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}_{2^n})$ are necessary to describe the evolution of $2^n$-dimensional quantum systems, such as systems involving $n$ qubits. It is shown that in order for the metaplectic property to be fulfilled, an increase in the dimensionality of the involved $n$-qubit Hilbert spaces, from $2^n$ to $2^{2n}$, is necessary. Thus we construct the general matrix form of such representations based on the magnetic translations of the diagonal subgroup $HW_{2^n} \otimes HW_{2^n}$. Comparisson with other approaches on this problem of the literature are discussed.</description>

      <title>Black hole/de Sitter as the fastest transmitter/receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress on the black hole information paradox has reproduced the Page curve as required by the unitary evolution of the black hole entanglement entropy. In this Letter, we will argue that, the quantum speed limit on how fast a quantum system can evolve unitarily, when saturating the maximal information transmission bounds (Pendry's bound and Bremermann-Bekenstein bound), will slow down the would-be divergent rate of dynamical black hole entropy decreasing at the very end of the Hawking evaporation, during which the Penrose inequality from cosmic censorship conjecture is exactly saturated. Therefore, an evaporating Schwarzschild black hole is the fastest transmitter of information in nature. Further applying the Bremermann-Bekenstein bound on the de Sitter entanglement entropy exactly reproduces the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture, indicating that the would-be-ended inflating de Sitter space is the fastest receiver of information in nature.</description>

      <title>The Primakoff effect: The Axion-Photon Mixing in the Context of Stellar Plasma Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose in this work the study of the production of axions in stellar plasma medium through an external magnetic field. In the background field approximation, we can show that the presence of the external magnetic field induces a mixing between the photon and the axion, i.e. the so called Primakoff effect. Since the axion is one of the greatest candidates for dark matter, for being a neutral pseudo-scalar field, the Primakoff process constitutes a mechanism (or portal) to access the dark sector, which in turn provides us new perspectives beyond the standard model. In the high energies limit, observables like probabilities transitions and particles production rates were computed.</description>

      <title>Radon Transforms and the SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work on the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, we consider the effect of Radon or X-ray transformations, on the Laplace eigenfunctions in hyperbolic Bolyai-Lobachevsky space. We show that the Radon map from this space to Lorentzian-signature Anti-de Sitter or de Sitter space is easier to interpret if we use the Poincare disc model and eigenfunctions rather than the upper-half-plane model. In particular, this version of the transform reveals the geometric origin of the boundary conditions imposed on the eigenfunctions that are involved in calculating the SYK four-point function.</description>

      <title>Black hole photon ring beyond General Relativity: an integrable parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the shape of the photon ring in black holes images has been argued to provide a sharp test of the Kerr hypothesis for future black hole imaging missions. In this work, we confront this proposal to beyond Kerr geometries and investigate the degeneracy in the estimations of the black hole parameters using the circlipse shape proposed by Gralla and Lupsasca. To that end, we consider a model-independent parametrization of the deviations to the Kerr black hole geometry, dubbed Kerr off shell (KOS), which preserves the fundamental symmetry structure of Kerr known as the Killing tower. Besides exhibiting a Killing tensor and thus a Carter-like constant, all the representants of this family also possess a Killing-Yano tensor and are of Petrov type D. The allowed deviations to Kerr, selected by the symmetry, are encoded in two free functions which depend respectively on the radial and polar angle coordinates. Using the symmetries, we provide an analytic study of the radial and polar motion of photon trajectories generating the critical curve, to which the subrings composing the photon ring converge. This allows us to derive a ready-to-use closed formula for the parametric critical curve in term of the free functions parametrizing the deviations to Kerr. Using this result, we confront the circlipse fitting function to four examples of Kerr-like objects and we show that it admits a high degree of degeneracy. At a given inclination, the same circlipse can fit both a Kerr black hole of a given mass and spin $(M,a)$ or a modified rotating black hole with different mass and spin parameters $(M,a)$ and a new parameter $\alpha$. Therefore, future tests of the Kerr hypothesis could be achieved only provided one can measure independently the mass and spin of the black hole to break this degeneracy.</description>
