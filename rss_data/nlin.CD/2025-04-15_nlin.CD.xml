      <title>Universality, Robustness, and Limits of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) underpins much of our modern understanding of the thermalization of closed quantum many-body systems. Here, we investigate the statistical properties of observables in the eigenbasis of the Lindbladian operator of a Markovian open quantum system. We demonstrate the validity of a Lindbladian ETH ansatz through extensive numerical simulations of several physical models. To highlight the robustness of Lindbladian ETH, we consider what we dub the dilute-click regime of the model, in which one postselects only quantum trajectories with a finite fraction of quantum jumps. The average dynamics are generated by a non-trace-preserving Liouvillian, and we show that the Lindbladian ETH ansatz still holds in this case. On the other hand, the no-click limit is a singular point at which the Lindbladian reduces to a doubled non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and Lindbladian ETH breaks down.</description>

      <title>Geodesic vortex detection on curved surfaces: Analyzing the 2002 austral stratospheric polar vortex warming event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geodesic vortex detection is a tool in nonlinear dynamical systems to objectively identify transient vortices with flow-invariant boundaries that defy the typical deformation found in 2-d turbulence. Initially formulated for flows on the Euclidean plane with Cartesian coordinates, we have extended this technique to flows on 2-d Riemannian manifolds with arbitrary coordinates. This extension required the further formulation of the concept of objectivity on manifolds. Moreover, a recently proposed birth-and-death vortex framing algorithm, based on geodesic detection, has been adapted to address the limited temporal validity of 2-d motion in otherwise 3-d flows, like those found in the Earth's stratosphere. With these adaptations, we focused on the Lagrangian, i.e., kinematic, aspects of the austral stratospheric polar vortex during the exceptional sudden warming event of 2002, which resulted in the vortex splitting. This study involved applying geodesic vortex detection to isentropic winds from reanalysis data. We provide a detailed analysis of the vortex's life cycle, covering its birth, the splitting process, and its eventual death. In addition, we offer new kinematic insights into ozone depletion within the vortex.</description>

      <title>Optimization hardness constrains ecological transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living systems operate far from equilibrium, yet few general frameworks provide global bounds on biological transients. In high-dimensional biological networks like ecosystems, long transients arise from the separate timescales of interactions within versus among subcommunities. Here, we use tools from computational complexity theory to frame equilibration in complex ecosystems as the process of solving an analogue optimization problem. We show that functional redundancies among species in an ecosystem produce difficult, ill-conditioned problems, which physically manifest as transient chaos. We find that the recent success of dimensionality reduction methods in describing ecological dynamics arises due to preconditioning, in which fast relaxation decouples from slow solving timescales. In evolutionary simulations, we show that selection for steady-state species diversity produces ill-conditioning, an effect quantifiable using scaling relations originally derived for numerical analysis of complex optimization problems. Our results demonstrate the physical toll of computational constraints on biological dynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic limit in learning period three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08825v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A continuous one-dimensional map with period three includes all periods. This raises the following question: Can we obtain any types of periodic orbits solely by learning three data points? In this paper, we report the answer to be yes. Considering a random neural network in its thermodynamic limit, we first show that almost all learned periods are unstable, and each network has its own characteristic attractors (which can even be untrained ones). The latently acquired dynamics, which are unstable within the trained network, serve as a foundation for the diversity of characteristic attractors and may even lead to the emergence of attractors of all periods after learning. When the neural network interpolation is quadratic, a universal post-learning bifurcation scenario appears, which is consistent with a topological conjugacy between the trained network and the classical logistic map. In addition to universality, we explore specific properties of certain networks, including the singular behavior of the scale of weight at the infinite limit, the finite-size effects, and the symmetry in learning period three.</description>

      <title>Chaos in violent relaxation dynamics. Disentangling micro- and macro-chaos in numerical experiments of dissipationless collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Violent relaxation (VR) is often regarded as the mechanism leading stellar systems to collisionless meta equilibrium via rapid changes in the collective potential. We investigate the role of chaotic instabilities on single particle orbits in leading to nearly-invariant phase-space distributions, aiming at disentangling it from the chaos induced by collective oscillations in the self-consistent potential. We explore as function of the systems size (i.e. number of particles $N$) the chaoticity in terms of the largest Lyapunov exponent of test trajectories in a simplified model of gravitational cold collapse, mimicking a $N-$body calculation via a time dependent smooth potential and a noise-friction process accounting for the discreteness effects. A new numerical method to evaluate effective Lyapunov exponents for stochastic models is presented and tested. We find that the evolution of the phase-space of independent trajectories reproduces rather well what observed in self-consistent $N-$body simulations of dissipationless collapses. The chaoticity of test orbits rapidly decreases with $N$ for particles that remain weakly bounded in the model potential, while it decreases with different power laws for more bound orbits, consistently with what observed in previous self-consistent $N$-body simulations. The largest Lyapunov exponents of ensembles of orbits starting from initial conditions uniformly sampling the accessible phase-space are somewhat constant for $N\lesssim 10^9$, while decreases towards the continuum limit with a power-law trend. Moreover, our numerical results appear to confirm the trend of a specific formulation of dynamical entropy and its relation with Lyapunov time scales.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Dynamics and Universality of 4D Quantum Vortices and Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of quantum vortices provides critical insights into non-equilibrium dynamics across diverse physical systems. While previous research has focused on point-like vortices in two dimensions and line-like vortices in three dimensions, quantum vortices in four spatial dimensions are expected to take the form of extended vortex surfaces, thereby fundamentally enriching dynamics. Here, we conduct a comprehensive numerical study of 4D quantum vortices and turbulence. Using a special visualization method, we discovered the decay of topological numbers that does not exist in low dimensions, as well as the high-dimensional counterpart of the vortex reconnection process. We further explore quench dynamics across phase transitions in four dimensions and verify the applicability of the higher-dimensional Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Our simulations provide numerical evidence of 4D quantum turbulence, characterized by universal power-law behavior. These findings reveal universal principles governing topological defects in higher dimensions, offering insights for future experimental realizations using synthetic dimensions.</description>
