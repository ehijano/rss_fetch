      <title>Comprehensive Assessment of $\mathrm{Th}^{3+}$ Properties for Nuclear Clock and Fundamental Physics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing singles, doubles, and triples excitations within the relativistic coupled-cluster framework, we perform comprehensive calculations of a wide range of atomic properties for the Th$^{3+}$ ion. These properties are essential for advancing nuclear clock technology and probing fundamental physics. Combining our isotope shift parameters with experimental data, we estimate highly accurate values of the differential nuclear charge radii for $^{232,229}$Th and $^{229m,229}$Th. Additionally, we determine the nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments for both the ground and isomeric states of $^{229}$Th by combining measured hyperfine structure constants with our theoretical calculations. Our precise evaluations of electric dipole polarizabilities and hyperfine-induced quadrupole moments are critical for assessing systematic uncertainties in $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$-based nuclear clock. Notably, we observe unexpectedly significant contributions from higher-order relativistic effects and excitations involving orbitals with higher angular momentum, which markedly influence the energies of the ground state and its fine-structure partner. These results highlight the substantial challenges in achieving highly accurate predictions for these properties.</description>

      <title>Wavelengths and Energy Levels of Neutral Manganese (Mn I) Determined Using High-Resolution Fourier Transform and Grating Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extensive analysis of the spectrum of neutral manganese has been performed using spectra of manganese-neon and manganese-argon hollow cathode discharges measured using high resolution Fourier transform (FT) and grating spectroscopy over the range 151 - 5112 nm (1956 - 65876 cm-1). Wavelengths for 10426 spectral lines were extracted from the FT spectra, with uncertainties at least an order-of-magnitude lower than previous measurements. Wavelengths for 13397 lines from new grating spectra were determined for spectral regions beyond the FT spectra range or to provide wavelengths for weak transitions not observed in FT spectra. To aid in level identification, selected, previously published grating lines were included in the energy level optimisation, but no levels in this work relied solely on previously published wavelengths. In total, 24237 lines were included in the final spectral linelist, and these were used to identify 2186 Mn I transitions. These classified spectral lines were then used to optimise the values of 384 previously published energy levels of Mn I, with typical uncertainties of a few 10-3 cm-1, again typically an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy. Our study then expanded the known energy level structure of Mn I through the establishment of 18 new energy levels, reported here for the first time. In total, 2187 lines and 402 energy levels of Mn I have been determined as a result of our work, marking a substantial advance in the precision of Mn I atomic data which will enable far more accurate analyses of Mn I lines in astrophysical spectra.
  Please note: The final wavelength and energy level datasets are withheld from this pre-print to ensure that only the peer-reviewed, definitive versions are released. This approach prevents the propagation of duplicate or inconsistent data across widely used atomic databases and modelling frameworks.</description>

      <title>First ionization potentials of Cr, Mo, and W calculated with SHCI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and performance of future fusion power plants will depend on accurate atomic data for plasma-facing material and plasma impurity species. A leading candidate for the plasma-facing material is tungsten due to its high melting point, however, the energy levels and wavefunctions of high-Z atoms with many electrons (e.g. 30 or more), including tungsten, are difficult to calculate with high accuracy. Gaps and large uncertainties in atomic data for tungsten introduce design and performance uncertainties for a fusion power plant. Specifically, improved atomic data for ionization potential, excited state energies, and collisional excitation rates are needed for the low charge states of atomic tungsten. We aim to address these shortcomings by using the semistochastic heat-bath configuration interaction (SHCI) method, which nearly exactly calculates the energies that can be determined at higher cost with the full configuration interaction. Adding well-motivated approximations to SHCI, including orbital optimization and effective core potentials, we demonstrate good agreement between our calculated first ionization potentials and the best available experimental values for chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten. The efficiency and accuracy achieved in calculating these ionization potentials demonstrates that our SHCI workflow can yield improved electron structure data for ions with many electrons, suggesting that the method could also be useful for collisional processes, such as state-selective charge exchange reactions and electron impact ionization.</description>

      <title>Study of ground state electronic structure of XH$^+$ (X : Cd, Hg and Yb) molecular ions via coupled-cluster approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work reports the spectroscopic parameters and molecular properties for the ground electronic state, $^1\Sigma^+$, of CdH$^+$, HgH$^{+}$, and YbH$^{+}$ molecular ions. We have used the state-of-the-art relativistic coupled cluster method together with the relativistic core-valence triple- and quadruple zeta quality basis sets for the calculation of structural parameters. The computed results have been extrapolated to the complete basis set limit using a two-point polynomial fit. The reliability of the results has been confirmed by their remarkable agreement with existing experimental and theoretical values. Further, we have calculated the relevant vibrational parameters by solving the vibrational Schr\"odinger equation using the potential energy curve and the permanent dipole moment curve of the electronic ground state. Subsequently, the lifetimes of the vibrational states have been determined by calculating the spontaneous and black-body radiation (BBR) induced transition rates. At room temperature, the lifetimes of the lowest ro-vibrational state ($v$ = \(0\), $J$ = \(0\)) due to BBR-induced transitions are estimated to be \(98.48\)\,s for CdH$^+$, \(204.85\)\,s for HgH$^+$, and \(1250.28\)\,s for YbH$^+$. Additionally, the rotational energies within each vibrational state are also calculated in this work.</description>

      <title>Time series learning in a many-body Rydberg system with emergent collective nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interacting Rydberg atoms constitute a versatile platform for the realization of non-equilibrium states of matter. Close to phase transitions, they respond collectively to external perturbations, which can be harnessed for technological applications in the domain of quantum metrology and sensing. Owing to the controllable complexity and straightforward interpretability of Rydberg atoms, we can observe and tune the emergent collective nonlinearity. Here, we investigate the application of an interacting Rydberg vapour for the purpose of time series prediction. The vapour is driven by a laser field whose Rabi frequency is modulated in order to input the time series. We find that close to a non-equilibrium phase transition, where collective effects are amplified, the capability of the system to learn the input becomes enhanced. This is reflected in an increase of the accuracy with which future values of the time series can be predicted. Using the Lorenz time series and temperature data as examples, our work demonstrates how emergent phenomena enhance the capability of noisy many-body quantum systems for data processing and forecasting.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic study of mixed lithium halides solid state electrolytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium halides with the general formula Li$_x$M$_y$X$_6$, where M indicates transition metal ions and X halide anions are very actively studied as solid-state electrolytes, because of relatively low cost, high stability and Li conductivity. The structure and properties of these halide-based solid electrolytes (HSE) can be tuned by alloying, e.g. using different halides and/or transition metals simultaneously. The large chemical space is difficult to sample by experiments, making simulations based on broadly applicable machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) a promising approach to elucidate structure-property relations, and facilitate the design of better-performing compositions. Here we focus on the Li$_3$YCl$_{6x}$Br$_{6(1-x)}$ system, for which reliable experimental data exists, and use the recently-developed PET-MAD universal MLIP to investigate the structure of the alloy, the interplay of crystalline lattice, volume and chemical composition, and its effect on Li conductivity. We find that the distribution of Cl and Br atoms is only weakly correlated, and that the primary effect of alloying is to modulate the lattice parameter -- although it can also trigger transition between different lattice symmetries. By comparing constant-volume and constant-pressure simulations, we disentangle the effect of lattice parameter and chemical composition on the conductivity, finding that the two effects compensate each other, reducing the overall dependency of conductivity on alloy composition. We also study the effect of Y-In metal substitution finding a small increase in the conductivity for the C2/m phase at 25\% In content, and an overall higher conductivity for the P$\bar{3}$m1 phase.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Variation of the QCD Interaction Scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07266v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laboratory and astrophysical tests of ''constant variation'' have so far concentrated on the dimensionless fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and on the electron or quark mass ratios $X_{e,q}=m_{e,q}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$, treating the QCD scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ as unchangeable. Certain beyond Standard Model frameworks, most notably those with a dark matter or dark energy scalar field $\phi$ coupling with the gluon field, would make $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ itself time dependent while leaving $\alpha$ and the electron mass untouched. Under the minimal assumption that this gluonic channel is the sole $\phi$ interaction, we recast state-of-the-art atomic clock comparisons into $\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}=(3.2 \pm 3.5) \times 10^{-17} \ \text{yr}^{-1}$ limits, translate the isotope yields of the 1.8-Gyr-old Oklo natural reactor into a complementary geophysical limit of $|\delta\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;2\times10^{-9}$ over that time span, corresponding to the linear drift limit $|\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;1\times10^{-18} \text{yr}^{-1}$, and show that the proposed $8.4$ eV $^{229}$Th nuclear clock would amplify a putative $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ drift by four orders of magnitude compared with present atomic clocks. We also obtain constraints from quasar absorption spectra and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis data.</description>

      <title>Structural effects of boron doping in diamond crystals for gamma-ray light-source applications: Insights from molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boron-doped diamond crystals (BDD, C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$) exhibit exceptional mechanical strength, electronic tunability, and resistance to radiation damage. This makes them promising materials for use in gamma-ray crystal-based light sources. To better understand and quantify the structural distortions introduced by doping, which are critical for maintaining channelling efficiency, we perform atomistic-level molecular dynamics simulations on periodic C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$ systems of various sizes. These simulations allow the influence of boron concentration on the lattice constant and the (110) and (100) inter-planar distances to be evaluated over the concentration range from pure diamond (0%) to 5% boron at room temperature (300 K). Linear relationships between both lattice constant and inter-planar distance with increasing dopant concentration are observed, with a deviation from Vegard's Law. This deviation is larger than that reported by other theoretical and computational studies; however, this may be attributed to an enhanced crystal quality over these studies, a vital aspect when considering gamma-ray crystal light source design. The methodology presented here incorporates several refinements to closely reflect the conditions of microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition (MPCVD) crystal growth. Validation of the methodology is provided through a comprehensive statistical analysis of the structure of our generated crystals. These results enable reliable atomistic modelling of doped diamond crystals and support their use in the design and fabrication of periodically bent structures for next-generation gamma-ray light source technologies.</description>
