      <title>Stochastic fluctuations and the relaxation time in transient relativistic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the ratio between the shear viscosity and the shear relaxation time, $\eta/\tau_\pi$, should be defined as a thermodynamic quantity obtained from the equal-time symmetric correlator of the shear-stress tensor. In kinetic theory, we show that this ratio does not depend on the type of interaction. Similarly, an exact expression for this ratio is obtained for holographic gauge theories. We also determine how stochastic fluctuations change $\eta/\tau_\pi$ in transient relativistic hydrodynamics and show that thermal fluctuations do not spoil causality and stability.</description>

      <title>Impact of reactor neutrino uncertainties on coherent scattering's discovery potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear power reactors are the most intense man-made source of antineutrino's and have long been recognized as promising sources for coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) studies. Its observation and the spectral shape of the associated recoil spectrum is sensitive to a variety of exotic new physics scenarios and many experimental efforts are underway. Within the context of the reactor antineutrino anomaly, which initially indicated eV-scale sterile neutrino's, the modeling of the reactor antineutrino spectrum has seen a significant evolution in the last decade. Even so, uncertainties remain due to a variety of nuclear structure effects, incomplete information in nuclear databases and fission dynamics complexities. Here, we investigate the effects of these uncertainties on one's ability to accurately distinguish new physics signals. For the scenarios discussed here, we find that reactor spectral uncertainties are similar in magnitude to the projected sensitivities pointing towards a need for $\beta$ spectroscopy measurements below the inverse $\beta$ decay threshold.</description>

      <title>Multipole modes of excitation in tetrahedrally deformed neutron-rich Zr isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multipole modes of excitation for tetrahedrally deformed neutron-rich Zr isotopes are investigated using the quasiparticle finite amplitude method based on the covariant density functional theories. By employing the density-dependent point-coupling covariant density functional theory with the parameter set DD-PC1 in the particle-hole channel and a separable pairing interaction of finite range, it is observed that a distinct peak emerges at $\omega = 9.0 - 10.0$ MeV in the isoscalar quadrupole $K=0$ strength when $\beta_{32}$ distortion is considered for $^{110,112}$Zr. This peak is absent when the deformation is limited to axially symmetric octuple or spherical case. It also does not appears in neighboring axially quadrople or octupole deformed nuclei, thus can be viewed as an indicator for the tetrahedral shape.</description>

      <title>Short-range correlation and Urca process in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of high-momentum correlated neutron-proton pairs at JLab suggest that the dense nucleonic component of the compact stars contain a fraction of high-momentum neutron-proton pairs that is not accounted in the familiar Fermi-liquid theory of the neutron-proton fluid mixture. We compute the rate of the Urca process in compact stars taking into the non-Fermi liquid contributions to the proton's spectral widths induced by short-range correlations. The Urca rate differs strongly from the Fermi-liquid prediction at low temperatures, in particular, the high threshold on the proton fraction precluding the Urca process in neutron stars is is lifted. This observation may have a profound impact on the theories of cooling of compact stars.</description>

      <title>Monopole Excitation and Nuclear Compressibility: Present and Future Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isoscalar giant resonances are nuclear collective excitations associated with the oscillation in phase of protons and neutrons according to a certain multipolarity $L$. In particular, the isoscalar giant monopole resonance ($L=0$) is the strongest nuclear compression mode, and its excitation energy is directly related to the compression modulus for finite nuclei. Typically, microscopic calculations are utilized to establish a relationship between the experimental compression modulus and the nuclear incompressibility that is a crucial parameter of the equation of state for nuclear matter. The incompressibility of nuclear matter has been determined with an accuracy of 10 to 20\% using relativistic and non-relativistic microscopic models for describing the monopole distributions in ${}^{208}$Pb and ${}^{90}$Zr isotopes. However, the same theoretical models are not able to describe data for open-shell nuclei, such as those of tin and cadmium isotopes. In fact, only effective interactions with a softer nuclear-matter incompressibility are able to predict the centroid energy of monopole distributions for open-shell nuclei. An unified description of the monopole resonance in ${}^{208}$Pb and other open-shell nuclei remains unsolved from the theory side. Most of this uncertainty is due to our poor knowledge of the symmetry energy, which is another essential component of the equation of state of nuclear matter. Therefore, new experimental data along isotopic chains covering a wide range in $N/Z$ ratios, including neutron-deficient and neutron-rich nuclei, are of paramount importance for determining both the nuclear-matter incompressibility and the symmetry energy more precisely.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the nuclear magnetic octupole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear magnetic octupole moment is revisited as a potentially useful observable for nuclear structure studies. The magnetic octupole moment, $\Omega$, is examined in terms of the nuclear collective model including weak and strong coupling. Single-particle formulation is additionally considered in the overall comparison of theoretical predictions with available experimental data. Mirror nuclei symmetry is examined in terms of the magnetic octupole moment isoscalar and isovector terms. A full list of predictions for $\Omega$ of odd-proton and odd-neutron nuclei in medium-heavy mass regimes of the nuclear chart is produced aiming at providing starting values for future experimental endeavors.</description>

      <title>$^{242m}$Am isomer yield in $^{243}$Am$(n, 2n)$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reaction 243 Am (n, 2n) populates the T of 16 hours ground state 242 g Am with J of 1 or the 242 m Am isomer state J of 5 with T of 141 years. The former state 242 g Am mostly beta decays to 242 Cm, or transmutes to 242 Pu via electron capture. The absolute yield of 242 g Am is compatible with the measured data, estimated by the alpha activity of 242 Cm by Norris in 1983. The branching ratio defined by the ratio of the populations of the lowest intrinsic states of 242 Am. Calculated yields of ground 242 g Am and isomer 242 m Am states of the residual nucleus 242 Am are used to predict the relative yield of isomer. These populations defined by the gamma decay of the excited states, described by the standard kinetic equation. The ordering of the low and high spin states is different in case of 236 Np and 242 Am nuclei, that explains different shapes of relative yields near the (n, 2n) reaction threshold, though the excitation energy dependences are similar. Data of 243 Am (n, F) at 5 MeV and 15 MeV by Drapchinsky in 2004, support calculated 243Am (n,xnf) prefission neutron contribution to prompt fission neutron spectra and calculated exclusive neutron spectra of 243 Am (n, 2n) feeding the 242 g Am and isomer 242 m Am states.</description>

Abstract: We present the findings of a study based on a new inelastic electron-scattering experiment on the ${}^{12}\mathrm{C}$ nucleus focusing on the kinematic region of $Q^2=0.8\,\mathrm{GeV}^2/{c}^2$. The measured cross section is sensitive to the transverse response function and provides a stringent test of theoretical models, as well as of the theoretical assumptions made in Monte-Carlo event-generator codes developed for the interpretation of neutrino-nucleus experiments, such as DUNE and HyperK. We find that modern generators such as GENIE and GiBUU reproduce our new experimental data within 10$\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies to solve nuclear structure problems using quantum computers rely on a quantum algorithm known as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). In this study, we calculate the correlation energy in Helium-6 using VQE, with a \textit{full-term} unitary-paired-coupled-cluster-doubles (UpCCD) ansatz on a quantum computer simulator and implement a set of custom termination criteria to shorten the optimization time. Using this setup, we test out noisy quantum computer simulators of various coherence times and quantum errors to find the required specification for such calculations. We also look into the contribution of errors from the quantum computers and optimization process. We find that the minimal specification of 5~ms coherence times and $10^{-4}$ quantum errors is required to reliably reproduce state-vector results within 8\% discrepancy. Our study indicates the possibility of performing VQE calculations using a full-term UpCCD ansatz on a slightly noisy quantum computer, without implementing quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Scale setting and hadronic properties in light quark sector with $(2+1)$-flavor Wilson fermions at the physical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report scale setting and hadronic properties for our new lattice QCD gauge configuration set (HAL-conf-2023). We employ $(2+1)$-flavor nonperturbatively improved Wilson fermions with stout smearing and the Iwasaki gauge action on a $96^4$ lattice, and generate configurations of 8,000 trajectories at the physical point. We show the basic properties of the configurations such as the plaquette value, topological charge distribution and their auto-correlation times. The scale setting is performed by detailed analyses of the $\Omega$ baryon mass. We calculate the physical results of quark masses, decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons and single hadron spectra in light quark sector. The masses of the stable hadrons are found to agree with the experimental values within a sub-percent level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a particle production mechanism analogous to the particle photoproduction processes, arising from the gluon-nucleon interactions in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The comparison is made on the effect of the gluon-nucleon interactions on the photon production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$2.76 TeV. The numerical results indicate that as the collision energy increases, the contribution of gluon-nucleon interactions becomes more prominent.</description>

      <title>Study of hybrid stars with nonstrange quark matter cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, under the hypothesis that quark matter may not be strange [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 222001 (2018)], we adopt a modification of the coupling constant of the four-quark scalar interaction $G\rightarrow G_1+G_2\langle\bar{\psi}\psi\rangle$ in the 2-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model to study nonstrange hybrid stars. According to lattice QCD simulation results of the critical temperature at zero chemical potential, $G_1$ and $G_2$ are constrained as $G_1\in(1.935, 1.972)$ GeV$^{-2}$, and $G_2\in(-1.582, -0.743)$ GeV$^{-5}$, respectively. To obtain hybrid equation of states, the Maxwell construction is used to describe the first-order confinement-deconfinement phase transition in hybrid stars. With recent measurements on neutron star mass, radius, and tidal deformability, the hybrid equation of states are constrained. The result suggests that pure nonstrange quark matter cores can exist in hybrid stars, possessing 0.014-0.026 solar mass with the bag constant $B^{1/4}$ in a range of 148-161 MeV. It is argued that the binary neutron stars in GW170817 should be hadron stars.</description>

      <title>Two-center harmonic oscillator basis for Skyrme-DFT calculations (I): formalism and Proof of Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new method to solve the nuclear density functional theory (DFT) equations using a two-center harmonic oscillator basis, incorporating pairing and Coulomb interactions. The goal is to efficiently determine the fission and fusion configurations in nuclei. The Coulomb exchange terms are evaluated exactly, allowing for a novel approach to neck formation without the Slater approximation, which has been commonly used in space coordinate-based approaches. The new method has been implemented in the code {\sc hfodd}, enabling direct comparison with standard one-center solutions. This first paper focuses on deriving and implementing a methodology based on stable, precise, and exact applications of harmonic oscillator bases for the two fragments, which can either overlap or be separated by arbitrarily large distances. The implementation is tested on two proof-of-principle examples using light nuclei, specifically $^8$Be and $^{24}$Mg.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic isovector form factors of the transition from the $N^*(1520)$ to the nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dispersion theory is used to provide a model-independent low-energy representation of the three electromagnetic isovector transition form factors $N^{*}(1520)\to N$. At low energies the virtual photon couples dominantly to a pion pair. Taking the very well understood pion vector form factor and pion re-scattering into consideration, the determination of the transition form factors is traced back to the determination of pion-baryon scattering amplitudes. Their low-energy aspects are parametrized by baryon exchange, accounting for the main decay channels of the $N^*(1520)$. Short-distance physics is encoded in subtraction constants that are fitted to data on space-like form factors and hadronic decays. It is shown that a limitation in the determination of the subtraction constants lies in the fact that isovector form factors require sufficient information about the differences between protons and neutrons. In particular, this calls for improvements in the form factor extraction from the electroproduction of the $N^*(1520)$ on the neutron. Via the dispersion relations, space- and time-like regions are naturally connected from first principles. This allows to predict the time-like form factors that enter the Dalitz decays $N^*(1520)\to N e^- e^+$ and $N^*(1520)\to N \mu^- \mu^+$. Under the assumption of the dominance of the isovector over the isoscalar channel, the Dalitz decay distributions are predicted.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational form factors (GFFs) of a hadron encode fundamental aspects of its structure, including its shape and size as defined from e.g., its energy density. This work presents a determination of the flavor decomposition of the GFFs of the proton from lattice QCD, in the kinematic region $0\leq -t\leq 2~\text{GeV}^2$. The decomposition into up-, down-, strange-quark, and gluon contributions provides first-principles constraints on the role of each constituent in generating key proton structure observables, such as its mechanical radius, mass radius, and $D$-term.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gluon Distribution for Quarkonium Dynamics in Strongly Coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the generalized gluon distribution that governs the dynamics of quarkonium inside a non-Abelian thermal plasma characterizing its dissociation and recombination rates. This gluon distribution can be written in terms of a correlation function of two chromoelectric fields connected by an adjoint Wilson line. We formulate and calculate this object in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at strong coupling using the AdS/CFT correspondence, allowing for a nonzero center-of-mass velocity $v$ of the heavy quark pair relative to the medium. The effect of a moving medium on the dynamics of the heavy quark pair is described by the simple substitution $T \to \sqrt{\gamma} \, T$ in agreement with previous calculations of other observables at strong coupling, where $T$ is the temperature of the plasma in its rest frame, and $\gamma = (1 - v^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz boost factor. Such a velocity dependence can be important when the quarkonium momentum is larger than its mass. Contrary to general expectations for open quantum systems weakly coupled with large thermal environments, the contributions to the transition rates that are usually thought of as the leading ones in Markovian descriptions vanish in this strongly coupled plasma. This calls for new theoretical developments to assess the effects of strongly coupled non-Abelian plasmas on in-medium quarkonium dynamics. Finally, we compare our results with those from weakly coupled QCD, and find that the QCD result moves toward the $\mathcal{N}=4$ strongly coupled result as the coupling constant is increased within the regime of applicability of perturbation theory. This behavior makes it even more pressing to develop a non-Markovian description of quarkonium in-medium dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Assuming that the number densities of heavy flavor in hadron gas and in QGP are same at $T_c$, we obtain the effective mass of heavy quark at $T_c$ from the comparison with the hadron resonance gas model which well describes particle yield in heavy-ion collisions. We find that charm quark mass at vanishing baryon chemical potential is around 1.8 GeV which is much heavier than QCD bare mass and close to $D$ meson mass. The mass slightly increases with increasing baryon chemical potential and then decreases. On the other hand, anticharm quark mass constantly decreases with increasing baryon chemical potential. Bottom quark mass has a similar pattern. Extending the hadron resonance gas model to a bit higher temperature beyond $T_c$, the effective masses of charm and bottom quarks decrease with increasing temperature.</description>

      <title>Unraveling hydrodynamization using ultracold 1D gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum evolution of 1D Bose gases immediately after several variants of high-energy quenches, both experimentally and theoretically. Using the advantages conveyed by the relative simplicity of these nearly integrable many-body systems, we are able to differentiate the behavior of two distinct but often temporally overlapping processes, hydrodynamization and local prethermalization. There is a universal character to our findings, which can be applied to the short-time behavior of any interacting many-body quantum system after a sudden high-energy quench. We specifically discuss its potential relevance to heavy-ion collisions.</description>
