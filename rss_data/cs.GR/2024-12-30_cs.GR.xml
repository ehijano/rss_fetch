      <title>Tuning Nonlinear Elastic Materials under Small and Large Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computer graphics and engineering, nonlinear elastic material properties of 3D volumetric solids are typically adjusted by selecting a material family, such as St. Venant Kirchhoff, Linear Corotational, (Stable) Neo-Hookean, Ogden, etc., and then selecting the values of the specific parameters for that family, such as the Lame parameters, Ogden exponents, or whatever the parameterization of a particular family may be. However, the relationships between those parameter values, and visually intuitive material properties such as object's "stiffness", volume preservation, or the "amount of nonlinearity", are less clear and can be tedious to tune. For an arbitrary isotropic hyperelastic energy density function psi that is not parameterized in terms of the Lame parameters, it is not even clear what the Lame parameters and Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are. Starting from psi, we first give a concise definition of Lame parameters, and therefore Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. Second, we give a method to adjust the object's three salient properties, namely two small-deformation properties (overall "stiffness", and amount of volume preservation, prescribed by object's Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio), and one large-deformation property (material nonlinearity). We do this in a manner whereby each of these three properties is decoupled from the other two properties, and can therefore be set independently. This permits a new ability, namely "normalization" of materials: starting from two distinct materials, we can "normalize" them so that they have the same small deformation properties, or the same large-deformation nonlinearity behavior, or both. Furthermore, our analysis produced a useful theoretical result, namely it establishes that Linear Corotational materials (arguably the most widely used materials in computer graphics) are the simplest possible nonlinear materials.</description>

      <title>STITCH: Surface reconstrucTion using Implicit neural representations with Topology Constraints and persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present STITCH, a novel approach for neural implicit surface reconstruction of a sparse and irregularly spaced point cloud while enforcing topological constraints (such as having a single connected component). We develop a new differentiable framework based on persistent homology to formulate topological loss terms that enforce the prior of a single 2-manifold object. Our method demonstrates excellent performance in preserving the topology of complex 3D geometries, evident through both visual and empirical comparisons. We supplement this with a theoretical analysis, and provably show that optimizing the loss with stochastic (sub)gradient descent leads to convergence and enables reconstructing shapes with a single connected component. Our approach showcases the integration of differentiable topological data analysis tools for implicit surface reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Adrenaline: Adaptive Rendering Optimization System for Scalable Cloud Gaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud gaming requires a low-latency network connection, making it a prime candidate for being hosted at the network edge. However, an edge server is provisioned with a fixed compute capacity, causing an issue for multi-user service and resulting in users having to wait before they can play when the server is occupied. In this work, we present a new insight that when a user's network condition results in use of lossy compression, the end-to-end visual quality more degrades for frames of high rendering quality, wasting the server's computing resources. We leverage this observation to build Adrenaline, a new system which adaptively optimizes the game rendering qualities by considering the user-side visual quality and server-side rendering cost. The rendering quality optimization of Adrenaline is done via a scoring mechanism quantifying the effectiveness of server resource usage on the user-side gaming quality. Our open-sourced implementation of Adrenaline demonstrates easy integration with modern game engines. In our evaluations, Adrenaline achieves up to 24% higher service quality and 2x more users served with the same resource footprint compared to other baselines.</description>

      <title>CAD-GPT: Synthesising CAD Construction Sequence with Spatial Reasoning-Enhanced Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) significantly enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and innovation of design processes by enabling precise 2D and 3D modeling, extensive analysis, and optimization. Existing methods for creating CAD models rely on latent vectors or point clouds, which are difficult to obtain and costly to store. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have inspired researchers to use natural language instructions and images for CAD model construction. However, these models still struggle with inferring accurate 3D spatial location and orientation, leading to inaccuracies in determining the spatial 3D starting points and extrusion directions for constructing geometries. This work introduces CAD-GPT, a CAD synthesis method with spatial reasoning-enhanced MLLM that takes either a single image or a textual description as input. To achieve precise spatial inference, our approach introduces a 3D Modeling Spatial Mechanism. This method maps 3D spatial positions and 3D sketch plane rotation angles into a 1D linguistic feature space using a specialized spatial unfolding mechanism, while discretizing 2D sketch coordinates into an appropriate planar space to enable precise determination of spatial starting position, sketch orientation, and 2D sketch coordinate translations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAD-GPT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in CAD model synthesis, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>
