      <title>An Improved High-order Adaptive Mesh Refinement Framework for Shock-turbulence Interaction Problems based on cell-centered finite difference schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a high-order finite-difference adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework for robust simulation of shock-turbulence interaction problems. A staggered-grid arrangement, in which solution points are stored at cell centers instead of at the vertices, is presented to address the boundary conservation issues encountered in previous studies. The key ingredient in the AMR framework, i.e., the high-order nonlinear interpolation method applied in the prolongation step together with the determination of fine-grid boundary conditions, are re-derived for staggered grids following the procedures in prior work [1] and are thus used here. Meanwhile, a high-order restriction method is developed in the present study as the coarse and fine grid solutions are non-collocated in this configuration. To avoid non-conservative interpolation at discontinuous cells that could incur instabilities, a hybrid interpolation strategy is proposed in this work for the first time, where the non-conservative WENO interpolation is applied in smooth regions whereas the second-order conservative interpolation is applied at shocks. This significantly mitigates the numerical instabilities introduced by non-conservative interpolation and pointwise replacement. The two interpolation approaches are seamlessly coupled through a troubled-cell detector achieved by a scale-irrelevant Riemann solver in a robust way. The present work is developed on a publicly available block-structured adaptive mesh refinement framework AMReX [2]. The canonical tests demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of accurately resolving a wide range of complex shock-turbulence interaction problems that have been proven intricate for existing approaches</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Simulacra AI's Quantum Accurate Synthetic Data Generation for Chemical Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we benchmark \simulacra's synthetic data generation pipeline against a state-of-the-art Microsoft pipeline on a dataset of small to large systems. By analyzing the energy quality, autocorrelation times, and effective sample size, our findings show that Simulacra's Large Wavefunction Models (LWM) pipeline, paired with state-of-the-art Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) sampling algorithms, reduces data generation costs by 15-50x, while maintaining parity in energy accuracy, and 2-3x compared to traditional CCSD methods on the scale of amino acids. This enables the creation of affordable, large-scale \textit{ab-initio} datasets, accelerating AI-driven optimization and discovery in the pharmaceutical industry and beyond. Our improvements are based on a novel and proprietary sampling scheme called Replica Exchange with Langevin Adaptive eXploration (RELAX).</description>

      <title>Toward fast, accurate and robust AI prediction of ground states in rotating BEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an unsupervised deep learning approach for computing the ground state (GS) of rotating Bose-Einstein condensation. To minimize the energy under a mass constraint, our approach introduces two key and novel ingredients: a normalized loss function that exactly enforces the mass constraint, and a training strategy named virtual rotation acceleration that is essential for avoiding local minima and guiding the learning process to the correct quantized vortex phase. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the proposed approach as an effective and accurate method to predict GS across physical conditions--from slow to fast rotation and from isotropic to anisotropic confinement. Through further distillation, we establish a unified operator network capable of efficiently generalizing physical parameters across different phases. It enables rapid GS predictions while correctly capturing phase transitions and is applied for inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Optimization of Multi-Parameter Micromixers Using a Scientific Machine Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multidimensional optimization has consistently been a critical challenge in engineering. However, traditional simulation-based optimization methods have long been plagued by significant limitations: they are typically capable of optimizing only a single problem at a time and require substantial computational time for meshing and numerical simulation. This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging cutting-edge Scientific Machine Learning (Sci-ML) methodologies to overcome these inherent drawbacks of conventional approaches. The proposed method provides instantaneous solutions to a spectrum of complex, multidimensional optimization problems. A micromixer case study is employed to demonstrate this methodology. An agent, operating on a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture, serves as the optimizer to explore the relationships between key problem parameters. This optimizer interacts with an environment constituted by a parametric Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), which responds to the agent's actions at a significantly higher speed than traditional numerical methods. The agent's objective, conditioned on the Schmidt number is to discover the optimal geometric and physical parameters that maximize the micromixer's efficiency. After training the agent across a wide range of Schmidt numbers, we analyzed the resulting optimal designs. Across this entire spectrum, the achieved efficiency was consistently greater than the baseline, normalized value. The maximum efficiency occurred at a Schmidt number of 13.3, demonstrating an improvement of approximately 32%. Finally, a comparative analysis with a Genetic Algorithm was conducted under equivalent conditions to underscore the advantages of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Fast Direct Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey describes a class of methods known as "fast direct solvers". These algorithms address the problem of solving a system of linear equations $\boldsymbol{Ax}=\boldsymbol{b}$ arising from the discretization of either an elliptic PDE or of an associated integral equation. The matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ will be sparse when the PDE is discretized directly, and dense when an integral equation formulation is used. In either case, industry practice for large scale problems has for decades been to use iterative solvers such as multigrid, GMRES, or conjugate gradients. A direct solver, in contrast, builds an approximation to the inverse of $\boldsymbol{A}$, or alternatively, an easily invertible factorization (e.g. LU or Cholesky). A major development in numerical analysis in the last couple of decades has been the emergence of algorithms for constructing such factorizations or performing such inversions in linear or close to linear time. Such methods must necessarily exploit that the matrix $\boldsymbol{A}^{-1}$ is "data-sparse", typically in the sense that it can be tessellated into blocks that have low numerical rank. This survey provides a unifying context to both sparse and dense fast direct solvers, introduces key concepts with a minimum of notational overhead, and provides guidance to help a user determine the best method to use for a given application.</description>

      <title>Fill the gaps: continuous in time interpolation of fluid dynamical simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible and accurate interpolation schemes using machine learning could be of great benefit for many use-cases in numerical simulations and post-processing, such as temporal upsampling or storage reduction. In this work, we adapt the physics-informed token transformer (PITT) network for multi-channel data and couple it with Fourier neural operator (FNO). The resulting PITT FNO network is trained for interpolation tasks on a dataset governed by the Euler equations. We compare the performance of our machine learning model with a linear interpolation baseline and show that it requires $\sim6-10$ times less data to achieve the same mean square error of the interpolated quantities. Additionally, PITT FNO has excellent mass and energy conservation as a result of its physics-informed nature. We further discuss the ability of the network to recover fine detail using a spectral analysis. Our results suggest that loss of fine details is related to the decreasing correlation time of the data with increasing Fourier mode which cannot be resolved by simply increasing Fourier mode truncation in FNO.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning interatomic potential for AlN for epitaxial simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A machine learned interatomic potential for AlN was developed using the ultra-fast force field (UF3) methodology. A strong agreement with density functional theory calculations in predicting key structural and mechanical properties, including lattice constants, elastic constants, cohesive energy, and surface energies has been demonstrated. The potential was also shown to accurately reproduce the experimentally observed atomic core structure of edge dislocations. Most significantly, it reproduced the experimentally observed wurtzite crystal structure in the overlayer during homoepitaxial growth of AlN on wurtzite AlN, something that prior potentials failed to achieve. Additionally, the potential reproduced the experimentally observed layer-by-layer growth mode in the epilayer. The combination of accuracy, transferability, and computational speed afforded by the UF3 framework thus makes large-scale, atomistic simulations of epitaxial growth of AlN feasible.</description>

      <title>Quantum annealing for lattice models with competing long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use superconducting qubit quantum annealing devices to determine the ground state of Ising models with algebraically decaying competing long-range interactions in the thermodynamic limit. This is enabled by a unit-cell-based optimization scheme, in which the finite optimizations on each unit cell are performed using commercial quantum annealing hardware. To demonstrate the capabilities of the approach, we choose three exemplary problems relevant for other quantum simulation platforms and material science: (i) the calculation of devil's staircases of magnetization plateaux of the long-range Ising model in a longitudinal field on the triangular lattice, motivated by atomic and molecular quantum simulators; (ii) the evaluation of the ground state of the same model on the Kagome lattice in the absence of a field, motivated by artificial spin ice metamaterials; (iii) the study of models with additional few-nearest-neighbor interactions relevant for frustrated Ising compounds with potential long-range interactions. The approach discussed in this work provides a useful and realistic application of existing quantum annealing technology, applicable across many research areas in which lattice problems with resummable long-range interactions are relevant.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Dynamics of Roughness-Driven Flow in Soft Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft lubricated contacts exhibit complex interfacial behaviours governed by the coupled effects of multiscale surface roughness and non-linear fluid-solid interactions. Accurately capturing this interplay across thin-film flows is challenging due to the strong synergy between contact mechanics and hydrodynamic flow, spanning over various spatiotemporal scales. Here, we develop a rigorous computational framework to simulate the frictional behaviour of soft lubricated interfaces; its modularity and the use of optimal solvers provides solutions for realistic configurations in lubrication regimes ranging from direct solid contact to complete fluid separation. Surface roughness is described via Persson's statistical theory as well as a deterministic Conjugate Gradient with Fast Fourier Transform (CG-FFT) approach, while limitations associated with classical half-space models are addressed by developing the Reduced Stiffness Method (RSM) to rigorously model pressure-induced surface responses. The integrated framework captures the full evolution of frictional behaviour, validated against experiments on rough elastomer-glass interfaces, revealing how surface roughness and material compliance together drive the transition from solid contact to fluid-mediated sliding. The developed approach establishes a robust and versatile simulation tool for analysing a plethora of soft interfacial systems shaped by fluid-solid interactions, with potential applications including but not limited to biomechanics, soft robotics and microfluidic systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Collision Algorithms in DSMC for Rarefied Gas Dynamics: Markovian NTC-Pre-Scan and Bernoulli-Trial Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The collision process is essential to the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, as it incorporates the fundamental principles of the Boltzmann and Kac stochastic equations. A series of collision algorithms, known as the Bernoulli-trials (BT) family schemes, have been proposed based on the Kac stochastic equation. The primary impetus of this paper is to rectify a long-standing theoretical flaw in the widely used no-time-counter (NTC) collision algorithm. We demonstrate that the standard NTC scheme is fundamentally non-Markovian, relying on a fixed majorant product that introduces a system 'memory' and leads to inaccuracies at low particle counts. We propose a new algorithm, NTC-Pre-Scan, which transforms the scheme into a fully Markovian process. When the repeated collisions are not crucial, our new NTC scheme, called NTC-Pre-Scan, could work accurately with a very low number of particles per cell (PPC), average PPC&lt;1, i.e., PPC=0.01, which means with several empty cells in simulations. This contrasts with the standard NTC schemes, which typically require a PPC greater than 1. Then, a systematic evaluation of different BT-based collision partner selection schemes, including the simplified Bernoulli trials (SBT), generalized Bernoulli trials (GBT), symmetrized and simplified Bernoulli trials (SSBT), and the newly proposed symmetrized and generalized Bernoulli trials (SGBT), is conducted to treat some benchmark rarefied gas dynamics problems. The results show that the BT-based collision algorithms and NTC-Pre-scan successfully maintain the collision frequency as the number of particles per cell decreases.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport in nitrogen-doped nanoporous graphenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bottom-up on-surface synthesized nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), realized as 2D arrays of laterally covalently bonded $\pi$-conjugated graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), are a family of carbon nanomaterials that are receiving increasing attention for nanoelectronics and biosensing. Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG (hNPG) is synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and non-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic structure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and even carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the transport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most applications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, the quantum transport properties of hNPGs are studied. It is found that injected carriers in hNPG spread laterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place exclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). A simple model is proposed to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in hNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement and anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, it is found that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer precision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.</description>

      <title>Common Task Framework For a Critical Evaluation of Scientific Machine Learning Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is transforming modeling and control in the physical, engineering, and biological sciences. However, rapid development has outpaced the creation of standardized, objective benchmarks - leading to weak baselines, reporting bias, and inconsistent evaluations across methods. This undermines reproducibility, misguides resource allocation, and obscures scientific progress. To address this, we propose a Common Task Framework (CTF) for scientific machine learning. The CTF features a curated set of datasets and task-specific metrics spanning forecasting, state reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints, including noise and limited data. Inspired by the success of CTFs in fields like natural language processing and computer vision, our framework provides a structured, rigorous foundation for head-to-head evaluation of diverse algorithms. As a first step, we benchmark methods on two canonical nonlinear systems: Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Lorenz. These results illustrate the utility of the CTF in revealing method strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific classes of problems and diverse objectives. Next, we are launching a competition around a global real world sea surface temperature dataset with a true holdout dataset to foster community engagement. Our long-term vision is to replace ad hoc comparisons with standardized evaluations on hidden test sets that raise the bar for rigor and reproducibility in scientific ML.</description>

      <title>All-Altermagnetic Tunnel Junction of RuO2/NiF2/RuO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emerging altermagnets offer a promising avenue for spintronics, yet their integration into magnetic tunnel junctions has been hindered by reliance on ferromagnetic electrodes (introducing stray fields) or by limited functionality (non-tunable magnetoresistance without spin filtering). Here, we propose an all-altermagnetic tunnel junction (AAMTJ) paradigm composed exclusively of altermagnets - exemplified by experimentally feasible RuO2/NiF2/RuO2. Giant tunneling magnetoresistances of 11,704%, 2,496% and 1,892%, and high spin-filtering of ~90% are achieved. This architecture unlocks tunable multistate magnetoresistance and spin filtering via magnetization control of the electrodes and barrier, stemming from their synergistic and antagonistic alignments of momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin-splitting. Our AAMTJ inherently exhibits low consumption and zero stray field, with nonrelativistic spin splitting and vanishing magnetic moment, combining the advantages of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. This AAMTJ paradigm provides a practically versatile platform to realize the revolutionarily potential of altermagnets for reconfigurable magnetic memory devices.</description>
