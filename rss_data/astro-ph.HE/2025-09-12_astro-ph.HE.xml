      <title>Characterizing Supernovae Host Galaxies with FrankenBlast: A Scalable Tool for Transient Host Galaxy Association, Photometry, and Stellar Population Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FrankenBlast, a customized and improved version of the Blast web application. FrankenBlast associates transients to their host galaxies, performs host photometry, and runs a innovative SED fitting code to constrain host stellar population properties--all within minutes per object. We test FrankenBlast on 14,432 supernovae (SNe), ~half of which are spectroscopically-classified, and are able to constrain host properties for 9262 events. When contrasting the host stellar masses ($M_*$), specific star formation rates (sSFR), and host dust extinction ($A_V$) between spectroscopically and photometrically-classified SNe Ia, Ib/c, II, and IIn, we determine that deviations in these distributions are primarily due to misclassified events contaminating the photometrically-classified sample. We further show that the higher redshifts of the photometrically-classified sample also force their $M_*$ and sSFR distributions to deviate from those of the spectroscopically-classified sample, as these properties are redshift-dependent. We compare host properties between spectroscopically-classified SN populations and determine if they primarily trace $M_*$ or SFR. We find that all SN populations seem to both depend on $M_*$ and SFR, with SNe II and IIn somewhat more SFR-dependent than SNe Ia and Ib/c, and SNe Ia more $M_*$-dependent than all other classes. We find the difference in the SNe Ib/c and II hosts the most intriguing and speculate that SNe Ib/c must be more dependent on higher $M_*$ and more evolved environments for the right conditions for progenitor formation. All data products and FrankenBlast are publicly available, along with a developing FrankenBlast version intended for Rubin Observatory science products.</description>

      <title>Polarimetric Diversity in Tidal Disruption Events: Comparative Study of Low-Polarised sources with AT2020mot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star is disrupted by the tidal forces of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), producing bright multi-wavelength flares. Among these events, AT2020mot has so far exhibited the highest recorded optical polarisation, with tidal shocks proposed as the primary source of its polarised emission. We present a comprehensive analysis of 13 TDEs with available polarimetric observations, aiming to determine whether the unusually high polarisation of AT2020mot stems from unique physical processes or arises from mechanisms shared by other TDEs. We present new optical polarisation measurements of TDEs obtained from multiple ground-based telescopes, combining them with optical, UV, and X-ray light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Swift observatory, respectively. We derive intrinsic TDE properties, such as SMBH and stellar masses, using MOSFiT and TDEMass, and compare them with the ones of the sample population. Our population study reveals that AT2020mot agrees with the broader TDE sample in most physical properties, including blackbody temperature, luminosity, and rise timescales. However, its optical polarisation degree is exceptionally high compared to the low or undetected polarisation observed in other events. Additionally, AT2020mot appears to have an elevated column density from our MOSFiT fits, suggesting a more complex environment than is typically assumed. We conclude that although AT2020mot fits well within the general TDE population in terms of global characteristics, its extraordinarily high polarisation and higher column density challenge current models based purely on shock or reprocessing mechanisms. More extensive, time-resolved polarimetric monitoring of newly discovered TDEs will be critical to determine whether AT2020mot represents an outlier or the extreme end of a continuum of TDE properties.</description>

      <title>Old Galactic novae in the eROSITA All Sky Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nova explosions occur on accreting white dwarfs. A thermonuclear runaway in the H-rich accreted envelope causes its ejection without destroying the white dwarf, and an increase in the luminosity by several magnitudes. Accretion is re-established some time after the explosion. The explosion of the nova itself is expected to affect the mass-transfer rate from the secondary and the accretion rate, but these effects have been little explored observationally. Most novae are observed only in outburst and the properties of the host systems are unknown. X-ray observations of novae happen mostly during outburst; only a few have been the target of dedicated X-ray observations years or decades after outburst. However, the X-ray emission long after the outburst provides a powerful diagnostics of the accretion rate and the possible magnetic nature of the white dwarf. We have explored the first two years of the SRG/eROSITA All Sky Survey (eRASS) for X-ray sources correlated with Galactic historical novae. We present the first population study of nova hosting systems in X-rays, focus on the evolution of accretion rate as a function of the time since last outburst, and look for new candidates for magnetic systems. In total, 32 X-ray counterparts of novae are found in the western Galactic hemisphere. Combined with 53 nova detections published for the eastern hemisphere, the fraction of X-ray detected novae in quiescence is 18% of the Galactic novae. We have, for the first time, enough statistics to observationally determine the evolution of accretion rate as a function of time since the last nova outburst for a time span of 120 years. The results confirm that magnetic systems remain systematically at higher fluxes and that accretion is enhanced during the first years after the outburst, as predicted theoretically. We also identify new IP candidates in AT Cnc and RR Cha.</description>

      <title>Relativistic precessing jets powered by an accreting neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precessing relativistic jets launched by compact objects are rarely directly measured, and present an invaluable opportunity to better understand many features of astrophysical jets. In this Letter we present MeerKAT radio observations of the neutron star X-ray binary system (NSXB) Circinus X-1 (Cir X-1). We observe a curved S-shaped morphology on $\sim 20''$ $(\sim1\:\text{pc})$ scales in the radio emission around Cir X-1. We identify flux density and position changes in the S-shaped emission on year timescales, robustly showing its association with relativistic jets. The jets of Cir X-1 are still propagating with mildly relativistic velocities $\sim1\:\text{pc}$ from the core, the first time such large scale jets have been seen from a NSXB. The position angle of the jet axis is observed to vary on year timescales, over an extreme range of at least $110{\deg}$. The morphology and position angle changes of the jet are best explained by a smoothly changing launch direction, verifying suggestions from previous literature, and indicating that precession of the jets is occurring. Steady precession of the jet is one interpretation of the data, and if occurring, we constrain the precession period and half-opening angle to $&gt;10$ years and $&gt;33{\deg}$ respectively, indicating precession in a different parameter space to similar known objects such as SS~433.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Spatial Distribution and the Galactic/Extragalactic Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the spatial distribution of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) is fundamental to understand how these particles propagate in interstellar space and to infer their source spectra. The most sensitive method of studying this problem is observing the gamma--ray and neutrino diffuse fluxes produced in the inelastic interactions of CR protons and nuclei with interstellar gas that encode the energy and spatial distributions of the interacting particles. Most theoretical models assume that the spatial and energy dependencies of the spectra of CR protons and nuclei are factorized, so that the CR energy spectra have the same shape at all points of the Milky Way. However, on the base of the Fermi--LAT observations, some authors have tentatively inferred that particles in the inner regions of the Milky Way have significantly harder spectra. Recently the ground--based telescopes Tibet--AS$\gamma$, LHAASO and HAWC have extended the measurements of the diffuse gamma--ray flux to much higher energies, and the IceCube neutrino telescope has obtained evidence for a $\nu$ flux from the Galactic disk. These new measurements allow for new tests of the factorization hypothesis, and disfavor models in which the spectral shape of CR protons and nuclei is harder in the inner part of the Galaxy. In fact, the LHAASO data above 30~TeV are in better agreement with the opposite hypothesis, that cosmic rays is the inner Galaxy have softer spectra than those in the outer Galaxy. This result, that has currently only modest significance due to large statistical and systematic uncertainties, could be explained by assuming that the CR confinement volume increases with energy. An alternative explanation is that a significant fraction of cosmic rays in the multi--PeV energy range is of extragalactic origin.</description>

      <title>Suppression of pair beam instabilities in a laboratory analogue of blazar pair cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of dense electron-positron pair beams in the laboratory can enable direct tests of theoretical models of $\gamma$-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei. We have successfully achieved this using ultra-relativistic protons accelerated by the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN. In the first application of this experimental platform, the stability of the pair beam is studied as it propagates through a metre-length plasma, analogous to TeV $\gamma$-ray induced pair cascades in the intergalactic medium. It has been argued that pair beam instabilities disrupt the cascade, thus accounting for the observed lack of reprocessed GeV emission from TeV blazars. If true this would remove the need for a moderate strength intergalactic magnetic field to explain the observations. We find that the pair beam instability is suppressed if the beam is not perfectly collimated or monochromatic, hence the lower limit to the intergalactic magnetic field inferred from $\gamma$-ray observations of blazars is robust.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the emission mechanism powering long period radio transients from interacting white dwarf binaries via kinetic plasma simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of long period radio transients, such as GLEAM-X J0704-37 and ILTJ1101 + 5521, have revealed a previously unrecognized population of galactic radio transient sources associated with white dwarf - M dwarf binaries. It is an open question how to produce coherent radio emission in these systems, though a model driven by binary interaction seems likely given the nature and correlation of the emission with the binaries' orbital period. Using kinetic plasma simulations, we demonstrate that the relativistic electron cyclotron maser instability (ECMI) is a viable mechanism for generating radio pulses in white dwarf - M dwarf systems, akin to planetary radio emission, such as that from the Jupiter-Io system. We quantify the relativistic ECMI in the nonlinear regime under conditions relevant for white dwarf radio emission for the first time. Our simulations demonstrate that the ECMI can intrinsically produce partially linearly polarized emission relevant to explaining the observed emission spectrum of the two galactic sources, though the precise details will depend on the plasma composition. Our work paves the way for a systematic and fully nonlinear computational modeling of radio emission from interacting white dwarf sources.</description>

      <title>Testing the effect of progenitor's metallicity on $^{56}$Ni mass and constraining the progenitor scenarios in Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytical model found that the intrinsic variation in the initial metallicity of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) progenitor stars ($Z_{progenitor}$) translates into a 25% variation in the $^{56}$Ni mass synthesized and, therefore, 0.2 mag difference in the observed peak luminosity of SNe Ia. Previous observational studies used the currently-observed global gas-phase metallicity of host galaxies, instead of $Z_{progenitor}$ used in the model, and showed a higher scatter in the $^{56}$Ni mass measurements compared to the model prediction. Here, we use $Z_{progenitor}$ of 34 normal SNe Ia and employ recent SN Ia explosion models with various configurations to cover the observed $^{56}$Ni mass range. Unlike previous studies, our sample covers the $Z_{progenitor}$ range, where most of the $Z_{progenitor}$ effect occurs. Linear regression returns a slope of 0.02+-0.03, which is the opposite trend to the analytical model, but at at low statistical significance level. We find that comparing our sample with SN Ia explosion models on the $Z_{progenitor}$--$^{56}$Ni mass diagram allows us to constrain the progenitor scenarios. We also explore other chemical composition indicators. For $(Fe/H)_{progenitor}$, our sample follows the trend predicted by the analytical models, but at a low significance level. Noticeably, $(\alpha/Fe)_{progenitor}$ shows the opposite trend and a clear gap. When we split the sample at $(\alpha/Fe)_{progenitor}$ = 0.35 $(\alpha/Fe)_{\odot}$, we find a 3$\sigma$ difference in the weighted-means of the $^{56}$Ni mass. Lastly, SNe Ia in different $Z_{progenitor}$ groups show a difference of 0.14+-0.09 mag in the standardized luminosity. The present work highlights a holistic approach (from the progenitor star to the explosion with SN Ia and host galaxy observational data) to understand the underlying physics of SNe Ia for more accurate and precise cosmology.</description>

      <title>Binary Black Hole Phase Space Discovers the Signature of Pair Instability Supernovae Mass Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapidly expanding catalog of gravitational-wave detections provides a powerful probe of the formation history of compact binaries across cosmic time. In this work, we extend the Binary Compact Object (BCO) phase-space framework to the full set of events in the GWTC-4 catalog to map the observed binary formation scenarios in a data-driven way. Applying this framework, we identify distinct regions of phase-space associated with different channels and discover for the first time a unique mass-cutoff scale in a data-driven way. The mapping of these on different formation channels reveals a population of first-generation (1G) black holes sharply truncated at approximately 45.5 $M_\odot$, consistent with the theoretically predicted pair-instability supernova (PISN) mass gap. These findings demonstrate the capability of the BCO phase-space to disentangle overlapping formation pathways, establish robust connections between gravitational-wave observations and binary evolution, and highlight the potential of upcoming observing runs to reveal rare populations and exotic origins.</description>

      <title>Reprocessing of X-rays emission in Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the discovery of pulsations in some of the ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs), it is quite clear that most of the ULXs harbor either a neutron star or a stellar mass black hole as a compact object accreting at super-Eddington rates. In spite of having such a high accretion rate, the reprocessed emission in the ULX sources is quite meagre compared to that observed in Galactic X-ray binaries, except for some absorption lines in the winds. In this work, we investigate the extent of reprocessed emission in ULXs using three diagnostics: (i) searches for Fe $\rm K\alpha$ lines in bright well-known ULXs and Ultra luminous X-ray Pulsars (ULXPs), (ii) evolution of hardness ratio around the eclipse transitions in the eclipsing ULXs, and (iii) the flux ratio between eclipse and out-of-eclipse (OOE) phases in eclipsing ULXs. We placed the most stringent constraints to date on the upper limits on EW of the iron line, 11--20 eV. Furthermore, we have not observed any significant changes in the hardness ratio during the ingress or egress, while in Galactic eclipsing X-ray binaries, an increase in the hardness ratio is observed during the transitions. Finally, the reprocessing efficiency (eclipse to OOE flux ratio) is found to be larger in ULXs compared to Galactic eclipsing X-ray binaries. Based on these results, we discuss the possibility of a metal-poor or highly ionized environment surrounding the ULXs, which suppresses reprocessed emission features.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Confirms GW231123 is a "Lite" Intermediate Mass Black Hole Merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration recently reported GW231123, a black hole merger with total mass of around 190-265 solar mass. This event adds to the growing evidence of "lite" intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) discoveries of post-merger black holes &gt;100 solar mass. GW231123 posed several data analysis challenges owing to waveform-model systematics and presence of noise artifacts called glitches. We present the first comprehensive machine learning analysis to further validate this event, strengthen its astrophysical inference, and characterize instrumental noise in its vicinity. Our approach uses a combination of tools tailored for specific analyses: GW-Whisper, an adaptation of OpenAI's audio transformer, ArchGEM, a Gaussian mixture model-based soft clustering and density approximation software and AWaRe, a convolutional autoencoder. We identify the data segment containing the merger with &gt;70% confidence in both detectors and verify its astrophysical origin. We then characterize the scattered light glitch around the event, providing the first physically interpretable parameters for the glitch. We also reconstruct the real waveforms from the data with slightly better agreement to model-agnostic reconstructions than to quasi-circular models, hinting at possible astrophysics beyond current waveform families (such as non-circular orbits or environmental imprints). Finally, by demonstrating high-fidelity waveform reconstructions for simulated mergers with total masses between 100-1000 solar mass, we show that our method can confidently probe the IMBH regime. Our integrated framework offers a powerful complementary tool to traditional pipelines for rapid, robust analysis of massive, glitch-contaminated events.</description>

      <title>Magnetic White Dwarf -- M Dwarf Binaries in Pre-polar Phase as Special Population of Long-Period Radio Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a new class of coherent radio sources with periods ranging from minutes to hours. Recently, two LPT sources, ILT J1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704-37, with periods of 2-3 hours has been confirmed to originate from white dwarf (WD) -- M dwarf (MD) binaries. In this work, we propose that at least some LPTs originate from the magnetic WD -- MD binaries in the pre-polar phase. The asynchronism between the WD's rotation and the binary's orbital motion allows for the unipolar-inductor mechanism or magnetosphere interaction to operate and accelerate radiating particles, with the dominant process depending on the magnetic moment ratio of the two stars. Under asynchronism condition, both the peak flux and the polarization of radio pulses will be modulated by the beat period. The pre-polar phase characterized by an extremely low accretion rate provides the relatively clean magnetospheric environment necessary for a loss-cone-driven maser (LCDM) mechanism to operate, producing the LPT emission. The observed pulse duty cycle of $10^{-3}-10^{-1}$ is attributed to a beaming effect modulated by the binary's magnetic geometry. Furthermore, the magnetized environment of a WD--MD binary is conducive to Faraday conversion with weak coupling, which implies that the polarization state of LPTs should vary significantly at different periods. Finally, we predict that LPTs from WD--MD binaries should exhibit a period distribution following $f_P(P)dP \propto P^{-(1.67-2.33)}dP$ and a luminosity function described by $f_L(L)dL \propto L^{-(1.80-2.67)}dL$, which can be tested by the future large sample.</description>

      <title>GRMHD Study of Accretion onto time-like Naked Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Naked singularities (NkS) are solutions to the Einstein field equations that violate the cosmic censorship conjecture. Recent studies indicate that these objects may serve as compelling mimickers of black hole shadows. In this work, we investigate the accretion dynamics of selected time-like naked singularities using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. Our objective is to determine whether naked singularities exhibit distinct signatures compared to black holes. We find that, unlike black holes, naked singularities exhibit a centrifugal barrier that prevents direct accretion of rotating matter onto the NkS. Despite reduced magnetization in the funnel region, these objects are capable of generating jet powers comparable to those observed in black holes. Additionally, we observe that accreting matter releases gravitational energy as it is driven towards the NkS, powering the strong outflow via local fluid pressure gradient or magnetic pressure forces.</description>

      <title>Towards systematic search for white dwarf binaries with multiband photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-compact double white dwarfs (DWDs) represent key targets for multi-messenger astrophysics, as they may be observed both through gravitational waves and the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. The future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect thousands of these systems, and they are predicted to be the most numerous science targets of the mission. We develop a strategy to identify LISA source candidates in multiband photometric surveys. We constructed a synthetic EM catalogue of white dwarf (WD) detections based on a population synthesis code combined with a semi-analytical model of the Milky Way and a consistent cooling model for the evolution. We compared sources in the LISA band with other WD observations in magnitude-colour and colour-colour plots. From a full sky survey with $u \le$24.5, we find that 57$\%$ of the sources in the LISA band occupy a specific region in colour-colour diagrams. Inside this area, we find that $\sim 63\%$ (6.5 $\times 10^4$) of EM observations are LISA candidates, $\sim 31\%$ ($ 3.2 \times 10^4$) are DWDs slightly outside the LISA frequency range, and only a small contamination comes from single WDs and wider binaries. We find that the colour distributions of close DWDs represent a powerful tool to distinguish potential LISA sources from the broader WD population. This is an avenue to select candidates for further follow-up and identification.</description>

      <title>Spin Constraints on 4U 1630-47 via combined Continuum Fitting and Reflection methods: a comparative study using Frequentist and Bayesian statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive Bayesian spectral analysis of the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-47 during its 2022 outburst, using simultaneous \textit{NICER} and \textit{NuSTAR} observations. Using the traditional frequentist approach, we build our model combining reflection spectroscopy with continuum fitting techniques and analyse the data. In the Bayesian framework, we jointly constrain the black hole's spin, mass, inclination, and distance within a unified framework. Employing nested sampling, we capture parameter degeneracies and rigorously propagate both statistical and systematic uncertainties. Our results yield robust and precise spin measurements from both approaches. Our Bayesian analysis fetches spin $a_*= 0.93_{-0.04}^{+0.05}$, mass $M_{\rm BH} = 9.0_{-2.0}^{+2.0} \, M_\odot$, distance $d_{\rm BH} = 10.5_{-1.2}^{+1.3}$~kpc, and inclination angle $i=53.8_{-1.3}^{+1.3}$~deg. It also demonstrates the power of Bayesian inference in fetching valuable insights into the complex physics of black hole accretion and enabling high-confidence measurements of fundamental parameters.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high energy event KM3-230213A as a cosmogenic neutrino in light of minimal UHECR flux models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the KM3NeT experiment reported the detection of a neutrino with exceptionally high energy E = 220 PeV, whose origin remains unclear. The corresponding value of the neutrino flux is in tension with the results of other high-energy neutrino experiments. In this study, we discuss the possibility that this neutrino is cosmogenic, i. e., produced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) during their propagation through the intergalactic medium. We adopt the UHECR flux models derived by the Telescope Array experiment, which features a predominantly light mass composition. We show that the predictions of the cosmogenic neutrino flux in these models are consistent with the measurements of the KM3NeT-only and with that of the "global neutrino observatory" at approximately 2${\sigma}$ level. Notably, this result is achieved in a minimal version of the UHECR flux models, that assume one source population with a standard cosmological evolution. We also estimate the corresponding cosmogenic gamma-ray flux and show that it is consistent with Fermi-LAT IGRB measurements and UHE gamma-ray limits; the improvement of the latter can probe these predictions in future.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength observations of a new black-widow millisecond pulsar PSR J1544-2555</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a new black-widow millisecond pulsar, PSR J1544-2555, associated with the Fermi-LAT source 4FGL J1544.2-2554. Optical, radio, and gamma-ray observations confirmed its nature as a compact spider binary system. Optical photometry from ULTRACAM revealed a \(\sim\)2.7-hour orbital period, guiding MeerKAT observations that detected \(\sim\)2.4-ms radio pulsations. Subsequent timing campaigns using the Murriyang Parkes Telescope, the Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope, and the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope allowed us to obtain a preliminary timing solution, which enabled us to find gamma-ray pulsations. The final timing solution, spanning 16 years of Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data, also displays orbital period variations typical of spider pulsars. X-ray observations from eROSITA indicate non-thermal emission, but the relatively low count rate prohibits the search for X-ray pulsations. Optical light curve modelling using Icarus suggests the asymmetry is best explained by a spot model, where uneven heating creates localised temperature variations on the companion. While the optical spectra we obtained are compatible with the physical properties we infer for the companion star, they were not of sufficient signal-to-noise to allow for radial velocity measurements, thus limiting constraints on the neutron star's mass. The observed bluer colour near the light curve minimum suggests possible non-thermal emission from intra-binary shocks, supported by the presence of an X-ray source. This discovery exemplifies the proven capability of the Fermi-LAT catalogue in identifying millisecond pulsar candidates and highlights the role of optical surveys in detecting variable sources suitable for radio follow-up.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Ultra-heavy DM from TeV-PeV gamma-ray diffuse measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have measured the Galactic $\gamma$-ray diffuse emission up to PeV energies, opening a window to study acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays and their propagation up to the cosmic-ray knee. Furthermore, these observations provide a powerful tool to set strong constraints into very-heavy dark matter particles, with masses in the TeV-PeV range. In this paper, we explore the potential of the newest observations of diffuse emissions at the Galactic plane from HAWC and LHAASO to probe this kind of dark matter over a wide mass range. Here, we model secondary emissions (inverse-Compton) from the electrons and positrons produced in the annihilation/decay of dark matter, on top of their prompt $\gamma$-ray emission, including the effects of absorption of high-energy photons via pair production. Furthermore, we show that including the astrophysical backgrounds (namely diffuse emission from cosmic-ray collisions or emission from unresolved sources) can significantly improve these limits. We find that the new measurements provided, specially by LHAASO with the combination of the WCDA and KM2A detectors, allow us to set strong constraints in decaying dark matter, being competitive and even improving the strongest constraints at the moment. We also highlight that these regions lead to constraints that are less affected by uncertainties from the dark matter distribution and discuss how CTA north and SWGO will be able to improve limits in this mass range.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the origin of black hole mergers using sparse astrophysical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The astrophysical origin of binary black hole mergers discovered by LIGO and Virgo remains uncertain. Efforts to reconstruct the processes that lead to mergers typically rely on either astrophysical models with fixed parameters, or continuous analytical models that can be fit to observations. Given the complexity of astrophysical formation mechanisms, these methods typically cannot fully take into account model uncertainties, nor can they fully capture the underlying processes. Here, we present a merger population analysis that can take a discrete set of simulated model distributions as its input to interpret observations. The analysis can take into account multiple formation scenarios as fractional contributors to the total set of observations, and can naturally account for model uncertainties. We apply this technique to investigate the origin of black hole mergers observed by LIGO Virgo. Specifically, we consider a model of AGN assisted black hole merger distributions, exploring a range of AGN parameters along with several {{SEVN}} population synthesis models that vary in common envelope efficiency parameter ($\alpha$) and metallicity ($Z$). We estimate the posterior distributions for AGN+SEVN models using $87$ BBH detections from the $O1--O3$ observation runs. The inferred total merger rate is $46.2 {Gpc}^{-3} {yr}^{-1}$, with the AGN sub-population contributing $21.2{Gpc}^{-3}{yr}^{-1}$ and the SEVN sub-population contributing $25.0 {Gpc}^{-3} {yr}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Constraining Dark Photon Dark Matter with Radio Silence from Soliton Mergers around Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We place the first constraints on the dark matter fraction contained within dark photon solitons using the absence of their predicted radio-frequency signatures, or radio silence, following mergers around supermassive black holes. In these dense environments, spiky dark matter density profiles can form that enhance the soliton merger rate. We present a novel estimate of this rate by incorporating both the steepened dark matter profile and the soliton velocity dispersion via the Jeans equation. For galaxies with an initial profile $\rho_\mathrm{DM} \propto r^{-1}$, we find the total merger rate across redshifts $0 \leq z \leq 4$ to be $\Gamma_{\text{merg}}^{\text{TOTAL}} \lesssim 10^{-7}f^2_{\text{DM}}\,\text{Mpc}^{-3}\,\text{day}^{-1}$, where $f_\mathrm{DM}$ is the solitonic fraction of dark matter. This enhanced rate leads to more major merger events in which the generated soliton has a mass exceeding a critical threshold, leading to its decay via the parametric resonance phenomenon that produces brief, narrowband, and energetic radio bursts detectable by fast radio burst surveys. Comparing our predictions with the non-observation of such events, we already obtain $f_\mathrm{DM} \lesssim 10^{-1}$ from the first fast radio burst study. This constraint is strengthened to $f_\mathrm{DM} \lesssim 10^{-2}$ from the Parkes HTRU survey, with CHIME projected to tighten this to $f_\mathrm{DM} \lesssim 10^{-3}$. For larger $f_\mathrm{DM}$, we instead constrain the effective coupling strength between the dark and visible sectors to lie outside $10^{-18}\,\mathrm{GeV^{-1}} \lesssim g \lesssim 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ for dark photon masses in the range $10^{-6}\,\mathrm{eV} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-4}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Our results establish astrophysical transients as powerful probes of dark sectors, opening a window onto the detectability of ultralight vector fields.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter mass density profiles and velocity distributions for a set of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) have recently been obtained (F.Bezrukov, D.Gorbunov, E.Koreshkova arXiv:2412.20585) by performing a multi-parametric fit to the stellar observations with the help of the GravSphere which solves the Jeans equation. We use these results to calculate the geometrical factors for estimation of the fluxes of cosmic rays expected from decay ($D$-factor) and annihilation ($J_s$-, $J_p$- and $J_d$-factors for $s$-, $p$- and $d$- wave processes) of dark matter particles in galaxies. The general novelty is the account for a possible anisotropy in velocities of dark matter particles. On the basis of this analysis we present empirical scaling approximations to these factors as functions of typical observables: distance to the galaxy $d$, it's half-radius $r_h$ and line-of-sight stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_{LOS}$. They can be applied to any galaxy, and for $D$- and $J_s$-factors we refine the estimates of (Andrew B. Pace, Louis E. Strigari arXiv:1802.06811): the shifts in the central values remain within 1-2$\sigma$ error bars.</description>

      <title>The superMIGHTEE project: MeerKAT and GMRT Together to Unveil the Deep Radio Sky</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An international team of researchers has come together to undertake an ultra-broadband exploration of the deep radio sky. The superMIGHTEE project combines data from the MIGHTEE project, using the precursor Square Kilometre Array (SKA) MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, with observations from the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in India to produce deep images at several $\mu$Jy sensitivity over a frequency range of 200 MHz--2.5 GHz, with an angular resolution of a few arcseconds. This paper describes the initial superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release, comprising total intensity continuum images covering a total of 9.9 deg$^2$ at 650 MHz and 6.9 deg$^2$ at 400 MHz in the XMM-LSS, COSMOS, and E-CDFS deep fields. The associated radio source catalogs include 27,101 sources at 650 MHz and 10,946 sources at 400 MHz. The redshift distribution of the sources extends to $z\sim4$ with a median value of $z=1$. An overview of the broadband spectra of the sources, in combination with the MeerKAT MIGHTEE 1280 MHz data, reveals a clear change in spectral properties at the transition from an active galactic nuclei-dominated population to a population dominated by star-forming galaxies at flux densities of a few mJy. At higher frequencies, the star-forming galaxy population exhibits an optically thin synchrotron spectral index indicative of energy injection from supernovae. At lower frequencies, the spectra flatten significantly with decreasing flux density, and the fraction of sources with peaked spectra increases. This is the first superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release. Subsequent releases will include spectropolarimetric and spectral line image cubes, as well as images at lower frequencies. The goal of the superMIGHTEE ultra-wideband dataset is to enhance our understanding of the evolution of active galactic nuclei and star-forming galaxies over cosmic time, (abridged).</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the depth of the shower maximum of air showers with the SD-750 surface detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory using neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is one of the intriguing mysteries in astroparticle physics. In order to identify their sources, we need precise knowledge of the mass composition of UHECRs. The direct detection of UHECRs is not feasible at energies above 0.1 PeV, necessitating the use of mass-sensitive observables of extended air showers induced by UHECRs interacting with the atmosphere. One way to achieve high statistics for these mass-sensitive observables is to use ground-based detector arrays, such as the Surface Detector (SD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The SD consists of three sub-arrays of independent detector stations arranged in triangular grids with different spacings. Recently, it has been shown that neural networks (NNs) can extract mass-sensitive observables from data taken by the SD-1500, the largest sub-detector of the SD. In this contribution, we demonstrate the feasibility of using NNs to reconstruct a high-level shower observable, the depth of the shower maximum, from data simulated for and observed by the SD-750, the second-largest detector array nested within the SD-1500. A simulation study shows that the SD-750 NN exhibits behavior similar to that of an SD-1500 NN and outperforms the latter in the energy range [1, 10) EeV. Moreover, we show that, after performing a correction and calibration procedure, the predictions of the SD-750 NN are consistent with the measurement of the depth of the shower maximum obtained by the Fluorescence Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory.</description>

Abstract: We investigate neutron stars with nonlinear magnetic monopoles in the framework of the Einstein-nonlinear electrodynamics model, specifically within the Bardeen and Hayward models. Solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for three different equations of state, we find that upon reaching the critical magnetic charge $q_{c}$, neutron stars enter frozen states characterized by the critical horizon. This extends the concept of frozen states to compact objects composed of ordinary matter (non-field matter), thereby offering a new perspective for related research.</description>

      <title>Impact of rotation on the accretion of entropy perturbations in collapsing massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convection in the innermost shells of massive stars plays an important role in initiating core-collapse supernovae. When these convective motions reach the supernova shock, they create extra turbulence, which helps energize the explosion. In our earlier work, we studied the effect of rotation on the hydrodynamic evolution of convective vortices in collapsing stars. This study focuses on how rotation influences the entropy perturbations, which naturally form in turbulent convection. As these perturbations are carried inward with the collapsing star, they generate both vorticity and sound waves. Using linear perturbation theory, we model entropy waves as small disturbances on top of a steady background flow. Our results show that stellar rotation has little effect on the evolution of entropy perturbations during collapse, prior to encountering the supernova shock. This outcome is consistent with our earlier findings on the limited influence of rotation in the accretion of convective eddies.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Boson Ionization from Comparable-Mass Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons around comparable-mass binaries can form gravitationally bound states analogous to molecules once the binary separation decreases below the boson's Bohr radius, with the inner region co-moving with the binary. We simulate the formation of these gravitational molecules, determine their co-moving regions, and compute ionization fluxes induced by orbital motion for various binary eccentricities. We develop semi-analytic formalisms to describe the ionization dynamics of both the co-moving and non-co-moving regions, demonstrating consistency with numerical simulation results. From ionization fluxes, we estimate their backreaction on binary orbital evolution. At early stages, molecule ionization can dominate over gravitational wave emission, producing a spectral turnover in the gravitational wave background. Additionally, ionization of the co-moving component occurs solely due to binary eccentricity, causing orbital circularization.</description>

      <title>A FLASH on Blazars: Capturing the Radio Realm of 4FGL Blazars with SKAO Pathfinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the multi-wavelength properties of 165 4FGL blazars from the Fermi-LAT fourth source catalogue, looking for with counterparts in the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) First Large Absorption Survey in HI (FLASH) continuum. Using high-resolution data from FLASH and complementary radio datasets, combined with archival Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations, we perform detailed spectral energy distribution (SED) analyses across cm-to-mm wavelengths. Our findings reveal that most blazars exhibit re-triggered peaked spectra, indicative of emission dominated by a single emitting region. Additionally, we identify strong correlations between radio and gamma-ray luminosities, highlighting the significant role of relativistic jets in these active galactic nuclei. The inclusion of spectroscopic redshifts from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Gaia enables a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary trends and physical characteristics of the sources. Furthermore, we report a tight Radio-X-ray Correlation for Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars, contrasting with the more scattered behaviour observed in BL-Lacs, reflecting their distinct accretion and jet-driving mechanisms. These results provide critical insights into the physics of blazars and their environments, paving the way for future studies with next-generation facilities like the SKA Observatory (SKAO) for radio observations and Cherenkov Telescope Array for gamma-ray studies.</description>

      <title>Can repeating and non-repeating FRBs be drawn from the same population?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Do all Fast Radio Burst (FRB) sources repeat? We present evidence that FRB sources follow a Zipf-like distribution, in which the number density of sources is approximately inversely proportional to their burst rate above a fixed energy threshold-even though both the burst rate and number density span many orders of magnitude individually. We introduce a model-independent framework that predicts the distribution of observed fluences and distances, and repetition rates of an FRB population based on an assumed burst rate distribution per source. Using parameters derived directly from observations, this framework simultaneously explains several key features of the FRB population: (i) The observed ratio of repeaters to apparent non-repeaters; (ii) The much lower ratio of apparent non-repeaters to the total number of Soft Gamma Repeater (SGR) sources within the observable Universe; And (iii) the slightly smaller average distances of known repeaters compared to non-repeaters. We further explore how survey parameters, such as radio sensitivity and observation time, influence these statistics. Notably, we find that the fraction of repeaters rises only mildly with improved sensitivity or longer exposure. This weak dependence could be misinterpreted as evidence that not all FRBs repeat. Overall, our results support the idea that a single population-likely magnetars-can account for the full observed diversity of FRB activity, from very inactive FRB sources like SGR 1935+2154 to the most active repeaters.</description>

      <title>Temporal evolution of quasi-periodic oscillations in an accreting black hole Swift J1727.8-1613: coevolution of the disk-corona during the state transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are commonly observed in black hole X-ray binaries, and their frequency has been found to correlate with various spectral properties. In this work, we present a detailed timing analysis of Swift J1727.8-1613, revealing a novel two-branch correlation between the QPO frequency and the observed disk emission, which differs from previous findings of a single correlation. Specifically, at QPO frequencies below 3 Hz, the QPO frequency is negatively correlated with the observed disk emission. This negative relation transitions to a positive one, as the QPO frequency exceeds approximately 3 Hz. The correlation between QPO frequency and Compton flux exhibits an opposite trend, with a positive correlation at lower frequencies and a negative correlation at higher ones. We interpret these behaviors as signatures of an evolving disk-corona geometry, within the framework of a Lense-Thirring precessing hot flow. Additionally, we find that during the flare state, the QPO fractional root-mean-square (rms) remains nearly constant above 15 keV, but increases with energy below this threshold. The slope of the rms-energy relation increases as the energy spectrum softens.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric emissions of neutrinos in the cooling of rotating proto-neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate global asymmetry in the luminosities of neutrinos emitted from rapidly-rotating proto-neutron stars (PNS's). We build axisymmetric models of PNS's in mechanical equilibrium with rotation by adding prescribed angular momentum distributions by hand to non-rotational PNS models, which are extracted from a one-dimensional (spherically symmetric) PNS cooling calculation at different times: \(t=2, 6, 10, 20, 30\)s after a supernova explosion. We then conduct two-dimensional (spatially axisymmetric) neutrino transport calculations on top of them with the matter profiles (and the spacetime geometry) fixed. We find for the rapidly-rotating models with \(T/|W|\sim 5\times 10^{-2}\) that the neutrino luminosity changes by \(\sim 3 \% \) depending on the observer position. We give detailed analyses of the neutrino-hemispheres as well as the neutrino luminosities that are defined observer-wise. We also calculate the low-frequency (\(\lesssim 1{\rm Hz}\)) gravitational waves produced by the neutrinos radiated asymmetrically. We find that those gravitational waves, if emitted from the Galactic center, can be detected by planned detectors such as B-DECIGO, DECIGO and AILA. Finally, we look for crossings in the energy-integrated angular distributions in momentum space for the electron neutrino sector, a signature of the fast flavor conversion. We find them near the PNS surface in all models.</description>

      <title>GeV Gamma-Rays from Molecular Clouds Illuminated by Particles Diffusing from the Adjacent Supernova Remnant G335.2+0.1 Confined in an Expanding Bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of GeV gamma-ray emission likely associated with supernova remnant (SNR) G335.2+0.1 and the finding of a molecular cloud ($\sim20$--$30^\prime$ in angular size) that is very likely in physical contact with the SNR and responsible for the gamma-ray emission. Using the 16.8 yr Fermi-LAT data, an extended emission, with a significance of 13.5 $\sigma$ and a radius 0.24{\deg} in 0.2--500 GeV in the uniform-disk model, was found to the adjacent east of the SNR. With archival Mopra CO-line data, a large molecular clump at local-standard-of-rest velocity $\sim-48$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$ was revealed appearing coincident with the gamma-ray source. The SNR was found located in a cavity encircled by a 'C'-shaped ring-like molecular shell at $-45$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$. This morphological agreement, together with the position-velociy diagrams made along lines cutting across the cavity, suggests that the SNR was evolving in the expanding molecular bubble created by the stellar wind of the progenitor with a mass $\gtrsim 15 M_{\mathrm{sun}}$. The giant molecular cloud, visible at around $-46$ km s$^{-1}$, and the associated SNR are thus estimated to lie at a kinematic distance of 3.1 kpc, with the HI absorption taken into account. We suggest that the SNR has entered the radiative phase after the blastwave recently struck the cavity wall. With the evolutionary scenario of the SNR, we demonstrate that the gamma-ray emission reported here can be naturally interpreted by the hadronic interaction between the accelerated protons that escaped from the SNR shock and the eastern large molecular clump.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Perseus Cluster I: Resolving the Si/S/Ar/Ca ratios by Stellar Convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical abundance measurements from stars in the Milky Way to the intragalactic medium in the Perseus Cluster have challenged the spherical explosion models. Models in the literature cannot closely match the observed element ratios, where Si, S are overproduced and Ar, Ca are underproduced. In this article, we explore the impact of the model parameters during the evolution of massive stars on the final explosive nucleosynthesis. We investigate the effects of a parametrized model of the convective process, including the mixing length parameter and the semi-convection parameter, on the production of Si-group elements. We search for the value pair that can reduce the discrepancy in the models. We conclude that a mixing length parameter of 2.2 and semi-convection parameter of 0.03 are required to fit these criteria. Using this updated value pair, we compute a sequence of massive star models from $M_{\rm ZAMS} = $ 15 -- 40 $M_{\odot}$. The high resolution data from future observations such as XRISM will provide further details on less constrained processes in stellar evolution and supernova explosion. Future comparison with supernova models of various progenitor metallicity will further shed light on the supernova population and their relative rates on cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Triggered Type Ia Supernovae I: Impact on Explosion Dynamics and Light Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass window are compelling dark matter candidates, made plausible by the existence of black holes and by the variety of mechanisms of their production in the early universe. If a PBH falls into a white dwarf (WD), the strong tidal forces can generate enough heat to trigger a thermonuclear runaway explosion, depending on the WD mass and the PBH orbital parameters. In this work, we investigate the WD explosion triggered by the passage of PBH. We perform 2D simulations of the WD undergoing thermonuclear explosion in this scenario, with the predicted ignition site as the parameter assuming the deflagration-detonation transition model. We study the explosion dynamics and predict the associated light curves and nucleosynthesis. We find that the model sequence predicts the light curves which align with the Phillip's relation ($B_{\max}$ vs. $\Delta M_{15}$). Our models hint at a unifying approach in triggering Type Ia supernovae without involving two distinctive evolutionary tracks.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of the Energy and Redshift Distributions of the Fast Radio Burst Population Based on the First CHIME/FRB Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief, high-energy bursts of radio waves from extragalactic sources, and their origin remains an open question. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the FRB population using the first CHIME/FRB catalog, focusing on their energy and redshift distribution, with careful consideration of selection effects. We investigate a range of models, including the Schechter function and the broken power-law function for the energy distribution, and several redshift evolution models, such as the star formation history (SFH) model, as well as models incorporating time delays relative to the SFH or additional redshift evolution factors. Our results indicate that the energy distribution of FRBs is best described by the Schechter function, with a power-law index of $\gamma = -1.49^{+0.37}_{-0.27}$ and a characteristic cutoff energy of $E_\mathrm{c} = 2.82^{+2.43}_{-1.47} \times 10^{41}$ erg. Furthermore, we find no evidence for redshift evolution in the energy distribution of FRBs. In terms of their redshift distribution, our analysis shows that it follows the cosmic SFH, without requiring additional delayed components or redshift evolution factors, suggesting that most FRBs likely originate from young stellar populations. Simultaneously, we infer a local volumetric rate of $\Phi_0 = 4.68^{+4.66}_{-2.39} \times 10^{4} \rm \ Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ for $E&gt;10^{39}$ erg. These results, robust against CHIME observational biases, may provide new insights into the underlying properties of the FRB population.</description>

      <title>Towards high-precision inspiral gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star mergers in numerical relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the performance of a newly implemented fourth-order accurate finite-volume HLLC Riemann solver in the adaptive-mesh-refinement numerical relativity code {\tt SACRA-MPI}. First, we validate our implementation in one-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamics tests, i.e., a simple wave and shock tube test, which have analytic solutions. We demonstrate that the fourth-order convergence is achieved for the smooth flow, which cannot be achieved in our original second-order accurate finite-volume Riemann solver. We also show that our new solver is robust for the strong shock wave emergence problem. Second, we validate the implementation in a dynamical spacetime by demonstrating that {\tt SACRA-MPI} perfectly preserves the $\pi$-symmetry without imposing the $\pi$-symmetry in a short-term ($\sim 20~{\rm ms}$ in the inspiral and subsequent post-merger phase) non-spinning equal-mass binary neutron star merger simulations. Finally, we quantify the accuracy of $\approx 28$ cycles inspiral gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star mergers by conducting a resolution study with $\approx 78, 94$, $118$, and $135$ m. We find that the fourth-order accurate Riemann solver achieves the convergence order $\approx 2.1\pm{0.05}$--$2.4\pm{0.27}$, i.e., slightly evolving with time, in the inspiral gravitational wave phase, while the second-order accurate Riemann solver achieves the convergence order $\approx 2.0\pm{0.5}$. The residual phase error towards the continuum limit at the merger is $0.27\pm 0.07$ rad and $0.58\pm 0.22$ rad out of a total phase of $\approx 176$ rad, respectively, for the fourth- and second-order accurate Riemann solver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transient events associated with supermassive black holes provide rare opportunities to study accretion and the environments of supermassive black holes. We present a multiwavelength study of AT2020adpi (ZTF20acvfraq), a luminous optical/UV transient in the nucleus of the galaxy WISEA J231853.77$-$103505.6 ($z=0.26$) that exhibits the properties of an ambiguous nuclear transient. Near peak, its spectral energy distribution is well described by a power law ($\lambda L_\lambda \propto \lambda^{-\alpha}$, $\alpha = 0.44 \pm 0.04$), with a maximum $g$-band luminosity of $(3.6 \pm 0.6)\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is consistent with luminous AGN flares. We detect a strong mid-infrared flare ($L_\mathrm{peak}^{\mathrm{MIR}} = (2.3 \pm 0.05)\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) delayed by $\sim$240 rest-frame days, indicating a hot dust echo from material at $\sim$0.2 pc. The optical and near-infrared spectra show broad H, He I, [OIII] lines, as well as narrow Fe II, and prominent Mg II, which is a combination not typical of TDEs. Taken together, these features suggest AT2020adpi is an ambiguous nuclear transient, where an accretion episode was triggered by stellar disruption of an accretion disk or instabilities within an active nucleus. This source demonstrates the need for careful multiwavelength analysis to distinguish between extreme AGN variability and TDEs.</description>

      <title>Analytic and Numerical Constraints on QPOs in EHT and XRB Sources Using Quantum-Corrected Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This investigation examines QPOs in two quantum-corrected BH spacetimes that preserve general covariance while incorporating quantum gravitational effects through a dimensionless parameter \zeta. We combine analytical derivations of epicyclic frequencies with comprehensive numerical simulations of BHL accretion to explore how quantum corrections manifest in observable astrophysical phenomena. Using a fiducial BH mass of M=10M_\odot representative of stellar-mass X-ray binaries, we demonstrate that the two models exhibit fundamentally different behaviors: Model-I modifies both temporal and radial metric components, leading to innermost stable circular orbit migration proportional to \zeta^4 and dramatic stagnation point evolution from 27M to 5M as quantum corrections strengthen. Model-II preserves the classical temporal component while altering only spatial geometry, maintaining constant stagnation points and stable cavity structures throughout the parameter range. Our numerical simulations reveal distinct QPO generation mechanisms, with Model-I showing systematic frequency evolution and cavity shrinkage that suppresses oscillations for \zeta \geq 3M, while Model-II maintains stable low-frequency modes up to \zeta \geq 5M. Power spectral density analyzes demonstrate characteristic frequency ratios (3:2, 2:1, 5:3) consistent with observations from X-ray binaries, providing specific targets for discriminating between quantum correction scenarios. The hydrodynamically derived constraints (\zeta \lesssim 4M) show remarkable agreement with independent EHT limits for M87* and Sgr A*, validating our theoretical framework through multiple observational channels. These results establish QPO frequency analysis as a probe for detecting quantum gravitational effects in astrophysical BHs and demonstrate the complementary nature of timing and imaging observations in constraining fundamental physics.</description>

Abstract: Many well motivated dark matter (DM) particle candidates can decay into detectable X-ray photons. We analyze the Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS) data from eROSITA early data release to search for unidentified X-ray lines that could indicate DM signals. Having discovered no anomalous signal, we set limits on DM decay rate in mass range between 1.8-18 keV, and constrain the parameter space of two DM particles: sterile neutrino and axion-like particles. Finally we also study the projected sensitivity of eROSITA full sky search, showing that eROSITA all-sky survey is expected to set the most stringent limits in the soft X-ray band.</description>

      <title>Dance to Demise -- How Massive Stars May Form Dense Circumstellar Shells Before Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors of core-collapse (CC) supernovae (SNe) with initial masses between $12-20~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ focusing on effects of enhanced mass loss due to pulsation-driven instabilities in their envelopes and subsequent dynamical ejections during advanced stages of nuclear burning. Using time-dependent mass loss rates from detailed MESA stellar evolution models, including prescriptions for both pulsation-driven superwinds and shock-induced ejections, we construct the circumstellar medium (CSM) before the SN explosion. We calculate resulting CSM density profiles and column densities considering the radiation-driven acceleration of the stellar wind. Our models produce episodes of enhanced mass loss $\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-2}~ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ in the last centuries-decades before explosion forming dense CSM ($\gtrsim10^{-15}~\mathrm{g~cm}^{-3}$ at distances $\lesssim10^{15}~\mathrm{cm}$) - consistent with multi-wavelength observations of Type II SNe such as SN 2023ixf, SN 2020ywx, SN 2017hcc, SN 2005ip and SN 1998S. The formation of such dense CS shells, as predicted by our single star RSG models, provides a natural explanation for observed flash-ionization signatures, X-ray and radio emission, and has important implications for dust formation around Type II SNe.</description>
