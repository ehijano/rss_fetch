      <title>A simple algorithm for checking equivalence of counting functions on free monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we propose a new algorithm for checking whether two counting functions on a free monoid $M_r$ of rank $r$ are equivalent modulo a bounded function. The previously known algorithm has time complexity $O(n)$ for all ranks $r&gt;2$, however in case $r=2$ it was estimated only as $O(n^2)$. Here we apply a new approach, based on explicit basis expansion and weighted rectangles summation, which allows us to construct a much simpler algorithm with time complexity $O(n)$ for any $r\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Finding connected components of a graph using traversals associated with iterative methods for solving systems of linear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To solve many problems on graphs, graph traversals are used, the usual variants of which are the depth-first search and the breadth-first search. Implementing a graph traversal we consequently reach all vertices of the graph that belong to a connected component. The breadth-first search is the usual choice when constructing efficient algorithms for finding connected components of a graph. Methods of simple iteration for solving systems of linear equations with modified graph adjacency matrices and with the properly specified right-hand side can be considered as graph traversal algorithms. These traversal algorithms, generally speaking, turn out to be non-equivalent neither to the depth-first search nor the breadth-first search. The example of such a traversal algorithm is the one associated with the Gauss-Seidel method. For an arbitrary connected graph, to visit all its vertices, the algorithm requires not more iterations than that is required for BFS. For a large number of instances of the problem, fewer iterations will be required.</description>

      <title>An efficient algorithm to compute the minimum free energy of interacting nucleic acid strands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The information-encoding molecules RNA and DNA form a combinatorially large set of secondary structures through nucleic acid base pairing. Thermodynamic prediction algorithms predict favoured, or minimum free energy (MFE), secondary structures, and can assign an equilibrium probability to any structure via the partition function: a Boltzman-weighted sum over the set of secondary structures. MFE is NP-hard in the presence pseudoknots, base pairings that violate a restricted planarity condition. However, unpseudoknotted structures are amenable to dynamic programming: for a single DNA/RNA strand there are polynomial time algorithms for MFE and partition function. For multiple strands, the problem is more complicated due to entropic penalties. Dirks et al [SICOMP Review; 2007] showed that for O(1) strands, with N bases, there is a polynomial time in N partition function algorithm, however their technique did not generalise to MFE which they left open. We give the first polynomial time (O(N^4)) algorithm for unpseudoknotted multiple (O(1)) strand MFE, answering the open problem from Dirks et al. The challenge lies in considering rotational symmetry of secondary structures, a feature not immediately amenable to dynamic programming algorithms. Our proof has two main technical contributions: First, a polynomial upper bound on the number of symmetric secondary structures to be considered when computing rotational symmetry penalties. Second, that bound is leveraged by a backtracking algorithm to find the MFE in an exponential space of contenders. Our MFE algorithm has the same asymptotic run time as Dirks et al's partition function algorithm, suggesting efficient handling of rotational symmetry, although higher space complexity. It also seems reasonably tight in the number of strands since Codon, Hajiaghayi &amp; Thachuk [DNA27, 2021] have shown that unpseudoknotted MFE is NP-hard for O(N) strands.</description>

      <title>Information dissemination and confusion in signed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of information dissemination in signed networks. It is a discrete-time process in which uninformed actors incrementally receive information from their informed neighbors or from the outside. Our goal is to minimize the number of confused actors - that is, the number of actors who receive contradictory information. We prove upper bounds for the number of confused actors in signed networks and in equivalence classes of signed networks. In particular, we show that there are signed networks where, for any information placement strategy, almost 60\% of the actors are confused. Furthermore, this is also the case when considering the minimum number of confused actors within an equivalence class of signed graphs.</description>

      <title>Refining Boolean models with the partial most permissive scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation:
  In systems biology, modelling strategies aim to decode how molecular components interact to generate dynamical behaviour. Boolean modelling is more and more used, but the description of the dynamics from two-levels components may be too limited to capture certain dynamical properties. %However, in Boolean models, the description of the dynamics may be too limited to capture certain dynamical properties. Multivalued logical models can overcome this limitation by allowing more than two levels for each component. However, multivaluing a Boolean model is challenging.
  Results: We present MRBM, a method for efficiently identifying the components of a Boolean model to be multivalued in order to capture specific fixed-point reachabilities in the asynchronous dynamics. To this goal, we defined a new updating scheme locating reachability properties in the most permissive dynamics. MRBM is supported by mathematical demonstrations and illustrated on a toy model and on two models of stem cell differentiation.</description>

      <title>Partial Implementation of Max Flow and Min Cost Flow in Almost-Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2022, Chen et al. proposed an algorithm in \cite{main} that solves the min cost flow problem in $m^{1 + o(1)} \log U \log C$ time, where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph, $U$ is an upper bound on capacities and $C$ is an upper bound on costs. However, as far as the authors of \cite{main} know, no one has implemented their algorithm to date. In this paper, we discuss implementations of several key portions of the algorithm given in \cite{main}, including the justifications for specific implementation choices. For the portions of the algorithm that we do not implement, we provide stubs. We then go through the entire algorithm and calculate the $m^{o(1)}$ term more precisely. Finally, we conclude with potential directions for future work in this area.</description>

      <title>On the twin-width of smooth manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on Whitney's classical method of triangulating smooth manifolds, we show that every compact $d$-dimensional smooth manifold admits a triangulation with dual graph of twin-width at most $d^{O(d)}$. In particular, it follows that every compact 3-manifold has a triangulation with dual graph of bounded twin-width. This is in sharp contrast to the case of treewidth, where for any natural number $n$ there exists a closed 3-manifold such that every triangulation thereof has dual graph with treewidth at least $n$. To establish this result, we bound the twin-width of the incidence graph of the $d$-skeleton of the second barycentric subdivision of the $2d$-dimensional hypercubic honeycomb. We also show that every compact, piecewise-linear (hence smooth) $d$-dimensional manifold has triangulations where the dual graph has an arbitrarily large twin-width.</description>

      <title>Isometric Cycles and a Generalization of Moore Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equator of a graph is the length of a longest isometric cycle. We bound the order $n$ of a graph from below by its equator $q$, girth $g$ and minimum degree $\delta$ - and show that this bound is sharp when there exists a Moore graph with girth $g$ and minimum degree $\delta$. The extremal graphs that attain our bound give an analogue of Moore graphs. We prove that these extremal `Moore-like' graphs are regular, and that every one of their vertices is contained in some maximum length isometric cycle. We show that these extremal graphs have a highly structured partition that is unique, and easily derived from any of its maximum length isometric cycles. We characterize the extremal graphs with girth 3 and 4, and those with girth 5 and minimum degree 3. We also bound the order of $C_4$-free graphs with given equator and minimum degree, and show that this bound is nearly sharp. We conclude with some questions and conjectures further relating our extremal graphs to cages and Moore graphs.</description>

Abstract: We say a finite word $x$ is a palindromic periodicity if there exist two palindromes $p$ and $s$ such that $|x| \geq |ps|$ and $x$ is a prefix of the word $(ps)^\omega = pspsps\cdots$. In this paper we examine the palindromic periodicities occurring in some classical infinite words, such as Sturmian words, episturmian words, the Thue-Morse word, the period-doubling word, the Rudin-Shapiro word, the paperfolding word, and the Tribonacci word, and prove a number of results about them.</description>

      <title>On full-separating sets in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several different types of identification problems have been already studied in the literature, where the objective is to distinguish any two vertices of a graph by their unique neighborhoods in a suitably chosen dominating or total-dominating set of the graph, often referred to as a \emph{code}. To study such problems under a unifying point of view, reformulations of the already studied problems in terms of covering problems in suitably constructed hypergraphs have been provided. Analyzing these hypergraph representations, we introduce a new separation property, called \emph{full-separation}, which has not yet been considered in the literature so far. We study it in combination with both domination and total-domination, and call the resulting codes \emph{full-separating-dominating codes} (or \emph{FD-codes} for short) and \emph{full-separating-total-dominating codes} (or \emph{FTD-codes} for short), respectively. We address the conditions for the existence of FD- and FTD-codes, bounds for their size and their relation to codes of the other types. We show that the problems of determining an FD- or an FTD-code of minimum cardinality in a graph is NP-hard. We also show that the cardinalities of minimum FD- and FTD-codes differ by at most one, but that it is NP-complete to decide if they are equal for a given graph in general. We find the exact values of minimum cardinalities of the FD- and FTD-codes on some familiar graph classes like paths, cycles, half-graphs and spiders. This helps us compare the two codes with other codes on these graph families thereby exhibiting extremal cases for several lower bounds.</description>

      <title>NPA Hierarchy for Quantum Isomorphism and Homomorphism Indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Man\v{c}inska and Roberson~[FOCS'20] showed that two graphs are quantum isomorphic if and only if they are homomorphism indistinguishable over the class of planar graphs. Atserias et al.~[JCTB'19] proved that quantum isomorphism is undecidable in general. The NPA hierarchy gives a sequence of semidefinite programming relaxations of quantum isomorphism. Recently, Roberson and Seppelt~[ICALP'23] obtained a homomorphism indistinguishability characterization of the feasibility of each level of the Lasserre hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations of graph isomorphism. We prove a quantum analogue of this result by showing that each level of the NPA hierarchy of SDP relaxations for quantum isomorphism of graphs is equivalent to homomorphism indistinguishability over an appropriate class of planar graphs. By combining the convergence of the NPA hierarchy with the fact that the union of these graph classes is the set of all planar graphs, we are able to give a new proof of the result of Man\v{c}inska and Roberson~[FOCS'20] that avoids the use of the theory of quantum groups. This homomorphism indistinguishability characterization also allows us to give a randomized polynomial-time algorithm deciding exact feasibility of each fixed level of the NPA hierarchy of SDP relaxations for quantum isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds for the Network Scale-Up Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epidemiologists and social scientists have used the Network Scale-Up Method (NSUM) for over thirty years to estimate the size of a hidden sub-population within a social network. This method involves querying a subset of network nodes about the number of their neighbours belonging to the hidden sub-population. In general, NSUM assumes that the social network topology and the hidden sub-population distribution are well-behaved; hence, the NSUM estimate is close to the actual value. However, bounds on NSUM estimation errors have not been analytically proven. This paper provides analytical bounds on the error incurred by the two most popular NSUM estimators. These bounds assume that the queried nodes accurately provide their degree and the number of neighbors belonging to the hidden population. Our key findings are twofold. First, we show that when an adversary designs the network and places the hidden sub-population, then the estimate can be a factor of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ off from the real value (in a network with $n$ nodes). Second, we also prove error bounds when the underlying network is randomly generated, showing that a small constant factor can be achieved with high probability using samples of logarithmic size $O(\log{n})$. We present improved analytical bounds for Erdos-Renyi and Scale-Free networks. Our theoretical analysis is supported by an extensive set of numerical experiments designed to determine the effect of the sample size on the accuracy of the estimates in both synthetic and real networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dominating sets in graphs are often used to model some monitoring of the graph: guards are posted on the vertices of the dominating set, and they can thus react to attacks occurring on the unguarded vertices by moving there (yielding a new set of guards, which may not be dominating anymore). A dominating set is eternal if it can endlessly resist to attacks. From the attacker's perspective, if we are given a non-eternal dominating set, the question is to determine how fast can we provoke an attack that cannot be handled by a neighboring guard. We investigate this question from a computational complexity point of view, by showing that this question is PSPACE-hard, even for graph classes where finding a minimum eternal dominating set is in P. We then complement this result by giving polynomial time algorithms for cographs and trees, and showing a connection with tree-depth for the latter. We also investigate the problem from a parameterized complexity perspective, mainly considering two parameters: the number of guards and the number of steps.</description>

      <title>Sparse High Dimensional Expanders via Local Lifts</title>

Abstract: High dimensional expanders (HDXs) are a hypergraph generalization of expander graphs. They are extensively studied in the math and TCS communities due to their many applications. Like expander graphs, HDXs are especially interesting for applications when they are bounded degree, namely, if the number of edges adjacent to every vertex is bounded. However, only a handful of constructions are known to have this property, all of which rely on algebraic techniques. In particular, no random or combinatorial construction of bounded degree HDXs is known. As a result, our understanding of these objects is limited. The degree of an $i$-face in an HDX is the number of $(i+1)$-faces containing it. In this work we construct HDXs whose higher dimensional faces have bounded degree. This is done by giving an elementary and deterministic algorithm that takes as input a regular $k$-dimensional HDX $X$ and outputs another $k$-dimensional HDX $\widehat{X}$ with twice as many vertices. While the degree of vertices in $\widehat{X}$ grows, the degree of the $(k-1)$-faces in $\widehat{X}$ stays the same. As a result, we obtain a new `algebra-free' construction of HDXs whose $(k-1)$-face degree is bounded. Our algorithm is based on a simple and natural generalization of the construction by Bilu and Linial (Combinatorica, 2006), which build expanders using lifts coming from edge signings. Our construction is based on local lifts of HDXs, where a local lift is a complex whose top-level links are lifts of links in the original complex. We demonstrate that a local lift of an HDX is an HDX in many cases. In addition, combining local lifts with existing bounded degree constructions creates new families of bounded degree HDXs with significantly different links than before. For every large enough $D$, we use this technique to construct families of bounded degree HDXs with links that have diameter $\geq D$.</description>

Abstract: A pair $(A,B)$ of hypergraphs is called orthogonal if $|a \cap b|=1$ for every pair of edges $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. An orthogonal pair of hypergraphs is called a loom if each of its two members is the set of minimum covers of the other. Looms appear naturally in the context of a conjecture of Gy\'arf\'as and Lehel on the covering number of cross-intersecting hypergraphs. We study their properties and ways of construction, and prove special cases of a conjecture that if true would imply the Gy\'arf\'as--Lehel conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We prove optimal concentration of measure for lifted functions on high dimensional expanders (HDX). Let $X$ be a $k$-dimensional HDX. We show for any $i\leq k$ and $f:X(i)\to [0,1]$: \[\Pr_{s\in X(k)}\left[\left|\underset{{t\subseteq s}}{\mathbb{E}}[f(t)]-\mu\right|\geq\varepsilon\right]\leq exp\left(-\varepsilon^2\frac{k}{i}\right).\] Using this fact, we prove that high dimensional expanders are reverse hypercontractive, a powerful functional inequality from discrete analysis implying that for any sets $A,B \subset X(k)$, the probability a $\rho$-correlated pair passes between them is at least \[\Pr_{s,s' \sim T_\rho}[s \in A, s' \in B] \geq \Pr[A]^{O(1)} \Pr[B]^{O(1)}.\] Our results hold under weak spectral assumptions on $X$. Namely we prove exponential concentration of measure for any complex below the `Trickling-Down Threshold' (beyond which concentration may be arbitrarily poor), and optimal concentration for $\sqrt{k}$-skeletons of such complexes. We also show optimal bounds for the top dimension of stronger HDX among other settings. We leverage our inequalities to prove several new agreement testing theorems on high dimensional expanders, including a new 99%-regime test for subsets, and a variant of the `Z-test' achieving inverse exponential soundness under the stronger assumption of $\ell_\infty$-expansion. The latter gives rise to the first optimal testers beyond the complete complex and products, a stepping stone toward the use of HDX in strong soundness PCPs. We also give applications within expansion, analysis, combinatorics, and coding theory, including a proof that two-sided HDX have optimal geometric overlap (giving the first explicit bounded-degree construction), near-optimal double samplers, new super-exponential degree lower bounds for certain HDX, distance-amplified list-decodable and locally testable codes, a Frankl-R\"odl Theorem and more.</description>
