      <title>SuperFlow: A Fully-Customized RTL-to-GDS Design Automation Flow for Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits, like Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron (AQFP), offer exceptional energy efficiency but face challenges in physical design due to sophisticated spacing and timing constraints. Current design tools often neglect the importance of constraint adherence throughout the entire design flow. In this paper, we propose SuperFlow, a fully-customized RTL-to-GDS design flow tailored for AQFP devices. SuperFlow leverages a synthesis tool based on CMOS technology to transform any input RTL netlist to an AQFP-based netlist. Subsequently, we devise a novel place-and-route procedure that simultaneously considers wirelength, timing, and routability for AQFP circuits. The process culminates in the generation of the AQFP circuit layout, followed by a Design Rule Check (DRC) to identify and rectify any layout violations. Our experimental results demonstrate that SuperFlow achieves 12.8% wirelength improvement on average and 12.1% better timing quality compared with previous state-of-the-art placers for AQFP circuits.</description>

      <title>Application of the Digital Annealer Unit in Optimizing Chemical Reaction Conditions for Enhanced Production Yields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding appropriate reaction conditions that yield high product rates in chemical synthesis is crucial for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. However, due to the vast chemical space, conducting experiments for each possible reaction condition is impractical. Consequently, models such as QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) or ML (Machine Learning) have been developed to predict the outcomes of reactions and illustrate how reaction conditions affect product yield. Despite these advancements, inferring all possible combinations remains computationally prohibitive when using a conventional CPU. In this work, we explore using a Digital Annealing Unit (DAU) to tackle these large-scale optimization problems more efficiently by solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). Two types of QUBO models are constructed in this work: one using quantum annealing and the other using ML. Both models are built and tested on four high-throughput experimentation (HTE) datasets and selected Reaxys datasets. Our results suggest that the performance of models is comparable to classical ML methods (i.e., Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)), while the inference time of our models requires only seconds with a DAU. Additionally, in campaigns involving active learning and autonomous design of reaction conditions to achieve higher reaction yield, our model demonstrates significant improvements by adding new data, showing promise of adopting our method in the iterative nature of such problem settings. Our method can also accelerate the screening of billions of reaction conditions, achieving speeds millions of times faster than traditional computing units in identifying superior conditions. Therefore, leveraging the DAU with our developed QUBO models has the potential to be a valuable tool for innovative chemical synthesis.</description>

      <title>A Sensitivity Analysis of Cellular Automata and Heterogeneous Topology Networks: Partially-Local Cellular Automata and Homogeneous Homogeneous Random Boolean Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA) are a well-studied computational universe that is, despite its simple configurations, capable of impressive computational variety. Harvesting this computation in a useful way has historically shown itself to be difficult, but if combined with reservoir computing (RC), this becomes much more feasible. Furthermore, RC and ECA enable energy-efficient AI, making the combination a promising concept for Edge AI. In this work, we contrast ECA to substrates of Partially-Local CA (PLCA) and Homogeneous Homogeneous Random Boolean Networks (HHRBN). They are, in comparison, the topological heterogeneous counterparts of ECA. This represents a step from ECA towards more biological-plausible substrates. We analyse these substrates by testing on an RC benchmark (5-bit memory), using Temporal Derrida plots to estimate the sensitivity and assess the defect collapse rate. We find that, counterintuitively, disordered topology does not necessarily mean disordered computation. There are countering computational "forces" of topology imperfections leading to a higher collapse rate (order) and yet, if accounted for, an increased sensitivity to the initial condition. These observations together suggest a shrinking critical range.</description>

      <title>IRIS: Wireless Ring for Vision-based Smart Home Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating cameras into wireless smart rings has been challenging due to size and power constraints. We introduce IRIS, the first wireless vision-enabled smart ring system for smart home interactions. Equipped with a camera, Bluetooth radio, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and an onboard battery, IRIS meets the small size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements for ring devices. IRIS is context-aware, adapting its gesture set to the detected device, and can last for 16-24 hours on a single charge. IRIS leverages the scene semantics to achieve instance-level device recognition. In a study involving 23 participants, IRIS consistently outpaced voice commands, with a higher proportion of participants expressing a preference for IRIS over voice commands regarding toggling a device's state, granular control, and social acceptability. Our work pushes the boundary of what is possible with ring form-factor devices, addressing system challenges and opening up novel interaction capabilities.</description>
