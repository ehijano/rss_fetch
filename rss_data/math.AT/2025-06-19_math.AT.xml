      <title>Data analysis using discrete cubical homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new tool for data analysis: persistence discrete homology, which is well-suited to analyze filtrations of graphs. In particular, we provide a novel way of representing high-dimensional data as a filtration of graphs using pairwise correlations. We discuss several applications of these tools, e.g., in weather and financial data, comparing them to the standard methods used in the respective fields.</description>

      <title>Cutting and pasting pairs of manifolds with tangential structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies cutting and pasting groups (SK-groups) of pairs of manifolds. By a pair of manifolds we mean a manifold with a submanifold of strictly smaller dimension. Existing results in the unoriented category by Komiya are generalized to manifolds with certain tangential structures. In this way multiple new splitting results for SK of pairs are obtained, in particular for SK of pairs of manifolds with a map to a reference space. We also prove that SK of manifolds with a map into $X\times Y$ with $Y$ simply connected is the same as SK of manifolds with map into $X$. This generalizes the result of Neumann that SK of manifolds with a map into a simply connected space is trivial.</description>

      <title>Fractal dimensions of complex networks: advocating for a topological approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) uses insights from topology to create representations of data able to capture global and local geometric and topological properties. Its methods have successfully been used to develop estimations of fractal dimensions for metric spaces that have been shown to outperform existing techniques. In a parallel line of work, networks are ubiquitously used to model a variety of complex systems. Higher-order interactions, i.e., simultaneous interactions between more than two nodes, are wide-spread in social and biological systems, and simplicial complexes, used in TDA, can capture important structural and topological properties of networks by modelling such higher-order interactions. In this position paper, we advocate for methods from TDA to be used to estimate fractal dimensions of complex networks, we discuss the possible advantages of such an approach and outline some of the challenges to be addressed.</description>

      <title>Homotopy types of moment-angle complexes associated to almost linear resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Hurewicz image in the homology of a moment-angle complex, when passed through an isomorphism with the Ext-module of the corresponding Stanley-Reisner ideal, contains the linear strand of this ideal. This recovers and refines results of various authors identifying the homotopy type of a moment-angle complex as a wedge of spheres when the underlying ideal satisfies certain linearity properties. Going further, we study the homotopy types of moment-angle manifolds associated to Gorenstein Stanley-Reisner ideals with (componentwise) almost linear resolutions. The simplicial complexes that give rise to these manifolds are part of an even larger class that we introduce, which generalises the homological behaviour of cyclic polytopes, stacked polytopes and odd-dimensional neighbourly sphere triangulations. For these simplicial complexes the associated moment-angle manifolds are shown to be formal, having the rational homotopy type of connected sums of sphere products, and the (integral) loop space homotopy type of products of spheres and loop spaces of spheres. Along the way we establish a number of purely algebraic results, in particular generalising a result of R\"omer characterising Koszul modules so that it can be applied to modules with almost linear resolutions.</description>

      <title>$p$-local decompositions of looped polyhedral products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that localised away from a finite set of primes, the loop space of a moment-angle complex is homotopy equivalent to a product of loops on spheres. This verifies a conjecture of Anick for such spaces. We also develop a method to reduce the study of the loops of more general polyhedral products to that of the loops on a moment-angle complex. As a consequence, we give $p$-local loop space decompositions of a wide family of polyhedral products, quasitoric manifolds and simply connected toric orbifolds. We also describe the additive structure of loop homology of simply connected polyhedral products in terms of polynomials studied by Backelin and Berglund.</description>

      <title>Models for cyclic infinity operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct model structures on cyclic dendroidal sets and cyclic dendroidal spaces for cyclic quasi-operads and complete cyclic dendroidal Segal spaces, respectively. We show these models are Quillen equivalent to the model structure for simplicial cyclic operads. This answers in the affirmative a question of the second author and Drummond-Cole concerning model structures for cyclic $\infty$-operads. We infer similar statements for planar cyclic $\infty$-operads, providing the model-categorical foundation needed to complete Walde's program on the relationship between cyclic 2-Segal spaces and planar cyclic $\infty$-operads.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we construct a combinatorial quasi-free differential graded model for the Orlik-Solomon algebra of supersolvable matroids, which generalizes in a matroidal setting the cdga of admissible graphs introduced by M. Kontsevich for the braid arrangements. Our construction draws on well-known concepts from matroid theory, including modularity, single-element extensions, and generalized parallel connections. We also show that this model carries a cooperadic structure in a suitably generalized sense. As an application, we use this model to give a new proof that the Orlik-Solomon algebras of supersolvable matroids are Koszul.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an arbitrary finite group G, we consider a suitable notion of Gromov Hausdorff distance between compact G-metric spaces and derive lower bounds based on equivariant topology methods. As applications, we prove equivariant rigidity and finiteness theorems, and obtain sharp bounds on the Gromov Hausdorff distance between spheres.</description>

      <title>Stabilizations of $\mathbb{E}_\infty$ Operads and $p$-Adic Stable Homotopy Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.08941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study differential graded operads and $p$-adic stable homotopy theory. We first construct a new class of differential graded operads, which we call the stable operads. These operads are, in a particular sense, stabilizations of $\mathbb{E}_\infty$ operads. For example, we construct a stable Barratt-Eccles operad. We develop a homotopy theory of algebras over these stable operads and a theory of (co)homology operations for algebras over these stable operads. We note interesting properties of these operads, such as that, non-equivariantly, in each arity, they have (almost) trivial homology, whereas, equivariantly, these homologies sum to a certain completion of the generalized Steenrod algebra and so are highly non-trivial. We also justify the adjective "stable" by showing that, among other things, the monads associated to these operads are additive in the homotopy coherent, or $\infty$-, sense. We then provide an application of our stable operads to $p$-adic stable homotopy theory. It is well-known that cochains on spaces yield examples of algebras over $\mathbb{E}_\infty$ operads. We show that in the stable case, cochains on spectra yield examples of algebras over our stable operads. Moreover, a result of Mandell says that, endowed with the $\mathbb{E}_\infty$ algebraic structure, cochains on spaces provide algebraic models of $p$-adic homotopy types. We show that, endowed with the algebraic structure encoded by our stable operads, spectral cochains provide algebraic models for $p$-adic stable homotopy types.</description>

      <title>Leibniz rule for wedge product in discrete exterior calculus on general polygonal meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete exterior calculus offers a coordinate-free discretization of exterior calculus especially suited for computations on curved spaces. In this work, we present a wedge product on 2-dimensional pseudomanifolds, whose faces are any polygons. We prove that this polygonal wedge product is compatible with the discrete exterior derivative in the sense that it satisfies the Leibniz product rule. We thus extend previously studied discretizations of wedge products from simplicial or quadrilateral meshes to general polygonal surface meshes. We also prove that our discrete wedge product corresponds to a cup product of cochains on 2-pseudomanifolds.</description>

      <title>Equivariant aspects of de-completing cyclic homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Derived de Rham cohomology turns out to be important in p-adic geometry, following Bhatt's discovery [Bha12] of conjugate filtration in char p, de-Hodge-completing results in [Bei12]. In [Kal18], Kaledin introduced an analogous de-completion of the periodic cyclic homology, called the polynomial periodic cyclic homology, equipped with a conjugate filtration in char p, and expected to be related to derived de Rham cohomology. In this article, using genuine equivariant homotopy structure on Hochschild homology as in [ABG+18, BHM22], we give an equivariant description of Kaledin's polynomial periodic cyclic homology. This leads to Morita invariance without any Noetherianness assumption as in [Kal18], and the comparison to derived de Rham cohomology becomes transparent. Moreover, this description adapts directly to "topological" analogues, which gives rise to a de-Nygaard-completion of the topological periodic cyclic homology. We compare it to topological Hochschild homology over $\mathbb F_p$, and produce a conjugate filtration in char p from our description.</description>

      <title>Exponential actions defined by vector configurations, Gale duality, and moment-angle manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exponential actions defined by vector configurations provide a universal framework for several constructions of holomorphic dynamics, non-Kaehler complex geometry, toric geometry and topology. These include leaf spaces of holomorphic foliations, intersections of real and Hermitian quadrics, the quotient construction of simplicial toric varieties, LVM and LVMB manifolds, complex-analytic structures on moment-angle manifolds and their partial quotients. In all of these cases, the geometry and topology of the appropriate quotient object can be described by combinatorial data including a pair of Gale dual vector configurations.</description>
