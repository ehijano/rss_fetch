      <title>Network Community Detection and Novelty Scoring Reveal Underexplored Hub Genes in Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the modular structure and central elements of complex biological networks is critical for uncovering system-level mechanisms in disease. Here, we constructed weighted gene co-expression networks from bulk RNA-seq data of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial tissue, using pairwise correlation and a percolation-guided thresholding strategy. Community detection with Louvain and Leiden algorithms revealed robust modules, and node-strength ranking identified the top 50 hub genes globally and within communities. To assess novelty, we integrated genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with literature-based evidence from PubMed, highlighting five high-centrality genes with little to no prior RA-specific association. Functional enrichment confirmed their roles in immune-related processes, including adaptive immune response and lymphocyte regulation. Notably, these hubs showed strong positive correlations with T- and B-cell markers and negative correlations with NK-cell markers, consistent with RA immunopathology. Overall, our framework demonstrates how correlation-based network construction, modularity-driven clustering, and centrality-guided novelty scoring can jointly reveal informative structure in omics-scale data. This generalizable approach offers a scalable path to gene prioritization in RA and other autoimmune conditions.</description>

      <title>Rule-Based Gillespie Simulation of Chemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The M{\O}D computational framework implements rule-based generative chemistries as explicit transformations of graphs representing chemical structural formulae. Here, we expand M{\O}D by a stochastic simulation module that simulates the time evolution of species concentrations using Gillespie's well-known stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA). This module distinguishes itself among competing implementations of rule-based stochastic simulation engines by its flexible network expansion mechanism and its functionality for defining custom reaction rate functions. It enables direct sampling from actual reactions instead of rules. We present methodology and implementation details followed by examples which demonstrate the capabilities of the stochastic simulation engine.</description>

      <title>BoolForge: Random Generation and Analysis of Boolean Functions and Networks in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boolean networks are a powerful and popular modeling framework in systems biology, enabling the study of complex processes underlying gene regulation, signal transduction, and cellular decision-making. Most biological networks exhibit a high degree of canalization, a property of the Boolean update rules that stabilizes network dynamics. Despite its importance, existing software packages provide hardly any support for generating Boolean networks with defined canalization properties.
  We present BoolForge, a Python toolbox for the analysis and random generation of Boolean functions and networks, with a particular focus on canalization. BoolForge allows users to (i) generate random Boolean functions with specified canalizing depth, layer structure, or other structural constraints; (ii) construct random Boolean networks with tunable topological and functional properties; and (iii) compute structural and dynamical features including network attractors, robustness, and modularity. BoolForge enables researchers to rapidly prototype biological Boolean network models, explore the relationship between structure and dynamics, and generate ensembles of networks for statistical analysis. It is lightweight, adaptable, and fully compatible with existing Boolean network analysis tools.
  BoolForge is implemented in Python (version3.8+), with no platform-specific dependencies. The software is distributed under the MIT License and will be maintained for at least two years following publication. Source code, documentation, and tutorial notebooks are freely available at: https://github.com/ckadelka/BoolForge. BoolForge can be installed via pip install git+https://github.com/ckadelka/BoolForge.</description>

      <title>Biological Pathway Informed Models with Graph Attention Networks (GATs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological pathways map gene-gene interactions that govern all human processes. Despite their importance, most ML models treat genes as unstructured tokens, discarding known pathway structure. The latest pathway-informed models capture pathway-pathway interactions, but still treat each pathway as a "bag of genes" via MLPs, discarding its topology and gene-gene interactions. We propose a Graph Attention Network (GAT) framework that models pathways at the gene level. We show that GATs generalize much better than MLPs, achieving an 81% reduction in MSE when predicting pathway dynamics under unseen treatment conditions. We further validate the correctness of our biological prior by encoding drug mechanisms via edge interventions, boosting model robustness. Finally, we show that our GAT model is able to correctly rediscover all five gene-gene interactions in the canonical TP53-MDM2-MDM4 feedback loop from raw time-series mRNA data, demonstrating potential to generate novel biological hypotheses directly from experimental data.</description>

      <title>Noise equals control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15670v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise plays the role of control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, this leads to a precise mathematical mapping: the most probable trajectory between two states minimizes an action functional and corresponds to an optimal control strategy. In Langevin dynamics, the noise term itself serves as the control. For general Markov jump processes, such as chemical reaction networks or electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Peliti formalism to identify the `response' (or `momentum') field $\pi$ as the control variable. This resolves a long-standing interpretational problem in the field-theoretic description of stochastic systems: although $\pi$ evolves backward in time, it has a clear physical role as the control that steers the system along rare trajectories. This implies that Nature is constantly sampling control strategies. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks, systems with unstable fixed points, and specifically on stochastic resonance and Brownian ratchets. The noise-control mapping justifies agential descriptions of these phenomena, and builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why probabilities are generically non-smooth functions of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agential behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism.</description>
