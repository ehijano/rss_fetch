      <title>Linearization, separability and Lax pairs representation of $a_4^{(2)}$ Toda lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is focused on linearizing and found the Lax Pairs of the algebraic complete integrability (a.c.i) Toda lattice associated with the twisted affine Lie algebra \(a_4^{\left(2\right)}\). Firstly, we recall that our case of a.c.i is a two-dimensional algebraic completely integrable systems for which the invariant (real) tori can be extended to complex algebraic tori (abelian surfaces). This implies that the geometry can be used to study this system. Secondly, we show that the lattice is related to the Mumford system and we construct an explicit morphism between these systems, leading to a new Poisson structure for the Mumford system. Finally, we give a new Lax equation for this Toda lattice and we construct an explicit linearization of the system.</description>

      <title>Exploring the depths of symmetry in the mKdV equation: physical interpretations and multi-wave solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript embarks on an in-depth exploration of the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation, with a particular emphasis on unraveling the intricate structure of its infinite symmetries and their physical interpretations. Central to this investigation are the $K$-symmetries and $\tau$-symmetries, which are delineated by a recursive relationship and constitute an infinite ensemble that underpins the conservation laws. We engage with an existing symmetry conjecture, which posits that the currently identified symmetries represent a subset of a more expansive, yet to be unearthed, set. This conjecture is substantiated through an analysis of the soliton solutions associated with the mKdV equation, demonstrating that these symmetries can be decomposed into linear combinations of center and wave number translation symmetries. Further, by imposing an infinite sequence of symmetry constraints, it becomes feasible to derive exact multi-wave solutions. This methodology, predicated on the proposed symmetry conjecture, facilitates the extraction of exact solutions, encompassing complexiton, breather, multi-soliton solutions, among others.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium of Charges and Differential Equations Solved by Polynomials II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01494v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue study of equilibrium of two species of 2d coulomb charges (or point vortices in 2d ideal fluid) started in [20]. Although for two species of vortices with circulation ratio -1 the relationship between the equilibria and the factorization/Darboux transformation of the Schrodinger operator was established a long ago, the question about similar relationship for the ratio -2 remained unanswered. Here we present the answer: One has to consider Darboux-type transformations of third order differential operators rather than second order Schrodinger operators. Furthermore, we show that such transformations can also generate equilibrium configurations where an additional charge of a third specie is present. Relationship with integrable hierarchies is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Exact solvability of an Ising-type model, and exact solvability of the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle coordinates for an Ising type model whose L-operator has been previously studied in the literature by Bazhanov and Sergeev. In comparison to computations with such operators that have been examined previously by the author for the 4-vertex, 6-vertex, and 20-vertex, models, computations for asymptotically approximating a collection of sixteen identities with the Poisson bracket, which together constitute the Poisson structure of the Ising type model, exhibit dependencies upon nearest neighbor interactions. Inspite of the fact that L-operators for the 20-vertex model are defined in terms of combinatorial, and algebraic, constituents unlike such operators for the 6-vertex model which are defined in terms of projectors and Pauli basis elements, L-operators for the Ising-type model can be used for concluding that a model which interpolates between the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models is exactly solvable.</description>

      <title>Riemann--Hilbert method to the Ablowitz--Ladik equation: higher-order case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focused on the Ablowitz--Ladik equation on a zero background, specifically considering the scenario of $N$ pairs of multiple poles. Our first goal was to establish a mapping between the initial data and the scattering data. This allowed us to introduce a direct problem by analyzing the discrete spectrum associated with $N$ pairs of higher-order zeros. Next, we constructed another mapping from the scattering data to a $2\times2$ matrix Riemann--Hilbert problem equipped with several residue conditions set at $N$ pairs of multiple poles. By characterizing the inverse problem based on this Riemann--Hilbert problem, we were able to derive higher-order soliton solutions in the reflectionless case. Furthermore, we expressed an infinite-order soliton solution using a special Riemann--Hilbert problem formulation.</description>

Abstract: For the isospectral Darboux transformations of the discrete quantum mechanics with real shifts, there are two methods: type I and type II constructions. Based on the type I construction, the type I multi-indexed little $q$-Jacobi and little $q$-Laguerre orthogonal polynomials were presented in J. Phys. {\bf A50} (2017) 165204. Based on the type II construction, we present the type II multi-indexed little $q$-Jacobi and little $q$-Laguerre orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>Computation of $\wp$-functions on plane algebraic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05632v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical tools for computation of $\wp$-functions, also known as Kleinian, or multiply periodic, are proposed. In this connection, computation of periods of the both first and second kinds is reconsidered. An analytical approach to constructing Riemann surfaces of plane algebraic curves of low gonalities is used. The approach is based on explicit radical solutions to quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations, which serve for hyperelliptic, trigonal, and tetragonal curves, respectively. The proposed analytical models of Riemann surfaces give full control over computation of the Abel image of any point or divisor. Therefore, computation of $\wp$-functions at Abel images of given divisors can be done directly. An alternative computation with the help of the Jacobi inversion problem is used for verification. Hyperelliptic and trigonal curves are considered in detail, and illustrated by examples. A method of finding the unique characteristic corresponding to the vector of Riemann constants is suggested for non-hyperelliptic and hyperelliptic curves.</description>

      <title>Rational Ruijsenaars-Schneider model with cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ruijsenaars-Schneider models are integrable dynamical realizations of the Poincare group in 1+1 dimensions, which reduce to the Calogero and Sutherland systems in the nonrelativistic limit. In this work, a possibility to construct a one-parameter deformation of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider models by uplifting the Poincare algebra in 1+1 dimensions to the anti de Sitter algebra is studied. It is shown that amendments including a cosmological constant are feasible for the rational variant, while the hyperbolic and trigonometric systems are ruled out by our analysis. The issue of integrability of the deformed rational model is discussed in some detail. A complete proof of integrability remains a challenge.</description>

      <title>All 4 x 4 solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we complete the classification of 4 x 4 solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Regular solutions were recently classified and in this paper we find the remaining non-regular solutions. We present several new solutions, then consider regular and non-regular Lax operators and study their relation to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We show that for regular solutions there is a correspondence, which is lost in the non-regular case. In particular, we find non-regular Lax operators whose R-matrix from the fundamental commutation relations is regular but does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. These R-matrices satisfy a modified Yang-Baxter equation instead.</description>
