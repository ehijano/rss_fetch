      <title>Immunometabolic Gatekeeping: Reconciling Peto's &amp; the T-cell Infiltration Prognostic Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical models of cancer focus on tumour-intrinsic genetic aberrations and immune dynamics and often overlook how the metabolic environment of healthy tissues shapes tumour development and immune efficacy. Here, we propose that tissue-intrinsic metabolic intensity and waste-handling capacity act as an upstream gatekeeper of anti-tumour immunity, determining whether immune infiltration translates into effective immune function and safeguards the tissue from tumourigenesis. Across human cancers, tumours arising in high-metabolism tissues - like kidney, brain, and eye - tend to show high T cell infiltration but poor prognosis, suggesting pre-existing metabolic environments prior to malignant transformation may undermine immune function. This pattern is mirrored across species: large mammals with lower mass-specific metabolic rates (e.g., elephants, whales) accumulate fewer metabolic byproducts and show lower cancer incidence (Peto's paradox), while long-lived small mammals like bats and naked mole-rats resist tumourigenesis via suppressed glycolysis or altered hypoxia responses leading to lower metabolic rates and/or byproduct accumulation. Through integrative synthesis spanning human single-cell expression data and cross-species comparisons, we outline a framework of 'immunometabolic gatekeeping', where tissues with high metabolic rate and poor waste clearance foster immune-exhausting niches even before transformation. This unifying framework reconciles multiple paradoxes in cancer biology: Peto's paradox, T cell infiltration non-prognosticity, tissue tropisms, and sex-based inequalities, and suggests new principles for identifying high-risk patients and metabolic-immune combination strategies for prevention and treatment. By shifting focus from tumour-intrinsic mutations to host-tissue metabolism, this work offers a novel, integrative lens on cancer vulnerability and immune failure.</description>

      <title>Geometric Confinement Reveals Scale-Free Velocity Correlations in Epithelial Cell Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective cell flows are a hallmark of tissue dynamics in development, wound healing, and various diseases. Here, we perform experiments on epithelial MDCK cell monolayers, over tens of hours without jamming, on millimeter-scale micropatterned substrates with or without free front (a strip or a closed racetrack). During maturation in time, domains and long-range correlations of the velocity field appear. Enstrophy increases (along with kinetic energy) during 5 hours, then passes through a maximum and decreases. Spatial velocity correlations are scale-free, following a power law, which challenges the notion of a single intrinsic correlation length. It suggests that the monolayer behaves as a critical-like system where information is transmitted across its entire size, a feature consistent with models of active solids capable of long-range stress propagation. The spatial correlation exponent significantly evolves with time, probably reflecting the monolayer maturation. The size, shape, topology and rigidity of patterned substrate influence the organization of flows and mechanical fields. Spontaneous collective motions are stronger on soft than on hard substrate. The presence of a free front accumulates vimentin on a much larger length scale than a fixed boundary ($65\pm 4$~$\mu$m vs $3.2 \pm 0.7$~$\mu$m), possibly revealing an underlying polarizing cue on the cell velocity field.</description>
