      <title>THEA-Code: an Autoencoder-Based IDS-correcting Code for DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The insertion, deletion, substitution (IDS) correcting code has garnered increased attention due to significant advancements in DNA storage that emerged recently. Despite this, the pursuit of optimal solutions in IDS-correcting codes remains an open challenge, drawing interest from both theoretical and engineering perspectives. This work introduces a pioneering approach named THEA-code. The proposed method follows a heuristic idea of employing an end-to-end autoencoder for the integrated encoding and decoding processes. To address the challenges associated with deploying an autoencoder as an IDS-correcting code, we propose innovative techniques, including the differentiable IDS channel, the entropy constraint on the codeword, and the auxiliary reconstruction of the source sequence. These strategies contribute to the successful convergence of the autoencoder, resulting in a deep learning-based IDS-correcting code with commendable performance. Notably, THEA-Code represents the first instance of a deep learning-based code that is independent of conventional coding frameworks in the IDS-correcting domain. Comprehensive experiments, including an ablation study, provide a detailed analysis and affirm the effectiveness of THEA-Code.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional Graph Linear Canonical Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many multi-dimensional (M-D) graph signals appear in the real world, such as digital images, sensor network measurements and temperature records from weather observation stations. It is a key challenge to design a transform method for processing these graph M-D signals in the linear canonical transform domain. This paper proposes the two-dimensional graph linear canonical transform based on the central discrete dilated Hermite function (2-D CDDHFs-GLCT) and the two-dimensional graph linear canonical transform based on chirp multiplication-chirp convolution-chirp multiplication decomposition (2-D CM-CC-CM-GLCT). Then, extending 2-D CDDHFs-GLCT and 2-D CM-CC-CM-GLCT to M-D CDDHFs-GLCT and M-D CM-CC-CM-GLCT. In terms of the computational complexity, additivity and reversibility, M-D CDDHFs-GLCT and M-D CM-CC-CM-GLCT are compared. Theoretical analysis shows that the computational complexity of M-D CM-CC-CM-GLCT algorithm is obviously reduced. Simulation results indicate that M-D CM-CC-CM-GLCT achieves comparable additivity to M-D CDDHFs-GLCT, while M-D CM-CC-CM-GLCT exhibits better reversibility. Finally, M-D GLCT is applied to data compression to show its application advantages. The experimental results reflect the superiority of M-D GLCT in the algorithm design and implementation of data compression.</description>

      <title>Leave-One-Out Analysis for Nonconvex Robust Matrix Completion with General Thresholding Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of robust matrix completion (RMC), where the partially observed entries of an underlying low-rank matrix is corrupted by sparse noise. Existing analysis of the non-convex methods for this problem either requires the explicit but empirically redundant regularization in the algorithm or requires sample splitting in the analysis. In this paper, we consider a simple yet efficient nonconvex method which alternates between a projected gradient step for the low-rank part and a thresholding step for the sparse noise part. Inspired by leave-one out analysis for low rank matrix completion, it is established that the method can achieve linear convergence for a general class of thresholding functions, including for example soft-thresholding and SCAD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first leave-one-out analysis on a nonconvex method for RMC. Additionally, when applying our result to low rank matrix completion, it improves the sampling complexity of existing result for the singular value projection method.</description>

      <title>Model-based Super-resolution: Towards a Unified Framework for Super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mathematics, a super-resolution problem can be formulated as acquiring high-frequency data from low-frequency measurements. This extrapolation problem in the frequency domain is well-known to be unstable. We propose the model-based super-resolution framework (Model-SR) to address this ill-posedness. Within this framework, we can recover the signal by solving a nonlinear least square problem and achieve the super-resolution. Theoretically, the resolution-enhancing map is proved to have Lipschitz continuity under mild conditions, leading to a stable solution to the super-resolution problem. We apply the general theory to three concrete models and give the stability estimates for each model. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the super-resolution behavior of the proposed framework. The model-based mathematical framework can be extended to problems with similar structures.</description>

      <title>Error Correction Decoding Algorithms of RS Codes Based on An Earlier Termination Algorithm to Find The Error Locator Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are widely used to correct errors in storage systems. Finding the error locator polynomial is one of the key steps in the error correction procedure of RS codes. Modular Approach (MA) is an effective algorithm for solving the Welch-Berlekamp (WB) key-equation problem to find the error locator polynomial that needs $2t$ steps, where $t$ is the error correction capability. In this paper, we first present a new MA algorithm that only requires $2e$ steps and then propose two fast decoding algorithms for RS codes based on our MA algorithm, where $e$ is the number of errors and $e\leq t$. We propose Improved-Frequency Domain Modular Approach (I-FDMA) algorithm that needs $2e$ steps to solve the error locator polynomial and present our first decoding algorithm based on the I-FDMA algorithm. We show that, compared with the existing methods based on MA algorithms, our I-FDMA algorithm can effectively reduce the decoding complexity of RS codes when $e&lt;t$. Furthermore, we propose the $t_0$-Shortened I-FDMA ($t_0$-SI-FDMA) algorithm ($t_0$ is a predetermined even number less than $2t-1$) based on the new termination mechanism to solve the error number $e$ quickly. We propose our second decoding algorithm based on the SI-FDMA algorithm for RS codes and show that the multiplication complexity of our second decoding algorithm is lower than our first decoding algorithm (the I-FDMA decoding algorithm) when $2e&lt;t_0+1$.</description>

      <title>Suppressing Beam Squint Effect For Near-Field Wideband Communication Through Movable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this correspondence, we study deploying movable antenna (MA) array in a wideband multiple-input-single-output (MISO) communication system, where near-field (NF) channel model is considered. To alleviate beam squint effect, we propose to maximize the minimum analog beamforming gain across the entire wideband spectrum by appropriately adjusting MAs' positions, which is a highly challenging task. By introducing a slack variable and adopting the cutting-the-edge smoothed-gradient-descent-ascent (SGDA) method, we develop algorithms to resolve the aforementioned challenge. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and demonstrate the benefit of utilizing MA array to mitigate beam squint effect in NF wideband system.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Max-Min Fairness Performance Balancing in ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is envisioned as a key technology for future wireless communications. In this paper, we consider a downlink monostatic ISAC system wherein the base station serves multiple communications users and sensing targets at the same time in the presence of clutter. We aim at both guaranteeing fairness among the communications users while simultaneously balancing the performances of communications and sensing functionalities. Therefore, we optimize the transmit and receive beamformers to maximize the weighted minimum signal-to-interference and clutter-plus-noise ratios. The design problem is highly challenging due to the non-smooth and non-convex objective function and strongly coupled variables. We propose two efficient methods to solve the problem. First, we rely on fractional programming and transform the original problem into convex sub-problems, which can be solved with standard convex optimization tools. To further reduce the complexity and dependence on numerical tools, we develop a novel approach to address the inherent non-smoothness of the formulated problem. Finally, the efficiencies of the proposed designs are demonstrated by numerical results.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming Design for Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Maritime Communications in the Presence of Wave Fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to provide wireless services for wide sea area, this paper designs an integrated satellite-terrestrial maritime communication framework. Specifically, the terrestrial base station (TBS) serves near-shore users, while the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communicates with off-shore users. We aim to improve the overall performance of integrated satellite-terrestrial maritime communication system. Thus, it makes sense to jointly optimize transmit beamforming at the TBS and LEO satellite. Due to sea wave fluctuation, the obtained channel state information (CSI) is often imperfect. In this context, a robust beamforming design algorithm is proposed with the goal of minimizing the total power consumption of integrated satellite-terrestrial maritime communication system while satisfying quality of service (QoS) requirements. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of proposed algorithm in maritime communications.</description>

      <title>Quasi-optimum distance flag codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A flag is a sequence of nested subspaces of a given ambient space F_q^n over a finite field F_q. In network coding, a flag code is a set of flags, all of them with the same sequence of dimensions, the type vector. In this paper, we investigate quasi-optimum distance flag codes, i.e., those attaining the second best possible distance value. We characterize them and present upper bounds for their cardinality. Moreover, we propose a systematic construction for every choice of the type vector by using partial spreads and sunflowers. For flag codes with lower minimum distance, we adapt the previous construction and provide some results towards their characterization, especially in the case of the third best possible distance value.</description>

      <title>Graph Fourier Transform Enhancement through Envelope Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world networks are characterized by directionality; however, the absence of an appropriate Fourier basis hinders the effective implementation of graph signal processing techniques.
  Inspired by discrete signal processing, where embedding a line digraph into a cycle digraph facilitates the powerful Discrete Fourier Transform for signal analysis, addressing the structural complexities of general digraphs can help overcome the limitations of the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) and unlock its potential.
  The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) serves as a Graph Fourier Transform for both cycle graphs and Cayley digraphs on the finite cyclic groups $\mathbb{Z}_N$. We propose a systematic method to identify a class of such Cayley digraphs that can encompass a given directed graph. By embedding the directed graph into these Cayley digraphs and opting for envelope extensions that naturally support the Graph Fourier Transform, the GFT functionalities of these extensions can be harnessed for signal analysis.
  Among the potential envelopes, optimal performance is achieved by selecting one that meets key properties. This envelope's structure closely aligns with the characteristics of the original digraph. The Graph Fourier Transform of this envelope is reliable in terms of numerical stability, and its columns approximately form an eigenbasis for the adjacency matrix associated with the original digraph.
  It is shown that the envelope extensions possess a convolution product, with their GFT fulfilling the convolution theorem. Additionally, shift-invariant graph filters (systems) are described as the convolution operator, analogous to the classical case. This allows the utilization of systems for signal analysis.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Propagation and Filtering via the Koopman Operator in Astrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman Operator (KO) provides an analytical solution of dynamical systems in terms of orthogonal polynomials. This work exploits this representation to include the propagation of uncertainties, where the polynomials are modified to work with stochastic variables. Thus, a new uncertainty quantification technique is proposed, where the KO solution is expanded to include the prediction of central moments, up to an arbitrary order. The propagation of uncertainties is then expanded to develop a new filtering algorithm, where measurements are considered as additional observables in the KO mathematics. Numerical simulations in astrodynamics assess the accuracy and performance of the new methodologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new method to propagate uncertainties undergoing nonlinear dynamics using the Koopman Operator (KO). Probability density functions are propagated directly using the Koopman approximation of the solution flow of the system, where the dynamics have been projected on a well-defined set of basis functions. The prediction technique is derived following both the analytical (Galerkin) and numerical (EDMD) derivation of the KO, and a least square reduction algorithm assures the recursivity of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most promising solutions for uncertainty quantification in high-dimensional statistics is the debiased LASSO that relies on unconstrained $\ell_1$-minimization. The initial works focused on real Gaussian designs as a toy model for this problem. However, in medical imaging applications, such as compressive sensing for MRI, the measurement system is represented by a (subsampled) complex Fourier matrix. The purpose of this work is to extend the method to the MRI case in order to construct confidence intervals for each pixel of an MR image. We show that a sufficient amount of data is $n \gtrsim \max\{ s_0\log^2 s_0\log p, s_0 \log^2 p \}$.</description>

      <title>A Versatility Measure for Parametric Risk Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric statistical methods play a central role in analyzing risk through its underlying frequency and severity components. Given the wide availability of numerical algorithms and high-speed computers, researchers and practitioners often model these separate (although possibly statistically dependent) random variables by fitting a large number of parametric probability distributions to historical data and then comparing goodness-of-fit statistics. However, this approach is highly susceptible to problems of overfitting because it gives insufficient weight to fundamental considerations of functional simplicity and adaptability. To address this shortcoming, we propose a formal mathematical measure for assessing the versatility of frequency and severity distributions prior to their application. We then illustrate this approach by computing and comparing values of the versatility measure for a variety of probability distributions commonly used in risk analysis.</description>

      <title>Application of the Lov\'asz-Schrijver Operator to Compact Stable Set Integer Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lov\'asz theta function $\theta(G)$ provides a very good upper bound on the stability number of a graph $G$. It can be computed in polynomial time by solving a semidefinite program (SDP), which also turns out to be fairly tractable in practice. Consequently, $\theta(G)$ achieves a hard-to-beat trade-off between computational effort and strength of the bound. Indeed, several attempts to improve the theta bound are documented, mainly based on playing around the application of the $N_+(\cdot)$ lifting operator of Lov\'asz and Schrijver to the classical formulation of the maximum stable set problem. Experience shows that solving such SDP-s often struggles against practical intractability and requires highly specialized methods. We investigate the application of such an operator to two different linear formulations based on clique and nodal inequalities, respectively. Fewer inequalities describe these two and yet guarantee that the resulting SDP bound is at least as strong as $\theta(G)$. Our computational experience, including larger graphs than those previously documented, shows that upper bounds stronger than $\theta(G)$ can be accessed by a reasonable additional effort using the clique-based formulation on sparse graphs and the nodal-based one on dense graphs.</description>

      <title>Discrete Spectrum Analysis of Vector OFDM Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector OFDM (VOFDM) is equivalent to OTFS and is good for time-varying channels. However, due to its vector form, its signal spectrum is not as clear as that of the conventional OFDM. In this paper, we study the discrete spectrum of discrete VOFDM signals. We obtain a linear relationship between a vector of information symbols and a vector of the same size of components evenly distributed in the discrete VOFDM signal spectrum, and show that if a vector of information symbols is set to 0, then a corresponding vector of the same size of the discrete VOFDM signal spectrum is 0 as well, where the components of the 0 vector are not together but evenly distributed in the spectrum. With the linear relationship, the information symbol vectors can be locally precoded so that any of the discrete spectrum of VOFDM signals can be set to 0, similar to that of the conventional OFDM signals. These results are verified by simulations.</description>

      <title>To accept or not to accept? An IRT-TOE Framework to Understand Educators' Resistance to Generative AI in Higher Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20130</link>

Abstract: Since the public release of Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), extensive discourse has emerged concerning the potential advantages and challenges of integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into education. In the realm of information systems, research on technology adoption is crucial for understanding the diverse factors influencing the uptake of specific technologies. Theoretical frameworks, refined and validated over decades, serve as guiding tools to elucidate the individual and organizational dynamics, obstacles, and perceptions surrounding technology adoption. However, while several models have been proposed, they often prioritize elucidating the factors that facilitate acceptance over those that impede it, typically focusing on the student perspective and leaving a gap in empirical evidence regarding educators viewpoints. Given the pivotal role educators play in higher education, this study aims to develop a theoretical model to empirically predict the barriers preventing educators from adopting GenAI in their classrooms. Acknowledging the lack of theoretical models tailored to identifying such barriers, our approach is grounded in the Innovation Resistance Theory (IRT) framework and augmented with constructs from the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework. This model is transformed into a measurement instrument employing a quantitative approach, complemented by a qualitative approach to enrich the analysis and uncover concerns related to GenAI adoption in the higher education domain.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided MIMO Systems: A Partially Decoupled Atomic Norm Minimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Channel estimation (CE) plays a key role in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, while it poses a challenging task due to the passive nature of RIS and the cascaded channel structures. In this paper, a partially decoupled atomic norm minimization (PDANM) framework is proposed for CE of RIS-aided MIMO systems, which exploits the three-dimensional angular sparsity of the channel. In particular, PDANM partially decouples the differential angles at the RIS from other angles at the base station and user equipment, reducing the computational complexity compared with existing methods. A reweighted PDANM (RPDANM) algorithm is proposed to further improve CE accuracy, which iteratively refines CE through a specifically designed reweighing strategy. Building upon RPDANM, we propose an iterative approach named RPDANM with adaptive phase control (RPDANM-APC), which adaptively adjusts the RIS phases based on previously estimated channel parameters to facilitate CE, achieving superior CE accuracy while reducing training overhead. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approaches in terms of running time, CE accuracy, and training overhead. In particular, the RPDANM-APC approach can achieve higher CE accuracy than existing methods within less than 30 percent training overhead while reducing the running time by tens of times.</description>

      <title>Design of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces by Using S-Parameter Multiport Network Theory -- Optimization and Full-Wave Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiport network theory has been proved to be a suitable abstraction model for analyzing and optimizing reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in an electromagnetically consistent manner, especially for studying the impact of the electromagnetic mutual coupling among radiating elements that are spaced less than half of the wavelength apart and for considering the interrelation between the amplitude and phase of the reflection coefficients. Both representations in terms of Z-parameter (impedance) and S-parameter (scattering) matrices are widely utilized. In this paper, we embrace multiport network theory for analyzing and optimizing the reradiation properties of RIS-aided channels, and provide four new contributions. (i) We offer a thorough comparison between the Z-parameter and S-parameter representations. This comparison allows us to unveil that typical scattering models utilized for RIS-aided channels ignore the structural scattering from an RIS, which is well documented in antenna theory. We show that the structural scattering results in an unwanted specular reflection. (ii) We develop an iterative algorithm for optimizing, in the presence of electromagnetic mutual coupling, the tunable loads of an RIS based on the S-parameters representation. We prove that small perturbations of the step size of the algorithm result in larger variations of the S-parameter matrix compared with the Z-parameter matrix, resulting in a faster convergence rate. (iii) We generalize the proposed algorithm to suppress the specular reflection due to the structural scattering, while maximizing the received power towards the direction of interest, and analyze the effectiveness and tradeoffs of the proposed approach. (iv) We validate the theoretical findings and algorithms with numerical simulations and a commercial full-wave electromagnetic simulator based on the method of moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The matrix representations of linear codes have been well-studied for use as disjunct matrices. However, no connection has previously been made between the properties of disjunct matrices and the parity-check codes obtained from them. This paper makes this connection for the first time. We provide some fundamental results on parity-check codes from general disjunct matrices (in particular, a minimum distance bound). We then consider three specific constructions of disjunct matrices and provide parameters of their corresponding parity-check codes including rate, distance, girth, and density. We show that, by choosing the correct parameters, the codes we construct have the best possible error-correction performance after one round of bit-flipping decoding with regard to a modified version of Gallager's bit-flipping decoding algorithm.</description>

      <title>Unified Capacity Results for Free-Space Optical Communication Systems Over Gamma-Gamma Atmospheric Turbulence Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11352v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transmit power control, as in the mobile wireless channels, can enable a robust and spectrally efficient communication through atmospheric turbulence in terrestrial free-space optical (FSO) channels. With optical bandwidths in excess of several GHz and eye safety regulations limiting the transmit optical power, the per hertz signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in terrestrial FSO systems can possibly become limited, especially true for future high-bandwidth and long-haul applications. Hence, power control becomes significant in terrestrial FSO systems. However, a comprehensive study of dynamic power adaptation in the existing FSO systems is lacking in the literature. In this paper, we investigate FSO communication systems capable of beam power control with heterodyne detection and direct detection based receivers operating under shot noise-limited conditions. Under these considerations, we derive unified exact and asymptotic capacity formulas for the Gamma-Gamma turbulence channels with and without pointing errors; these novel closed-form capacity expressions provide new insights into the impact of varying turbulence conditions and pointing errors. Further, the numerical results highlight the intricate relations of atmospheric turbulence and pointing error parameters in typical terrestrial FSO channel setting. A concrete assessment of the impact of the key channel parameters on the capacity performances of the aforementioned FSO systems is performed revealing several novel and interesting insights.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming with Gradient-based Liquid Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication with the advanced beamforming technologies is a key enabler to meet the growing demands of future mobile communication. However, the dynamic nature of cellular channels in large-scale urban mmWave MIMO communication scenarios brings substantial challenges, particularly in terms of complexity and robustness. To address these issues, we propose a robust gradient-based liquid neural network (GLNN) framework that utilizes ordinary differential equation-based liquid neurons to solve the beamforming problem. Specifically, our proposed GLNN framework takes gradients of the optimization objective function as inputs to extract the high-order channel feature information, and then introduces a residual connection to mitigate the training burden. Furthermore, we use the manifold learning technique to compress the search space of the beamforming problem. These designs enable the GLNN to effectively maintain low complexity while ensuring strong robustness to noisy and highly dynamic channels. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the GLNN can achieve 4.15% higher spectral efficiency than that of typical iterative algorithms, and reduce the time consumption to only 1.61% that of conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Lifted Hamming, Simplex and Reed-Muller Codes and Their Designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generator matrix of a linear code $\C$ over $\gf(q)$ is also a matrix of the same rank $k$ over any extension field $\gf(q^\ell)$ and generates a linear code of the same length, same dimension and same minimum distance over $\gf(q^\ell)$, denoted by $\C(q|q^\ell)$ and called a lifted code of $\C$. Although $\C$ and their lifted codes $\C(q|q^\ell)$ have the same parameters, they have different weight distributions and different applications. Few results about lifted linear codes are known in the literature. This paper proves some fundamental theory for lifted linear codes, settles the weight distributions of the lifted Hamming codes and lifted Simplex codes as well as the lifted Reed-Muller codes of certain orders, and investigates the $2$-designs and $3$-designs supported by these lifted codes. Infinite families of $2$-designs and $3$-designs are obtained. In addition, an infinite family of two-weight projective codes and two infinite families of three-weight projective codes are presented.</description>

      <title>Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) in Low Altitude Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the problem of utilizing Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) technology in Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), with a particular focus on aerial access networks. We consider an Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based wireless network comprised of two layers of UAVs: (a) a lower layer consisting a number of flying users and a UAV Base Station (BS) that provides coverage for terrestrial users and, (b) an upper layer designated to provide both wireless access for flying users and backhaul connectivity for UAV BS. By adopting IAB technology, the backhaul and access links collaboratively share their resources, enabling aerial backhauling and the utilization of the same infrastructure and frequency resources for access links. A sum-rate maximization problem is formulated by considering aerial backhaul constraints to optimally allocate the frequency spectrum between aerial and terrestrial networks. We decompose the resulting non-convex optimization problem into two sub-problems of beamforming and spectrum allocation and then propose efficient solutions for each. Numerical results in different scenarios yield insightful findings about the effectiveness of using the IAB technique in aerial networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03075v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the tasks of learning quantum states, measurements and channels generated by continuous-variable (CV) quantum circuits. This family of circuits is suited to describe optical quantum technologies and in particular it includes state-of-the-art photonic processors capable of showing quantum advantage. We define classes of functions that map classical variables, encoded into the CV circuit parameters, to outcome probabilities evaluated on those circuits. We then establish efficient learnability guarantees for such classes, by computing bounds on their pseudo-dimension or covering numbers, showing that CV quantum circuits can be learned with a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the circuit's size, i.e., the number of modes. Our results show that CV circuits can be trained efficiently using a number of training samples that, unlike their finite-dimensional counterpart, does not scale with the circuit depth.</description>

      <title>Estimate distillable entanglement and quantum capacity by squeezing useless entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07228v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Internet relies on quantum entanglement as a fundamental resource for secure and efficient quantum communication, reshaping data transmission. In this context, entanglement distillation emerges as a crucial process that plays a pivotal role in realizing the full potential of the quantum internet. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to accurately estimate the distillable entanglement and its closely related essential quantity, the quantum capacity. In this work, we consider a general resource measure known as the reverse divergence of resources which quantifies the minimum divergence between a target state and the set of free states. Leveraging this measure, we propose efficiently computable upper bounds for both quantities based on the idea that the useless entanglement within a state or a quantum channel does not contribute to the distillable entanglement or the quantum capacity, respectively. Our bounds can be computed via semidefinite programming and have practical applications for purifying maximally entangled states under practical noises, such as depolarizing and amplitude damping noises, leading to improvements in estimating the one-way distillable entanglement. Furthermore, we provide valuable benchmarks for evaluating the quantum capacities of qubit quantum channels, including the Pauli channels and the random mixed unitary channels, which are of great interest for the development of a quantum internet.</description>

      <title>Selection for short-term empowerment accelerates the evolution of homeostatic neural cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empowerment -- a domain independent, information-theoretic metric -- has previously been shown to assist in the evolutionary search for neural cellular automata (NCA) capable of homeostasis when employed as a fitness function. In our previous study, we successfully extended empowerment, defined as maximum time-lagged mutual information between agents' actions and future sensations, to a distributed sensorimotor system embodied as an NCA. However, the time-delay between actions and their corresponding sensations was arbitrarily chosen. Here, we expand upon previous work by exploring how the time scale at which empowerment operates impacts its efficacy as an auxiliary objective to accelerate the discovery of homeostatic NCAs. We show that shorter time delays result in marked improvements over empowerment with longer delays, when compared to evolutionary selection only for homeostasis. Moreover, we evaluate stability and adaptability of evolved NCAs, both hallmarks of living systems that are of interest to replicate in artificial ones. We find that short-term empowered NCA are more stable and are capable of generalizing better to unseen homeostatic challenges. Taken together, these findings motivate the use of empowerment during the evolution of other artifacts, and suggest how it should be incorporated to accelerate evolution of desired behaviors for them.
