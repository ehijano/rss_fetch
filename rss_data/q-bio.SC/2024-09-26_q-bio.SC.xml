      <title>Efficiency-fluctuation trade-offs in biomolecular assembly processes</title>

Abstract: Stochastic fluctuations of molecular abundances are a ubiquitous feature of biochemical processes and lead to significant cell-to-cell variability even in clonal populations under identical conditions. Despite the complexity of biochemical control networks, recent theoretical work established lower bounds for stochastic fluctuations in broad classes of systems where specific reaction motifs are embedded in unspecified networks with arbitrary interactions. For example, a class of generalized assembly processes in which two co-regulated subunits irreversibly form a complex was shown to exhibit an unavoidable trade-off between assembly efficiency and subunit fluctuations: Regardless of rate constants and the exact details of feedback control, the subunit fluctuations were shown to diverge as efficiency approaches 100%. In contrast, other work has reported how efficient assembly processes work as noise filters or can exhibit finite fluctuations while achieving robust adaptation of cellular averages through integral control. While all reported results are technically correct their seemingly contradictory conclusions raise the question of how broadly applicable the previously reported efficiency-fluctuation trade-off is. Here we establish that a much broader class of assembly processes than previously considered is subject to an efficiency-fluctuation trade-off which diverges in the high efficiency regime. We find the proposed noise filtering property of efficient assembly processes corresponds to a singular limit of this class of systems. Additionally, we establish that systems must necessarily combine feedback control with distinct subunit synthesis rates to overcome the efficiency-fluctuation trade-off. We show that biomolecular integral controllers are one of several realizations of such dual-input feedback control which avoid diverging fluctuations in the high efficiency regime.</description>
