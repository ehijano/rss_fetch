      <title>On the equivalence of Lp-parabolicity, Lq-liouville property on weighted graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relationship between the $L^p$-parabolicity, the $L^q$-Liouville property for positive superharmonic functions, and the existence of nonharmonic positive solutions to the system
  \begin{align*}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
  -\Delta u\geq 0,
  \Delta(|\Delta u|^{p-2}\Delta u)\geq 0,
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \end{align*} 
  on weighted graphs, where $1\leq p&lt; \infty$ and $(p, q)$ are H\"{o}lder conjugate exponent pair. Moreover, some new technique is developed to establish the estimate of green function under volume doubling and Poincar\'{e} inequality conditions, and the sharp volume growth conditions for the $L^p$-parabolicity can be derived on some graphs.</description>

      <title>On some Sobolev and P\'olya-Sezg\"o type inequalities with weights and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are motivated by studying a boundary-value problem for a class of semilinear degenerate elliptic equations
  \begin{align}\tag{P}\label{P}
  \begin{cases}
  - \Delta_x u - |x|^{2\alpha} \dfrac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = f(x,y,u), &amp; \textrm{in } \Omega,
  u = 0, &amp; \textrm{on } \partial \Omega,
  \end{cases}
  \end{align}
  where $x = (x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2$, $\Omega$ is a bounded smooth domain in $\mathbb{R}^3$, $(0,0,0) \in \Omega $, and $\alpha &gt; 0$.
  In this paper, we will study this problem by establishing embedding theorems for weighted Sobolev spaces. To this end, we need a new P\'olya-Szeg\"o type inequality, which can be obtained by studying an isoperimetric problem for the corresponding weighted area. Our results then extend the existing ones in \cite{nga, Luyen2} to the three-dimensional context.</description>

      <title>The monopolist's free boundary problem in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Monopolist's problem with a focus on the free boundary separating bunched from unbunched consumers, especially in the plane, and give a full description of its solution for the family of square domains $\{(a,a+1)^2\}_{a \ge 0}$. The Monopolist's problem is fundamental in economics, yet widely considered analytically intractable when both consumers and products have more than one degree of heterogeneity. Mathematically, the problem is to minimize a smooth, uniformly convex Lagrangian over the space of nonnegative convex functions. What results is a free boundary problem between the regions of strict and nonstrict convexity. Our work is divided into three parts: a study of the structure of the free boundary problem on convex domains in ${\mathbf R}^n$ showing that the product allocation map remains Lipschitz up to most of the fixed boundary and that each bunch extends to this boundary; a proof in ${\mathbf R}^2$ that the interior free boundary can only fail to be smooth in one of four specific ways (cusp, high frequency oscillations, stray bunch, nontranversal bunch); and, finally, the first complete solution to Rochet and Chon\'e's example on the family of squares $\Omega = (a,a+1)^2$, where we discover bifurcations first to targeted and then to blunt bunching as the distance $a \ge 0$ to the origin is increased. We use techniques from the study of the Monge--Amp\'ere equation, the obstacle problem, and localization for measures in convex-order.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal pattern formations in a two-layer coupled reaction-diffusion Lengyel-Epstein system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal pattern formations in two-layer coupled reaction-diffusion Lengyel-Epstein system with distributed delayed couplings are investigated. Firstly, for the original decoupled system, it is proved that when the intra-reactor diffusion rate $\ep$ of the inhibitor is sufficiently small and the intra-reactor diffusion rate $d$ of the inhibitor is large enough, then the subsystem can exhibit non-constant positive steady state $(\widetilde{u}(x;\ep),\widetilde{v}(x;\epsilon))$ with large amplitude, and that as the parameter $\tau$ varies, the stability of $(\widetilde{u}(x;\ep),\widetilde{v}(x;\epsilon))$ changes, leading to the emergence of periodic solutions via Hopf bifurcation. Secondly, for the two-layer coupled system, the stability of the symmetric steady state $(\widetilde{u}(x;\ep),\widetilde{v}(x;\epsilon),\widetilde{u}(x;\ep),\widetilde{v}(x;\epsilon))$ is studied by treating $k_1,k_2$ (the inter-reactor diffusion rates) and $\al$ (the delay parameter) as the main parameters. In case of non-delayed couplings, the first quadrant of the $(k_1, k_2)$ parameter space can be divided into two regions: one is stable region, the other one is unstable region, and the two regions have the common boundary, which is the primary Turing bifurcation curve. In case of delayed couplings, it is shown that the first quadrant of the $(k_1, k_2)$ parameter space can be re-divided into three regions: the first one is unstable region, the second one is stable region, while the third one is the potential \lq\lq bifurcation\rq\rq region, where Hopf bifurcation may occur for suitable $\al$. Our analysis is mainly based on the singular perturbation techniques and the implicit function theorem, and the results show some different phenomena from those of the original decoupled system in one reactor.</description>

      <title>Sharp well-posedness for the free boundary MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a definitive well-posedness theory for the free boundary problem in incompressible magnetohyrodynamics. Despite the clear physical interest in this system and the remarkable progress in the study of the free boundary Euler equations in recent decades, the low regularity well-posedness of the free boundary MHD equations has remained completely open. This is due, in large part, to the highly nonlinear wave-type coupling between the velocity, magnetic field and free boundary, which has forced previous works to impose restrictive geometric constraints on the data. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Eulerian approach and an entirely new functional setting, which better captures the wave equation structure of the MHD equations and permits a complete Hadamard well-posedness theory in low-regularity Sobolev spaces. In particular, we give the first proofs of existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence on the data at the sharp $s&gt;\frac{d}{2}+1$ Sobolev regularity, in addition to a blowup criterion for smooth solutions at the same low regularity scale. Moreover, we provide a completely new method for constructing smooth solutions which, to our knowledge, gives the first proof of existence (at any regularity) in our new functional setting. All of our results hold in arbitrary dimensions and in general, not necessarily simply connected, domains. By taking the magnetic field to be zero, they also recover the corresponding sharp well-posedness theorems for the free boundary Euler equations. The methodology and tools that we employ here can likely be fruitfully implemented in other free boundary models.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems of recovering lower-order coefficients from boundary integral data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under consideration are mathematical models of heat and mass transfer. We study inverse problems of recovering lower-order coefficients in a second order parabolic equation. The coefficients are representable in the form of a finite segments of the series whose coefficients depending on time are to be determined. The linear case is also considered.
  The overdetermination conditions are the integrals over the boundary of the domain of a solution with weights. The main attention is paid to existence, uniqueness, and stability estimates for solutions to inverse problems of this type. The problem is reduced to an operator equation which is studied with the use of the fixed point theorem and a priori estimates. A solution has all generalized derivatives occurring into the equation summable to some power. The method of the proof is constructive and it can be used for developing new numerical algorithms of solving the problem.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the rate of convergence of the vanishing viscosity process of Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a linear $L^p$ rate of convergence, $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, with respect to the viscosity $\varepsilon$ for the vanishing viscosity process of semiconcave solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations by regularizing the PDE with the half-Laplacian $-\varepsilon(-\Delta)^{1/2}$. Our result reveals a nonlocal phenomenon, since it improves the known estimates obtained via the classical second order vanishing viscosity regularization $\varepsilon\Delta u$. It also highlights a faster rate of convergence than the available $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon|\log\varepsilon|)$ rate in sup-norm obtained by the doubling of variable technique for this nonlocal approximation. The result is based on integral methods and does not use the maximum principle.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness and multiple existence of positive radial solutions of the Brezis-Nirenberg Problem on annular domains in ${\Bbb S}^{3}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uniqueness and multiple existence of positive radial solutions to the Brezis-Nirenberg problem on a domain in the 3-dimensional unit sphere ${\mathbb S}^3$ \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{aligned} \Delta_{{\mathbb S}^3}U -\lambda U + U^p&amp;=0,\, U&gt;0 &amp;&amp; \text{in $\Omega_{\theta_1,\theta_2}$,}\\ U &amp;= 0&amp;&amp;\text{on $\partial \Omega_{\theta_1,\theta_2}$,}
  \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} for $-\lambda_{1}&lt;\lambda\leq 1$ are shown, where $\Delta_{{\mathbb S}^3}$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator, $\lambda_{1}$ is the first eigenvalue of $-\Delta_{{\mathbb S}^3}$ and $\Omega_{\theta_1,\theta_2}$ is an annular domain in ${\mathbb S}^3$: whose great circle distance (geodesic distance) from $(0,0,0,1)$ is greater than $\theta_1$ and less than $\theta_2$. A solution is said to be radial if it depends only on this geodesic distance. It is proved that the number of positive radial solutions of the problem changes with respect to the exponent $p$ and parameter $\lambda$ when $\theta_1=\varepsilon$, $\theta_2=\pi-\varepsilon$ and $0&lt;\varepsilon$ is sufficiently small.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness for the Landau-Lifshitz-Baryakhtar equation in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the global well-posedness of the Landau-Lifshitz-Baryakhtar (LLBar) equation in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^3$. The study first demonstrates the existence and uniqueness of global strong solutions using the weak compactness approach. Furthermore, the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions, as well as arbitrary smooth solutions, are derived through a bootstrap argument. The proofs for the existence of these three types of global solutions are based on Friedrichs mollifier approximation and energy estimates, with the structure of the LLBar equation playing a crucial role in the derivation of the results.</description>

      <title>Bernis estimates for higher-dimensional doubly-degenerate non-Newtonian thin-film equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the doubly-degenerate parabolic non-Newtonian thin-film equation $$ u_t + \text{div}\bigl(u^n |\nabla \Delta u|^{p-2} \nabla \Delta u\bigr) = 0, $$ we derive (local versions) of Bernis estimates of the form $$
  \int_{\Omega} u^{n-2p} |\nabla u|^{3p}\, dx
  +
  \int_{\Omega} u^{n-\frac{p}{2}} |\Delta u|^{\frac{3p}{2}}\, dx
  \leq c(n,p,d) \int_{\Omega} u^n|\nabla \Delta u|^p\, dx, $$ for functions $u \in W^2_p(\Omega)$ with Neumann boundary condition, where $2 \leq p &lt; \frac{19}{3}$ and $n$ lies in a certain range. Here, $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is a smooth convex domain with $d &lt; 3p$. A particularly important consequence is the estimate $$
  \int_{\Omega}
  |\nabla \Delta (u^{\frac{n+p}{p}})|^p\, dx \leq c(n,p,d) \int_{\Omega} u^n|\nabla \Delta u|^p\, dx. $$ The methods used in this article follow the approach of [Gr\"u01] for the Newtonian case, while addressing the specific challenges posed by the nonlinear higher-order term $|\nabla \Delta u|^{p-2} \nabla \Delta u$ and the additional degeneracy. The derived estimates are key to establishing further qualitative results, such as the existence of weak solutions, finite propagation of support, and the appearance of a waiting-time phenomenon.</description>

      <title>From discrete to continuum in the helical XY-model: emergence of chirality transitions in the $S^1$ to $S^2$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the discrete-to-continuum limit of a frustrated ferromagnetic/anti-ferromagnetic $\mathbb{S}^2$-valued spin system on the lattice $\lambda_n\mathbb{Z}^2$ as $\lambda_n\to 0$. For $\mathbb{S}^2$ spin systems close to the Landau-Lifschitz point (where the helimagnetic/ferromagnetic transition occurs), it is well established that for chirality transitions emerge with vanishing energy. Inspired by recent work on the $N$-clock model, we consider a spin model where spins are constrained to $k_n$ copies of $\mathbb{S}^1$ covering $\mathbb{S}^2$ as $n\to\infty$. We identify a critical energy-scaling regime and a threshold for the divergence rate of $k_n\to+\infty$, below which the $\Gamma$-limit of the discrete energies capture chirality transitions while retaining an $\mathbb{S}^2$-valued energy description in the continuum limit.</description>

Abstract: We consider the kinetic wave equation, or phonon Boltzmann equation, set on the torus (physical system set on the lattice). We describe entropy maximizers for fixed mass and energy; our framework is very general, being valid in any dimension, for any dispersion relation, and even including the quantum kinetic wave equation. Of particular interest is the presence of condensation in certain regimes which we characterize.</description>

Abstract: A measure representation result for a functional modelling optimal design problems for plastic deformations, under linear growth conditions, is obtained.
  Departing from an energy with a bulk term depending on the second gradient, as well as a perimeter term, the functional in question corresponds to the relaxation of this energy with respect to a pair $(\chi,u)$, where $\chi$ is the characteristic function of a set of finite perimeter and $u$ is a function of bounded hessian.</description>

      <title>Generic regularity of free boundaries in the obstacle problem for the fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish generic regularity results of free boundaries for solutions of the obstacle problem for the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^s$. We prove that, for almost every obstacle, the free boundary contains only regular points up to dimension $3$, for every $s\in(0,1)$. To do so, we extend some results on the fine structure of the free boundary to the case $s\in (0,1)$ and general non-zero obstacle, including a blow-up analysis at points with frequency $2m+2s$, and we prove new explicit uniform frequency gaps for solutions of the fractional obstacle problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by problems in machine learning, we study a class of variational problems characterized by nonlocal operators. These operators are characterized by power-type weights, which are singular at a portion of the boundary. We identify a range of exponents on these weights for which the variational Dirichlet problem is well-posed. This range is determined by the ambient dimension of the problem, the growth rate of the nonlocal functional, and the dimension of the boundary portion on which the Dirichlet data is prescribed. We show the variational convergence of solutions to solutions of local weighted Sobolev functionals in the event of vanishing nonlocality.</description>

      <title>Gradient integrability for bounded $\mathrm{BD}$-minimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that locally bounded relaxed minimizers of degenerate elliptic symmetric gradient functionals on $\mathrm{BD}(\Omega)$ have weak gradients in $\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{loc}}^{1}(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^{n\times n})$. This is achieved for the sharp ellipticity range that is presently known to yield $\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{loc}}^{1,1}$-regularity in the full gradient case on $\mathrm{BV}(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^{n})$. As a consequence, we also obtain the first Sobolev regularity results for minimizers of the area-type functional on $\mathrm{BD}(\Omega)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a well-known conjecture in $\beta$-models and in their discrete counterpart that, generically, external potentials should be ``off-critical'' (or, equivalently, ``regular''). Exploiting the connection between minimizing measures and thin obstacle problems, we give a positive answer to this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Covariance-modulated optimal transport and gradient flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a variant of the dynamical optimal transport problem in which the energy to be minimised is modulated by the covariance matrix of the distribution. Such transport metrics arise naturally in mean-field limits of certain ensemble Kalman methods for solving inverse problems. We show that the transport problem splits into two coupled minimization problems: one for the evolution of mean and covariance of the interpolating curve and one for its shape. The latter consists in minimising the usual Wasserstein length under the constraint of maintaining fixed mean and covariance along the interpolation. We analyse the geometry induced by this modulated transport distance on the space of probabilities as well as the dynamics of the associated gradient flows. Those show better convergence properties in comparison to the classical Wasserstein metric in terms of exponential convergence rates independent of the Gaussian target. On the level of the gradient flows a similar splitting into the evolution of moments and shapes of the distribution can be observed.</description>

      <title>Stability of Rellich-Sobolev type inequality involving Hardy term for bi-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $N\geq 5$ and $0&lt;\mu&lt;N-4$, we first show a non-degenerate result of the extremal functions for the following Rellich-Sobolev type inequality
  \begin{align*}
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|\Delta u|^2 \mathrm{d}x
  -C_{\mu,1}\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}\frac{|\nabla u|^2}{|x|^2} \mathrm{d}x
  +C_{\mu,2}\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}\frac{u^2}{|x|^4} \mathrm{d}x
  \geq \mathcal{S}_\mu\left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|u|^{\frac{2N}{N-4}} \mathrm{d}x\right)^\frac{N-4}{N},\quad \forall u\in C^\infty_0(\mathbb{R}^N),
  \end{align*} where $C_{\mu,1}$, $C_{\mu,2}$ and $\mathcal{S}_\mu$ are constants depending on $N$ and $\mu$, which is a key ingredient in analyzing the blow-up phenomena of solutions to various elliptic equations on bounded or unbounded domains. Then by using spectral analysis combined with a compactness argument, we consider the stability of this inequality. Furthermore, we derive a remainder term inequality in the weak Lebesgue-norm sense in a subdomain with finite Lebesgue measure.</description>

      <title>Face 2-phase: how much overdetermination is enough to get symmetry in multi-phase problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a full characterization of multi-phase problems under a large class of overdetermined Serrin-type conditions. Our analysis includes both symmetry and asymmetry (including bifurcation) results. A broad range of techniques is needed to obtain a full characterization of all the cases, including applications of results obtained via the moving planes method, approaches via integral identities in the wake of Weinberger, applications of the Crandall-Rabinowitz theorem, and the Chauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem. The multi-phase setting entails intrinsic difficulties that make it difficult to predict whether a given overdetermination will lead to symmetry or asymmetry results; the results of our analysis are significant as they answer such a question providing a full characterization of both symmetry and asymmetry results.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate a polynomial convergence rate for homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equations with quasi-periodic potentials. We establish a connection between the convergence rate of homogenization and the regularity of the effective Hamiltonian, by using a new quantitative ergodic estimate for bounded quasi-periodic functions with Diophantine frequencies. As an application, we also study the convergent rate for Birkhoff average of unbounded quasi-periodic functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical length phenomenon of the Korteweg-de Vries equation is well known, however, in higher dimensions, it is unknown. This work explores this property in the context of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, a two-dimensional generalization of the Korteweg-de Vries equation. Specifically, we demonstrate observability inequalities for this equation, which allow us to deduce the exact boundary controllability and boundary exponential stabilization of the linear system, provided the spatial domain length avoids certain specific values, which is a direct consequence of the Paley-Wiener theorem. To the best of our knowledge, our work introduces new results by identifying a set of critical lengths for the two-dimensional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of radial self-similar singular solutions for the mass supercritical Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation far from the critical regime and, more generally, branches of such solutions for the Complex Ginzburg-Landau Equation. We are also able to control their monotone index (number of monotone intervals). In particular, we prove the existence of monotone radial self-similar singular solutions for the three dimensional cubic Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation. The paper combines sharp analytic bounds of the self-similar profile at infinity with computer assisted bounds around zero and their matching at an intermediate value.</description>

Abstract: We study three types of fourth-order Steklov eigenvalue problems. For the first two of them, we derive the asymptotic expansion of their spectra on Euclidean annular domains $\mathbb{B}^n_1\setminus \overline{\mathbb{B}^n_\epsilon}$ as $\epsilon \to 0$, leading to conclusions on shape optimization. For these two problems, we also compute their spectra on cylinders over closed Riemannian manifolds. Last, for the third problem, we obtain a sharp upper bound for its first non-zero eigenvalue on star-shaped and mean convex Euclidean domains.</description>

Abstract: We investigate (in)stabilities of periodic patterns under stochastic forcing in reaction-diffusion equations exhibiting a so-called Busse balloon. Specifically, we used a one-dimensional Klausmeier model for dryland vegetation patterns. Using numerical methods, we can accurately describe the transient dynamics of the stochastic solutions and compare several notions of stability. In particular, we show that stochastic stability heavily depends on the model parameters, the intensity of the noise and the location of the wavenumber of the periodic pattern within the deterministic Busse balloon. Furthermore, the boundary of the Busse balloon becomes blurred under the stochastic perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the manifold-valued Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (ROF) model, which involves an initial datum $f$ mapping from a curved compact surface with smooth boundary to a complete, connected and smooth $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold. We prove the existence and uniqueness of minimizers under curvature restrictions on the target and topological ones on the range of $f$. We obtain a series of regularity results on the associated PDE system of a relaxed functional with Neumann boundary condition. We apply these results to the ROF model to obtain Lipschitz regularity of minimizers without further requirements on the convexity of the boundary. Additionally, we provide variants of the regularity statement of independent interest: for 1-dimensional domains (related to signal denoising), local Lipschitz regularity (meaningful for image processing) and Lipschitz regularity for a version of the Mosolov problem coming from fluid mechanics.</description>

      <title>Weak Serrin-type blowup criterion for the 3D full compressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate weak Serrin-type blowup criterion of the three-dimensional full compressible Navier-Stokes equations for the Cauchy problem, Dirichlet problem and Navier-slip boundary condition. It is shown that the strong or smooth solution exists globally if the density is bounded from above, and either the absolute temperature or velocity satisfies the weak Serrin's condition. Therefore, if the weak Serrin norm of the absolute temperature or the velocity remains bounded, it is not possible for other kinds of singularities (such as vacuum states vanish or vacuum appears in the non-vacuum region or even milder singularities) to form before the density becomes unbounded. In particular, this criterion extends those Serrin-type blowup criterion results in (Math. Ann. 390 (2024): 1201-1248; Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 207(2013): 303-316). Furthermore, as a by-product, for the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations, we succeed in removing the technical assumption $\rho_0\in L^1$ in (J. Lond. Math. Soc. (2) 102(2020): 125--142). The initial data can be arbitrarily large and allow to contain vacuum states here.</description>

Abstract: In this article we consider the Lagrangian mean curvature flow of compact, circle-invariant, almost calibrated Lagrangian surfaces in hyperk\"ahler 4-manifolds with circle symmetry. We show that this Lagrangian mean curvature flow can be continued for all time, through finite time singularities, and converges to a chain of special Lagrangians, thus verifying various aspects of Joyce's conjectures in this setting. We show that the singularities of the flow are neck pinches in the sense conjectured by Joyce. We also give examples where such finite time singularities are guaranteed to occur.</description>

      <title>Approximating Continuous Spectra of Hyperbolic Systems with Summation-by-Parts Finite Difference Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we explore the fidelity of numerical approximations to continuous spectra of hyperbolic partial differential equation systems with variable coefficients. We are particularly interested in the ability of discrete methods to accurately discover sources of physical instabilities. By focusing on the perturbed equations that arise in linearized problems, we apply high-order accurate summation-by-parts finite difference operators, with weak enforcement of boundary conditions through the simultaneous-approximation-term technique, which leads to a provably stable numerical discretization with formal order of accuracy given by p = 2, 3, 4 and 5. We derive analytic solutions using Laplace transform methods, which provide important ground truth for ensuring numerical convergence at the correct theoretical rate. We find that the continuous spectrum is better captured with mesh refinement, although dissipative strict stability (where the growth rate of the discrete problem is bounded above by the continuous) is not obtained. We also find that sole reliance on mesh refinement can be a problematic means for determining physical growth rates as some eigenvalues emerge (and persist with mesh refinement) based on spatial order of accuracy but are non-physical. We suggest that numerical methods be used to approximate discrete spectra when numerical stability is guaranteed and convergence of the discrete spectra is evident with both mesh refinement and increasing order of accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We study continuity of the multiplier operator $e^{i q}$ acting on Gelfand--Shilov spaces, where $q$ is a polynomial on $\mathbf R^d$ of degree at least two with real coefficients. In the parameter quadrant for the spaces we identify a wedge that depends on the polynomial degree for which the operator is continuous. We also show that in a large part of the complement region the operator is not continuous in dimension one. The results give information on well-posedness for linear evolution equations that generalize the Schr\"odinger equation for the free particle.</description>
