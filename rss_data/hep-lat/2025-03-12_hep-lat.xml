      <title>Exact Chiral Symmetries of 3+1D Hamiltonian Lattice Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct Hamiltonian models on a 3+1d cubic lattice for a single Weyl fermion and for a single Weyl doublet protected by exact (as opposed to emergent) chiral symmetries. In the former, we find a not-on-site, non-compact chiral symmetry which can be viewed as a Hamiltonian analog of the Ginsparg-Wilson symmetry in Euclidean lattice models of Weyl fermions. In the latter, we combine an on-site $U(1)$ symmetry with a not-on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which together generate the $SU(2)$ flavor symmetry of the doublet at low energies, while in the UV they generate an algebra known in integrability as the Onsager algebra. This latter model is in fact the celebrated magnetic Weyl semimetal which is known to have a chiral anomaly from the action of $U(1)$ and crystalline translation, that gives rise to an anomalous Hall response - however reinterpreted in our language, it has two exact $U(1)$ symmetries that gives rise to the global $SU(2)$ anomaly which protects the gaplessness even when crystalline translations are broken. We also construct an exact symmetry-protected single Dirac cone in 2+1d with the $U(1) \rtimes T$ parity anomaly. Our constructions evade both old and recently-proven no-go theorems by using not-on-siteness in a crucial way, showing our results are sharp.</description>

      <title>Untwisted and Twisted R\'{e}nyi Negativities: Toward a R\'{e}nyi Proxy for Logarithmic Negativity in Fermionic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy is a fundamental measure of quantum entanglement for pure states, but for large-scale many-body systems, R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy is much more computationally accessible. For mixed states, logarithmic negativity (LN) serves as a widely used entanglement measure, but its direct computation is often intractable, leaving R\'{e}nyi negativity (RN) as the practical alternative. In fermionic systems, RN is further classified into untwisted and twisted types, depending on the definition of the fermionic partial transpose. However, which of these serves as the true R\'{e}nyi proxy for LN has remained unclear -- until now. In this work, we address this question by developing a robust quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method to compute both untwisted and twisted RNs, focusing on the rank-4 twisted RN, where non-trivial behavior emerges. We identify and overcome two major challenges: the singularity of the Green's function matrix and the exponentially large variance of RN estimators. Our method is demonstrated in the Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model, revealing critical distinctions between untwisted and twisted RNs, as well as between rank-2 and high-rank RNs. Remarkably, we find that the twisted R\'{e}nyi negativity ratio (RNR) adheres to the area law and decreases monotonically with temperature, in contrast to the untwisted RNR but consistent with prior studies of bosonic systems. This study not only establishes the twisted RNR as a more pertinent R\'{e}nyi proxy for LN in fermionic systems but also provides comprehensive technical details for the stable and efficient computation of high-rank RNs. Our work lays the foundation for future studies of mixed-state entanglement in large-scale fermionic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Partial Transpose in the Overlap Matrix Framework for Entanglement Negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07742v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, the overlap matrix approach has been developed to compute quantum entanglement in free-fermion systems, particularly to calculate entanglement entropy and entanglement negativity. This method involves the use of partial trace and partial transpose operations within the overlap matrix framework. However, previous studies have only considered the conventional partial transpose in fermionic systems, which does not account for fermionic anticommutation relations. Although the concept of a fermionic partial transpose was introduced in \cite{Shapourian2017prb}, it has not yet been systematically incorporated into the overlap matrix framework. In this paper, we introduce the fermionic partial transpose into the overlap matrix approach, provide a systematic analysis of the validity of partial trace and partial transpose operations, and derive an explicit formula for calculating entanglement negativity in bipartite systems. Additionally, we numerically compute the logarithmic negativity of two lattice models to verify the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law. For tripartite geometries, we uncover limitations of the overlap matrix method and demonstrate that the previously reported logarithmic negativity result for a homogeneous one-dimensional chain in a disjoint interval geometry exceeds its theoretical upper bound. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of partial trace and partial transpose operations in different representations.</description>

      <title>Contribution of Geometry and Non-Abelian Gauge Fields to Aharonov-Bohm Scattering of Massless Fermions in Graphene with Disclinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work examines the effect of disclinations on the scattering of quasipaticles in graphene with the presence of a topological defect. Using the tight-binding method, the electronic properties of graphene with disclination are described, where the topological defects are introduced in the lattice via geometric theory. The massless Dirac equation is modified to account for the curvature induced by these defects, incorporating a gauge field. The results show that disclinations significantly affect the scattering process, altering phase shifts and interference patterns. The differential cross-section and its dependence on the scattering angle are analyzed, highlighting the role of geometric factors like the parameter {\alpha} in shaping the scattering dynamics.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of $P_{\psi}^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$ within the Bethe-Salpeter framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By combining the effective Lagrangian and Bethe-Salpeter framework, we studied the mass spectra, wave functions, and strong decay widths of the two pentaquark states $P_\psi^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$ reported by LHCb in 2019. We calculate the one-boson-exchange interaction kernel of $\bar D^*\Sigma_c$ in the isospin-$\frac12$ configuration. Then we present the Bethe-Salpeter equation(BSE) and wave functions for the bound states of a vector meson and a $\frac12$ baryon with $J^P={\frac12}^-$ and ${\frac32}^-$. By solving the BSE we obtain 2 bound states for both ${\frac12}^-$ and ${\frac32}^-$ spin-parity configuration, and the mass results favor the $(\frac32)^-$ and $(\frac12)^-$ configuration for the $P_\psi^N(4440)$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)$. Combining the effective Lagrangians and the obtained BS wave functions, we further calculate the strong decay channels $\bar D^{(*)0}\Lambda_c^+$, $J/\psi(\eta_c) p$, and $\bar D\Sigma_c^{(*)}$ for the two $P_\psi^N$ states. In the favored $\frac32^-$ and $\frac12^-$ configuration, the obtained total widths are 34.8 MeV and $2.2$ MeV for $P_\psi^N(4440)$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)$, respectively, which are substantially consistent with the LHCb data. The obtained decay widths suggest that $\bar D^{*0}\Lambda_c^+$ and $\bar D\Sigma_c$ are the dominant decay channels to detect $P_\psi^N(4440)$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)$. Taking into account both the mass spectra and decay widths, our results favor the interpretation of $P_\psi^N(4440)$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)$ as the isospin-$\frac12$ $[\bar D^*\Sigma_c]$ molecular states with $J^P$ configuration $(\frac{3}{2})^-$ and $(\frac12)^-$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical autoregressive neural networks in three-dimensional statistical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive Neural Networks (ANN) have been recently proposed as a mechanism to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo algorithms for several spin systems. The idea relies on the fact that the total probability of a configuration can be factorized into conditional probabilities of each spin, which in turn can be approximated by a neural network. Once trained, the ANNs can be used to sample configurations from the approximated probability distribution and to evaluate explicitly this probability for a given configuration. It has also been observed that such conditional probabilities give access to information-theoretic observables such as mutual information or entanglement entropy. So far, these methods have been applied to two-dimensional statistical systems or one-dimensional quantum systems. In this paper, we describe a generalization of the hierarchical algorithm to three spatial dimensions and study its performance on the example of the Ising model. We discuss the efficiency of the training and also describe the scaling with the system's dimensionality by comparing results for two- and three-dimensional Ising models with the same number of spins. Finally, we provide estimates of thermodynamical observables for the three-dimensional Ising model, such as the entropy and free energy in a range of temperatures across the phase transition.</description>
