      <title>Stabilization of Age-Structured Competing Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Age-structured models represent the dynamic behaviors of populations over time and result in integro-partial differential equations (IPDEs). Such processes arise in biotechnology, economics, demography, and other domains. Coupled age-structured IPDE population dynamics with two or more species occur in epidemiology and ecology, but have received little attention thus far. This work considers an exponentially unstable model of two competing predator populations, formally referred to in the literature as ''competition'' dynamics. If one were to apply an input that simultaneously harvests both predator species, one would have control over only the product of the densities of the species, not over their ratio. Therefore, it is necessary to design a control input that directly harvests only one of the two predator species, while indirectly influencing the other via a backstepping approach. The model is transformed into a system of two coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), of which only one is actuated, and two autonomous, exponentially stable integral delay equations (IDEs) which enter the ODEs as nonlinear disturbances. The ODEs are globally stabilized with backstepping and an estimate of the region of attraction of the asymptotically stabilized equilibrium of the full IPDE system is provided, under a positivity restriction on control. These generalizations open exciting possibilities for future research directions, such as investigating population systems with more than two species.</description>

      <title>Experimentally-Driven Analysis of Stability in Connected Vehicle Platooning: Insights and Control Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a tangible platform for demonstrating the practical implementation of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) systems, an enhancement to the standard adaptive cruise control (ACC) concept by means of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. It involves a detailed examination of existing longitudinal controllers and their performance in homogeneous vehicle platoons. Moreover, extensive tests are conducted using multiple autonomous experimental vehicle platform topologies to verify the effectiveness of the controller. The outcomes from both simulations and field tests affirm the substantial benefits of the proposed CACC platooning approach in longitudinal vehicle platooning scenarios. This research is crucial due to a notable gap in the existing literature; while numerous studies focus on simulated vehicle platooning systems, there is lack of research demonstrating these controllers on physical vehicle systems or robot platforms. This paper seeks to fill this gap by providing a practical demonstration of CACC systems in action, showcasing their potential for real-world application in intelligent transportation systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Control Design and Analysis for Nonlinear Systems with Uncertain Initial Conditions Based on Lifting Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust control synthesis and analysis framework for nonlinear systems with uncertain initial conditions. First, a deep learning-based lifting approach is proposed to approximate nonlinear dynamical systems with linear parameter-varying (LPV) state-space models in higher-dimensional spaces while simultaneously characterizing the uncertain initial states within the lifted state space. Then, convex synthesis conditions are provided to generate full-state feedback nonstationary LPV (NSLPV) controllers for the lifted LPV system. A performance measure similar to the l2-induced norm is used to provide robust performance guarantees in the presence of exogenous disturbances and uncertain initial conditions. The paper also includes results for synthesizing full-state feedback LTI controllers and output feedback NSLPV controllers. Additionally, a robustness analysis approach based on integral quadratic constraint (IQC) theory is developed to analyze and tune the synthesized controllers while accounting for noise associated with state measurements. This analysis approach characterizes model parameters and disturbance inputs using IQCs to reduce conservatism. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through two illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models for Clean Energy Forecasting: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As global energy systems transit to clean energy, accurate renewable generation and renewable demand forecasting is imperative for effective grid management. Foundation Models (FMs) can help improve forecasting of renewable generation and demand because FMs can rapidly process complex, high-dimensional time-series data. This review paper focuses on FMs in the realm of renewable energy forecasting, primarily focusing on wind and solar. We present an overview of the architectures, pretraining strategies, finetuning methods, and types of data used in the context of renewable energy forecasting. We emphasize the role of models that are trained at a large scale, domain specific Transformer architectures, where attention is paid to spatial temporal correlations, the embedding of domain knowledge, and also the brief and intermittent nature of renewable generation. We assess recent FM based advancements in forecast accuracy such as reconciling predictions over multiple time scales and quantifying uncertainty in renewable energy forecasting. We also review existing challenges and areas of improvement in long-term and multivariate time series forecasting. In this survey, a distinction between theory and practice is established regarding the use of FMs in the clean energy forecasting domain. Additionally, it critically assesses the strengths and weaknesses of FMs while advancing future research direction in this new and exciting area of forecasting.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stochastic Control via Non-i.i.d. Trajectories: Foundations and Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes a crucial step toward advancing data-driven trajectory-based methods for stochastic systems with unknown mathematical dynamics. In contrast to scenario-based approaches that rely on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) trajectories, this work develops a data-driven framework where each trajectory is gathered over a finite horizon and exhibits temporal dependence-referred to as a non-i.i.d. trajectory. To ensure safety of dynamical systems using such trajectories, the current body of literature primarily considers dynamics subject to unknown-but-bounded disturbances, which facilitates robust analysis. While promising, such bounds may be violated in practice and the resulting worst-case robust analysis tends to be overly conservative. To overcome these fundamental challenges, this paper considers stochastic systems with unknown mathematical dynamics, influenced by process noise with unknown distributions. In the proposed framework, data is collected from stochastic systems under multiple realizations within a finite-horizon experiment, where each realization generates a non-i.i.d. trajectory. Leveraging the concept of stochastic control barrier certificates constructed from data, this work quantifies probabilistic safety guarantees with a certified confidence level. To achieve this, the proposed conditions are formulated as sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization problems, relying solely on empirical average of the collected trajectories and statistical features of the process noise. The efficacy of the approach has been validated on three stochastic benchmarks with both unknown models and noise distributions. In one case study, it is shown that while no safety controller exists for the robust analysis of the system under bounded disturbances, the proposed stochastic framework offers a safety controller with guaranteed probabilistic satisfaction.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Ethical Decision-Making in Automated Vehicles through Human Reasons-based Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ethical dilemmas are a common challenge in everyday driving, requiring human drivers to balance competing priorities such as safety, efficiency, and rule compliance. However, much of the existing research in automated vehicles (AVs) has focused on high-stakes "trolley problems," which involve extreme and rare situations. Such scenarios, though rich in ethical implications, are rarely applicable in real-world AV decision-making. In practice, when AVs confront everyday ethical dilemmas, they often appear to prioritise strict adherence to traffic rules. By contrast, human drivers may bend the rules in context-specific situations, using judgement informed by practical concerns such as safety and efficiency. According to the concept of meaningful human control, AVs should respond to human reasons, including those of drivers, vulnerable road users, and policymakers. This work introduces a novel human reasons-based supervision framework that detects when AV behaviour misaligns with expected human reasons to trigger trajectory reconsideration. The framework integrates with motion planning and control systems to support real-time adaptation, enabling decisions that better reflect safety, efficiency, and regulatory considerations. Simulation results demonstrate that this approach could help AVs respond more effectively to ethical challenges in dynamic driving environments by prompting replanning when the current trajectory fails to align with human reasons. These findings suggest that our approach offers a path toward more adaptable, human-centered decision-making in AVs.</description>

      <title>Energy management and flexibility quantification in a discrete event distribution grid simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distribution grid operation faces new challenges caused by a rising share of renewable energy sources and the introduction of additional types of loads to the grid. With the increasing adoption of distributed generation and emerging prosumer households, Energy Management Systems, which manage and apply flexibility of connected devices, are gaining popularity. While potentially beneficial to grid capacity, strategic energy management also adds to the complexity of distribution grid operation and planning processes. Novel approaches of time-series-based planning likewise face increasingly complex simulation scenarios and rising computational cost. Discrete event modelling helps facilitating simulations of such scenarios by restraining computation to the most relevant points in simulation time. We provide an enhancement of a discrete event distribution grid simulation software that offers fast implementation and testing of energy management algorithms, embedded into a feature-rich simulation environment. Physical models are specified using the Discrete Event System Specification. Furthermore, we contribute a communication protocol that makes use of the discrete event paradigm by only computing flexibility potential when necessary.</description>

      <title>Advancing Standard Load Profiles with Data-Driven Techniques and Recent Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating electricity consumption accurately is essential for the planning and operation of energy systems, as well as for billing processes. Standard Load Profiles (SLP) are widely used to estimate consumption patterns of different user groups. However, in Germany these SLP were formulated using historical data from over 20 years ago and have not been adjusted since. Changing electricity consumption behaviour, which leads to increasing deviations between load patterns and SLP, results in a need for a revision taking into account new data. The growing number of smart meters provides a large measurement database, which enables more accurate load modelling. This paper creates updated SLP using recent data. In addition, the assumptions of the SLP method are validated and improvements are proposed, taking into account the ease of applicability. Furthermore, a Fourier Series-based model is proposed as an alternative SLP model. The different models are compared and evaluated.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Cascading Risk Quantification in Multi-Agent Rendezvous: Effects of Time Delay and Network Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving safety in autonomous multi-agent systems, particularly in time-critical tasks like rendezvous, is a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust risk framework for analyzing cascading failures in multi-agent rendezvous. To capture the complex interactions between network connectivity, system dynamics, and communication delays, we use a time-delayed network model as a benchmark. We introduce a conditional distributionally robust functional to quantify cascading effects between agents, utilizing a bi-variate normal distribution. Our approach yields closed-form risk expressions that reveal the impact of time delay, noise statistics, communication topology, and failure modes on rendezvous risk. The insights derived inform the design of resilient networks that mitigate the risk of cascading failures. We validate our theoretical results through extensive simulations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Grid Connections Providing Fast-Frequency Response: System Integration Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an integration study for a power electronic-based fast-frequency response technology, an asynchronous grid connection operating as an aggregator for behindthe-meter resources and distributed generators. Both technical feasibility and techno-economic viability studies are presented. The dynamic performance of the fast-frequency response enabled by the asynchronous grid connection is validated with Power Hardware-in-the-Loop experiments and transferred to an IEEE 9-bus system in DigSilent PowerFactory for dynamic stability analysis. We demonstrate that droop-based control enhancements to the local distributed generators could allow their aggregation to provide grid-supporting functionalities and participate in the market for ancillary services. To this end, we performed a long-term simulation embedding the system within the ancillary service market framework of PJM. The fast-frequency response regulation is subsequently used to calculate the potential revenue and project the results on a 15-year investment horizon. Finally, the techno-economic analysis concludes with recommendations for enhancements to access the full potential of distributed generators on a technical and regulatory level.</description>

      <title>Tensor-based reduction of linear parameter-varying state-space models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) framework is a powerful tool for controlling nonlinear and complex systems, but the conversion of nonlinear models into LPV forms often results in high-dimensional and overly conservative LPV models. To be able to apply control strategies, there is often a need for model reduction in order to reduce computational needs. This paper presents the first systematic approach for the joint reduction of state order and scheduling signal dimension of LPV state space models. The existing methods typically address these reductions separately. By formulating a tensorial form of LPV models with an affine dependency on the scheduling variables, we leverage tensor decomposition to find the dominant components of state and scheduling subspaces. We extend the common Petrov-Galerkin projection approach to LPV framework by adding a scheduling projection. This extension enables the joint reduction. To find suitable subspaces for the extended Petrov-Galerkin projection, we have developed two different methods: tensor-based LPV moment matching, and an approach through Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. Advantages of the proposed methods are demonstrated on two different series-interconnected mass-spring-damper systems with nonlinear springs: one primarily used for comparison with other methods and a more elaborate higher-order model designed to assess scalability.</description>

      <title>Learning with Episodic Hypothesis Testing in General Games: A Framework for Equilibrium Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new hypothesis testing-based learning dynamics in which players update their strategies by combining hypothesis testing with utility-driven exploration. In this dynamics, each player forms beliefs about opponents' strategies and episodically tests these beliefs using empirical observations. Beliefs are resampled either when the hypothesis test is rejected or through exploration, where the probability of exploration decreases with the player's (transformed) utility. In general finite normal-form games, we show that the learning process converges to a set of approximate Nash equilibria and, more importantly, to a refinement that selects equilibria maximizing the minimum (transformed) utility across all players. Our result establishes convergence to equilibrium in general finite games and reveals a novel mechanism for equilibrium selection induced by the structure of the learning dynamics.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based planning of Motion Sequences for Automated Procedure Optimization in Multi-Robot Assembly Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable multi-robot cells offer a promising approach to meet fluctuating assembly demands. However, the recurrent planning of their configurations introduces new challenges, particularly in generating optimized, coordinated multi-robot motion sequences that minimize the assembly duration. This work presents a simulation-based method for generating such optimized sequences. The approach separates assembly steps into task-related core operations and connecting traverse operations. While core operations are constrained and predetermined, traverse operations offer substantial optimization potential. Scheduling the core operations is formulated as an optimization problem, requiring feasible traverse operations to be integrated using a decomposition-based motion planning strategy. Several solution techniques are explored, including a sampling heuristic, tree-based search and gradient-free optimization. For motion planning, a decomposition method is proposed that identifies specific areas in the schedule, which can be solved independently with modified centralized path planning algorithms. The proposed method generates efficient and collision-free multi-robot assembly procedures that outperform a baseline relying on decentralized, robot-individual motion planning. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation experiments.</description>

Abstract: Drifting, characterized by controlled vehicle motion at high sideslip angles, is crucial for safely handling emergency scenarios at the friction limits. While recent reinforcement learning approaches show promise for drifting control, they struggle with the significant simulation-to-reality gap, as policies that perform well in simulation often fail when transferred to physical systems. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework with GPU-accelerated parallel simulation and systematic domain randomization that effectively bridges the gap. The proposed approach is validated on both simulation and a custom-designed and open-sourced 1/10 scale Individual Wheel Drive (IWD) RC car platform featuring independent wheel speed control. Experiments across various scenarios from steady-state circular drifting to direction transitions and variable-curvature path following demonstrate that our approach achieves precise trajectory tracking while maintaining controlled sideslip angles throughout complex maneuvers in both simulated and real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Waypoint Path Planning and Motion Control for Non-holonomic Mobile Robots in Agricultural Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing demand for autonomous mobile robots capable of navigating unstructured agricultural environments. Tasks such as weed control in meadows require efficient path planning through an unordered set of coordinates while minimizing travel distance and adhering to curvature constraints to prevent soil damage and protect vegetation. This paper presents an integrated navigation framework combining a global path planner based on the Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP) with a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategy for local path planning and control. The DTSP generates a minimum-length, curvature-constrained path that efficiently visits all targets, while the NMPC leverages this path to compute control signals to accurately reach each waypoint. The system's performance was validated through comparative simulation analysis on real-world field datasets, demonstrating that the coupled DTSP-based planner produced smoother and shorter paths, with a reduction of about 16% in the provided scenario, compared to decoupled methods. Based thereon, the NMPC controller effectively steered the robot to the desired waypoints, while locally optimizing the trajectory and ensuring adherence to constraints. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework for efficient autonomous navigation in agricultural environments.</description>

      <title>Quantifying and Visualizing Sim-to-Real Gaps: Physics-Guided Regularization for Reproducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-to-real transfer using domain randomization for robot control often relies on low-gear-ratio, backdrivable actuators, but these approaches break down when the sim-to-real gap widens. Inspired by the traditional PID controller, we reinterpret its gains as surrogates for complex, unmodeled plant dynamics. We then introduce a physics-guided gain regularization scheme that measures a robot's effective proportional gains via simple real-world experiments. Then, we penalize any deviation of a neural controller's local input-output sensitivities from these values during training. To avoid the overly conservative bias of naive domain randomization, we also condition the controller on the current plant parameters. On an off-the-shelf two-wheeled balancing robot with a 110:1 gearbox, our gain-regularized, parameter-conditioned RNN achieves angular settling times in hardware that closely match simulation. At the same time, a purely domain-randomized policy exhibits persistent oscillations and a substantial sim-to-real gap. These results demonstrate a lightweight, reproducible framework for closing sim-to-real gaps on affordable robotic hardware.</description>

      <title>Human-Exoskeleton Kinematic Calibration to Improve Hand Tracking for Dexterous Teleoperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hand exoskeletons are critical tools for dexterous teleoperation and immersive manipulation interfaces, but achieving accurate hand tracking remains a challenge due to user-specific anatomical variability and donning inconsistencies. These issues lead to kinematic misalignments that degrade tracking performance and limit applicability in precision tasks. We propose a subject-specific calibration framework for exoskeleton-based hand tracking that uses redundant joint sensing and a residual-weighted optimization strategy to estimate virtual link parameters. Implemented on the Maestro exoskeleton, our method improves joint angle and fingertip position estimation across users with varying hand geometries. We introduce a data-driven approach to empirically tune cost function weights using motion capture ground truth, enabling more accurate and consistent calibration across participants. Quantitative results from seven subjects show substantial reductions in joint and fingertip tracking errors compared to uncalibrated and evenly weighted models. Qualitative visualizations using a Unity-based virtual hand further confirm improvements in motion fidelity. The proposed framework generalizes across exoskeleton designs with closed-loop kinematics and minimal sensing, and lays the foundation for high-fidelity teleoperation and learning-from-demonstration applications.</description>

      <title>From Link Diversity to Cross-Band Feedback Collaboration: A New Perspective on Hybrid Optical-RF Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest a re-examination of the conventional view that hybrid optical-radio frequency (O-RF) systems are primarily diversity-driven networks that switch between RF and optical links for robustness. Instead, we uncover a new architectural opportunity: repurposing the optical downlink to enable real-time feedback channel coding over the RF uplink, where structured decoder feedback is delivered from the access point to guide the transmitter's coding strategy. This insight marks a conceptual paradigm shift from passive link diversity to active cross-band collaboration, where the wideband, interference-free optical wireless communication (OWC) is no longer merely a downlink backup but a functional enabler of uplink reliability. To realize this vision, we propose a novel architecture, O-RF with Cross-Band Feedback (O-RF-CBF), that exploits the optical downlink feedback to facilitate adaptive RF uplink coding. Numerical results reveal that O-RF-CBF achieves significant uplink throughput gains over traditional O-RF systems. Our findings highlight that inter-band synergy, not redundancy, is the key to unlocking the full potential of hybrid wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Learning-based model predictive control for passenger-oriented train rescheduling with flexible train composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on passenger-oriented real-time train rescheduling, considering flexible train composition and rolling stock circulation, by integrating learning-based and optimization-based approaches. A learning-based model predictive control (MPC) approach is developed for real-time train rescheduling with flexible train composition and rolling stock circulation to address time-varying passenger demands. In the proposed approach, the values of the integer variables are obtained by pre-trained long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, while the continuous variables are determined through nonlinear constrained optimization. The learning-based MPC approach enables us to jointly consider efficiency and constraint satisfaction by combining learning-based and optimization-based approaches. In order to reduce the number of integer variables, four presolve techniques are developed to prune a subset of integer decision variables. Numerical simulations based on real-life data from the Beijing urban rail transit system are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed learning-based MPC approach.</description>

      <title>PGLib-CO2: A Power Grid Library for Computing and Optimizing Carbon Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sustainable electricity infrastructure requires the explicit integration of carbon emissions into power system modeling and optimization paradigms. However, existing open-source datasets for power system R&amp;D lack generator-level carbon emission profiling, limiting the ability to benchmark and compare various carbon-aware grid operational strategies. To address this gap, this work introduces PGLib-CO2, an open-source extension to the widely adopted PGLib-OPF test case library. PGLib-CO2 enriches standard network cases with CO2 and CO2-equivalent emission intensity factors by expanding the fuel-type categorization used by PGLib-OPF, attaining a realistic generator-level carbon profiling. It is also packaged for both Python's pandapower and Julia's PowerModels.jl, for a seamless, user-friendly integration of emission modeling into grid computation and optimization tasks. The dataset produced by PGLib-CO2 can support grid-based carbon accounting, emission metric evaluation, and integration into AC optimal power flow (OPF) and optimal load shifting (OLS) formulations. We demonstrate PGLib-CO2's utility through case studies that quantify cost-emission trade-offs and optimize a carbon-aware objective function. By standardizing carbon-enhanced test cases, PGLib-CO2 provides an open-source, reproducible foundation for benchmarking carbon-aware computation, facilitating future research in sustainable power system operation.</description>

      <title>Global Observer Design for a Class of Linear Observed Systems on Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear observed systems on groups encode the geometry of a variety of practical state estimation problems. In this paper, we propose a unified observer framework for a class of linear observed systems by restricting a bi-invariant system on a Lie group to its normal subgroup. This structural property powerfully enables a system immersion of the original system into a linear time-varying system. Leveraging the immersion, an observer is constructed by first designing a Kalman-like observer for the immersed system and then reconstructing the group-valued state via optimization. Under a rank condition, global exponential stability (GES) is achieved provided one global optimum of the reconstruction optimization is found, reflecting the topological difficulties inherent to the non-Euclidean state space. Semi-global stability is guaranteed when input biases are jointly estimated. The theory is applied to the GES observer design for two-frame systems, capable of modeling a family of navigation problems. Two non-trivial examples are provided to illustrate implementation details.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of finite horizon constrained robust optimal control for nonlinear systems subject to norm-bounded disturbances. To this end, the underlying uncertain nonlinear system is decomposed based on a first-order Taylor series expansion into a nominal system and an error (deviation) described as an uncertain linear time-varying system. This decomposition allows us to leverage system level synthesis to jointly optimize an affine error feedback, a nominal nonlinear trajectory, and, most importantly, a dynamic linearization error over-bound used to ensure robust constraint satisfaction for the nonlinear system. The proposed approach thereby results in less conservative planning compared with state-of-the-art techniques. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach to control the rotational motion of a rigid body subject to state and input constraints.</description>

Abstract: In the context of evolving supply chain management, the significance of efficient inventory management has grown substantially for businesses. However, conventional manual and experience-based approaches often struggle to meet the complexities of modern market demands. This research introduces an intelligent inventory management system to address challenges related to inaccurate data, delayed monitoring, and overreliance on subjective experience in forecasting. The proposed system integrates bar code and distributed flutter application technologies for intelligent perception, alongside comprehensive big data analytics to enable data-driven decision-making. Through meticulous analysis, system design, critical technology exploration, and simulation validation, the effectiveness of the proposed system is successfully demonstrated. The intelligent system facilitates second-level monitoring, high-frequency checks, and artificial intelligence-driven forecasting, consequently enhancing the automation, precision, and intelligence of inventory management. This system contributes to cost reduction and optimized inventory sizes through accurate predictions and informed decisions, ultimately achieving a mutually beneficial scenario.

      <title>Optimal Placement and Coordinated Scheduling of Distributed Space-Based Lasers for Orbital Debris Remediation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The significant expansion of the orbital debris population poses a serious threat to the safety and sustainability of space operations. This paper investigates orbital debris remediation through a constellation of collaborative space-based lasers, leveraging the principle of momentum transfer onto debris via laser ablation. A novel delta-v vector analysis framework quantifies the cumulative effects of multiple concurrent laser-to-debris (L2D) engagements by utilizing the vector composition of the imparted delta-v vectors. The paper formulates the Concurrent Location-Scheduling Optimization Problem (CLSP) to optimize the placement of laser platforms and the scheduling of L2D engagements, aiming to maximize debris remediation capacity. Given the computational intractability of the CLSP, a decomposition strategy is employed, yielding two sequential subproblems: (1) determining optimal laser platform locations via the Maximal Covering Location Problem, and (2) scheduling L2D engagements using a novel integer linear programming approach to maximize debris remediation capacity. Computational experiments evaluate the efficacy of the proposed framework across diverse mission scenarios, demonstrating critical constellation functions such as collaborative and controlled nudging, deorbiting, and just-in-time collision avoidance. A sensitivity analysis further explores the impact of varying the number and distribution of laser platforms on debris remediation capacity, offering insights into optimizing the performance of space-based laser constellations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel algorithm for controlling linear time invariant systems in a tracking problem. The controller is based on a Gaussian Process (GP) whose realizations satisfy a system of linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. Control inputs for tracking are determined by conditioning the prior GP on the setpoints, i.e. control as inference. The resulting Model Predictive Control scheme incorporates pointwise soft constraints by introducing virtual setpoints to the posterior Gaussian process. We show theoretically that our controller satisfies open-loop stability for the optimal control problem by leveraging general results from Bayesian inference and demonstrate this result in a numerical example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lyapunov's theorem provides a fundamental characterization of the stability of dynamical systems. This paper presents a categorical framework for Lyapunov theory, generalizing stability analysis with Lyapunov functions categorically. Core to our approach is the set of axioms underlying a setting for stability, which give the necessary ingredients for ``doing Lyapunov theory'' in a category of interest. With these minimal assumptions, we define the stability of equilibria, formulate Lyapunov morphisms, and demonstrate that the existence of Lyapunov morphisms is necessary and sufficient for establishing the stability of flows. To illustrate these constructions, we show how classical notions of stability, e.g., for continuous and discrete time dynamical systems, are captured by this categorical framework for Lyapunov theory. Finally, to demonstrate the extensibility of our framework, we illustrate how enriched categories, e.g., Lawvere metric spaces, yield settings for stability enabling one to ``do Lyapunov theory'' in enriched categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08278v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present FilterDDP, a differential dynamic programming algorithm for solving discrete-time, optimal control problems (OCPs) with nonlinear equality constraints. Unlike prior methods based on merit functions or the augmented Lagrangian class of algorithms, FilterDDP uses a step filter in conjunction with a line search to handle equality constraints. We identify two important design choices for the step filter criteria which lead to robust numerical performance: 1) we use the Lagrangian instead of the cost as one of the filter criterion and, 2) for the stopping criteria and backward pass Hessians, we replace the value function gradient with an estimated dual variable of the dynamics constraints. Both choices are rigorously justified, for 2) in particular by a formal proof of local quadratic convergence. We validate FilterDDP on three contact implicit trajectory optimisation problems which arise in robotics.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework for guaranteeing and evaluating the resilience of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks in control systems. We introduce "recovery time" as a new metric of resilience in order to quantify the time required for an LSTM to return to its normal state after anomalous inputs. By mathematically refining incremental input-to-state stability ($\delta$ISS) theory for LSTM, we derive a practical data-independent upper bound on recovery time. This upper bound gives us resilience-aware training. Experimental validation on simple models demonstrates the effectiveness of our resilience estimation and control methods, enhancing a foundation for rigorous quality assurance in safety-critical AI applications.</description>

      <title>Graph Representation-based Model Poisoning on Federated Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01694</link>

Abstract: Federated large language models (FedLLMs) enable powerful generative capabilities within wireless networks while preserving data privacy. Nonetheless, FedLLMs remain vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. This article first reviews recent advancements in model poisoning techniques and existing defense mechanisms for FedLLMs, underscoring critical limitations, especially when dealing with non-IID textual data distributions. Current defense strategies predominantly employ distance or similarity-based outlier detection mechanisms, relying on the assumption that malicious updates markedly differ from benign statistical patterns. However, this assumption becomes inadequate against adaptive adversaries targeting billion-parameter LLMs. The article further investigates graph representation-based model poisoning (GRMP), an emerging attack paradigm that exploits higher-order correlations among benign client gradients to craft malicious updates indistinguishable from legitimate ones. GRMP can effectively circumvent advanced defense systems, causing substantial degradation in model accuracy and overall performance. Moreover, the article outlines a forward-looking research roadmap that emphasizes the necessity of graph-aware secure aggregation methods, specialized vulnerability metrics tailored for FedLLMs, and evaluation frameworks to enhance the robustness of federated language model deployments.</description>

      <title>Incremental Collision Laws Based on the Bouc-Wen Model: External Forces and Corner Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07953v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the article titled "The Bouc-Wen Model for Binary Direct Collinear Collisions of Convex Viscoplastic Bodies" and published in the Journal of Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics (Volume 20, Issue 6, June 2025), the authors studied mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies that employed two incremental collision laws based on the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis. It was shown that the models possess favorable analytical properties, and several model parameter identification studies were conducted, demonstrating that the models can accurately capture the nature of a variety of collision phenomena. In this article, the aforementioned models are augmented by modeling the effects of external forces as time-dependent inputs that belong to a certain function space. Furthermore, the range of the parameters under which the models possess favorable analytical properties is extended to several corner cases that were not considered in the prior publication. Finally, the previously conducted model parameter identification studies are extended, and an additional model parameter identification study is provided in an attempt to validate the ability of the augmented models to represent the effects of external forces.</description>
