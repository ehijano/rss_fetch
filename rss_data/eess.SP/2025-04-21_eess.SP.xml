      <title>Focus3D: A Practical Method to Adaptively Focus ISAR Data and Provide 3-D Information for Automatic Target Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To improve ATR identification of ships at sea requires an advanced ISAR processor - one that not only provides focused images but can also determine the pose of the ship. This tells us whether the image shows a profile (vertical plane) view, a plan (horizontal plane) view or some view in between. If the processor can provide this information, then the ATR processor can try to match the images with known vertical or horizontal features of ships and, in conjunction with estimated ship length, narrow the set of possible identifications. This paper extends the work of Melendez and Bennett [M-B, Ref. 1] by combining a focus algorithm with a method that models the angles of the ship relative to the radar. In M-B the algorithm was limited to a single angle and the plane of rotation was not determined. This assumption may be fine for a short time image where there is limited data available to determine the pose. However, the present paper models the ship rotation with two angles - aspect angle, representing rotation in the horizontal plane, and tilt angle, representing variations in the effective grazing angle to the ship.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning-Based Supervised Transfer Learning Framework for DOA Estimation with Array Imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical scenarios, processes such as sensor design, manufacturing, and installation will introduce certain errors. Furthermore, mutual interference occurs when the sensors receive signals. These defects in array systems are referred to as array imperfections, which can significantly degrade the performance of Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation. In this study, we propose a deep-learning based transfer learning approach, which effectively mitigates the degradation of deep-learning based DOA estimation performance caused by array imperfections.
  In the proposed approach, we highlight three major contributions. First, we propose a Vision Transformer (ViT) based method for DOA estimation, which achieves excellent performance in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and limited snapshots. Second, we introduce a transfer learning framework that extends deep learning models from ideal simulation scenarios to complex real-world scenarios with array imperfections. By leveraging prior knowledge from ideal simulation data, the proposed transfer learning framework significantly improves deep learning-based DOA estimation performance in the presence of array imperfections, without the need for extensive real-world data. Finally, we incorporate visualization and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of DOA estimation algorithms, which allow for a more thorough evaluation of algorithms and further validate the proposed method.

      <title>Modular XL-Array-Enabled 3-D Localization based on Hybrid Spherical-Planar Wave Model in Terahertz Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers the three-dimensional (3-D) positioning problem in a Terahertz (THz) system enabled by a modular extra-large (XL) array with sub-connected architecture. Our purpose is to estimate the Cartesian Coordinates of multiple user equipments (UEs) with the received signal of the RF chains while considering the spatial non-stationarity (SNS). We apply the hybrid spherical-planar wave model (HSPWM) as the channel model owing to the structual feature of the modular array, and propose a 3-D localization algorithm with relatively high accuracy and low complexity. Specifically, we first distinguish the visible sub-arrays (SAs) located in the VR and estimate the angles-of-arrival (AoAs) from each UE to typical visible SAs with the largest receive power via compressed sensing (CS) method. In addition, we apply the weighted least square (WLS) method to obtain a coarse 3-D position estimation of each UE according to the AoA estimations. Then, we estimate the AoAs of the other SAs with a reduced dictionary (RD)-CS-based method for lower computational complexity, and utilize all the efficient AoA estimations to derive a fine position estimation. Simulation results indicate that the proposed positioning framework based on modular XL-array can achieve satisfactory accuracy with evident reduction in complexity. Furthermore, the deployment of SAs and the allocation of antenna elements need to be specially designed for better positioning performance.</description>

      <title>Accurate semiclassical analysis of light propagation on tilted hyperplanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the scalar light model given by Helmholtz' equation in R^{1+d} , we consider the transformation of an initial scene (a hologram) in {0}xR^d by an arbitrary affine transformation (which can be viewed as a propagation into a tilted hyperplane). In the high frequency regime, we use microlocal and semiclassical analysis to describe the propagator as a semiclassical Fourier integral operator, thus generalising the well-known Angular Spectrum formula from optics. We then prove new precise Egorov theorems, including subprincipal terms, which indicate how to take into account the propagation along rays of geometric optics.</description>

      <title>Block-Weighted Lasso for Joint Optimization of Memory Depth and Kernels in Wideband DPD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimizations of both memory depth and kernel functions are critical for wideband digital pre-distortion (DPD). However, the memory depth is usually determined via exhaustive search over a wide range for the sake of linearization optimality, followed by the kernel selection of each memory depth, yielding excessive computational cost. In this letter, we aim to provide an efficient solution that jointly optimizes the memory depth and kernels while preserving reasonable linearization performance. Specifically, we propose to formulate this optimization as a blockweighted least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) problem, where kernels are assigned regularization weights based on their polynomial orders. Then, a block coordinate descent algorithm is introduced to solve the block-weighted Lasso problem. Measurement results on a generalized memory polynomial (GMP) model demonstrates that our proposed solution reduces memory depth by 31.6% and kernel count by 85% compared to the full GMP, while achieving -46.4 dB error vector magnitude (EVM) for signals of 80 MHz bandwidth. In addition, the proposed solution outperforms both the full GMP and the GMP pruned by standard Lasso by at least 0.7 dB in EVM.</description>

      <title>Integrated Super-resolution Sensing and Symbiotic Communication with 3D Sparse MIMO for Low-Altitude UAV Swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms are expected to play important role for future intelligent aerial systems due to their great potential to cooperatively accomplish complicated missions effectively. However, there are important challenges to be addressed to enable their efficient operation: the large-scale nature of swarms usually leads to excessive spectrum consumption, and ultra-low cost requirements for individual UAVs renders it necessary to develop more cost-effective communication modules. In addition, the densely located swarm UAVs require high resolution for localization and sensing. To address the above challenges and simultaneously achieve spectrum and energy-efficient communication and accurate sensing, we investigate low-altitude UAV swarm with integrated super-resolution sensing and symbiotic communication technology. Specifically, one leading UAV may act as a primary transmitter (PT) to transmit communication signals to the base station (BS), and the remaining nearby UAVs in the swarm act as passive backscatter devices (BDs), which can modulate their information by efficiently backscattering the radio frequency (RF) signals from the PT without consuming extra spectrum or power. In addition, to achieve efficient three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution sensing for the densely located UAV swarm, 3D sparse multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology and super-resolution signal processing algorithms are further exploited, where both L-shaped nested array (LNA) and planar nested arrays (PNA) are considered at the BS. To evaluate the communication and sensing performance for the UAV-symbiotic radio (SR) system, the achievable rates of UAV swarm are derived and the beam patterns of sparse LNA, PNA and the benchmarking compact uniform planar array (UPA) are compared.</description>

      <title>Design Of a Dual-band Patch Antenna with Stacked Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project presents the design, simulation, and fabrication of a compact dual-band patch antenna using a stacked structure, targeting 2.25 to 2.35 GHz and 5.6 to 5.8 GHz ISM bands. A stacked configuration was chosen over a slotted design for its better performance, featuring two copper patches separated by dielectrics, with a single feed line and a 5 mm patch offset to enhance coupling. Simulations showed strong return loss and directional gain in both bands. Although physical testing was limited due to equipment constraints, the prototype met design expectations, demonstrating potential for use in compact wireless and embedded systems.</description>

      <title>PV-VLM: A Multimodal Vision-Language Approach Incorporating Sky Images for Intra-Hour Photovoltaic Power Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of solar energy has significantly expedited the integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into contemporary power grids. Considering that the cloud dynamics frequently induce rapid fluctuations in solar irradiance, accurate intra-hour forecasting is critical for ensuring grid stability and facilitating effective energy management. To leverage complementary temporal, textual, and visual information, this paper has proposed PV-VLM, a multimodal forecasting framework that integrates temporal, textual, and visual information by three modules. The Time-Aware Module employed a PatchTST-inspired Transformer to capture both local and global dependencies in PV power time series. Meanwhile, the Prompt-Aware Module encodes textual prompts from historical statistics and dataset descriptors via a large language model. Additionally, the Vision-Aware Module utilizes a pretrained vision-language model to extract high-level semantic features from sky images, emphasizing cloud motion and irradiance fluctuations. The proposed PV-VLM is evaluated using data from a 30-kW rooftop array at Stanford University and through a transfer study on PV systems at the University of Wollongong in Australia. Comparative experiments reveal an average RMSE reduction of approximately 5% and a MAE improvement of nearly 6%, while the transfer study shows average RMSE and MAE reductions of about 7% and 9.5%, respectively. Overall, PV-VLM leverages complementary modalities to provide a robust solution for grid scheduling and energy market participation, enhancing the stability and reliability of PV integration.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Authentication With Colored RIS in Visible Light Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a visible light communication (VLC) system that employs a colored reconfigurable intelligent surface (CRIS) based on dichroic mirrors that reflect light at tunable frequencies. A verifier can use the CRIS to authenticate transmissions by comparing received multicolor power profiles with expected patterns. Four CRIS configuration strategies are evaluated: a deterministic cyclic pattern, static random reflectance, dynamic random reflectance, and dynamic random permutation of fixed profiles. Randomized configurations, especially dynamic ones, achieve superior authentication, enabling a novel challenge-response physical-layer authentication scheme over CRIS.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)-enabled Secure Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel pinching-antenna systems (PASS)-enabled secure wireless communication framework is proposed. By dynamically adjusting the positions of dielectric particles, namely pinching antennas (PAs), along the waveguides, PASS introduces a novel concept of pinching beamforming to enhance the performance of physical layer security. A fundamental PASS-enabled secure communication system is considered with one legitimate user and one eavesdropper. Both single-waveguide and multiple-waveguide scenarios are studied. 1) For the single-waveguide scenario, the secrecy rate (SR) maximization is formulated to optimize the pinching beamforming. A PA-wise successive tuning (PAST) algorithm is proposed, which ensures constructive signal superposition at the legitimate user while inducing a destructive legitimate signal at the eavesdropper. 2) For the multiple-waveguide scenario, artificial noise (AN) is employed to further improve secrecy performance. A pair of practical transmission architectures are developed: waveguide division (WD) and waveguide multiplexing (WM). The key difference lies in whether each waveguide carries a single type of signal or a mixture of signals with baseband beamforming. For the SR maximization problem under the WD case, a two-stage algorithm is developed, where the pinching beamforming is designed with the PAST algorithm and the baseband power allocation among AN and legitimate signals is solved using successive convex approximation (SCA). For the WM case, an alternating optimization algorithm is developed, where the baseband beamforming is optimized with SCA and the pinching beamforming is designed employing particle swarm optimization.</description>

      <title>QoS-Aware NOMA Design for Downlink Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching antennas, implemented by applying small dielectric particles on a waveguide, have emerged as a promising flexible-antenna technology ideal for next-generation wireless communications systems. Unlike conventional flexible-antenna systems, pinching antennas offer the advantage of creating line-of-sight links by enabling antennas to be activated on the waveguide at a location close to the user. This paper investigates a typical two-user non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) downlink scenario, where multiple pinching antennas are activated on a single dielectric waveguide to assist NOMA transmission. We formulate the problem of maximizing the data rate of one user subject to the quality-of-service requirement of the other user by jointly optimizing the antenna locations and power allocation coefficients. The formulated problem is nonconvex and difficult to solve due to the impact of antenna locations on large-scale path loss and two types of phase shifts, namely in-waveguide phase shifts and free space propagation phase shifts. To this end, we propose an iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques. Moreover, we consider the special case with a single pinching antenna, which is a simplified version of the multi-antenna case. Although the formulated problem is still nonconvex, by using the inherent features of the formulated problem, we derive the global optimal solution in closed-form, which offers important insights on the performance of pinching-antenna systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the pinching-antenna system significantly outperforms conventional fixed-position antenna systems, and the proposed algorithm achieves performance comparable to the computationally intensive exhaustive search based approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating sensing and communication (ISAC) can help overcome the challenges of limited spectrum and expensive hardware, leading to improved energy and cost efficiency. While full cooperation between sensing and communication can result in significant performance gains, achieving optimal performance requires efficient designs of unified waveforms and beamformers for joint sensing and communication. Sophisticated statistical signal processing and multi-objective optimization techniques are necessary to balance the competing design requirements of joint sensing and communication tasks. Since model-based analytical approaches may be suboptimal or overly complex, deep learning emerges as a powerful tool for developing data-driven signal processing algorithms, particularly when optimal algorithms are unknown or when known algorithms are too complex for real-time implementation. Unified waveform and beamformer design problems for ISAC fall into this category, where fundamental design trade-offs exist between sensing and communication performance metrics, and the underlying models may be inadequate or incomplete. This article explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in ISAC designs to enhance efficiency and reduce complexity. We emphasize the integration benefits through AI-driven ISAC designs, prioritizing the development of unified waveforms, constellations, and beamforming strategies for both sensing and communication. To illustrate the practical potential of AI-driven ISAC, we present two case studies on waveform and beamforming design, demonstrating how unsupervised learning and neural network-based optimization can effectively balance performance, complexity, and implementation constraints.</description>

Abstract: We compute the Fr\'echet mean $\mathscr{E}_t$ of the solution $X_{t}$ to a continuous-time stochastic differential equation in a Lie group. It provides an estimator with minimal variance of $X_{t}$. We use it in the context of Kalman filtering and more precisely to infer rotation matrices. In this paper, we focus on the prediction step between two consecutive observations. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our assumptions on the model are minimal.</description>

Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are an emerging technology for next-generation wireless base stations, distinguished by hybrid analog/digital beamforming capabilities with low hardware complexity. However, the coupling between meta-atoms is fixed in existing DMAs, which fundamentally constrains the achievable performance. Here, we introduce reconfigurable coupling mechanisms between meta-atoms, yielding finer control over the DMA's analog signal processing capabilities. This novel hardware is coined "beyond-diagonal DMA" (BD-DMA), in line with established BD-RIS terminology. We derive a physics-consistent system model revealing (correlated) "beyond-diagonal" programmability in a reduced basis. We also present an equivalent formulation in a non-reduced basis with (uncorrelated) "diagonal" programmability. Based on the diagonal representation, we propose a general and efficient mutual-coupling-aware optimization algorithm. Physics-consistent simulations validate the performance enhancement enabled by reconfigurable coupling mechanisms in BD-DMAs. The BD-DMA benefits grow with the mutual coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Efficient algorithms for the Hadamard decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hadamard decomposition is a powerful technique for data analysis and matrix compression, which decomposes a given matrix into the element-wise product of two or more low-rank matrices. In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, leveraging an alternating optimization approach that decomposes the global non-convex problem into a series of convex sub-problems. To improve performance, we explore advanced initialization strategies inspired by the singular value decomposition (SVD) and incorporate acceleration techniques by introducing momentum-based updates. Beyond optimizing the two-matrix case, we also extend the Hadamard decomposition framework to support more than two low-rank matrices, enabling approximations with higher effective ranks while preserving computational efficiency. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to compare our method with the existing gradient descent-based approaches for the Hadamard decomposition and with traditional low-rank approximation techniques. The results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed method across diverse datasets.</description>

      <title>Green Robotic Mixed Reality with Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing green communication in robotic mixed reality (RoboMR) systems presents a challenge, due to the necessity of uploading high-resolution images at high frequencies through wireless channels. This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR (GSRMR), which achieves a lower energy consumption and makes a concrete step towards green RoboMR. The crux to GSRMR is to build a GS model which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a photo-realistic view from the robot's pose, thereby reducing the need for excessive image uploads. Since the GS model may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which jointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or not) and power allocation across different frames. The GSCLO problem is solved by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed GSRMR reduces the communication energy by over 10x compared with RoboMR. Furthermore, the proposed GSRMR with APO outperforms extensive baseline schemes, in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM).</description>

      <title>Sensing-Then-Beamforming: Robust Transmission Design for RIS-Empowered Integrated Sensing and Covert Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional covert communication often relies on the knowledge of the warden's channel state information, which is inherently challenging to obtain due to the non-cooperative nature and potential mobility of the warden. The integration of sensing and communication technology provides a promising solution by enabling the legitimate transmitter to sense and track the warden, thereby enhancing transmission covertness. In this paper, we develop a framework for sensing-then-beamforming in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered integrated sensing and covert communication (ISCC) systems, where the transmitter (Alice) estimates and tracks the mobile aerial warden's channel using sensing echo signals while simultaneously sending covert information to multiple legitimate users (Bobs) with the assistance of RIS, under the surveillance of the warden (Willie). Considering channel estimation errors, we formulate a robust non-convex optimization problem that jointly designs the communication beamformers, the sensing signal covariance matrix at Alice, and the phase shifts at the RIS to maximize the covert sum rate of Bobs while satisfying the constraints related to covert communication, sensing, transmitter power, and the unit modulus of the RIS elements. To solve this complex problem, we develop an efficient algorithm using alternating optimization, successive convex approximation, S-procedure, sequential rank-one constraint relaxation, and semidefinite relaxation techniques. Numerical results confirm the convergence of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness in tracking the warden's channel while ensuring robust covert transmission. Furthermore, the results highlight the advantages of using RIS to enhance the covert transmission rate compared to baseline schemes, and also illustrate the intricate trade-off between communication and sensing in ISCC systems.</description>

      <title>BUPTCMCC-6G-CMG+: A GBSM-Based ISAC Standard Channel Model Generator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14441v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been recognized as the key technology in the vision of the sixth generation (6G) era. With the emergence of new concepts in mobile communications, the channel model is the prerequisite for system design and performance evaluation. Currently, 3GPP Release 19 is advancing the standardization of ISAC channel models. Nevertheless, a unified modeling framework has yet to be established. This paper provides a simulation diagram of ISAC channel modeling extended based on the Geometry-Based Stochastic Model (GBSM), compatible with existing 5G channel models and the latest progress in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standardization. We first introduce the progress of the ISAC channel model standardization in general. Then, a concatenated channel modeling approach is presented considering the team's standardization proposals, which is implemented on the BUPTCMCC-6G-CMG+ channel model generator. We validated the model in cumulative probability density function (CDF) in statistical extension of angle and delay, and radar cross section (RCS). Simulation results show that the proposed model can realistically characterize the feature of channel concatenation and RCS within the ISAC channel.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Limitations of Structured Orthogonal Dictionary Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is motivated by recent applications of structured dictionary learning, in particular when the dictionary is assumed to be the product of a few Householder atoms. We investigate the following two problems: 1) How do we approximate an orthogonal matrix $\mathbf{V}$ with a product of a specified number of Householder matrices, and 2) How many samples are required to learn a structured (Householder) dictionary from data? For 1) we discuss an algorithm that decomposes $\mathbf{V}$ as a product of a specified number of Householder matrices. We see that the algorithm outputs the decomposition when it exists, and give bounds on the approximation error of the algorithm when such a decomposition does not exist. For 2) given data $\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{HX}$, we show that when assuming a binary coefficient matrix $\mathbf{X}$, the structured (Householder) dictionary learning problem can be solved with just $2$ samples (columns) in $\mathbf{Y}$.</description>

      <title>RIS Meets O-RAN: A Practical Demonstration of Multi-user RIS Optimization through RIC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) along with artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud and edge networking, and virtualization are important enablers for designing flexible and software-driven programmable wireless networks. In addition, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) represent an innovative technology to direct incoming radio signals toward desired locations by software-controlled passive reflecting antenna elements. Despite their distinctive potential, there has been limited exploration of integrating RIS with the O-RAN framework, an area that holds promise for enhancing next-generation wireless systems. This paper addresses this gap by designing and developing the RIS optimization xApps within an O-RAN-based real-time 5G environment. We perform extensive measurement experiments using an end-to-end 5G testbed including the RIS prototype in a multi-user scenario. The results demonstrate that the RIS can be utilized either to boost the performance of the selected user or to provide the fairness among the users or to balance the tradeoff between the performance and fairness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) is a promising technology that exploits new spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to improve wireless communication and sensing performance. In this letter, we investigate an RA-enabled secure communication system where confidential information is transmitted from an RA-based access point (AP) to a single-antenna legitimate user in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. We aim to maximize the achievable secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the deflection angles of all RAs. Accordingly, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution in an iterative manner, where the generalized Rayleigh quotient-based beamforming is applied and the RAs' deflection angles are optimized by the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Simulation results show that the proposed RA-enabled secure communication system achieves significant improvement in achievable secrecy rate as compared to various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>On the Shift Invariance of Max Pooling Feature Maps in Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on improving the mathematical interpretability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the context of image classification. Specifically, we tackle the instability issue arising in their first layer, which tends to learn parameters that closely resemble oriented band-pass filters when trained on datasets like ImageNet. Subsampled convolutions with such Gabor-like filters are prone to aliasing, causing sensitivity to small input shifts. In this context, we establish conditions under which the max pooling operator approximates a complex modulus, which is nearly shift invariant. We then derive a measure of shift invariance for subsampled convolutions followed by max pooling. In particular, we highlight the crucial role played by the filter's frequency and orientation in achieving stability. We experimentally validate our theory by considering a deterministic feature extractor based on the dual-tree complex wavelet packet transform, a particular case of discrete Gabor-like decomposition.</description>

      <title>BRIGHT: A globally distributed multimodal building damage assessment dataset with very-high-resolution for all-weather disaster response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disaster events occur around the world and cause significant damage to human life and property. Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment (BDA), an essential capability in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and to inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on the development of AI models to achieve accurate mapping of unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. However, solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal (MM) EO data, particularly the combination of optical and SAR imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the development of robust multimodal AI models has been constrained by the lack of suitable benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present a BDA dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (BRIGHT) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, BRIGHT is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse MM dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of man-made disasters across 14 regions worldwide, with a particular focus on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The optical and SAR imagery in BRIGHT, with a spatial resolution between 0.3-1 meters, provides detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise BDA. In our experiments, we have tested seven advanced AI models trained with our BRIGHT to validate the transferability and robustness. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT. BRIGHT also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest.</description>

      <title>Stability and performance guarantees for misspecified multivariate score-driven filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of tracking multivariate unobserved time-varying parameters under potential model misspecification. Specifically, we examine implicit and explicit score-driven (ISD and ESD) filters, which update parameter predictions using the gradient of the postulated logarithmic observation density (commonly referred to as the score). For both filter types, we derive novel sufficient conditions that ensure the invertibility of the filtered parameter path and the existence of a finite mean squared error (MSE) bound relative to the pseudo-true parameter path. Our (non-)asymptotic MSE bounds rely on mild moment conditions on the data-generating process, while our invertibility result is agnostic about the true process. For the ISD filter, concavity of the postulated log density combined with simple parameter restrictions is sufficient (though not necessary) to guarantee stability. In contrast, the ESD filter additionally requires the score to be Lipschitz continuous. We validate our theoretical findings and highlight the superior stability and performance of ISD over ESD filters through extensive simulation studies. Finally, we demonstrate the practical relevance of our approach through an empirical application to U.S. Treasury-bill rates.</description>

      <title>Mind2Matter: Creating 3D Models from EEG Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reconstruction of 3D objects from brain signals has gained significant attention in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Current research predominantly utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 3D reconstruction tasks due to its excellent spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of fMRI is limited by its prohibitive costs and inability to support real-time operations. In comparison, electroencephalography (EEG) presents distinct advantages as an affordable, non-invasive, and mobile solution for real-time brain-computer interaction systems. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled remarkable progress in image generation from neural data, decoding EEG signals into structured 3D representations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that translates EEG recordings into 3D object reconstructions by leveraging neural decoding techniques and generative models. Our approach involves training an EEG encoder to extract spatiotemporal visual features, fine-tuning a large language model to interpret these features into descriptive multimodal outputs, and leveraging generative 3D Gaussians with layout-guided control to synthesize the final 3D structures. Experiments demonstrate that our model captures salient geometric and semantic features, paving the way for applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), virtual reality, and neuroprosthetics.
