      <title>Gravitational Wave Probe of Planck-scale Physics After Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle decays are always accompanied by the emission of graviton quanta of gravity through bremsstrahlung processes. However, the corresponding branching ratio is suppressed by the square of the ratio of particle's mass to the Planck scale. The resulting present abundance of gravitational waves (GWs), composed of gravitons, is analogously suppressed. We show that superheavy particles, as heavy as the Planck scale, can be naturally produced during the post-inflationary reheating stage in the early Universe and their decays yield dramatic amounts of GWs over broad frequency range. GW observations could hence directly probe Planck-scale physics, notoriously challenging to explore.</description>

      <title>Continuous Gravitational Waves: A New Window to Look for Heavy Non-annihilating Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sun-like stars can transmute into comparable mass black holes by steadily accumulating heavy non-annihilating dark matter particles over the course of their lives. If such stars form in binary systems, they could give rise to quasi-monochromatic, persistent gravitational waves, commonly known as continuous gravitational waves, as they inspiral towards one another. We demonstrate that next-generation space-based detectors, e.g., Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and Big Bang Observer (BBO), can provide novel constraints on dark matter parameters (dark matter mass and its interaction cross-section with the nucleons) by probing gravitational waves from transmuted Sun-like stars that are in close binaries. Our projected constraints depend on several astrophysical uncertainties, nevertheless, are competitive with the existing constraints obtained from cosmological measurements as well as terrestrial direct searches, demonstrating a notable science-case for these space-based gravitational wave detectors as probes of particle dark matter.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Light New Particles in $B\to K^{(*)} E_{\rm miss}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent Belle II observation of $B \to K E_{\rm miss}$ challenges theoretical interpretations in terms of Standard Model neutrino final states. Instead, we consider new physics scenarios where up to two new light-invisible particles of spin 0 up to 3/2 are present in the final state. We identify viable scenarios by reconstructing the (binned) likelihoods of the relevant $B \to K^{(*)} E_{\rm miss}$ and also $B_s \to E_{\rm miss}$ experimental analyses and present preferred regions of couplings and masses. In particular, we find that the current data prefers two-body decay kinematics involving the emission of a single massive scalar or a vector particle, or alternatively, three-body decays involving pairs of massive scalars or spin 1/2 fermions. When applicable, we compare our findings with existing literature and briefly discuss some model-building implications.</description>

      <title>Background-Induced Forces from Dark Relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light particles quadratically coupled to nucleons induce macroscopic forces in matter. While a quantum effect always exists, an additional force occurs in the presence of a finite density of the light particles. We compute and classify such background-induced forces for particles of spin $0,\frac{1}{2},1$ in the framework of effective field theory. We show that, at short distance, the background-induced forces exhibit a universal behavior that depends solely on the moments of the phase space distribution function of the light particles. We compute the forces in the case of thermal-like densities of dark particles that may realistically occur in cosmology. All the background-induced forces remain, unlike the quantum ones, exponentially unsuppressed at large distance, implying that large scale fifth force experiments are highly sensitive to dark relics. Moreover at zero mass the forces from dark bosons are generically enhanced with respect to their quantum counterpart due to Bose-Einstein distribution. Overall, we find that the resulting fifth force bounds can compete with those from quantum forces. A thorough adaptation of the results from the E\"ot-Wash experiment may produce powerful additional bounds.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Moment of $\Xi_b(6227)$ as Molecular Pentaquark State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation of $\Xi_b(6227)$ state, in this study considering $\Xi_b(6227)$ has a molecular structure, we calculate magnetic moment of this state in quark model. The magnetic moment of a hadron gives valuable information about the internal structure and shape deformations. We observe that orbital excitation of $\Xi_b(6227)$ molecular state change the results of magnetic moment significantly. We also observe that light quarks in $\Xi_b(6227)$ molecular state determine magnetic moment. Measurement of the magnetic moment of $\Xi_b(6227)$ can clarify the nature of this state and be useful to identify the quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>Tripartite entanglement in $H \to ZZ,WW$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decays of the Higgs boson produce a state in which the spins of the decay products and the orbital angular momentum ($L$) are highly entangled. We obtain the tripartite density operator, as well as reduced operators, for the decay into two weak bosons. For $H \to ZZ$ in the four-lepton final state we also estimate the statistical sensitivity at the Large Hadron Collider and future upgrades, using a binned method to reconstruct the density operators from distributions. With the expected Run 3 data, establishing genuine tripartite entanglement would be possible beyond the $5\sigma$ level. The violation of Bell inequalities involving the spins of the two weak bosons could also be established beyond the $5\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>Smooth $\mu$-Hybrid and Non-Minimal Higgs Inflation in $SU(4)_{C}\times SU(2)_{L}\times SU(2)_{R}$ With Observable Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to study a smooth variant of the $\mu$-hybrid inflation model and a non-minimal Higgs model of inflation with quartic non-minimal coupling between the Higgs field and gravity within the context of a realistic GUT gauge group based on supersymmetric $SU(4)_{C}\times SU(2)_{L}\times SU(2)_{R}$. These models are incorporated with a realistic scenario of reheating and non-thermal leptogenesis, compatible with the constraints from the baryon asymmetry of the universe. Notably, both models successfully address the MSSM $\mu$-problem and avoid the issue of primordial magnetic monopoles. Our analysis reveals that both models predict a scalar spectral index $n_s$ that closely aligns with the central observationally favored value of Planck2018 + BICEP2/Keck Array (BK15) data and yield a large tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r &gt; 10^{-3}$), potentially detectable in forthcoming CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>Approximate SU(5), Fine Structure Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fit the three finestructure constants of the Standard Model with three, in first approximation theoretically estimable parameters, 1) a "unifiedscale",turning out not equal to the Planck scale and thus only estimable by a very speculative story, 2) a "number of layers" being a priori the number of families, and 3) a unified coupling related to a critical coupling on a lattice. So formally we postdict the three fine structure constants! In the philosophy of our model there is a physically lattice theory with link variables taking values in a (or in the various) "small" representations of the Standard Model Group. We argue for that these representations functio in first approximation as were the theory a genuine $SU(5)$ theory. Next we take into account fluctuation of the gauge fields in the lattice and obtain a correction to the a priori $SU(5)$ approximation, because of course the link fluctuations not corresponding any Standard model Lie algebra, but only to the SU(5), do not exist. The model is a development of our old anti-grand-unification model having as its genuine gauge group, close to fundamental scale, a cross product of the standard model group S(U(3)x U(2)) with itself, there being one Cartesian product factor for each family. In these old works we included the hypotesis of "multiple point criticallity principle" which here effectively means the coupling constants be critical on the lattice. Counted relative to the Higgs scale we suggest the in our sense "unified scale" (where the deviations between the inverse fine structure constants deviate by quantum fluctuations being only from standard model groups, not SU(5)) makes up the 2/3 th power of the Planck scale relative to the Higgs scale, or better the top quark mass scale.</description>

      <title>Radiative inverse seesaw model with hidden $U(1)$ gauge symmetry enhancing lepton $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new inverse seesaw model based on hidden local $U(1)$ symmetry framework where inverse seesaw mechanism is induced at one loop level. A Majorana mass term of singlet fermion is forbidden by the $U(1)$ symmetry and it is generated at one-loop level by introducing relevant particle contents to get loop diagram, inducing inverse seesaw mechanism. The same particle contents also contribute to lepton magnetic(electric) dipole moment and lepton flavor violating decays without chiral suppression. We can then obtain sizable muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment that accommodate with deviation from the standard model prediction. The constraints from lepton flavor violating decays and electron magnetic(electric) dipole moment are also discussed to explore testability of the model.</description>

      <title>Electron-positron annihilation into $K\bar{K}\pi$ and their contributions to $(g-2)_\mu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a coherent study of the $e^+e^-$ annihilation into $K^+K^-\pi^0$, $K^0_SK^0_L\pi^0$ and $K^0_SK^\pm\pi^\mp$ is carried out within the framework of resonance chiral theory. The amplitudes are fixed by fitting to the experimental cross-section and invariant mass spectrum. With these amplitudes, one can calculate the hadronic vacuum polarization form factors of these processes. The leading order contributions of $\sigma(e^+e^- \to K\bar{K}\pi)$ to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $(g-2)_\mu$, is obtained as $a_\mu^{\rm HVP,LO}(e^+e^- \to K\bar{K}\pi)=(3.07\pm0.07)\times10^{-10}$ up to $E_{\rm cm}=2.3$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Constraining scalars of $16_H$ through proton decays in non-renormalisable $SO(10)$ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-renormalisable versions of $SO(10)$ based on irreducible representations with lesser degrees of freedom, are free of running into the catastrophe of non-perturbativity of standard model gauge couplings in contrast to the renormalisable versions having tensors with many degrees of freedom. $16_H$ is the smallest representation, participates in Yukawa Lagrangian at the non-renormalisable level, contributing to the charged and neutral fermion masses, and has six distinct scalars with different $B-L$ charges. We computed the leptoquark and diquark couplings of different pairs of scalars stemming from all possible decomposition of the term resulting from the coupling of $16_{\rm{H}}$ with the $\mathbf{16}$ dimensional fermion multiplet of $SO(10)$, i.e. $\frac{\mathbf{16}\,\mathbf{16}\,16_{\rm{H}}\,16_{\rm{H}}}{\Lambda}$. Computing the tree and loop level contribution of different pairs to the effective dimension six, $B-L$ conserving operators, it turns out only three pairs, viz $\sigma\big(1,1,0\big)- T\big(3,1,\frac{1}{3}\big)$, and $H\big(1,2,-\frac{1}{2}\big)-\Delta\big(3,2,\frac{1}{6}\big)$, and $H-T$ can induce proton decay at tree level. Assuming that the Yukawa couplings of the $16_{\rm{H}}$ are comparable to those of the $\overline{126}_{\rm{H}}$ of a realistic SO(10) model and setting the cutoff scale to the Planck scale typically constrains the $B-L$ breaking scale to be $4\sim 5$ orders of magnitude less than the cutoff scale $(\Lambda)$. Moreover, analysing the branching pattern of the leading two-body decay modes of the proton, we observed a preference for the proton to decay into second-generation mesons due to the hierarchical nature of Yukawa couplings. In a realistic $SO(10)$ scenario, we find that $M_T &gt;10^{8}$ TeV, while $M_\Delta$ could be as light as a few TeV$s$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute top quark pair production in association with a bottom quark pair at the LHC within the five-flavour scheme, employing the FxFx merging scheme for $t\bar{t}+\textrm{jets}$ production with up to 2 jets at NLO accuracy. To enhance the selection efficiency for the events with $b$-jets within the inclusive five-flavour sample, we augment the generation probability of bottom quark flavours in the short-distance event generation. Our analysis reveals significant differences from NLO predictions within the four-flavour scheme.</description>

      <title>Magnetic corrections to the QCD coupling: strong field approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the 1-loop vertex function of the QCD coupling in the presence of an ultra intense magnetic field. From the vertex function, we extract the effective coupling and show that it grows with increasing magnetic field. We consider the quark-gluon vertex and the three-gluon vertex, accounting for the propagators of charged particles within the loops using the lowest Landau level approximation in order to satisfy the condition where the magnetic field is the largest energy scale. Under this approximation, we find that the contribution from the three-gluon vertex vanishes. Therefore, this result arises from the competition between the color charge associated to gluons and to quarks as well, with the former being larger than the latter. The behavior of the QCD coupling as a function of the magnetic field strength is analogous to that exhibited by the light-quark condensate, indicating the magnetic catalysis occurs. This increasing behavior stems from the dominant contribution of color charge associated to gluons in the vertex function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel subtraction method to remove the soft and collinear divergences at next-to-leading order for processes involving an arbitrary number of fragmentation functions, where this method acts directly in the hadronic centre-of-mass frame. We provide the analytical formulae of the subtraction terms in the general case where all the final state partons fragment to hadrons and for the two special cases when one of the partons of the final state does not fragment, i.e. it is a photon or involved in a jet.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Models for Ultra-High Granularity Particle Physics Detector Simulation: A Voyage From Emulation to Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating ultra-high-granularity detector responses in Particle Physics represents a critical yet computationally demanding task. This thesis aims to overcome this challenge for the Pixel Vertex Detector (PXD) at the Belle II experiment, which features over 7.5M pixel channels-the highest spatial resolution detector simulation dataset ever analysed with generative models. This thesis starts off by a comprehensive and taxonomic review on generative models for simulating detector signatures. Then, it presents the Intra-Event Aware Generative Adversarial Network (IEA-GAN), a new geometry-aware generative model that introduces a relational attentive reasoning and Self-Supervised Learning to approximate an "event" in the detector. This study underscores the importance of intra-event correlation for downstream physics analyses. Building upon this, the work drifts towards a more generic approach and presents YonedaVAE, a Category Theory-inspired generative model that tackles the open problem of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) simulation. YonedaVAE introduces a learnable Yoneda embedding to capture the entirety of an event based on its sensor relationships, formulating a Category theoretical language for intra-event relational reasoning. This is complemented by introducing a Self-Supervised learnable prior for VAEs and an Adaptive Top-q sampling mechanism, enabling the model to sample point clouds with variable intra-category cardinality in a zero-shot manner. Variable Intra-event cardinality has not been approached before and is vital for simulating irregular detector geometries. Trained on an early experiment data, YonedaVAE can reach a reasonable OOD simulation precision of a later experiment with almost double luminosity. This study introduces, for the first time, the results of using deep generative models for ultra-high granularity detector simulation in Particle Physics.</description>

      <title>Higgs radial modes and the UV completion of non-linear sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated non-linear sigma models with cosets G/H represented by $SU(N)\times SU(N)/SU(N)$, $SU(N)/SO(N)$, and $SU(2N)/USp(2N)$. These models exhibit a transition to a strongly coupled regime above a threshold energy scale $\Lambda^*$, where the effective field theory approach breaks down. To address this issue, we introduced the so called Higgs radial modes within the Linear Sigma Model, crucial for restoring perturbative unitarity. Analyzing the $N&gt;2$ case, we first notice that all radial modes coming from the most general irreducible representation of G are necessary for unitarizing scattering amplitudes and ensuring the weakly coupled nature of the theory. The phenomenology behind these extra radial modes recalls the physics of the Higgs in the electroweak sector of the Standard Model. In the case of a model describing electroweak symmetry breaking with a more complex pattern, despite strict constraints from electroweak precision tests, these modes could stabilize the Higgs potential and be a possible solution for the vacuum instability issue.</description>

      <title>Hint of a long-range dark sector fifth force in the current cosmological data?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many previous studies have explored models of dynamically interacting dark energy scenarios instead of a cosmological constant and cold dark matter. This work aims to offer a comprehensive investigation of the Yukawa-type interaction between dark energy and dark matter where dark matter mass is also a function of a dynamical scalar field value. Unlike previous work, instead of taking an approximate solution, we numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation that governs the intricate interplay between these two components of the dark sector along with the corresponding perturbations, using a suitable shooting algorithm to determine precise initial conditions. We have conducted a thorough analysis of this interaction using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, incorporating diverse datasets such as Planck, BAO, Pantheon+, and SH$_0$ES. Our results, for the first time, reveal a discernible detection of the coupling constant, which encapsulates the strength of the dark sector interaction. We find non-zero $\beta$ values of 0.0487, 0.0680, 0.0712, and 0.0822 ($68\%$ Confidence Limit) corresponding to the inclusion of each dataset, respectively. Notably, the addition of SH$_0$ES data led to a significant increase in the prominence of $\beta$, suggesting the potential for new physics in the dark sector. This study serves as a strategic road map for future endeavours with non-linear cosmology, which will contribute to an enhanced understanding and refinement of constraints on the dark sector interaction.</description>

      <title>Conditional variational autoencoder inference of neutron star equation of state from astrophysical observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new inference framework for neutron star astrophysics based on conditional variational autoencoders. Once trained, the generator block of the model reconstructs the neutron star equation of state from a given set of mass-radius observations. While the pressure of dense matter is the focus of the present study, the proposed model is flexible enough to accommodate the reconstructing of any other quantity related to dense matter equation of state. Our results show robust reconstructing performance of the model, allowing to make instantaneous inference from any given observation set. The present framework contrasts with computationally expensive evaluation of the equation-of-state posterior probability distribution based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>Probing modified Hawking evaporation with gravitational waves from the primordial black hole dominated universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been recently proposed that Hawking evaporation might slow down after a black hole has lost about half of its mass. Such an effect, called "memory burden", is parameterized as a suppression in the mass loss rate by negative powers $n$ of the black hole entropy and could considerably extend the lifetime of a black hole. We study the impact of memory burden on the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario. Modified PBH evaporation leads to a significantly longer PBH dominated stage. Requiring that PBHs evaporate prior enough to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis shrinks the allowed PBH mass range. Indeed, we find that for $n&gt;2.5$ the PBH reheating scenario is not viable. The frequency of the Gravitational Waves (GWs) induced by PBH number density fluctuations is bound to be larger than about a Hz, while the amplitude of the GW spectrum is enhanced due to the longer PBH dominated phase. Interestingly, we show that, in some models, the slope of the induced GW spectrum might be sensitive to the modifications to Hawking evaporation, proving it may be possible to test the "memory burden" effect via induced GWs. Lastly, we argue that our results could also apply to general modifications of Hawking evaporation.</description>

      <title>Probing Primordial Black Holes and Dark Matter Clumps in the Solar System with Gravimeter and GNSS Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and gravimeters on Earth and in space can potentially offer the most accurate direct measurement of local density of near-Earth asteroid-mass Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and Dark Matter (DM) clumps in the solar system by means of gravitational influence. Using semi-analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulation, this paper revisits the analysis of the trajectories of DM clumps in the solar system, including both captured objects and hyperbolic trajectories. A link is thus made between the frequency and distance of Earth overflights for a given mass flux, and a direct measure of dark matter clump density in the solar system. We then model the signature of a close flyby of a DM object on orbital data from GNSS satellites and gravity measurements from gravimeters. We thus obtain a first assessment of the single probe sensitivity. It paves the way for an exhaustive statistical analysis of 28 years of gravimeters and GNSS data to obtain observational constraints on the density of the PBHs and DM clumps within the solar system, for the mass range $[10^8-10^{17}]$ kg. In addition, our methodology offers a possibility of direct detection in cases where DM clumps are endowed with an additional long-range clump-matter fifth-force beyond gravity.</description>

      <title>An On-Shell Derivation of the Soft Effective Action in Abelian Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the soft effective action in $(d+2)$-dimensional abelian gauge theories from the on-shell action obeying Neumann boundary conditions at timelike and null infinity and Dirichlet boundary conditions at spatial infinity. This allows us to identify the on-shell degrees of freedom on the boundary with the soft modes living on the celestial sphere. Following the work of Donnelly and Wall, this suggests that we can interpret soft modes as entanglement edge modes on the celestial sphere and study entanglement properties of soft modes in abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Qu8its for Quantum Simulations of Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the utility of $d=8$ qudits, qu8its, for quantum simulations of the dynamics of 1+1D SU(3) lattice quantum chromodynamics, including a mapping for arbitrary numbers of flavors and lattice size and a re-organization of the Hamiltonian for efficient time-evolution. Recent advances in parallel gate applications, along with the shorter application times of single-qudit operations compared with two-qudit operations, lead to significant projected advantages in quantum simulation fidelities and circuit depths using qu8its rather than qubits. The number of two-qudit entangling gates required for time evolution using qu8its is found to be more than a factor of five fewer than for qubits. We anticipate that the developments presented in this work will enable improved quantum simulations to be performed using emerging quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: Proton beam-dump experiments are a high-intensity source of secondary muons and provide an opportunity to probe muon-specific dark sectors. We adopt a simplified-models framework for an exotic light scalar particle coupling predominantly or exclusively to muons. Equipped with state-of-the-art muon simulations, we compute the sensitivity reach in the parameter space $(m_S, \, g_\mu)$ of the dark mediator, examining in detail the examples of the experiment NA62 in beam-dump mode and the proposed experiment SHiP. We find a significant yield of such exotics in the sub-GeV mass range. Our projections are competitive with those of primary muon-beam experiments and complementary to current constraints, spanning uncharted parameter space and accessing new physics potentially responsible for the $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective field theory (EFT) framework is a precise approximation procedure when the inherent assumptions of a large-scale separation between the Standard Model (SM) and new interactions alongside perturbativity are realised. Constraints from available data might not automatically guarantee these circumstances when contrasted with UV scenarios that the EFT analysis wishes to inform. From an EFT perspective, achieving sufficient precision in navigating the alignment or decoupling limits beyond the SM scenarios can necessitate moving beyond the SM's leading, dimension six EFT deformation. Using the example of Higgs boson mixing, we demonstrated the importance of higher-dimensional terms in the EFT expansion. We analyse the relevance of virtual EFT corrections and dimension eight contributions for well-determined electroweak precision observables. We find that when moving away from the decoupling limit, the relevance of additional terms in the EFT expansion quickly becomes relevant. This demonstrates the necessity to move beyond dimension six interactions for any scenario that contains Higgs boson mixing.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter self-scattering is one of key ingredients for small-scale structure of the Universe, while dark matter annihilation is important for the indirect measurements. There is a strong correlation between the velocity-dependent self-scattering cross section and the Sommerfeld enhancement factor for the dark matter annihilation cross section. In this study, we formulate a direct relation between them by the use of Watson's (initial state/final state) theorem and Omn\`es solution, and our formulation reproduces the Sommerfeld enhancement factor, which directly computed by solving the Schr\"odinger equation, from the scattering phase shift.</description>

Abstract: Recent experimental studies have led to the suggestion that short-range correlations may be a major contributor to the nuclear EMC effect. This hypothesis requires that the structure function for nucleons involved in short-range correlations should be heavily suppressed compared to that of a free nucleon. Based on calculations performed within an AdS/QCD motivated, light-front quark-diquark model, we find that this large suppression of the nucleon structure function leads to a strong suppression of the nucleon elastic form factors.</description>

Abstract: Young neutron stars cool via the emission of neutrinos from their core. A precise understanding of all the different processes producing neutrinos in the hot and degenerate matter is essential for assessing the cooling rate of such stars. The main Standard Model processes contributing to this effect are $\nu$ bremsstrahlung, mURCA among others. In this paper, we investigate another Standard Model process initiated by the Wess-Zumino-Witten term, leading to the emission of neutrino pairs via $N\gamma\to N\nu\bar\nu$. We find that for proto-neutron stars, such processes, with degenerate neutrons, can be comparable and even dominate over the prototypical and well-known cooling mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: The currently accepted mathematical description of the fundamental constituents and interactions of matter is the Standard Model of particle physics. Its last missing particle, the famous Higgs boson, was observed at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in 2012. However, it is clear that the Standard Model cannot be the ultimate theory of Nature, and e.g. cannot account for Dark Matter or non-vanishing neutrino masses (and does not include gravity). In fact, searches for physics beyond the SM have been intensified since the Higgs boson discovery. In this article, we review the hints for new physics, called ``anomalies'', obtained in particle physics experiments within the last years. We consider both direct high-energy searches for new resonances at the LHC and indirect low-energy precision experiments. These anomalies range from the nuclear scale (approximately the mass of the proton) to the electroweak scale (i.e. the mass of the Higgs boson) to the TeV scale (the highest scale directly accessible at the LHC), therefore spanning over four orders of magnitude. After discussing the experimental and theoretical status of the anomalies, we summarize possible explanations in terms of new particles and new interactions. In particular, new Higgs bosons and leptoquarks are promising candidates. Discovery prospects and implications for future colliders are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08526v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We outline a new production mechanism for dark matter that we dub "recycling": dark sector particles are kinematically trapped in the false vacuum during a dark phase transition; the false pockets collapse into primordial black holes (PBHs), which ultimately evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) to reproduce the dark sector particles. The requirement that all PBHs evaporate prior to BBN necessitates high scale phase transitions and hence high scale masses for the dark sector particles in the true vacuum. Our mechanism is therefore particularly suited for the production of ultra heavy dark matter (UHDM) with masses above $\sim 10^{12}\,{\rm GeV}$. The correct relic density of UHDM is obtained because of the exponential suppression of the false pocket number density. Recycled UHDM has several novel features: the dark sector today consists of multiple decoupled species that were once in thermal equilibrium and the PBH formation stage has extended mass functions whose shape can be controlled by IR operators coupling the dark and visible sectors.</description>

      <title>Systematic Evaluation of Generative Machine Learning Capability to Simulate Distributions of Observables at the Large Hadron Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations are a crucial component when analysing the Standard Model and New physics processes at the Large Hadron Collider. This paper aims to explore the performance of generative models for complementing the statistics of classical Monte Carlo simulations in the final stage of data analysis by generating additional synthetic data that follows the same kinematic distributions for a limited set of analysis-specific observables to a high precision. Several normalizing flow architectures are adapted for this task and their performance is systematically evaluated using a well-known benchmark sample containing the Higgs boson production beyond the Standard Model and the corresponding irreducible background. The applicability of normalizing flows under different model parameters and a restricted number of initial events used in training is investigated. The best performing model is then chosen for further evaluation with a set of statistical procedures and a simplified physics analysis. We demonstrate that the the number of events used in training coupled with the flow architecture are crucial for the physics performance of the generative models. By implementing and performing a series of statistical tests and evaluations we show that a machine-learning-based generative procedure can can be used to generate synthetic data that matches the original samples closely enough and that it can therefore be incorporated in the final stage of a physics analysis with some given systematic uncertainty.</description>

Abstract: We present next-to-leading order perturbative QCD predictions for four-jet-like event-shape observables in hadronic Higgs decays. To this end, we take into account two Higgs-decay categories: involving either the Yukawa-induced decay to a $b\bar{b}$ pair or the loop-induced decay to two gluons via an effective Higgs-gluon-gluon coupling. We present results for distributions related to the event-shape variables thrust minor, light-hemisphere mass, narrow jet broadening, $D$-parameter, and Durham four-to-three-jet transition variable. For each of these observables we study the impact of higher-order corrections and compare their size and shape in the two Higgs-decay categories. We find large NLO corrections with a visible shape difference between the two decay modes, leading to a significant shift of the peak in distributions related to the $H\to gg$ decay mode.</description>

Abstract: The methods of QCD sum rules and light-cone sum rules within the framework of heavy quark effective theory have been widely applied to study the singly heavy baryons, and especially, we have applied these methods to predict not only the mass and width of the $\Xi_b(6087)^0$ recently discovered by LHCb, but also its observation channel and its mass difference from the $\Xi_b(6100)^-$. We apply the same approach to perform a complete study on the $P$-wave bottom baryons of the $SU(3)$ flavor $\mathbf{\bar 3}_F$ and investigate their fine structure. Besides the $\Lambda_b(5912)^0$, $\Lambda_b(5920)^0$, $\Xi_b(6087)^0$, and $\Xi_b(6100)^-$, our results suggest the existence of the other two $\Lambda_b$ and two $\Xi_b$ baryons, whose widths are limited. They are the $\Lambda_b(J^P = 3/2^-)$ with the mass and width about $(5.93^{+0.13}_{-0.13}~{\rm GeV},\,0.0^{+12.0}_{-~0.0}~{\rm MeV})$, the $\Lambda_b(5/2^-)$ with $(5.94^{+0.13}_{-0.13}~{\rm GeV},\,\approx0~{\rm MeV})$, the $\Xi_b(3/2^-)$ with $(6.10^{+0.15}_{-0.10}~{\rm GeV},\,1.4{^{+11.6}_{-~1.4}}~{\rm MeV})$, and the $\Xi_b(5/2^-)$ with $(6.11^{+0.15}_{-0.10}~{\rm GeV},\,1.0{^{+7.4}_{-1.0}}~{\rm MeV})$. Their mass splittings are calculated to be $M_{\Lambda_b(5/2^-)} - M_{\Lambda_b(3/2^-)} = 17\pm7~{\rm MeV}$ and $M_{\Xi_b(5/2^-)} - M_{\Xi_b(3/2^-)} = 14\pm7~{\rm MeV}$. All these baryons are explained as the $P$-wave bottom baryons of the $\rho$-mode, where the orbital excitation is between the two light quarks. However, the existence of this mode is still controversial, so their experimental searches can verify both our approach and the existence of the $\rho$-mode, which can significantly improve our understanding on the internal structure of hadrons.</description>

      <title>On the dependence of the Landau gauge ghost-gluon-vertex on the number of flavors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gauge-boson, ghost and fermion propagators as well as the gauge-boson--ghost vertex function are studied for SU(N), Sp(2N) and SO(N) gauge groups. We solve a set of coupled Dyson-Schwinger equations in Landau gauge for a variable, fractional number $N_f$ of massless fermions in the fundamental representation. For large $N_f$ we find a phase transition from a chirally broken into a chirally symmetric phase that is consistent with the behavior expected inside the conformal window. Even in the presence of fermions the gauge-boson--ghost-vertex dressing remains small. In the conformal window this vertex shows the expected power law behavior. It does not assume its tree-level value in the far infrared, but the respective dressing function is a constant greater than one.</description>

      <title>Rare and exclusive few-body decays of the Higgs, Z, W bosons, and the top quark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform an extensive survey of rare and exclusive few-body decays -- defined as those with branching fractions $\mathcal{B} \lesssim 10^{-5}$ and two or three final particles -- of the Higgs, Z, W bosons, and the top quark. Such rare decays can probe physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), constitute a background for exotic decays into new BSM particles, and provide precise information on quantum chromodynamics factorization with small nonperturbative corrections. We tabulate the theoretical $\mathcal{B}$ values for almost 200 rare decay channels of the four heaviest elementary particles, indicating the current experimental limits in their observation. Among those, we have computed for the first time ultrarare Higgs boson decays into photons and/or neutrinos, H and Z radiative decays into leptonium states, radiative H and Z quark-flavour-changing decays, and semiexclusive top-quark decays into a quark plus a meson, while updating predictions for a few other rare H, Z, and top quark partial widths. The feasibility of measuring each of these unobserved decays is estimated for p-p collisions at the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), and for $e^+e^-$ and p-p collisions at the future circular collider (FCC).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the analytic and compact two-loop helicity amplitudes for QCD and QED corrections to the light-by-light scattering process with massive internal fermions. We express the master integrals either in terms of multiple polylogarithms or in terms of iterated integrals with dlog one-forms. We also elaborate on optimizing the analytic results for each phase-space region. This makes the numerical evaluation of the scattering amplitudes fast, stable and suitable for phenomenological applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a long-overlooked CP violation observable, termed double-mixing CP violation, which arises from the interference between two neutral meson oscillating paths involved in a decay chain. The double-mixing CP violation is beneficial for the precise test of the Standard Model CKM mechanism, as it offers the potential to extract weak phases without pollution from strong dynamics. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the double-mixing CP violation, we perform phenomenological analyses on the cascade decays of the $B^0_d$ and $B^0_s$ mesons. Our results show that the double-mixing CP violation can be very significant in certain decay channels, such as $B^0_s \to \rho^0 K \to \rho^0(\pi^-\ell^+\nu_\ell)$. In addition, we employ the decay process $B^0_d \to D^0 K \to (K^-\pi^+)(\pi\ell\nu)$ to demonstrate that the involved strong and weak phases can be directly determined from the experimental data without any theoretical inputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent Altas and CMS experiments on the invariant mass spectrum of $J/\psi J/\psi$, we systematically study the $c\bar{c}c\bar{c}$ system of $J^{P}=0^{+}$. In the framework of chiral quark model, we have carried out bound-state calculation and resonance-state calculation respectively by using Real-scaling method. The results of bound-state calculation show that there are no bound states in the $c\bar{c}c\bar{c}$ with $0^{+}$ system. The resonance-state calculation shows that there are four possible stable resonances: $R(6920)$, $R(7000)$, $R(7080)$ and $R(7160)$. $R(6920)$ and $R(7160)$ are experimental candidates for $X(6900)$ and $X(7200)$, whose main decay channel is $J/\psi J/\psi$. It is important to note that the another major decay channel of $R(7160)$ is $\chi_{c0} \chi_{c0} $, and the $\chi_{c0} \chi_{c0} $ is also the main decay channel of $R(7000)$, $R(7080)$. Therefore, we propose to search experimentally for these two predicted resonances in the $\chi_{c0} \chi_{c0}$ invariant mass spectrum.</description>

      <title>Qualitative probe of interacting dark energy with redshift-space distortions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.12582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The imprint of interacting dark energy (IDE) needs to be correctly identified in order to avoid bias in constraints on IDE. This paper investigates the large-scale imprint of IDE in redshift space distortions, using $Euclid$-like photometric prescriptions. A first attempt at incorporating the IDE dynamics in the galaxy (clustering and evolution) biases is made. Without IDE dynamics taken into account in the galaxy biases, as is conventionally done, the results suggest that for a constant dark energy equation of state parameter, an IDE model where the dark energy transfer rate is proportional to the dark energy density exhibits an alternating, positive-negative effect in the redshift space distortions angular power spectrum. However, when the IDE dynamics is incorporated in the galaxy biases, it is found that the apparent positive-negative alternating effect vanishes: implying that neglecting IDE dynamics in the galaxy biases can result in ''artefacts'' that can lead to incorrect identification of the IDE imprint. In general, the results show that multi-tracer analysis will be needed to beat down cosmic variance in order for the redshift space distortions angular power spectrum as a statistic to be a viable diagnostic of IDE. Moreover, it is found that redshift space distortions hold the potential to constrain IDE on large scales, at redshifts $z \,{\leq}\, 1$; with the scenario having IDE dynamics incorporated in the biases showing better potential.</description>

      <title>EDGES of the dark forest: A new absorption window into the composite dark matter and large scale structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to hunt for dark matter using dark forest/absorption features across the whole electromagnetic spectrum from radio to gamma rays, especially in the bands where there is a desert i.e. regions where no strong lines from baryons are expected. Such novel signatures can arise for dark matter models with a composite nature and internal electromagnetic transitions. The photons from a background source can interact with the dark matter resulting in an absorption signal in the source spectrum. In the case of a compact source, such as a quasar, such interactions in the dark matter halos can produce a series of closely spaced absorption lines, which we call the dark forest. We show that the dark forest feature is a sensitive probe of the dark matter self-interactions and the halo mass function, especially at the low mass end. There is a large volume of parameter space where dark forest is more sensitive compared to the best current and proposed direct detection experiments. Moreover, the absorption of CMB photons by dark matter gives rise to a global absorption signal in the CMB spectrum. For dark matter transition energies in the range $2.5\times 10^{-4}$ eV$-$ $5\times 10^{3}$ eV, such absorption features result in spectral distortions of the CMB in the COBE/FIRAS band of 60-600 GHz. If the dark matter transition frequency is $\sim$156 GHz, we show that the absorption of CMB photons by dark matter can provide an explanation for the anomalous absorption feature detected by the EDGES collaboration in 50-100 MHz range.</description>

      <title>Negative Dark Energy Density from High Redshift Pantheon+ Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) framework, the Hubble constant $H_0$ is an integration constant. Thus, consistency of the model demands observational constancy of $H_0$. We demonstrate redshift evolution of best fit $\Lambda$CDM parameters $(H_0, \Omega_{m})$ in Pantheon+ supernove (SNe). Redshift evolution of best fit cosmological parameters is a prerequisite to finding a statistically significant evolution as well as identifying alternative models that are competitive with $\Lambda$CDM in a Bayesian model comparison. To assess statistical significance, we employ three different methods: i) Bayesian model comparison, ii) mock simulations and iii) profile distributions. The first shows a marginal preference for the vanilla $\Lambda$CDM model over an ad hoc model with 3 additional parameters and an unphysical jump in cosmological parameters at $z=1$. From mock simulations, we estimate the statistical significance of redshift evolution of best fit parameters and negative dark energy density ($\Omega_m &gt; 1$) to be in the $1-2 \sigma$ range, depending on the criteria employed. Importantly, in direct comparison to the same analysis with the earlier Pantheon sample we find that statistical significance of redshift evolution of best fit parameters has increased, as expected for a physical effect. Our profile distribution analysis demonstrates a shift in $(H_0, \Omega_m)$ in excess of $95\%$ confidence level for SNe with redshifts $z &gt; 1$ and also shows that a degeneracy in MCMC posteriors is not equivalent to a curve of constant $\chi^2$. Our findings can be interpreted as a statistical fluctuation or unexplored systematics in Pantheon+ or $\Lambda$CDM model breakdown. The first two possibilities are disfavoured by similar trends in independent probes.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes Dark Matter and Secondary Gravitational Waves from Warm Higgs-G Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of dissipative effects during warm inflation leading to the small-scale enhancement of the power spectrum of curvature perturbations. In this paper, we specifically focus on non-canonical warm inflationary scenarios and study a model of warm Higgs-G inflation, in which the Standard Model Higgs boson drives inflation, with a Galileon-like non-linear kinetic term. We show that in the Galileon-dominated regime, the primordial power spectrum is strongly enhanced, leading to the formation of primordial black holes (PBH) with a wide range of the mass spectrum. Interestingly, PBHs in the asteroid mass window $\sim (10^{17}$ -- $10^{23}$) g are generated in this model, which can explain the total abundance of the dark matter in the Universe. In our analysis, we also calculate the secondary gravitational waves (GW) sourced by these small-scale overdense fluctuations and find that the induced GW spectrum can be detected in the future GW detectors, such as LISA, BBO, DECIGO, etc. Our scenario thus provides a novel way of generating PBHs as dark matter and a detectable stochastic GW background from warm inflation. We also show that our scenario is consistent with the swampland and the trans-Planckian censorship conjectures and, thus, remains in the viable landscape of UV complete theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive perturbative study of the operator spectrum in multi-scalar theories with hypercubic global symmetry. This includes working out symmetry representations and their corresponding tensor structures. These structures are then used to compute the anomalous dimensions of scalar operators with up to four fields and arbitrary representations to six-loop order. Moreover, we determine one-loop anomalous dimensions for a large number of low-lying operators in the spectrum which include more powers of the fundamental field and/or insertions of derivatives. As an aside we show how projectors used in the conformal bootstrap can be conveniently reused in computations of anomalous dimensions. The results of our study are of use to the conformal bootstrap. They also illuminate features of conformal perturbation theory and the large $n$ expansion. Our results may be of interest for various crossover phenomena in statistical field theory. In total, we compute the scaling dimension of more than 300 operators, of which 16 are computed to six-loops. Our analysis is exhaustive with respect to group theory up to rank 4 for any number of flavours $n$, and also exhaustive with respect to which representations exist for $n \leq 4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the Starobinsky model of inflation. We derive solutions for various cosmological observables, such as the scalar spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and their runnings, as well as the number of $e$-folds of inflation, reheating, and radiation with minimal assumptions. We establish an equation that connects inflation and reheating, which can be solved for the spectral index $n_s$. Using consistency relations of the model, we determine the other observables, the number of $e$-folds during inflation $N_k$, and the number of $e$-folds during reheating $N_{re}$. The impact of reheating on inflation is explored by constraining the equation of state parameter $\omega_{re}$ at the end of reheating. We find remarkable agreement between the Starobinsky model and current measurements of the power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations and the present bounds on the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Quark-hadron pasta phase in neutron stars: the role of medium-dependent surface and curvature tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the hadron-quark mixed phase, often termed the \textit{pasta} phase, expected to exist in the cores of massive neutron stars. To construct the equations of state (EoS), we combine an analytical representation based on the APR EoS for hadronic matter with the MIT bag model featuring vector interactions for quark matter. For modeling the mixed phase, we utilize the compressible liquid drop model that consistently accounts for finite-size and Coulomb effects. Unlike most previous analyses that treated surface tension as a constant free parameter and neglected curvature tension, we employ microphysical calculations using the multiple reflection expansion formalism to determine these parameters, while also ensuring their self-consistency with the EoS. We construct an extensive set of mixed hybrid EoSs by varying model parameters, solve the stellar structure equations to obtain neutron star mass-radius relationships, and select the models that satisfy current astrophysical constraints. Our findings closely align with calculations using a constant surface tension in terms of EoS stiffness and resulting stellar structure. However, they reveal significant differences in the types of geometric structures and their prevalence ranges within the mixed phase. Specifically, curvature effects enhance the emergence of tubes and bubbles at high densities despite the large value of surface tension, while suppressing the existence of drops and rods at low densities.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of the performance of Equivariant Quantum Neural Networks (EQNN) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), juxtaposed against their classical counterparts: Equivariant Neural Networks (ENN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). We evaluate the performance of each network with two toy examples for a binary classification task, focusing on model complexity (measured by the number of parameters) and the size of the training data set. Our results show that the $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ EQNN and the QNN provide superior performance for smaller parameter sets and modest training data samples.</description>
