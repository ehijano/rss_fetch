      <title>Quantum Rods and Clock in a Gravitational Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local operators are the basic observables in quantum field theory which encode the physics observed by a local experimentalist. However, when gravity is dynamical, diffeomorphism symmetries are gauged which apparently obstructs a sensible definition of local operators, as different locations in spacetime are connected by these gauged symmetries. This consideration brings in the puzzle of reconciling our empirical world with quantum gravity. Intuitively, this puzzle can be avoided using relatively defined observables when there exists a natural reference system such as a distribution of galaxies in our universe. Nevertheless, this intuition is classical as the rods and clock defined in this way may also have quantum fluctuations so it is not a priori clear if it can be realized in the quantum regime. In this letter, we provide an affirmative answer to this question. Interestingly, we notice that the quantum fluctuations of the reference system are in fact essential for the realization of the above intuition in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Anti-de Sitter Wormholes as seeds for Higgs Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how certain types of magnetic asymptotically Anti-de Sitter Euclidean wormholes can catalyze the onset of inflation. These wormholes can be embedded as saddle point solutions of General Relativity coupled to the Standard Model, the inflaton being identified with the Higgs particle. Our scenario is based on the assumption that the quantum effective potential for the Higgs turns negative at a certain high energy window, in line with current measured values for the Higgs and Top quark masses. Within our proposal, we can estimate various parameters and physical quantities of interest, in consistency with current observational bounds.</description>

      <title>Finiteness and the Emergence of Dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the finiteness of quantum gravity (QG) amplitudes in fully compactified theories (at least in supersymmetric cases) leads to a bottom-up prediction for the existence of non-trivial dualities. In particular, finiteness requires the moduli space of massless fields to be compactifiable, meaning that its volume must be finite or at least grow no faster than that of Euclidean space. Moreover, we relate the compactifiability of moduli spaces to the condition that the lattice of charged objects transform in a semisimple representation under the action of the duality group. These ideas are supported by a wide variety of string theory examples.</description>

      <title>Lie, Noether, Kosmann, and Diffeomorphism Anomalies Redux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Noether procedure carries an inherent ambiguity due to the necessary local extension, no longer a symmetry, of the global symmetry. The gauging should fix the ambiguity once and for all, however, and, for translations, the general covariance demands us to use the Lie derivative. We argue that, with this alone and without any further tweaking, the Noether energy-momentum $\hat{\mathbbm{T}}$ must equal the symmetric counterpart, $T$, inevitably and show the equality explicitly for general tensors. For spinors, a subtlety with the Lie derivative itself enters the issue and leads us to the Kosmann lift, often unnoticed by the physics community, from which $T=\hat{\mathbbm{T}}$ again emerges straightforwardly and in a naturally symmetric form. Finally, we address how the same Kosmann lift affects the anomaly computations and show that the diffeomorphism anomaly from the seminal paper {\it must be halved} while the venerable anomaly polynomials themselves stand unaffected. We discuss the ramifications of these findings.</description>

      <title>The Diagonal Approximation for Holographic R\'{e}nyi Entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Dong, Rath and Kudler-Flam proposed a modified cosmic brane prescription for computing the R\'{e}nyi entropy $S_\alpha$ of a holographic system in the presence of multiple extremal surfaces. This prescription was found by assuming a diagonal approximation, where the R\'{e}nyi entropy is computed after first measuring the areas of all extremal surfaces. We derive this diagonal approximation and show that it accurately computes R\'{e}nyi entropies up to $O(\log G)$ corrections. For $\alpha&lt;1$, this allows us to derive the modified cosmic brane prescription, which differs from the original cosmic brane prescription at leading order in $G$. For $\alpha&gt;1$, it leads to the original cosmic brane prescription without needing to assume that replica symmetry is unbroken in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a CP broken deconfined phase in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills theory at $\theta =\pi$ from imaginary $\theta$ simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry in 4D SU($N$) pure Yang-Mills theory at $\theta=\pi$ has recently attracted much attention in the context of the higher-form symmetry and the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition. Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to study the $N=2$ case, which is interesting since it is the case opposite to the large-$N$ limit, where explicit calculations are available. In order to circumvent the severe sign problem due to the $\theta$ term for real $\theta$, we first obtain results at imaginary $\theta$, where the sign problem is absent, and make an analytic continuation to real $\theta$. We use the stout smearing in defining the $\theta$ term in the action to be used in our simulations. Thus we obtain the expectation value of the topological charge and the deconfining temperature at $\theta=\pi$, and provide an evidence that the CP symmetry, which is spontaneously broken at low temperature, gets restored \emph{strictly above} the deconfining temperature. This conclusion is consistent with the anomaly matching condition and yet differs from the prediction in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Mixed 't Hooft Anomalies and the Witten Effect for AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a variety of BPS black holes in string theory, the supersymmetric index has provided a microscopic validation of the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. In the near-BPS limit, a gravitational path integral analysis previously revealed the semiclassical spectrum is modified, having a large extremal degeneracy (consistent with the index) and a mass gap up to a continuum of non-BPS black holes. Presently, we study examples in which these sharp features of the spectrum are altered due to the presence of anomalies in the form of $\vartheta$-angle terms in the action. These may appear generally, but we focus on near-BPS dyonic AdS$_4$ black holes in M-theory, dual to 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs of Class $R$ obtained by twisted compactification of $N$ wrapped M5 branes. Due to the Witten effect, the dyonic black holes receive quantum corrections to their charges, and when $\vartheta = \pi$ one may find a mixed `t Hooft anomaly between the $U(1)_R$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ time reversal symmetries. Using results from $\mathcal{N}=2$ JT supergravity, we find these effects result in a spectrum in which both the gap and index are reduced, and may even vanish. Surprisingly, for $\vartheta \rightarrow \pi$, neither the Bekenstein-Hawking formula nor the index correctly account for the extremal degeneracies.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of near-BPS Kerr-Newman black holes and the ABJM mass gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetric rotating 1/16-BPS black holes in $AdS_4 \times S^7$ are expected to capture the average degeneracy of BPS states in the dual ABJM superconformal theory for given fixed charges. This has been successfully demonstrated for the superconformal index using complexified black hole metrics, but a naive Gibbons-Hawking calculation of the actual degeneracies in the low temperature limit is invalid due to large quantum fluctuations of the near horizon $AdS_2$ metric. We argue that in a particular mixed grand/canonical ensemble, these fluctuations of the near-BPS Kerr-Newman black holes are described by a version of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Schwarzian theory with $SU(1,1|1)$ symmetry. Using this description as well as properties of ABJM, we recover the large $N$ superconformal index and find a characteristic ``mass gap'' of order $N^{-3/2}$ between the 1/16-BPS states and the lightest near BPS state. We further make a prediction for the operator dimension spectrum above the gap in the large $N$, low $T$ limit. Our results are consistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula at large energies, random matrix theory at low energies, and the microscopic index.</description>

      <title>Bound of Casimir Effect by Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kovtun-Son-Starinet bound, we propose that holography impose a lower bound on the Casimir effect. For simplicity, we focus on the Casimir effect between parallel planes for 3d conformal field theories and briefly comment on the generalizations to other boundary shapes and higher dimensions. Remarkably, the ghost-free holographic models impose a universal lower bound of the Casimir effect. We verify the holographic bound by free theories, Ising model, and $O(N)$ model with $N=2,3$ at critical points. Remarkably, the holographic bound is also obeyed by a general class of quantum field theories without conformal symmetries. It is interesting to find a field-theoretical proof or counterexample for the holographic bound of Casimir effect.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormhole for string, but not for particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Lorentzian wormhole geometry characterized by a closed string massless sector with nontrivial $H$-flux and a scalar dilaton. In the string frame, the dilaton exhibits a negative kinetic term, enabling the existence of the wormhole. The geometry consists of three distinct regions. The middle region contains the throat, and its boundaries with the other two regions form non-Riemannian two-spheres, where a fundamental string becomes chiral, akin to a non-relativistic string. While point-particle geodesics are complete within each region and non-traversable across regions, strings perceive the geometry differently, allowing a chiral string to traverse freely.</description>

      <title>Simulating matrix models with tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix models, as quantum mechanical systems without explicit spatial dependence, provide valuable insights into higher-dimensional gauge and gravitational theories, especially within the framework of string theory, where they can describe quantum black holes via the holographic principle. Simulating these models allows for exploration of their kinematic and dynamic properties, particularly in parameter regimes that are analytically intractable. In this study, we examine the potential of tensor network techniques for such simulations. Specifically, we construct ground states as matrix product states and analyse features such as their entanglement structure.</description>

      <title>Squashed 7-spheres, octonions and the swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entire eigenvalue spectrum of the operators on the squashed $S^7$ that appear in the Freund-Rubin compactification of eleven-dimensional supergravity was recently derived in [1 - 4]. Here we give a brief account of this work which started with [1] where the complete spectrum of irreducible isometry representations of the fields in $AdS_4$ was derived for the squashed $S^7$ compactification. The operator spectra determine the mass spectrum of the fields in $AdS_4$ and are important for the corresponding $\mathcal{N} =1$ supermultiplet structure which appears in two versions depending on the choice of boundary conditions. By an orientation-flip on the squashed $S^7$ we can also determine the spectrum of the corresponding non-supersymmetric theory, and, e.g., its spectrum of marginal operators on the boundary of $AdS_4$ which may have some relevance for the $AdS$ stability conjecture in the swampland program. The role of singletons is discussed and a possible new Higgsing phenomenon turning them into bulk fields is suggested. Details are here given primarily for 2-forms and comments are made on the key role of $G_2$ and octonions for the structure of the operator equations and mode functions on the squashed $S^7$. Some important features of these improved methods were obtained in Joel Karlsson's 2021 MSc thesis [5]. This is an extended version of the author's contribution to the proceedings of the conference ISQS28, Prague, Czech Republic, July 1 - 5, 2024.</description>

      <title>Dynamical edge modes in Maxwell theory from a BRST perspective, with an application to the Casimir energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, dynamical edge modes (DEM) in Maxwell theory have been constructed using a specific local boundary condition on the horizon. We discuss how to enforce this boundary condition on an infinite parallel plate in the QED vacuum by introducing Lagrange multiplier fields into the action. We carefully introduce appropriate boundary ghosts to maintain BRST invariance. Explicit correspondence of this BRST extended theory with the original DEM formulation is discussed, both directly, and through the correspondence between edge modes and Wilson lines attached to the boundary surface. We then use functional methods to calculate the Casimir energy for the first time with DEM boundary conditions imposed on two infinite parallel plates, both in generalized Coulomb and linear covariant gauge. Depending on the gauge, different fields are contributing, but, after correctly implementing the BRST symmetry, we retrieve the exact same Casimir energy as for two perfectly conducting parallel plates.</description>

      <title>Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics of 4D Dyonic AdS Black Holes: Insights from Kaniadakis Statistics and Emergence of Superfluid $\lambda$-Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of $4D$ dyonic AdS black hole in the Kaniadakis statistics framework using the Restricted Phase Space (RPST) formalism. This framework provides a non-extensive extension of classical statistical mechanics, drawing inspiration from relativistic symmetries and presenting a fresh perspective on black hole thermodynamics. Our study analyzes how including Kaniadakis entropy modifies the phase transition of the dyonic black holes. We consider the central charge $C$ and its conjugate chemical potential $\mu$ as the thermodynamic variable along with others except the pressure and volume. Due to the addition of the magnetic charge $\tilde{Q}_m$, the study of the phase transition becomes much richer by obtaining a non-equilibrium phase transition from an unstable small black hole to a stable large black hole along with the Van der Waals phase transition in the $T-S$ processes. In the $F-T$ plot, we get an extra Hawking-Page phase transition. Including the deformation parameter $\kappa$ introduces an unstable (ultra-large BH) branch seen in almost all the plots. Turning off the magnetic charge flips the direction of the phase transition seen during its presence. We observe a novel phenomenon that is the superfluid $\lambda$ phase transition in the mixed $(\tilde{\Phi}_e,\tilde{Q}_m)$ which is due to the additional $\tilde{Q}_m$ inclusion. Also, in the plots varying $\kappa$ match with the plot varying $C$ which underlines some sort of correspondence in its meaning which is not possible to observe in Gibbs-Boltzmann statistics. As the entropy models change the homogeneity is not lost where mass is of the first order and the rest is zeroth order. Finally, the $\mu-C$ processes in quite similar across black hole systems and entropy formulation marking some kind of universality of this process.</description>

      <title>Transcendentality of Type II superstring amplitude at one-loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the four-graviton scattering amplitude in Type II superstring theory at one-loop up to seventh order in the low-energy expansion through the recently developed iterated integral formalism of Modular Graph Functions (MGFs). We propose a new assignment of transcendental weight to the numbers that appear in the amplitude, which leads to a violation of uniform transcendentality. Furthermore, the machinery of the novel method allows us to propose a general form of the amplitude, which suggests that the expansion is expressible in terms of single-valued multiple zeta values and logarithmic derivatives of the Riemann zeta function at positive and negative odd integers.</description>

      <title>On the $1/c$ expansion in $2d$ CFTs with degenerate operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically determine the large central charge asymptotic expansion of the Virasoro conformal blocks entering in four-point functions with external degenerate operators on a sphere in $2d$ CFTs, and study its resurgence properties as a function of the conformal cross-ratio $z$. We focus on the cases of four heavy level-two $(2,1)$ degenerate operators, and two $(2,1)$ heavy degenerate ones plus two arbitrary light operators. The $1/c$ asymptotic series is Borel summable for generic values of $z$, but it jumps when a Stokes line is crossed. Starting from the $1/c$ series of the identity block, we show how a resurgent analysis allows us to completely determine the other Virasoro block and in fact to reconstruct the full correlator. We also show that forbidden singularities, known to exist in correlators with two heavy and two light operators, appear with four heavy operators as well. In both cases, they are turning points emanating Stokes lines, artefacts of the asymptotic expansion, and we show how they are non perturbatively resolved. More general correlators and implications for gravitational theories in $\text{AdS}_{3}$ are briefly discussed. Our results are based on new asymptotic expansions for large parameters $(a,b,c)$ of certain hypergeometric functions $\,_2 F_1(a,b,c;z)$ which can be useful in general.</description>

      <title>Index and localization for type B superconformal mechanics on singular spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type B superconformal quantum mechanical sigma models are of physical interest as they arise in the description of D-brane bound states forming an AdS$_2$ throat. In this work we discuss the applicability of localization methods to compute the superconformal index in these theories, despite the fact that their target spaces are generically singular. Similar in spirit to recent works on type A models, we propose to work on a suitably resolved target space to compute a regularized index. While this regularized index correctly captures the actual index unambiguously in models of physical interest, we do uncover a subtlety in more pathological examples. This occurs in situations where the supercharge is not essentially-selfadjoint, in which case the index becomes ambiguous and depends on the chosen selfadjoint extension. We also discuss the special class of models with K\"ahler target spaces, which can accommodate both type A and type B models, and show that the type B index is a particular limit of the type A index. For Calabi-Yau cones, the type B index coincides with the Hilbert series of the unresolved space.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Lagrangian Formulation for Quantum and Classical Gravity at High Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a systematic Lagrangian approach for quantum gravity in the super-Planckian limit where $s\gg M_{pl}^2\gg t$. The action can be used to calculate to arbitrary accuracy in the quantum and classical expansion parameters $\alpha_Q= \frac{t}{M_{pl}^2}$ and $\alpha_C= \frac{st}{M_{pl}^4}$, respectively, for the scattering of massless particles. The perturbative series contains powers of $\log(s/t)$ which can be resummed using a rapidity renormalization group equation (RRGE) that follows from a factorization theorem which allows us to write the amplitude as a convolution of a soft and collinear jet functions. We prove that the soft function is composed of an infinite tower of operators which do not mix under rapidity renormalization. The running of the leading order (in $G$) operator leads to the graviton Regge trajectory while the next to leading operator running corresponds to the gravitational BFKL equation. For the former, we find agreement with one of the two results previously presented in the literature, while for the ladder our result agrees (up to regulator dependent pieces) with those of Lipatov. We find that the convolutive piece of the gravitational BFKL kernel is the square of that of QCD. The power counting simplifies considerably in the classical limit where we can use our formalism to extract logs at any order in the PM expansion. The leading log at any order in the PM expansion can be calculated without going beyond one loop. The log at $(2N+1)$ order in the Post-Minkowskian expansion follows from calculating the one loop anomalous dimension for the $N+1$th order piece of the soft function and perturbatively solving the RRGE $N-1$ times. The factorization theorem implies that the classical logs which arise alternate between being real and imaginary in nature as $N$ increases.</description>

      <title>Aspects of a novel nonlinear electrodynamics in flat spacetime and in a gravity-coupled scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel nonlinear electrodynamics (NLE) model with two dimensionful parameters is introduced and investigated. Our model obeys the Maxwellian limit and exhibits behaviour similar to the Born-Infeld Lagrangian in the weak field limit. It is shown that the electric field of a point charge in this model has a definite maximum value. Thus, the self-energy of the point charge is finite. The phenomenon of vacuum birefringence is found to occur in the presence of an external uniform electric field. Causality and unitarity conditions for all background electric fields hold, whereas, for magnetic fields, a restricted domain of validity is found. Moreover, a minimal coupling of Einstein's General Relativity (GR) with this NLE results in solutions of regular black holes or naked singularities, depending on whether the source is a nonlinear magnetic monopole or an electric charge, respectively.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topological quantized current in the incommensurate regimes.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. Using a periodically driven XY chain as a model for a driven integrable quantum system, we provide semi-analytic results for the behavior of the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry, $\Delta S$, as a function of the drive frequency. Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the driven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum Mpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate symmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization of both these phenomena. We follow these results by numerical computation of $\Delta S$ for the non-integrable driven Rydberg atom chain and obtain similar emergent-symmetry-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in the prethermal regime for such a system. Finally, we provide an exact analytic computation of the entanglement asymmetry for a periodically driven conformal field theory (CFT) on a strip. Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive amplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating, that are separated by a critical line. Our results show that for $m$ cycles of a periodic drive with time period $T$, $\Delta S \sim \ln mT$ [$\ln (\ln mT)$] in the heating phase [on the critical line] for a generic CFT; in contrast, in the non-heating phase, $\Delta S$ displays small amplitude oscillations around it's initial value as a function of $mT$. We provide a phase diagram for the behavior of $\Delta S$ for such driven CFTs as a function of the drive frequency and amplitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a first-order theory of dissipative fluids in the trace-fixed particle frame, which is similar to Eckart's frame except that the temperature is determined by fixing the trace of the stress-energy tensor. Our theory is hyperbolic and causal provided a single inequality holds. For low wave numbers, the expected damped modes in the shear, acoustic, and heat diffusion channels are recovered. Stability of global equilibria with respect to all wave numbers is also analyzed. The conditions for hyperbolicity, causality and stability are satisfied for a simple gas of hard spheres or disks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive a new first-order theory of dissipative fluids by adopting the trace-fixed particle frame. Whereas in a companion paper we show that this theory is hyperbolic, causal and stable at global equilibrium states, here we prove that the full nonlinear system of equations can be cast into a first-order quasilinear system which is strongly hyperbolic. By rewriting the system in first-order form, auxiliary constraints are introduced. However, we show that these constraints propagate, and thus our theory leads to a well-posed Cauchy problem.</description>

      <title>Extended Poincare Symmetry Dictates Massive Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify an extended Poincare symmetry $ISO(2) \times ISO(3,1)$ for on-shell massive scattering amplitudes, transforming under the $U(2)$ Little group symmetry. Thus the one-particle state involves in both spin and transversality $t$ (related to chirality), and the spin-spinors are extended to the spin-transverality spinors. The massive spin-$s$ spinors with different transversality can be related by the $SO(5,1)$ symmetry, although the $U(2)$ Little group breaks the symmetry explicitly. The three-point massive amplitudes can be fully determined from the $T^\pm$ and $m$ generators, diagrammatically denoted as the mass insertion and chirality flip, which provide correspondence between massless ultraviolet and massive chiral-eigenstate amplitudes. Thus the massless on-shell technique can be utilized to construct higher-point tree- and loop-level massive amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of the unitary transformations in the Bell-CHSH inequality is highlighted, in both Quantum Mechanics and relativistic Quantum Field Theory. In the former case, we discuss, through a few examples, how the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality can be encoded into unitary transformations acting on a given reference set of Bell's observables. In the latter case, the Bell-CHSH inequality for a real massive scalar field in the vacuum state is considered. After introducing suitable bounded Hermitian operators, we show that using unitary transformations can significantly improve our previous numerical algorithm, leading to an increase in the size of the violation.</description>

Abstract: Fundamental laws of physics are symmetric under time reversal ($T$) symmetry, but the $T$ symmetry is strongly broken in the macroscopic world. In this Perspective, I review $T$ symmetry breaking frameworks: \textit{second law of thermodynamics, multiscale energy transfer}, and \textit{open systems}. In driven dissipative nonequilibrium systems, including turbulence, the multiscale energy flux from large scales to small scales helps determine the arrow of time. In addition, open systems are often irreversible due to particle and energy exchanges between the system and the environment. Causality is another important factor that breaks the $T$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Eogenesis via the High-scale Electroweak Symmetry Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel electron-assisted Baryogenesis scenario that does not require explicit B-L violation, which is essential for the traditional Leptogenesis mechanism. This scenario is based on the assumption of high-scale electroweak symmetry restoration, which implies that the electron Yukawa interaction, crucial for the mechanism, does not reach thermal equilibrium before the electroweak sphaleron process is quenched in the early universe. Primordial charge asymmetries for chiral electrons, which can be generated through various mechanisms such as axion inflation, the evaporation of primordial black holes, or the CP-asymmetric decays of a heavy Higgs doublet, serve as the initial condition for the amplification of the baryon asymmetry through transport equations. Right-handed electron asymmetry is almost irrelevant to the baryon asymmetry due to high-scale electroweak symmetry restoration, leading to both a non-zero baryon asymmetry and the electron asymmetry. We dub this mechanism as the Eogenesis.</description>

      <title>DHOST theories as disformal gravity: From black holes to radiative spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript reviews the construction of exact solutions describing both (rotating) black holes and non-linear radiative spacetimes in the context of degenerate higher order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. We start be reviewing the structure of the DHOST theory space, the notion of degeneracy conditions and the stability of these degeneracy classes under disformal field redefinition (DFR). Then we discuss several key notions related to stationary and axi-symmetric black holes, and in particular the no-hair theorems derived in GR and in its scalar-tensor extensions. The rest of the chapters are devoted to the disformal solution generating map use to construct new hairy black holes solutions. A brief review of the rotating black holes solutions found so far in this context and a detailed description of the disformed Kerr black hole, we further comment on on-going efforts to construct rotating black hole solutions mimicking the closest the Kerr geometry. Then, we discuss how DFR affects the algebraic properties of a gravitational field and in particular its Petrov type. This provides a first systematic characterization of this effect, paving the road for constructing new solutions with a fixed Petrov type. Finally, we review more recent works aiming at characterizing the effect of a DFR on non-linear radiative geometries. We derive the general conditions for the generation of disformal tensorial gravitational wave and we study in detail a concrete example in DHOST gravity describing the new radiative effect induced by a time-dependent scalar monopoly in such higher-order theory. While most of the material presented here is a re-organized and augmented version of our published works, we have included new results and also new proposals to construct phenomenologically interesting solutions. This manuscript can be used as a review on the construction of exact solutions in DHOST gravity.</description>

Abstract: Axions have long been considered plausible candidates for dark matter. The axion dark matter emitted from cosmic strings after the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry breaking in the early Universe was extensively simulated. In this work, we study dark matter and gravitational waves through the lattice simulation of the Axion-Higgs string. We gave the dark matter overproduction and the Big Bang nucleosynthesis bounds on the axion decay constant $f_a$ and the axion mass $m_a$ for axion-like particles, and found that the predicted gravitational wave spectra cannot be probed by the dataset of the current pulsar timing array experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Habiro ring of a number field $\mathbb{K}$ and modules over it graded by $K_3(\mathbb{K})$. Elements of these modules are collections of power series at each complex root of unity that arithmetically glue with each other after applying a Frobenius endomorphism, and after dividing at each prime by a collection of series that depends solely on an element of the Bloch group. We prove that the perturbative Chern-Simons invariants of knots and 3-manifolds are elements of these modules and identify these elements with expansions of certain admissible series of Kontsevich-Soibelman at roots of unity, suggesting that some Donaldson-Thomas invariants have arithmetic meaning and that some elements of the Habiro ring of a number field have enumerative meaning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eccentric binary compact mergers are prime targets of current and future gravitational wave observatories. In the small mass ratio expansion, post-adiabatic inspirals have been modeled up to the separatrix, where first-principle modeling currently ends. In this paper, we derive the analytic late time solution to the adiabatic inspiral in terms of self-force coefficients at the separatrix. We identify the role of the Lambert $W_{-1}$ function as a key mathematical ingredient in the approach to the separatrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We highlight a hidden aspect of scale-invariant actions that allow matter to couple with a dilaton field: $\ $the dynamics of the dilaton can be used to induce variations in Planck's quantum of action $\hbar$ and the speed of light $c$. This mechanism for generating variable $\hbar$ and $c$ in $\textit{curved}$ spacetimes offers novel insights into the origin of late-time cosmic acceleration, bypassing the need for dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a given nonlinear system of dynamical equations, the set of all stable perturbations of the system, the versal unfolding, is fully determined by bifurcation theory. This leads to a complete depiction of all possible qualitatively different solutions and their metamorphoses into new topological forms, the versal families being dependent on a suitable number, the codimension, of independent parameters. In this paper, we introduce and elaborate on the idea that gravitational phenomena are bifurcation problems of finite codimension. We deploy gravitational bifurcations for five standard problems in general relativity, namely, the Friedmann models, the Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole, the issue of a focusing state associated with the evolution of congruences of causal geodesics in the context of cosmology and black holes, the crease flow on black hole event horizons, and the Friedmann-Lemaitre equations. We also comment on more general emerging aspects of the application of bifurcation theory to problems involving the gravitational interaction, and the possible relations between gravitational versal unfoldings and those of the Maxwell, Dirac, and Schrodinger equations.</description>

      <title>New interpretation of the original charged BTZ black hole spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In their seminal 1992 paper, Ba\~{n}ados, Teitelboim and Zanelli (BTZ) proposed a simple charged generalization of what is now known as the spinning BTZ black hole, the proposal being that a rotating metric can be supported by a `static vector' potential. While with such an ansatz the Einstein equations are satisfied, and the corresponding energy-momentum tensor is divergence-less, the Maxwell equations do not (due to the special degenerate form of the corresponding field strength) hold. More recently, Deshpande and Lunin have proposed a generalized `Einstein--Maxwell' system which yields analytic rotating black holes in all odd dimensions. In this paper, we show that the original charged BTZ solution can be re-interpreted as a solution of the Deshpande--Lunin theory. Moreover, as we shall explicitly illustrate on an example of regularized conformal electrodynamics, similar construction also works for any non-linear electrodynamics in 3-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Coordinate- and spacetime-independent quantum physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of a particle is ambiguous in quantum field theory. It is generally agreed that particles depend not only on spacetime, but also on coordinates used to parametrise spacetime points. One of us has in contrast proposed a coordinate-frame-independent model of quantum particles within the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The aim of this article is to present a scalar-field-equation solution that is not only a zero-rank tensor under general coordinate transformations, but also common for anti-de-Sitter, de-Sitter, closed and open Einstein static universes. Moreover, it locally reduces to a Minkowski plane-wave solution and is non-perturbative in curvature. The former property makes it suitable for the standard applications of quantum theory in particle physics, while the latter allows then to gain insights into quantum physics in the strong-gravity regime.</description>

      <title>Numerical invariants of normed matrix factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a normed matrix factorization category and a notion of bounding cochains for objects of this category. We classify bounding cochains up to gauge equivalence for spherical objects and use this classification to define numerical invariants. These invariants are expected to correspond under mirror symmetry to the open Gromov-Witten invariants with only boundary constraints of Lagrangian rational cohomology spheres defined by the second author and Tukachinsky.
  For each Delzant polytope, we construct a normed matrix factorization category. For Delzant polytopes satisfying a combinatorial relative spin condition, we construct an object of this category called the Dirac factorization. The Dirac factorization is expected to correspond under mirror symmetry to the Lagrangian submanifold given by the real locus of the toric symplectic manifold associated to the Delzant polytope. In the case of the $n$-simplex for $n$ odd, we show that the Dirac factorization is spherical, mirroring the fact that $\mathbb{R} P^n$ is a rational cohomology sphere. For $n = 1,$ we show the numerical invariants of the Dirac factorization coincide with the open Gromov-Witten invariants of $\mathbb{R} P^1 \subset \mathbb{C} P^1.$ For $n = 3$ in low degrees, computer calculations verify that the numerical invariants of the Dirac factorization coincide with the open Gromov-Witten-Welschinger invariants of $\mathbb{R}P^3 \subset \mathbb{C} P^3.$ Although $\mathbb{R} P^n$ is trivial in the Fukaya category of $\mathbb{C} P^n$ over any field of characteristic zero, the above results can be seen as a manifestation of mirror symmetry over a Novikov ring.</description>

Abstract: String geometry theory is one of the candidates of non-perturbative formulation of string theory. In this paper, we have shown that dimensionally reduced string geometry theories have what we call T-symmetry. In case of the dimensional reduction in space-like directions, the T-symmetry transformation gives the T-dual transformation between the type IIA and IIB perturbative vacua. In case of the dimensional reduction in the direction of string geometry time $\bar{\tau}$, the T-symmetry transformation is independent of the T-dual transformation, and gives a symmetry that cannot be seen in the perturbative string theories.</description>

      <title>Open fermionic string theory in a non commutative target phase-space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an open fermionic string theory in a non-commutative target phase space as well as for the space part and the momentum part. The modified commutation relations in terms of oscillating modes are derived. Modified super-Virasoro algebras are obtained in the Ramond and Neuveu-Schwarz sectors where new anomaly terms appears. The non-commutativity affect the Lorentz covariance and the mass operator is no more diagonal in the usual Fock space. A redefinition of the Fock space is proposed to diagonalize the non-commutativity parameters matrices to obtain a diagonalized mass operator. Some restrictions on the non commutativity parameters are imposed to eliminate the Virasoro algerbra anomaly terms due to the non-commutativity, where at the same time the usual mass spectrum is obtained. The GSO projection is now possible where a space time supersymmetry is obtained. More restrictions on the non-commutativity parameters zero modes are imposed and the Lorentz covariance is restored.</description>

      <title>Embedding formalism for ${\mathcal N}$-extended AdS superspace in four dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supertwistor and bi-supertwistor formulations for ${\mathcal N}$-extended anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspace in four dimensions, ${\rm AdS}^{4|4\mathcal N}$, were derived two years ago in arXiv:2108.03907. In the present paper, we introduce a novel realisation of the ${\mathcal N}$-extended AdS supergroup $\mathsf{OSp}(\mathcal{N}|4;\mathbb{R})$ and apply it to develop a coset construction for ${\rm AdS}^{4|4\mathcal N}$ and the corresponding differential geometry. This realisation naturally leads to an atlas on ${\rm AdS}^{4|4\mathcal N}$ (that is a generalisation of the stereographic projection for a sphere) that consists of two charts with chiral transition functions for ${\mathcal N}&gt;0$. A manifestly $\mathsf{OSp}(\mathcal{N}|4;\mathbb{R})$ invariant model for a superparticle in ${\rm AdS}^{4|4\mathcal N}$ is proposed. Additionally, by employing a conformal superspace approach, we describe the most general conformally flat $\mathcal N$-extended supergeometry. This construction is then specialised to the case of ${\rm AdS}^{4|4\mathcal N}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how flux vacua that differ from each other in flux quanta can be seen as different vacua in a single scalar potential of an enlarged field space, which resolves the separation by thin domain walls. This observation, which is motivated by the AdS Distance Conjecture, allows one to compute distances between different vacua using the usual field space metric. We verify for explicit examples such as scale-seperated IIA flux vacua and the IIB Freund-Rubin vacua that the Distance Conjecture (for scalar fields) is satisfied and that the asymptotic directions in the enlarged field space are indeed hyperbolic. This enlarged field space contains the tachyon fields on the unstable $\tilde{\mathrm{D}}p$-branes of type II string theory, which can induce the brane charges of the stable D-branes. We suggest that requiring continuous interpolations refines the Cobordism Conjecture and postdicts the existence of unstable $\tilde{\mathrm{D}}p$-branes.</description>

Abstract: We study a parametric deformation of the unified genus-1 anharmonic potential and derive a parametric form of perturbative/nonperturbative (P/NP) relation, applicable across all parameter values. We explicitly demonstrate that the perturbative expansion around the perturbative saddle is sufficient to generate all the nonperturbative information in these systems. Our results confirm the known results in the literature, where the cubic and quartic anharmonic potentials are reproduced under extreme parameter values, and go beyond these known results by developing the nonperturbative function of real and complex instantons solely from perturbative data.</description>

      <title>Topological 5d $\mathcal {N} = 2$ Gauge Theory: Novel Floer Homologies, their Dualities, and an $A_\infty$-category of Three-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18302v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic Floer homologies of four, three and two-manifolds from the physics of a certain topologically-twisted 5d ${\cal N}=2$ gauge theory via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with Vafa-Witten, Hitchin, and $G_{\mathbb{C}}$-BF configurations on the four, three, and two-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define novel symplectic Floer homologies of Hitchin spaces, which in turn will allow us to derive novel Atiyah-Floer correspondences that relate our gauge-theoretic Floer homologies to symplectic intersection Floer homologies of Higgs bundles. Furthermore, topological invariance and 5d "S-duality" suggest a web of relations and a Langlands duality amongst these novel Floer homologies and their loop/toroidal group generalizations. Last but not least, via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 5d theory, we derive, from the soliton string theory that it defines and the 5d partition function, a Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-category of Hitchin configurations on three-manifolds -- thereby categorifying the aforementioned Floer homology of three-manifolds -- and its novel Atiyah-Floer type correspondence. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Haydys [1], Abouzaid-Manolescu [2], and Bousseau [3], and more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perturbation theory in asymptotically free quantum field theories is asymptotic. The factorially growing perturbative coefficients carry information about non-perturbative corrections, which can be related to renormalons and instantons. Using the Wiener-Hopf technique we determine the full analytic solution for the free energy density in the two dimensional $O(N)$ sigma models. For $N&gt;3$ there are no instantons, and we found that the perturbative series carries all the information about the non-perturbative corrections. However, in the $O(3)$ case, we identify several non-perturbative sectors that are not related to the asymptotics of the perturbative series. The number of sectors depends on the observables: for the ground-state energy density we identify three sectors, which we attribute to instantons. For the free energy density in the running perturbative coupling we found infinitely many sectors.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we realise the charged Nariai black hole on a braneworld from a nucleated bubble in AdS$_5$, known as the dark bubble model. Geometrically, the black hole takes the form of a cylindrical spacetime pulling on the dark bubble. This is realised by a brane embedding in an AdS$_5$ black string background. Identifying the brane with a D3-brane in string theory allows us to determine a relation between the fine structure constant and the string coupling, $\alpha_\text{EM} = \frac{3}{2} g_s$, which was previously obtained for a microscopic black hole. We also speculate on the consequences for the Festina Lente bound and neutrino masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electroweak monopole, when coupled to gravity, turns to the Reissner-Nordstrom type primordial magnetic blackhole whose mass is bounded below, with the lower bound $M_P \sqrt \alpha$. This changes the overall picture of the monopole production mechanism in the early universe drastically and has deep implications in cosmolpgy. In particular, this enhances the possibility that the electroweak monopoles turned to the primordial magnetic blackholes could become the seed of stellar objects and galaxies, and account for the dark matter of the universe. Moreover, this tells that we have a new type of primordial blackhole different from the popular primordial blackhole in cosmology, the electroweak primordial magnetic blackhole based on a totally different production mechanism. We discuss the physical implications of the electroweak primordial magnetic blackhole.</description>

      <title>Weak $G_2$-manifolds and scale separation in M-theory from type IIA backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work provides evidence for the existence of supersymmetric and scale-separated AdS$_4$ vacua in M-theory of the Freund-Rubin type. The internal space has weak $G_2$-holonomy, which is obtained from the lift of AdS vacua in massless type IIA on a specific SU(3)-structure with O6-planes. Such lifts require a local treatment of the O6-planes, therefore going beyond the usual smeared approximation. The setup is analysed by solving the pure spinor equations and the Bianchi identities perturbatively in a small backreaction parameter, preserving supersymmetry manifestly and therefore extending on previous work. This approach is applicable to lifts of other type IIA vacua on half-flat SU(3)-structures, including those with D6-brane sources. The resulting 7d manifold presented here exhibits singularities originating from the O6-planes loci in type IIA theory. Additionally, scale separation in M-theory arises from a decoupling between the Ricci curvature and the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian of the proposed 7d manifold, thereby challenging certain conjectures in the swampland program.</description>

      <title>Noninvertible Symmetry-Resolved Affleck-Ludwig-Cardy Formula and Entanglement Entropy from the Boundary Tube Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a refined version of the Affleck-Ludwig-Cardy formula for a 1+1d conformal field theory, which controls the asymptotic density of high energy states on an interval transforming under a given representation of a noninvertible global symmetry. We use this to determine the universal leading and sub-leading contributions to the noninvertible symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy of a single interval. As a concrete example, we show that the ground state entanglement Hamiltonian for a single interval in the critical double Ising model enjoys a Kac-Paljutkin $H_8$ Hopf algebra symmetry when the boundary conditions at the entanglement cuts are chosen to preserve the product of two Kramers-Wannier symmetries, and we present the corresponding symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies. Our analysis utilizes recent developments in symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs).</description>

      <title>Topological 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ Gauge Theory: Novel Floer Homologies, and $A_\infty$-categories of Six, Five, and Four-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is a continuation of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic (holomorphic) Floer homologies of seven, six, and five-manifolds, from the physics of a topologically-twisted 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theory on a Spin$(7)$-manifold via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with $G_2$ instanton, Donaldson-Thomas, and Haydys-Witten configurations on the seven, six, and five-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define hyperk\"ahler Floer homologies specified by hypercontact three-manifolds, and symplectic Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. In turn, this will allow us to derive Atiyah-Floer type dualities between the various gauge-theoretic Floer homologies and symplectic intersection Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 8d theory, one can derive novel Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories that categorify Donaldson-Thomas, Haydys-Witten, and Vafa-Witten configurations on six, five, and four-manifolds, respectively -- thereby categorifying the aforementioned Floer homologies of six and five-manifolds, and the Floer homology of four-manifolds from [arXiv:2311.18302] -- where an Atiyah-Floer type correspondence for the Donaldson-Thomas case can be established. Last but not least, topological invariance of the theory suggests a relation amongst these Floer homologies and Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories for certain Spin$(7)$-manifolds. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the conjectures by Donaldson-Thomas [2], Donaldson-Segal [3], Cherkis [4], Hohloch-Noetzel-Salamon [5], Salamon [6], Haydys [7], and Bousseau [8], and more.</description>

      <title>On-shell approach to scalar hair in spinning binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an on-shell description of spinning binary systems in gravitational theories where compact objects display scalar hair. The framework involves matter particles of arbitrary spin which, in addition to the minimal coupling to gravitons, are conformally coupled to a massless scalar mediating non-standard interactions. We use the unitary factorization techniques to derive the on-shell amplitudes relevant for emission of scalars and gravitons in matter scattering, paying attention to parametrize the freedom due to contact terms. Using the KMOC formalism, these amplitudes allow one to derive succinct expressions for the radiation waveforms at the leading post-Minkowskian order, together with the associated memory effects. Furthermore, we compute the power emitted via gravitational and scalar radiation in hyperbolic encounters of compact objects. After a continuation to bound orbits, these are compared with results obtained in specific scalar-tensor theories where black holes exhibit scalar hair, such as the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet or dynamical Chern-Simons theories. Finally, we identify possible deformations from the conformal coupling that can contribute to radiation observables at the same post-Newtonian order.</description>

      <title>A Nonlocal Schwinger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve a system of massless fermions constrained to two space-time dimensions interacting via a $d$ space-time dimensional Maxwell field. Through dimensional reduction to the defect and bosonization, the system maps to a massless scalar interacting with a nonlocal Maxwell field through a $F \phi$-coupling. The $d=2$ dimensional case is the usual Schwinger model where the photon gets a mass. More generally, in $2&lt;d&lt;4$ dimensions, the degrees of freedom map to a scalar which undergoes a renormalization group flow; in the ultraviolet, the scalar is free, while in the infrared it has scaling dimension $(4-d)/2$.
  The infrared is similar to the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, and the physically relevant case $d=4$ becomes infrared trivial in the limit of infinite ultraviolet cut-off, consistent with earlier work on the triviality of conformal surface defects in Maxwell theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of three parameter static and axially symmetric metrics that reduce to the Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) and $ \gamma$-metrics in certain limits of the parameters. We obtain rotating form of the metrics that are asymptotically flat, stationary and axisymmetric. In certain values of the parameters, the solutions represent the rotating JNW metric, rotating $ \gamma$-metric and Bogush-Gal'tsov (BG) metric. The singularities of rotating metrics are investigated. Using the light-ring method, we obtain the quasi normal modes (QNMs) related to rotating metrics in the eikonal limit. Finally, we investigate the precession frequency of a test gyroscope in the presence of the rotating metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Immersion (i.e., local embedding) is relevant to the physics of topologically ordered phases through entanglement bootstrap. An annulus can immerse in a disk or a sphere as a "figure-8", which cannot be smoothly deformed to an embedded annulus. We investigate a simple problem: is there an Abelian state on the immersed figure-8 annulus, locally indistinguishable from the ground state of the background physical system? We show that if the answer is affirmative, a strong sense of isomorphism must hold: two homeomorphic immersed regions must have isomorphic information convex sets, even if they cannot smoothly deform to each other on the background physical system. We explain why to care about strong isomorphism in physical systems with anyons and give proof in the context of Abelian anyon theory. We further discuss a connection between immersed annuli and anyon transportation in the presence of topological defects. In appendices, we discuss related problems in broader contexts.</description>

      <title>A scaling limit of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice Yang-Mills-Higgs theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The construction of non-Abelian Euclidean Yang-Mills theories in dimension four, as scaling limits of lattice Yang-Mills theories or otherwise, is a central open question of mathematical physics. This paper takes the following small step towards this goal. In any dimension $d\ge 2$, we construct a scaling limit of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice Yang-Mills theory coupled to a Higgs field transforming in the fundamental representation of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. After unitary gauge fixing and taking the lattice spacing $\varepsilon\to 0$, and simultaneously taking the gauge coupling constant $g\to 0$ and the Higgs length $\alpha\to \infty$ in such a manner that $\alpha g$ is always equal to $c\varepsilon$ for some fixed $c$ and $g= O(\varepsilon^{50d})$, a stereographic projection of the gauge field is shown to converge to a scale-invariant massive Gaussian field. This gives the first construction of a scaling limit of a non-Abelian lattice Yang-Mills theory in a dimension higher than two, as well as the first rigorous proof of mass generation by the Higgs mechanism in such a theory. Analogous results are proved for $\mathrm{U}(1)$ theory as well. The question of constructing a non-Gaussian scaling limit remains open.</description>

      <title>Rewording Theoretical Predictions at Colliders with Vacuum Amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose multiloop vacuum amplitudes as the optimal building blocks for efficiently assembling theoretical predictions at high-energy colliders. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the manifestly causal properties of the loop-tree duality (LTD) representation of a vacuum amplitude. The vacuum amplitude, acting as a kernel, encodes all the final states contributing to a given scattering or decay process through residues in the on-shell energies of the internal propagators. It also naturally implements gauge invariance and the wave function renormalisation of the external legs. This methodological approach, dubbed LTD causal unitary, leads to a novel representation of differential cross sections and decay rates that is locally free of ultraviolet and infrared singularities at all orders in perturbation theory. Threshold singularities also match between different phase-space residues. Most notably, it allows us to conjecture for the first time the local functional form of initial-state collinear singularities. The fulfillment of all these properties provides a theoretical description of differential observables at colliders that is well defined in the four physical dimensions of the space-time.</description>

Abstract: The existence of a set of $10$ Intrinsic Conformal Symmetries, which acts on three-dimensional hypersurfaces (spacelike or timelike), leads to the existence of two distinct families of 5D geometries. These models represent the general solutions of the bulk field equations where their energy-momentum tensor, includes only two components: a negative cosmological constant and a parallel pressure $p_{\parallel}$ aligned with the extra spatial dimension. Significantly, these models offer a novel perspective for investigating the impacts of spatial inhomogeneity and anisotropy on the cosmological evolution of the Universe, particularly within the context of the braneworld scenarios. It is shown that one of these families reduces to a \emph{fully inhomogeneous, anisotropic and conformally flat brane model} with a \emph{perfect fluid equation of state} and corresponds to the Stephani Universe (i.e. a Stephani brane) which implies that our model can be matched smoothly with the standard FRW model. We provide the generalized Friedmann and Raychaudhuri equations and we present how the additional quantities could affect the cosmological evolution. In particular we show that the new constituents are the terms $p_{\parallel }$, $\sigma ^{2}$ and the four acceleration of the brane observers that could affect the observational measurement of the Hubble parameter depending on which term dominates therefore provide us a potential answer to the Hubble tension and cosmic acceleration problems due to local inhomogeneities and anisotropies.</description>

Abstract: We study the axial gravitational perturbations of slowly-rotating compact objects which are assumed to be supported by anisotropic fluids. We find that the gravitational perturbations decouple from the matter perturbations for axial sectors. We obtain a master wave equation whose potential is fully determined by the metric functions. This equation makes the calculations of gravitational QNMs for rotating compact objects extremely easy in specific background configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study timelike and lightlike geodesics in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity around a black hole with the goal of constraining the Lorentz symmetry-breaking parameter $l$. The analysis involves studying the precession of the S2 star periastron orbiting Sgr A* and geodesic precession around the Earth. The ratio of precession frequencies for General Relativity (GR) and KR gravity is computed, with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) results providing a parameter range for the spontaneous symmetry-breaking of $-0.185022 \leq l \leq 0.060938$. Utilizing the geodesic precession frequency from the Gravity Probe B (GP-B), the $l$ parameter is further constrained to $-6.30714 \times 10^{-12} \leq l \leq 3.90708 \times 10^{-12}$, which is consistent with the Schwarzschild limits. Moreover, for timelike geodesics, the innermost circular orbit (ICO) and innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) are determined and analyzed to illustrate the impact of the symmetry breaking term. Zoom-whirl obstructions are compared with the Schwarzschild solution. Lower and upper limits of the photon sphere for lightlike geodesics are established to demonstrate the influence of KR gravity on the photon sphere. Additionally, the shadow radius is determined for two observers, one situated at a finite distance from the KR black hole, and the other located at an infinite distance, to constrain the symmetry-breaking parameter $l$, with comparisons made to EHT results. The bounds for $l$ derived from constraints on the photon sphere radius for lightlike geodesics yield $-0.0700225 \leq l \leq 0.189785$ using EHT data. The findings of this paper align with experimental results in the $l \rightarrow 0$ limit.</description>

The anomaly inflow mechanism provides an intuitive interpretation of the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological systems. In this work, we study global anomalies in systems with symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e. the manifolds of fermionic Green's function zeros in the momentum space at zero energy, described by nonlocal effective theories. We view the nonlocal effective theories as a result of integrating out some low energy states. Assuming that the states integrated out do not make extra contributions to the anomalies, we discuss the simplest Lagrangian describing a gapless Dirac zero and a two-pole variant, their global anomalies, and the bulk-boundary correspondence. We then consider the constraints on possible phases with Green's function zeros of Dirac type, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. We also provide some perspectives on why the nonlocal fermionic effective theory discussed by Golterman and Shamir (arXiv: 2311.12790) is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.</description>

      <title>Integrability in Perturbed Black Holes: Background Hidden Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the presence of integrable hidden structures in the dynamics of perturbed non-rotating black holes (BHs). This can also be considered as a first step in a wider program of an effective identification of ``slow'' and ``fast'' degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the (binary) BH dynamics, following a wave-mean flow perspective. The slow DoFs would be associated with a nonlinear integrable dynamics, on which the fast ones propagate following an effective linear dynamics. BH perturbation theory offers a natural ground to test these properties. Indeed, the decoupling of Einstein equations into wave master equations with a potential provides an instance of such splitting into (frozen) slow DoFs (background potential) over which the linear dynamics of the fast ones (perturbation master functions) evolve. It has been recently shown that these wave equations possess an infinite number of symmetries that correspond to the flow of the infinite hierarchy of Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations. Starting from these results, we systematically investigate the presence of integrable structures in BH perturbation theory. We first study them in Cauchy slices and then extend the analysis to hyperboloidal foliations. This second step introduces a splitting of the master equation into bulk and boundary contributions, unveiling an underlying structural relation with the slow and fast DoFs. This insight represents a first step to establish the integrable structures associated to the slow DoFs as bulk symmetries of the dynamics of perturbed BHs.</description>

      <title>Twist corrections to exclusive vector meson production in a saturation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework combining the higher-twist formalism of exclusive processes in the $s$ channel with the semi-classical effective description of small-$x$ physics in the $t$ channel. We apply it to transversely polarized light vector meson production, $\gamma^{*} p \rightarrow V (\rho, \varphi ,\omega) \; p$, which starts at the next-to-leading power and for which a purely collinear treatment leads to end-point singularities. The result is obtained in the most general kinematics, including both forward and non-forward cases by preserving the full impact parameter dependence in the non-perturbative correlators, in both momentum and coordinate space representations. A systematic expansion of the Wilson lines in terms of Reggeized gluon fields is performed in order to obtain the results in the weak-field BFKL approximation. These new results will allow for investigating the dilute-to-dense regime transition of QCD for a wide class of observables.</description>

      <title>Probing gluonic saturation in deeply virtual meson production beyond leading power</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exclusive diffractive meson production represents a golden channel for investigating gluonic saturation inside nucleons and nuclei. In this letter, we settle a systematic framework to deal with beyond leading power corrections at small-$x$, including the saturation regime, and obtain the $\gamma^{*} \rightarrow M (\rho, \phi, \omega)$ impact factor with both incoming photon and outgoing meson carrying arbitrary polarizations. This is of particular interest since the saturation scale at modern colliders, although entering a perturbative regime, is not large enough to prevents higher-twist effects to be sizable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cluster structures on spinor helicity and momentum twistor varieties which describe the kinematic spaces of massless scattering (with or without dual conformal symmetry). Both are instances of partial flag varieties. We exhibit embeddings of the corresponding cluster algebras into cluster algebras of sufficiently large Grassmannians and show how the former is obtained from the latter by freezing certain cluster variables and deleting some cluster variables.</description>

      <title>Geometrical deformation of brane matter field within $f(R,Q,P)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of braneworld scenarios, the real scalar field plays a crucial role by providing thickness for brane. In this work, we investigate a codimension-one thick brane within the framework of $f(R,Q,P)$ gravity, where $R$ represents the curvature scalar, while $Q=R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}$ and $P=R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}R^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}$ are quadratic geometric invariants. Our interest is to investigate the influence of these invariants on the scalar field solution and the energy density of the brane. Furthermore, we analyze the localization of spin $1/2$ fermions and the gravitino by employing a Yukawa-like coupling with the scalar field background. Such a coupling is able to produce a normalizable zero-mode for both fields.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Solutions in Non-Minimally Coupled Weyl Connection Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m black hole solutions are found in the context of a non-minimal matter-curvature coupling with the Weyl connection, both in vacuum and in the presence of a cosmological constant-like matter content. This special case of non-metricity leads to black hole solutions with non-vanishing scalar curvature. Moreover, vacuum Schwarzschild solutions differ from the ones from a constant curvature scenario in $f(R)$ theories with the appearance of a coefficient in the term linear in r and a corrected "cosmological constant". Non-vacuum Shwarzschild solutions have formally the same solutions as in the previous case with the exception being the physical interpretation of a cosmological constant as the source of the matter Lagrangian as not a simple reparametrization of the $f(R)$ description. Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m solutions cannot be found in vacuum, but only in the presence of matter fields, such that the solutions also differ from the constant curvature scenario in $f(R)$ theories by the term linear in r and corrected/dressed charge and cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>On the Gravitational Hysteresis in the Kinetic Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General theory of relativity is non--linear in nature and therefore can result in hysteresis-like effects and cause systems to remember the footprint of the gravitational field. Here we have investigated this effect using the Kinetic theory in curved spacetime. It is shown that the entropy rate experiences this hysteresis behavior. The effect is then considered for some special spacetimes, including Schwarzschild black hole, Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker cosmological solution, and the flat Minkowski spacetime perturbed by a gravitational wave pulse. It is shown that there is some hysteresis effect for the entropy rate.</description>

      <title>It\^{o}, Stratonovich, and zoom-in schemes in stochastic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The It\^{o} and Stratonovich approaches are two ways to integrate stochastic differential equations. Detailed knowledge of the origin of the stochastic noise is needed to determine which approach suits a particular problem. I discuss this topic pedagogically in stochastic inflation, where the noise arises from a changing comoving coarse-graining scale or, equivalently, from `zooming in' into inflating space. I introduce a zoom-in scheme where deterministic evolution alternates with instantaneous zoom-in steps. I show that this alternating zoom-in scheme is equivalent to the It\^{o} approach in the Markovian limit, while the Stratonovich approach doesn't have a similar interpretation. In the full non-Markovian setup, the difference vanishes. The framework of zoom-in schemes clarifies the relationship between computations in stochastic inflation, linear perturbation theory, and the classical $\Delta N$ formalism. It informs the numerical implementation of stochastic inflation and is a building block for a first-principles derivation of the stochastic equations.</description>

      <title>A long freeze is hard to achieve in the presence of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Certain holographic dark energy (HDE) models allow for the possibility of a ``long freeze,'' in which the scale factor evolves to a constant in the long-time limit. Here we extend previous calculations by adding a nonrelativistic matter component. The addition of a matter component tends to destroy the long freeze behavior, driving the universe to recollapse. Long freeze evolution is still possible, but only for a limited set of HDE models.</description>

      <title>Regulating chiral gauge theory at $\theta=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that a proposal to nonperturbatively regulate chiral gauge theories on the boundary of a five-dimensional lattice will fail due to the existence of exact $U(1)$ symmetries not present in the target theories. A related observation is that in the presence of gauge fields with nontrivial topology, fermion zeromodes will appear embedded in the extra dimension which do not decouple from the four-dimensional world. Here we show that these problems can be evaded by simulating the theory in the trivial topological sector of the boundary gauge fields. A regulated version of the Standard Model using this approach in the continuum and large volume limits is expected to appear as if it possessed a Peccei-Quinn mechanism for relaxing $\theta_\text{QCD}$ to zero, without there being an axion in the spectrum.</description>
