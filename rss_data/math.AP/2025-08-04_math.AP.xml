      <title>Infinite-order rogue waves that are small (but not small in $L^2$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General rogue waves of infinite order constitute a family of solutions of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation that have recently been identified in a variety of asymptotic limits such as high-order iteration of B\"acklund transformations and semiclassical focusing of pulses with specific amplitude profiles. These solutions have compelling properties such as finite $L^2$-norm contrasted with anomalously slow temporal decay in the absence of coherent structures. In this paper we investigate the asymptotic behavior of general rogue waves of infinite order in a parametric limit in which the solution becomes small uniformly on compact sets while the $L^2$-norm remains fixed. We show that the solution is primarily concentrated on one side of a specific curve in logarithmically rescaled space-time coordinates, and we obtain the leading-order asymptotic behavior of the solution in this region in terms of elliptic functions as well as near the boundary curve in terms of modulated solitons. The asymptotic formula captures the fixed $L^2$-norm even as the solution becomes uniformly small.</description>

      <title>Turbulent and intermittent phenomena in a universal total anomalous dissipator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For all $\alpha \in (0,1)$, we construct an explicit divergence-free vector field $V \in L^\infty([0,1],C^\alpha(\mathbb{T}^2))$ that exhibits universal anomalous (total) dissipation, accelerating dissipation enhancement, Richardson dispersion, anomalous regularization, and spatial intermittency. Additionally, we demonstrate the sharpness of the intermittent Obukhov-Corrsin regime for certain parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>Global solutions to cubic Dirac and Dirac-Klein-Gordon systems on spacetimes close to the Minkowski space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish global existence and derive sharp pointwise decay estimates of solutions to cubic Dirac and Dirac-Klein-Gordon systems on a curved background, close to the Minkowski spacetime. By squaring the Dirac operator, we reduce the analysis to a nonlinear wave-type equation involving spinorial connections, and apply energy estimates based on vector field methods and the hyperboloidal foliation framework, introduced by LeFloch-Ma. A key difficulty arises from the commutator structure of the Dirac operator, which exhibits significantly different behaviour from that of scalar field equations and requires refined control throughout the analysis, particularly due to the spacetime-dependent gamma matrices, which reduce to constant matrices in the flat Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Long-time evolution of forced waves in the low viscosity regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model for internal waves described by a zero order pseudo-differential Hamiltonian $P$ damped by a second order viscosity term $i \nu Q$. Under Morse-Smale or similar weaker global conditions on the classical dynamics, we describe qualitatively the long-time behavior of solutions of the corresponding evolution equation with smooth forcing in a small $\nu$ regime. We show that dissipation effects arise no earlier than at the $t\sim \nu^{-1/3-}$ time scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the nonlocal analogue of the classical free boundary minimal hypersurfaces in an open domain $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ as the (boundaries of) critical points of the fractional perimeter $\operatorname{Per}_s(\cdot,\,\Omega )$ with respect to inner variations leaving $\Omega$ invariant. We deduce the Euler-Lagrange equations and prove a few surprising features, such as the existence of critical points without boundary and a strong volume constraint in $\Omega$ for unbounded hypersurfaces. Moreover, we investigate stickiness properties and regularity across the boundary.</description>

      <title>Interactions between Wind and Water Waves near Circular Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript concerns the dynamical interactions between wind and water waves, which are characterized through two-phase free interface problems for the Euler equations. We provide a comprehensive derivation on the linearized problems of general two-phase flows. Then, we study the instability issues of perturbing waves around circular steady solutions, and we demonstrate a semi-circle result on the possible locations of unstable modes. We also present necessary conditions and sufficient ones for the instability of wind-perturbing water waves near Taylor-Couette flows.</description>

      <title>Existence of minimal maps of degree one in $W^{\frac1p,p}(\mathbb S^1,\mathbb S^1)$ for $p \in [p',2]$, where $p' \approx 1.13924$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show how the results of Mazowiecka--Schikorra, combined with those of Bourgain--Brezis--Mironescu, imply the existence of minimal maps of degree one in $ W^{\frac{1}{p},p}(\mathbb{S}^1,\mathbb{S}^1) $ for $ p \in [p', 2] $, where $ p' \approx 1.13924 $. This provides an affirmative answer in this range to a question posed by Mironescu and Brezis--Mironescu. In order to do so, we complement the results of Mazowiecka--Schikorra by extending them to the case $ n = 1 $ and $ 1 &lt; p &lt; 2 $, which had been excluded there for technical reasons.</description>

      <title>Long Time Existence of A Flow of Elliptic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For elliptic systems defined on Riemann surfaces, Liouville and Toda systems represent two well-known classes exhibiting drastically different solution structures. Over the years, existence results for these systems have highlighted discrepancies due to their unique solution structures. In this work, we aim to construct a monotone entropy form and establish the long-term existence of a flow of parabolic systems. As a result of our main theorem, we can prove existence results for some broad classes of elliptic systems, including both Liouville and Toda systems. The strength of our results is further underscored by the fact that no topological information about the Riemann surfaces is required and no positive lower bound of coefficient functions is postulated.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the periodic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with concentrated nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the solution theory of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a concentrated nonlinearity on the torus. In particular, we establish existence and uniqueness of global energy-conserving solutions for small initial data in $H^1$. Our approach is based on two approximation schemes, namely the concentrated limit of a smoothed nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and the inviscid limit of a concentrated complex Ginzburg--Landau equation. We also prove local well-posedness below the energy space. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous solution theory for a periodic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a concentrated nonlinearity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of Lagrangian variables, we develop a method for deriving explicit solutions to the 2D Boussinesq equations using harmonic mapping theory. By reformulating the characterization of flow solutions described by harmonic functions, we reduce the problem to solving a particular nonlinear differential system in complex space. To solve this nonlinear differential system, we introduce the Schwarzian and pre-Schwarzian derivatives, and derive the properties of the sense-preserving harmonic mappings with equal Schwarzian and pre-Schwarzian derivatives. Our method yields explicit solutions in Lagrangian coordinates that contain two fundamental classes of classical solutions.: Kirchhoff's elliptical vortex (1876) and Gerstner's gravity wave (1809, rediscovered by Rankine in 1863).</description>

      <title>Controllability of diffusive Lotka-Volterra strongly competitive systems under boundary constrained controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the controllability of the competition-diffusion Lotka-Volterra system. Our primary focus is on the one-dimensional setting with Dirichlet boundary controls, interpreted as ecological management policies regulating the density of species at the habitat boundaries and satisfying bilateral constraints. We show that the system can be steered from any initial state to a constant steady state representing the extinction of the less competitive species. In contrast, we prove that controllability toward a steady state where the more competitive species vanishes is generally not achievable when the inter-species competition rates are too unbalanced. This obstruction is due to the existence of barrier solutions, which we explicitly construct based on the spectral properties of the associated reaction-diffusion operators. Our theoretical results are illustrated through numerical simulations and are accompanied by a discussion of open problems and potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Time asymptotics, time regularity and separation rates for Navier-Stokes flows in supercritical solution classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the weak solution theory for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations of Barker, Seregin and Sverak from a critical setting to a supercritical setting making sure to include a useful a priori energy bound as well as a statement about stability under weak-star convergence. Two applications of the a priori bound are then explored. The first provides a spatially local, short-time asymptotic expansion in the time variable starting at $t=0$ which, as a corollary, provides an upper bound on how fast hypothetical non-unique solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations can separate locally. The second establishes higher-order time regularity at a singular time and at spatial points positioned away from the singularity. This quantifies the degree to which the non-local nature of the pressure allows a far flung singularity to disrupt the time regularity at a regular point.</description>

Abstract: Recent article by Carvalho et al. [J. Differential Equations 416 (2025)] presents in a~unified framework the Lyapunov--Perron construction of invariant and inertial manifolds together with the saddle point property. We extend their results on the existence of non-autonomous inertial manifolds by considering the gap condition which is known to be sharp. Moreover, we show that the constructed inertial manifolds have $C^1$ regularity.</description>

      <title>An analytic approach to the stress energy tensor in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a framework for quantum fields in curved spacetimes that possess a stress energy tensor as a connection one form on a suitable moduli space of metrics. In generic spacetimes the existence of such a tensor is thought to be a replacement for the existence of symmetries that the Minkowski theory relies on. It is shown that the local time-slice property and the implementability of local isometries is a consequence of the existence of a stress energy tensor that is a local field. We prove that the Klein-Gordon field, in an irreducible Fock representation in which the ground state is Hadamard, is an example. In this example we show that the scattering matrix for compactly supported metric perturbations exists in the Fock space and is smooth on a dense set with respect to the perturbation parameter. This generalises results by Dimock and Wald.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present paper is a numerical study of the dynamics of solitary wave solutions of the fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, whose existence was analyzed by the authors in the first part of the project. The computational study will be made from the approximation of the periodic initial-value problem with a fully discrete scheme consisting of a Fourier spectral method for the spatial discretization and a fourth-order, Runge-Kutta-Composition method as time integrator. Several issues regarding the stability of the waves, such as the effects of small and large perturbations, interactions of solitary waves and the resolution of initial data into trains of waves are discussed.</description>

      <title>On the controllability of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation on multi-dimensional cylindrical domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate null controllability of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation on a cylindrical domain $\Omega=\Omega_x\times \Omega_y$ in $\mathbb R^N$, where $\Omega_x=(0,a),$ $a&gt;0$ and $\Omega_y$ is a smooth domain in $\mathbb R^{N-1}$. We first study the controllability of this system by a control acting on $\{0\}\times \omega$, $\omega\subset \Omega_y$, through the boundary term associated with the Laplacian component. The null controllability of the linearized system is proved using a combination of two techniques: the method of moments and Lebeau-Robbiano strategy. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the null controllability of this system along with an explicit control cost estimate. Furthermore, we show that there exists minimal time $T_0(x_0)&gt;0$ such that the system is null controllable for all time $T &gt; T_0(x_0)$ by means of an interior control exerted on $\gamma = \{x_0\} \times \omega \subset \Omega$, where $x_0/a\in (0,1)\setminus \mathbb{Q}$ and it is not controllable if $T&lt;T_0(x_0).$
  If we assume $x_0/a$ is an algebraic real number of order $d &gt; 1$, then we prove the controllability for any time $T&gt;0.$
  Finally, for the case of $N=2 \text{ or } 3$, we show the local null controllability of the main nonlinear system by employing the source term method followed by the Banach fixed point theorem.</description>

      <title>Liouville type theorems for dual nonlocal evolution equations involving Marchaud derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a Liouville type theorem for the homogeneous dual fractional parabolic equation \begin{equation}
  \partial^\alpha_t u(x,t)+(-\Delta)^s u(x,t) = 0\ \ \mbox{in}\ \ \mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R} . \end{equation} where $0&lt;\alpha,s&lt;1$. Under an asymptotic assumption $$\liminf_{|x|\rightarrow\infty}\frac{u(x,t)}{|x|^\gamma}\geq 0 \; ( \mbox{or} \; \leq 0) \,\,\mbox{for some} \;0\leq\gamma\leq 1, $$ in the case $\frac{1}{2}&lt;s &lt; 1$, we prove that all solutions in the sense of distributions of above equation must be constant by employing a method of Fourier analysis. Our result includes the previous Liouville theorems on harmonic functions \cite{ABR} and on $s$-harmonic functions \cite{CDL} as special cases and it is still novel even restricted to one-sided Marchaud fractional equations, and our methods can be applied to a variety of dual nonlocal parabolic problems.
  In the process of deriving our main result, through very delicate calculations, we obtain an optimal estimate on the decay rate of $\left[D_{\rm right}^\alpha+(-\Delta)^s\right] \varphi(x,t)$ for functions in Schwartz space. This sharp estimate plays a crucial role in defining the solution in the sense of distributions and will become a useful tool in the analysis of this family of equations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of solutions to elliptic equations in 2D exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymptotic behavior of solutions to the second order elliptic equations in exterior domains is studied. In particular, under the assumption that the solution belongs to the Lorentz space $L^{p,q}$ or the weak Lebesgue space $L^{p,\infty}$ with certain conditions on the coefficients, we give natural and an almost sharp pointwise estimate of the solution at spacial infinity. The proof is based on the argument by Korobkov--Pileckas--Russo [4], in which the decay property of the solution to the vorticity equation of the two-dimensional Navier--Stokes equations was studied.</description>

      <title>The evolving surface Cahn-Hilliard equation with a degenerate mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the existence of suitable weak solutions to the Cahn-Hilliard equation with a non-constant (degenerate) mobility on a class of evolving surfaces. We also show weak-strong uniqueness for the case of a positive mobility function, and under some further assumptions on the initial data we show uniqueness for a class of strong solutions for a degenerate mobility function.</description>

      <title>Physical Vacuum Problems for the Full Compressible Euler Equations: Low-regularity Hadamard-style Local Well-posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17153v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript concerns the dynamics of non-isentropic compressible Euler equations in a physical vacuum. We establish the Hadamard-style local well-posedness in low-regularity weighted Sobolev spaces, where the gas-vacuum interface is allowed to have unbounded curvature, demonstrating existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on initial data. Additionally, we prove sharp a priori energy estimates and continuation criteria.
  The approach is based on the framework of Eulerian coordinates, avoiding the regularity issues of the flow map and the high nonlinearity induced by the Lagrangian transformation.</description>

      <title>Mixed norm estimates for dilated averages over planar curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the mixed norm estimates for the operator $ T $associated with a dilated plane curve $(ut, u\gamma(t))$, defined by \[ Tf(x, u) := \int_{0}^{1} f(x_1 - ut, x_2 - u\gamma(t)) \, dt, \] where $ x := (x_1, x_2) $ and $\gamma $ is a general plane curve satisfying appropriate smoothness and curvature conditions. More precisely, we establish the $ L_x^p(\mathbb{R}^2) \rightarrow L_x^q L_u^r(\mathbb{R}^2 \times [1, 2]) $ (space-time) estimates for $ T $, whenever $(\frac{1}{p},\frac{1}{q})$ satisfy \[ \max\left\{0, \frac{1}{2p} - \frac{1}{2r}, \frac{3}{p} - \frac{r+2}{r}\right\} &lt; \frac{1}{q} \leq \frac{1}{p} &lt; \frac{r+1}{2r} \] and $$1 + (1 + \omega)\left(\frac{1}{q} - \frac{1}{p}\right) &gt; 0,$$ where $ r \in [1, \infty] $ and $ \omega := \limsup_{t \rightarrow 0^+} \frac{\ln|\gamma(t)|}{\ln t} $. These results are sharp, except for certain borderline cases. Additionally, we examine the $ L_x^p(\mathbb{R}^2) \rightarrow L_u^r L_x^q(\mathbb{R}^2 \times [1, 2]) $ (time-space) estimates for $T $, which are especially almost sharp when $p=2$.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Analysis of an Optimal Insulation Problem on Non-Smooth Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an insulation problem that seeks the optimal distribution of a fixed amount $m&gt;0$ of insulating material coating an insulated boundary $\Gamma_I\subseteq \partial\Omega$ of a thermally conducting body $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, $d\in \mathbb{N}$. The thickness of the thin insulating layer $\Sigma_{I}^{\varepsilon}$ is given locally via $\varepsilon \mathtt{d}$, where $\mathtt{d}\colon \Gamma_{I}\to [0,+\infty)$ specifies the (to be determined) distribution of the insulating material. We establish $\Gamma(L^2(\mathbb{R}^d))$-convergence of the problem (as $\varepsilon\to 0^+$). Different from the existing literature, which predominantly assumes that the thermally conducting body $\Omega$ has a $C^{1,1}$-boundary, we merely assume that $\Gamma_I$ is piece-wise flat. To overcome this lack of boundary regularity, we define the thin insulating boundary layer $\Sigma_{I}^{\varepsilon}$ using a Lipschitz continuous transversal vector field rather than the outward unit normal vector field. The piece-wise flatness condition on $\Gamma_I$ is only needed to prove the $\liminf$-estimate. In fact, for the $\limsup$-estimate is enough that the thermally conducting body $\Omega$ has a $C^{0,1}$-boundary.</description>

      <title>Time-asymptotic self-similarity of the damped compressible Euler equations in parabolic scaling variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of solutions to the compressible Euler equations with frictional damping in the whole space, where we prescribe direction-dependent values for the density at spatial infinity. To this end, we transform the system into parabolic scaling variables and derive a relative entropy inequality, which allows to conclude the convergence of the density towards a self-similar solution to the porous medium equation while the associated limit momentum is governed by Darcy's law. Moreover, we obtain convergence rates that explicitly depend on the flatness of the limit profile. While we focus on weak solutions in the one-dimensional case, we extend our results to energy-variational solutions in the multi-dimensional setting.</description>

Abstract: We develop representations for bicomplex-valued functions in Hardy classes that generalize the complex holomorphic Hardy spaces. Using these representations, we show these functions have boundary values in the sense of distributions that are representable by an atomic decomposition, and we show continuity of the Hilbert transform on this class of distributional boundary values.</description>

      <title>On compact embeddings in $\mathbf{L^p}$ and fractional spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of the fractional Laplacian operator $(-\Delta)^s$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions gained enormous momentum through its identification with a Neumann operator in $\mathbb{R}^N\times (0, \infty)=\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+$, a method mainly introduced by Caffarelli and Silvestre. Since then, several other operators have been studied using this method. In general, a crucial question is attached to this method: the embedding (in the trace sense) on the ground space $L^q(\mathbb{R}^{N})$ is compact? This question is very important when dealing with problems of existence of solutions. This paper aims to answer this question for some operators.
  Passing to an abstract setting, let $X,Y$ be Hilbert spaces and $\mathcal{A}\colon X\to X'$ a continuous and symmetric elliptic operator. We suppose that $X$ is dense in $Y$ and that the embedding $X\subset Y$ is compact. In this paper we show some consequences of this setting for the study of the fractional operator attached to $\mathcal{A}$ in the extension setting $\Omega\times(0,\infty)$ or $\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+$. Being more specific, we will give some examples where the embedding of the extension domain into $L^2(\Omega)$ is compact, even in the case $\Omega=\mathbb{R}^N$.</description>
