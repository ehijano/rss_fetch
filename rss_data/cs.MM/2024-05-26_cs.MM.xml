      <title>Enhancing Student Feedback Using Predictive Models in Visual Literacy Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer review is a popular feedback mechanism in higher education that actively engages students and provides researchers with a means to assess student engagement. However, there is little empirical support for the durability of peer review, particularly when using data predictive modeling to analyze student comments. This study uses Na\"ive Bayes modeling to analyze peer review data obtained from an undergraduate visual literacy course over five years. We expand on the research of Friedman and Rosen and Beasley et al. by focusing on the Na\"ive Bayes model of students' remarks. Our findings highlight the utility of Na\"ive Bayes modeling, particularly in the analysis of student comments based on parts of speech, where nouns emerged as the prominent category. Additionally, when examining students' comments using the visual peer review rubric, the lie factor emerged as the predominant factor. Comparing Na\"ive Bayes model to Beasley's approach, we found both help instructors map directions taken in the class, but the Na\"ive Bayes model provides a more specific outline for forecasting with a more detailed framework for identifying core topics within the course, enhancing the forecasting of educational directions. Through the application of the Holdout Method and $\mathrm{k}$-fold cross-validation with continuity correction, we have validated the model's predictive accuracy, underscoring its effectiveness in offering deep insights into peer review mechanisms. Our study findings suggest that using predictive modeling to assess student comments can provide a new way to better serve the students' classroom comments on their visual peer work. This can benefit courses by inspiring changes to course content, reinforcement of course content, modification of projects, or modifications to the rubric itself.</description>

      <title>Self-distilled Dynamic Fusion Network for Language-based Fashion Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the domain of language-based fashion image retrieval, pinpointing the desired fashion item using both a reference image and its accompanying textual description is an intriguing challenge. Existing approaches lean heavily on static fusion techniques, intertwining image and text. Despite their commendable advancements, these approaches are still limited by a deficiency in flexibility. In response, we propose a Self-distilled Dynamic Fusion Network to compose the multi-granularity features dynamically by considering the consistency of routing path and modality-specific information simultaneously. Two new modules are included in our proposed method: (1) Dynamic Fusion Network with Modality Specific Routers. The dynamic network enables a flexible determination of the routing for each reference image and modification text, taking into account their distinct semantics and distributions. (2) Self Path Distillation Loss. A stable path decision for queries benefits the optimization of feature extraction as well as routing, and we approach this by progressively refine the path decision with previous path information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Looking Backward: Streaming Video-to-Video Translation with Feature Banks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces StreamV2V, a diffusion model that achieves real-time streaming video-to-video (V2V) translation with user prompts. Unlike prior V2V methods using batches to process limited frames, we opt to process frames in a streaming fashion, to support unlimited frames. At the heart of StreamV2V lies a backward-looking principle that relates the present to the past. This is realized by maintaining a feature bank, which archives information from past frames. For incoming frames, StreamV2V extends self-attention to include banked keys and values and directly fuses similar past features into the output. The feature bank is continually updated by merging stored and new features, making it compact but informative. StreamV2V stands out for its adaptability and efficiency, seamlessly integrating with image diffusion models without fine-tuning. It can run 20 FPS on one A100 GPU, being 15x, 46x, 108x, and 158x faster than FlowVid, CoDeF, Rerender, and TokenFlow, respectively. Quantitative metrics and user studies confirm StreamV2V's exceptional ability to maintain temporal consistency.</description>

      <title>WorDepth: Variational Language Prior for Monocular Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from a single image is an ill-posed problem with inherent ambiguities, i.e. scale. Predicting a 3D scene from text description(s) is similarly ill-posed, i.e. spatial arrangements of objects described. We investigate the question of whether two inherently ambiguous modalities can be used in conjunction to produce metric-scaled reconstructions. To test this, we focus on monocular depth estimation, the problem of predicting a dense depth map from a single image, but with an additional text caption describing the scene. To this end, we begin by encoding the text caption as a mean and standard deviation; using a variational framework, we learn the distribution of the plausible metric reconstructions of 3D scenes corresponding to the text captions as a prior. To "select" a specific reconstruction or depth map, we encode the given image through a conditional sampler that samples from the latent space of the variational text encoder, which is then decoded to the output depth map. Our approach is trained alternatingly between the text and image branches: in one optimization step, we predict the mean and standard deviation from the text description and sample from a standard Gaussian, and in the other, we sample using a (image) conditional sampler. Once trained, we directly predict depth from the encoded text using the conditional sampler. We demonstrate our approach on indoor (NYUv2) and outdoor (KITTI) scenarios, where we show that language can consistently improve performance in both.</description>

      <title>Visual Echoes: A Simple Unified Transformer for Audio-Visual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, with the realistic generation results and a wide range of personalized applications, diffusion-based generative models gain huge attention in both visual and audio generation areas. Compared to the considerable advancements of text2image or text2audio generation, research in audio2visual or visual2audio generation has been relatively slow. The recent audio-visual generation methods usually resort to huge large language model or composable diffusion models. Instead of designing another giant model for audio-visual generation, in this paper we take a step back showing a simple and lightweight generative transformer, which is not fully investigated in multi-modal generation, can achieve excellent results on image2audio generation. The transformer operates in the discrete audio and visual Vector-Quantized GAN space, and is trained in the mask denoising manner. After training, the classifier-free guidance could be deployed off-the-shelf achieving better performance, without any extra training or modification. Since the transformer model is modality symmetrical, it could also be directly deployed for audio2image generation and co-generation. In the experiments, we show that our simple method surpasses recent image2audio generation methods.
