      <title>Commodity Booms, Local State Capacity, and Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State capacity may shape whether natural resources generate prosperity, as it determines if windfalls are effectively turned into useful projects or wasted. We test this hypothesis studying the 2004-2011 mining boom in Peru, where mines' profits are redistributed as windfall transfers to local governments. Our empirical strategy combines geological data with the central government's mining windfalls allocation formula to identify the windfalls' effects on household incomes and other measures of economic development. Proxying local state capacity with the ability to tax and relying on a triple difference strategy we uncover significant variation in treatment response, with positive effects of windfalls limited to high state capacity localities. We find suggestive evidence that only localities with high state capacity succeed at transforming windfalls into infrastructure stocks, which in turns contributes to structural transformation and market integration. Lastly, social unrest increases in low state capacity localities that receive windfalls but fail to perceive their benefits. Our findings underscore important complementarities between investments in extractive industries and in state capacity.</description>

      <title>Globalization? Trade War? A Counterbalance Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.03436v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The embrace of globalization and protectionism among economies has ebbed and flowed over the past few decades. These fluctuations call for quantitative analytics to help countries improve their trade policies. Changing attitudes toward globalization also imply that the best trade policies vary over time and are country-specific. We argue that the imports and exports of all economies constitute a counterbalanced network where conflict and cooperation are two sides of the same coin. Quantitative competitiveness is then formulated for each country using a network counterbalance equilibrium. A country could improve its relative strength in the network by embracing globalization, protectionism, trade collaboration, or conflict. This paper presents some necessary conditions for globalization and trade wars, evaluates their side effects, derives national bargaining powers, identifies appropriate targets for conflict or collaboration, and recommends fair resolutions for trade conflicts. Data and events from 2000 to 2019 support these conditions.</description>

      <title>Nudging Nutrition: Lessons from the Danish "Fat Tax"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In October 2011, Denmark introduced the world's first and, to date, only tax targeting saturated fat. However, this tax was subsequently abolished in January 2013. Leveraging exogenous variation from untaxed Northern-German consumers, we employ a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the causal effects of both the implementation and repeal of the tax on consumption and expenditure behavior across eight product categories targeted by the tax. Our findings reveal significant heterogeneity in the tax's impact across these products. During the taxed period, there was a notable decline in consumption of bacon, liver sausage, and cheese, particularly among low-income households. In contrast, expenditure on butter, cream, and margarine increased as prices rose. Interestingly, we do not observe any difference in expenditure increases between high and low-income households, suggesting that the latter were disproportionately affected by the tax. After the repeal of the tax, we do not observe any significant decline in consumption. On the contrary, there was an overall increase in consumption for certain products, prompting concerns about unintended consequences resulting from the brief implementation of the tax. Finally, we find strong evidence on an overall increase purchases of butter abroad for households living less than 50 km from the German boarder but we do not find strong evidence of spatial heterogeneous effects of the tax.</description>
