      <title>SToFM: a Multi-scale Foundation Model for Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) technologies provide biologists with rich insights into single-cell biology by preserving spatial context of cells. Building foundational models for ST can significantly enhance the analysis of vast and complex data sources, unlocking new perspectives on the intricacies of biological tissues. However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to the need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast numbers of cells. This process requires integrating macro-scale tissue morphology, micro-scale cellular microenvironment, and gene-scale gene expression profile. To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model. SToFM first performs multi-scale information extraction on each ST slice, to construct a set of ST sub-slices that aggregate macro-, micro- and gene-scale information. Then an SE(2) Transformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the sub-slices. Additionally, we construct \textbf{SToCorpus-88M}, the largest high-resolution spatial transcriptomics corpus for pretraining. SToFM achieves outstanding performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as tissue region semantic segmentation and cell type annotation, demonstrating its comprehensive understanding of ST data</description>

      <title>RNAMunin: A Deep Machine Learning Model for Non-coding RNA Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional annotation of microbial genomes is often biased toward protein-coding genes, leaving a vast, unexplored landscape of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are critical for regulating bacterial and archaeal physiology, stress response and metabolism. Identifying ncRNAs directly from genomic sequence is a paramount challenge in bioinformatics and biology, essential for understanding the complete regulatory potential of an organism. This paper presents RNAMunin, a machine learning (ML) model that is capable of finding ncRNAs using genomic sequence alone. It is also computationally viable for large sequence datasets such as long read metagenomic assemblies with contigs totaling multiple Gbp. RNAMunin is trained on Rfam sequences extracted from approximately 60 Gbp of long read metagenomes from 16 San Francisco Estuary samples. We know of no other model that can detect ncRNAs based solely on genomic sequence at this scale. Since RNAMunin only requires genomic sequence as input, we do not need for an ncRNA to be transcribed to find it, i.e., we do not need transcriptomics data. We wrote this manuscript in a narrative style in order to best convey how RNAMunin was developed and how it works in detail. Unlike almost all current ML models, at approximately 1M parameters, RNAMunin is very small and very fast.</description>
