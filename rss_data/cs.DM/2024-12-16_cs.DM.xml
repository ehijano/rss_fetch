      <title>Revisiting Graph Homophily Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homophily is a graph property describing the tendency of edges to connect similar nodes. There are several measures used for assessing homophily but all are known to have certain drawbacks: in particular, they cannot be reliably used for comparing datasets with varying numbers of classes and class size balance. To show this, previous works on graph homophily suggested several properties desirable for a good homophily measure, also noting that no existing homophily measure has all these properties. Our paper addresses this issue by introducing a new homophily measure - unbiased homophily - that has all the desirable properties and thus can be reliably used across datasets with different label distributions. The proposed measure is suitable for undirected (and possibly weighted) graphs. We show both theoretically and via empirical examples that the existing homophily measures have serious drawbacks while unbiased homophily has a desirable behavior for the considered scenarios. Finally, when it comes to directed graphs, we prove that some desirable properties contradict each other and thus a measure satisfying all of them cannot exist.</description>

      <title>Infinite families of planar graphs of a given injective chromatic number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An injective colouring of a graph is a colouring in which every two vertices sharing a common neighbour receive a different colour. Chen, Hahn, Raspaud and Wang conjectured that every planar graph of maximum degree $\Delta \ge 3$ admits an injective colouring with at most $\lfloor 3\Delta/2\rfloor$ colours. This was later disproved by Lu\v{z}ar and \v{S}krekovski for certain small and even values of $\Delta$ and they proposed a new refined conjecture. Using an algorithm for determining the injective chromatic number of a graph, i.e. the smallest number of colours for which the graph admits an injective colouring, we give computational evidence for Lu\v{z}ar and \v{S}krekovski's conjecture and extend their results by presenting an infinite family of $3$-connected planar graphs for each $\Delta$ (except for $4$) attaining their bound, whereas they only gave a finite amount of examples for each $\Delta$. Hence, together with another infinite family of maximum degree $4$, we provide infinitely many counterexamples to the conjecture by Chen et al. for each $\Delta$ if $4\le \Delta \le 7$ and every even $\Delta \ge 8$. We provide similar evidence for analogous conjectures by La and \v{S}torgel and Lu\v{z}ar, \v{S}krekovski and Tancer when the girth is restricted as well. Also in these cases we provide infinite families of $3$-connected planar graphs attaining the bounds of these conjectures for certain maximum degrees $\Delta\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism Counts to Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a pair of non-isomorphic, bipartite graphs which are not distinguished by counting the number of homomorphisms to any tree. This answers a question motivated by Atserias et al. (LICS 2021). In order to establish the construction, we analyse the equivalence relations induced by counting homomorphisms to trees of diameter two and three and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for two graphs to be equivalent. We show that three is the optimal diameter for our construction.</description>

      <title>Aharoni's rainbow cycle conjecture holds up to an additive constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05697v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2017, Aharoni proposed the following generalization of the Caccetta-H\"{a}ggkvist conjecture: if $G$ is a simple $n$-vertex edge-colored graph with $n$ color classes of size at least $r$, then $G$ contains a rainbow cycle of length at most $\lceil n/r \rceil$.
  In this paper, we prove that, for fixed $r$, Aharoni's conjecture holds up to an additive constant. Specifically, we show that for each fixed $r \geq 1$, there exists a constant $\alpha_r \in O(r^5 \log^2 r)$ such that if $G$ is a simple $n$-vertex edge-colored graph with $n$ color classes of size at least $r$, then $G$ contains a rainbow cycle of length at most $n/r + \alpha_r$.</description>

      <title>Online Bipartite Matching in the Probe-Commit Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the classical online bipartite matching problem in the probe-commit model. In this problem, when an online vertex arrives, its edges must be probed to determine if they exist, based on known edge probabilities. A probing algorithm must respect commitment, meaning that if a probed edge exists, it must be used in the matching. Additionally, each online vertex has a patience constraint which limits the number of probes that can be made to an online vertex's adjacent edges. We introduce a new configuration linear program (LP) which we prove is a relaxation of an optimal offline probing algorithm. Using this LP, we establish the following competitive ratios which depend on the model used to generate the instance graph, and the arrival order of its online vertices:
  - In the worst-case instance model, an optimal $1/e$ ratio when the vertices arrive in uniformly at random (u.a.r.) order.
  - In the known independently distributed (i.d.) instance model, an optimal $1/2$ ratio when the vertices arrive in adversarial order, and a $1-1/e$ ratio when the vertices arrive in u.a.r. order.
  The latter two results improve upon the previous best competitive ratio of $0.46$ due to Brubach et al. (Algorithmica 2020), which only held in the more restricted known i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) instance model. Our $1-1/e$-competitive algorithm matches the best known result for the prophet secretary matching problem due to Ehsani et al. (SODA 2018). Our algorithm is efficient and implies a $1-1/e$ approximation ratio for the special case when the graph is known. This is the offline stochastic matching problem, and we improve upon the $0.42$ approximation ratio for one-sided patience due to Pollner et al. (EC 2022), while also generalizing the $1-1/e$ approximation ratio for unbounded patience due to Gamlath et al. (SODA 2019).</description>

      <title>Hereditary Graph Product Structure Theory and Induced Subgraphs of Strong Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16789v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the celebrated Planar Product Structure Theorem by Dujmovic et al, and also related graph product structure results, can be formulated with the induced subgraph containment relation. Precisely, we prove that if a graph G is a subgraph of the strong product of a graph Q of bounded maximum degree (such as a path) and a graph M of bounded tree-width, then G is an induced subgraph of the strong product of Q and a graph M' of bounded tree-width being at most exponential in the maximum degree of Q and the tree-width of M. In particular, if G is planar, we show that G is an induced subgraph of the strong product of a path and a graph of tree-width 39. In the course of proving this result, we introduce and study H-clique-width, a new single structural measure that captures a hereditary analogue of the traditional product structure (where, informally, the strong product has one factor from the graph class H and one factor of bounded clique-width).</description>

      <title>Maximal number of subword occurrences in a word</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the number of occurrences of subwords (non-consecutive sub-sequences) in a given word. We first define the notion of subword entropy of a given word that measures the maximal number of occurrences among all possible subwords. We then give upper and lower bounds of minimal subword entropy for words of fixed length in a fixed alphabet, and also showing that minimal subword entropy per letter has a limit value. A better upper bound of minimal subword entropy for a binary alphabet is then given by looking at certain families of periodic words. We also give some conjectures based on experimental observations.</description>

      <title>HYGENE: A Diffusion-based Hypergraph Generation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16457v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are powerful mathematical structures that can model complex, high-order relationships in various domains, including social networks, bioinformatics, and recommender systems. However, generating realistic and diverse hypergraphs remains challenging due to their inherent complexity and lack of effective generative models. In this paper, we introduce a diffusion-based Hypergraph Generation (HYGENE) method that addresses these challenges through a progressive local expansion approach. HYGENE works on the bipartite representation of hypergraphs, starting with a single pair of connected nodes and iteratively expanding it to form the target hypergraph. At each step, nodes and hyperedges are added in a localized manner using a denoising diffusion process, which allows for the construction of the global structure before refining local details. Our experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of HYGENE, proving its ability to closely mimic a variety of properties in hypergraphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to employ deep learning models for hypergraph generation, and our work aims to lay the groundwork for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Invariant Polydiagonal Subspaces of Matrices and Constraint Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a polydiagonal subspace of the Euclidean space, certain components of the vectors are equal (synchrony) or opposite (anti-synchrony). Polydiagonal subspaces invariant under a matrix have many applications in graph theory and dynamical systems, especially coupled cell networks. We describe invariant polydiagonal subspaces in terms of coloring vectors. This approach gives an easy formulation of a constraint satisfaction problem for finding invariant polydiagonal subspaces. Solving the resulting problem with existing state-of-the-art constraint solvers greatly outperforms the currently known algorithms.</description>
