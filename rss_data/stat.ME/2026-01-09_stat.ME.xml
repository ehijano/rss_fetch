      <title>A Generalized Adaptive Joint Learning Framework for High-Dimensional Time-Varying Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern biomedical and econometric studies, longitudinal processes are often characterized by complex time-varying associations and abrupt regime shifts that are shared across correlated outcomes. Standard functional data analysis (FDA) methods, which prioritize smoothness, often fail to capture these dynamic structural features, particularly in high-dimensional settings. This article introduces Adaptive Joint Learning (AJL), a regularization framework designed to simultaneously perform functional variable selection and structural changepoint detection in multivariate time-varying coefficient models. We propose a convex optimization procedure that synergizes adaptive group-wise penalization with fused regularization, effectively borrowing strength across multiple outcomes to enhance estimation efficiency. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the estimator in the ultra-high-dimensional regime (p &gt;&gt; n), establishing non-asymptotic error bounds and proving that AJL achieves the oracle property--performing as well as if the true active set and changepoint locations were known a priori. A key theoretical contribution is the explicit handling of approximation bias via undersmoothing conditions to ensure valid asymptotic inference. The proposed method is validated through comprehensive simulations and an application to Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) data. The analysis uncovers synchronized phase transitions in disease progression and identifies a parsimonious set of time-varying prognostic markers.</description>

      <title>A new method for augmenting short time series, with application to pain events in sickle cell disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers across different fields, including but not limited to ecology, biology, and healthcare, often face the challenge of sparse data. Such sparsity can lead to uncertainties, estimation difficulties, and potential biases in modeling. Here we introduce a novel data augmentation method that combines multiple sparse time series datasets when they share similar statistical properties, thereby improving parameter estimation and model selection reliability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through validation studies comparing Hawkes and Poisson processes, followed by application to subjective pain dynamics in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), a condition affecting millions worldwide, particularly those of African, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Indian descent.</description>

      <title>Bayesian nonparametric modeling of dynamic pollution clusters through an autoregressive logistic-beta Stirling-gamma process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine suspended particulates (FSP), commonly known as PM2.5, are among the most harmful air pollutants, posing serious risks to population health and environmental integrity. As such, accurately identifying latent clusters of FSP is essential for effective air quality and public health management. This task, however, is notably nontrivial as FSP clusters may depend on various regional and temporal factors, which should be incorporated in the modeling process. Thus, we capitalize on Bayesian nonparametric dynamic clustering ideas, in which clustering structures may be influenced by complex dependencies. Existing implementations of dynamic clustering, however, rely on copula-based dependent Dirichlet processes (DPs), presenting considerable computational challenges for real-world deployment. With this in mind, we propose a more efficient alternative for dynamic clustering by incorporating the novel ideas of logistic-beta dependent DPs. We also adopt a Stirling-gamma prior, a novel distribution family, on the concentration parameter of our underlying DP, easing the process of incorporating prior knowledge into the model. Efficient computational strategies for posterior inference are also presented. We apply our proposed method to identify dynamic FSP clusters across Chile and demonstrate its superior performance over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantile Vector Autoregression without Crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers estimation and model selection of quantile vector autoregression (QVAR). Conventional quantile regression often yields undesirable crossing quantile curves, violating the monotonicity of quantiles. To address this issue, we propose a simplex quantile vector autoregression (SQVAR) framework, which transforms the autoregressive (AR) structure of the original QVAR model into a simplex, ensuring that the estimated quantile curves remain monotonic across all quantile levels. In addition, we impose the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty on the SQVAR model to mitigate the explosive nature of the parameter space. We further develop a Bayesian information criterion (BIC)-based procedure for selecting the optimal penalty parameter and introduce new frameworks for impulse response analysis of QVAR models. Finally, we establish asymptotic properties of the proposed method, including the convergence rate and asymptotic normality of the estimator, the consistency of AR order selection, and the validity of the BIC-based penalty selection. For illustration, we apply the proposed method to U.S. financial market data, highlighting the usefulness of our SQVAR method.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Additive Regression Tree Copula Processes for Scalable Distributional Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to construct the implied copula process of response values from a Bayesian additive regression tree (BART) model with prior on the leaf node variances. This copula process, defined on the covariate space, can be paired with any marginal distribution for the dependent variable to construct a flexible distributional BART model. Bayesian inference is performed via Markov chain Monte Carlo on an augmented posterior, where we show that key sampling steps can be realized as those of Chipman et al. (2010), preserving scalability and computational efficiency even though the copula process is high dimensional. The posterior predictive distribution from the copula process model is derived in closed form as the push-forward of the posterior predictive distribution of the underlying BART model with an optimal transport map. Under suitable conditions, we establish posterior consistency for the regression function and posterior means and prove convergence in distribution of the predictive process and conditional expectation. Simulation studies demonstrate improved accuracy of distributional predictions compared to the original BART model and leading benchmarks. Applications to five real datasets with 506 to 515,345 observations and 8 to 90 covariates further highlight the efficacy and scalability of our proposed BART copula process model.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Truth: Calculating True Values in Causal Inference Simulation Studies via Gaussian Quadrature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation studies are used to understand the properties of statistical methods. A key luxury in many simulation studies is knowledge of the true value (i.e. the estimand) being targeted. With this oracle knowledge in-hand, the researcher conducting the simulation study can assess across repeated realizations of the data how well a given method recovers the truth. In causal inference simulation studies, the truth is rarely a simple parameter of the statistical model chosen to generate the data. Instead, the estimand is often an average treatment effect, marginalized over the distribution of confounders and/or mediators. Luckily, these variables are often generated from common distributions such as the normal, uniform, exponential, or gamma. For all these distributions, Gaussian quadratures provide efficient and accurate calculation for integrands with integral kernels that stem from known probability density functions. We demonstrate through four applications how to use Gaussian quadrature to accurately and efficiently compute the true causal estimand. We also compare the pros and cons of Gauss-Hermite quadrature to Monte Carlo integration approaches, which we use as benchmarks. Overall, we demonstrate that the Gaussian quadrature is an accurate tool with negligible computation time, yet is underused for calculating the true causal estimands in simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Beyond Interaction Effects: Two Logics for Studying Population Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When sociologists and other social scientist ask whether the return to college differs by race and gender, they face a choice between two fundamentally different modes of inquiry. Traditional interaction models follow deductive logic: the researcher specifies which variables moderate effects and tests these hypotheses. Machine learning methods follow inductive logic: algorithms search across vast combinatorial spaces to discover patterns of heterogeneity. This article develops a framework for navigating between these approaches. We show that the choice between deduction and induction reflects a tradeoff between interpretability and flexibility, and we demonstrate through simulation when each approach excels. Our framework is particularly relevant for inequality research, where understanding how treatment effects vary across intersecting social subpopulation is substantively central.</description>

      <title>Identifying expanding TCR clonotypes with a longitudinal Bayesian mixture model and their associations with cancer patient prognosis, metastasis-directed therapy, and VJ gene enrichment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Examination of T-cell receptor (TCR) clonality has become a way of understanding immunologic response to cancer and its interventions in recent years. An aspect of these analyses is determining which receptors expand or contract statistically significantly as a function of an exogenous perturbation such as therapeutic intervention. We characterize the commonly used Fisher's exact test approach for such analyses and propose an alternative formulation that does not necessitate pairwise, within-patient comparisons. We develop this flexible Bayesian longitudinal mixture model that accommodates variable length patient followup and handles missingness where present, not omitting data in estimation because of structural practicalities. Once clones are partitioned by the model into dynamic (expanding or contracting) and static categories, one can associate their counts or other characteristics with disease state, interventions, baseline biomarkers, and patient prognosis. We apply these developments to a cohort of prostate cancer patients who underwent randomized metastasis-directed therapy or not. Our analyses reveal a significant increase in clonal expansions among MDT patients and their association with later progressions both independent and within strata of MDT. Analysis of receptor motifs and VJ gene enrichment combinations using a high-dimensional penalized log-linear model we develop also suggests distinct biological characteristics of expanding clones, with and without inducement by MDT.</description>

      <title>Cluster-Based Bayesian SIRD Modeling of Chickenpox Epidemiology in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a cluster-based Bayesian SIRD model to analyze the epidemiology of chickenpox (varicella) in India, utilizing data from 1990 to 2021. We employed an age-structured approach, dividing the population into juvenile, adult, and elderly groups, to capture the disease's transmission dynamics across diverse demographic groups. The model incorporates a Holling-type incidence function, which accounts for the saturation effect of transmission at high prevalence levels, and applies Bayesian inference to estimate key epidemiological parameters, including transmission rates, recovery rates, and mortality rates. The study further explores cluster analysis to identify regional clusters within India based on the similarities in chickenpox transmission dynamics, using criteria like incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates. We perform K-means clustering to uncover three distinct epidemiological regimes, which vary in terms of outbreak potential and age-specific dynamics. The findings highlight juveniles as the primary drivers of transmission, while the elderly face a disproportionately high mortality burden. Our results underscore the importance of age-targeted interventions and suggest that regional heterogeneity should be considered in public health strategies for disease control. The model offers a transparent, reproducible framework for understanding long-term transmission dynamics and supports evidence-based planning for chickenpox control in India. The practical utility of the model is further validated through a simulation study.</description>

      <title>Identification and Scaling of Latent Variables in Ordinal Factor Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social science researchers are generally accustomed to treating ordinal variables as though they are continuous. In this paper, we consider how identification constraints in ordinal factor analysis can mimic the treatment of ordinal variables as continuous. We describe model constraints that lead to latent variable predictions equaling the average of ordinal variables. This result leads us to propose minimal identification constraints, which we call "integer constraints," that center the latent variables around the scale of the observed, integer-coded ordinal variables. The integer constraints lead to intuitive model parameterizations because researchers are already accustomed to thinking about ordinal variables as though they are continuous. We provide a proof that our proposed integer constraints are indeed minimal identification constraints, as well as an illustration of how integer constraints work with real data. We also provide simulation results indicating that integer constraints are similar to other identification constraints in terms of estimation convergence and admissibility.</description>

      <title>Propagating Surrogate Uncertainty in Bayesian Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard Bayesian inference schemes are infeasible for inverse problems with computationally expensive forward models. A common solution is to replace the model with a cheaper surrogate. To avoid overconfident conclusions, it is essential to acknowledge the surrogate approximation by propagating its uncertainty. At present, a variety of distinct uncertainty propagation methods have been suggested, with little understanding of how they vary. To fill this gap, we propose a mixture distribution termed the expected posterior (EP) as a general baseline for uncertainty-aware posterior approximation, justified by decision theoretic and modular Bayesian inference arguments. We then investigate the expected unnormalized posterior (EUP), a popular heuristic alternative, analyzing when it may deviate from the EP baseline. Our results show that this heuristic can break down when the surrogate uncertainty is highly non-uniform over the design space, as can be the case when the log-likelihood is emulated by a Gaussian process. Finally, we present the random kernel preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (RKpCN) algorithm, an approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme that provides practical EP approximation in the challenging setting involving infinite-dimensional Gaussian process surrogates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Racial disproportionality in Stop and Search practices elicits substantial concerns about its societal and behavioral impacts. This paper aims to investigate the effect of disproportionality, particularly on the black community, on expressive crimes in London using data from January 2019 to December 2023. We focus on a semi-parametric partially linear structural regression method and introduce a scalable Bayesian empirical likelihood procedure combined with double machine learning techniques to control for high-dimensional confounding and to accommodate strong prior assumptions. In addition, we show that the proposed procedure yields a valid posterior in terms of coverage. Applying this approach to the Stop and Search dataset, we find that racial disproportionality aimed at the Black community may be alleviated by taking into account the proportion of the Black population when focusing on expressive crimes.</description>
