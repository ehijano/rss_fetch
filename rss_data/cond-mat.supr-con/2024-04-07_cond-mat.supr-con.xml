      <title>Spin fluctuations in the ultranodal superconducting state of Fe(Se,S)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The iron-based superconductor FeSe isovalently substituted with S displays an abundance of remarkable phenomena that have not been fully understood, at the center of which are apparent zero-energy excitations in the superconducting state in the tetragonal phase. The phenomenology has been generally consistent with the proposal of the so-called ultranodal states where Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces are present. Recently, nuclear magnetic resonance measurements have seen unusually large upturns in the relaxation rate as temperature decreases to nearly zero in these systems, calling for theoretical investigations. In this paper, we calculate the spin susceptibility of an ultranodal superconductor including correlation effects within the random phase approximation. Although the non-interacting mean-field calculation rarely gives an upturn in the low temperature relaxation rate within our model, we found that correlation strongly enhances scattering between hot spots on the Bogoliubov Fermi surface, resulting in robust upturns when the interaction is strong. Our results suggest that in addition to the presence of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, correlation and multiband physics also play important roles in the system's low energy excitations.</description>

      <title>The polarisation fluctuation length scale shaping the superconducting dome of SrTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting domes, ubiquitous across a variety of quantum materials, are often understood as a window favorite for pairing opened by the fluctuations of competing orders. Yet, a quantitative understanding of how such a window closes is missing. Here, we show that inelastic neutron scattering, by quantifying a length scale associated with polar fluctuations, $\ell_0$, addresses this issue. We find that the superconducting dome of strontium titanate definitely ends when $\ell_0$ vanishes. Moreover, the product of $\ell_0$ and the Fermi wavevector peaks close to the maximum critical temperature. Thus, this superconducting dome stems from the competition between the increase of the density of states and the unavoidable collapse of the quantum paraelectric phase, both induced by doping. The successful quantitative account of both the peak and the end of the superconducting dome implies a central role in the pairing mechanism played by the soft ferro-electric mode and its hybridisation with the acoustic branch. Such a scenario may also be at work in other quantum paraelectric materials, either bulk or interfaces.</description>

      <title>Singlet, triplet, and mixed all-to-all pairings emerging from incoherent fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electron-electron and electron-phonon coupling in complex materials can be more complicated than simple density-density interactions, involving intertwined dynamics of spin, charge, and spatial symmetries. This motivates studying universal models with complex interactions, and studying whether in this case BCS-type singlet pairing is still the ``natural'' fate of the system. To this end, we construct a Yukawa-SYK model with nonlocal couplings in both spin and charge channels. Furthermore, we provide for time-reversal-symmetry breaking dynamics by averaging over the Gaussian Unitary ensemble rather than the Orthogonal ensemble. We find that the ground state of the system can be an orbitally nonlocal superconducting state arising from incoherent fermions with no BCS-like analog. The superconductivity has an equal tendency to triplet and singlet pairing states separated by a non-Fermi liquid phase. We further study the fate of the system within the superconducting phase and find that the expected ground state, away from the critical point, is a mixed singlet/triplet state. Finally, we find that while at $T_c$ the triplet and singlet transitions are dual to one another, below $T_c$ the duality is broken, with the triplet state more susceptible to orbital fluctuations just by virtue of its symmetry. Our results indicate that such fluctuation-induced mixed states may be an inherent feature of strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Planckian behavior of cuprates at the pseudogap critical point simulated via flat electron-boson spectral density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planckian behavior has been recently observed in La1.76Sr0.24CuO4 at the pseudogap critical point. The Planckian behavior takes place in an intriguing quantum metallic state at a quantum critical point. Here, the Planckian behavior was simulated with an energy-independent (or flat) and weakly temperature-dependent electron-boson spectral density (EBSD) function by using a generalized Allen's (Shulga's) formula. We obtained various optical quantities from the flat EBSD function, such as the optical scattering rate, the optical effective mass, and the optical conductivity. These quantities are well fitted with the recently observed Planckian behavior. Fermi-liquid behavior was also simulated with an energy-linear and temperature-independent EBSD function. The EBSD functions agree well with the overall doping- and temperature-dependent trends of the EBSD function obtained from the optically measured spectra of cuprate systems, which can be crucial for understanding the microscopic electron-pairing mechanism for high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Neutron Scattering Studies on the High-$T_c$ Superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ at Ambient Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After several decades of studies of high-temperature superconductivity, there is no compelling theory for the mechanism yet; however, the spin fluctuations have been widely believed to play a crucial role in forming the superconducting Cooper pairs. The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity near 80 K in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure provides a new platform to elucidate the origins of high-temperature superconductivity. We perform elastic and inelastic neutron scattering studies on a polycrystalline sample of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ at ambient pressure. No magnetic order can be identified down to 10 K. The absence of long-range magnetic order in neutron diffraction measurements may be ascribed to the smallness of the magnetic moment. However, we observe a weak flat spin-fluctuation signal at $\sim$ 45 meV in the inelastic scattering spectra. The observed spin excitations could be interpreted as a result of strong interlayer and weak intralayer magnetic couplings for stripe-type antiferromagnetic orders. Our results provide crucial information on the spin dynamics and are thus important for understanding the superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons Modified-RPA Eliashberg Theory of the nu=1/2+1/2 Quantum Hall Bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nu=1/2+1/2 quantum Hall bilayer has been previsously modeled using Chern-Simons-RPA-Eliashberg (CSRPAE) theory to describe pairing between the two layers. However, these approaches are troubled by a number of divergences and ambiguities. By using a "modified" RPA approximation to account for mass renormalization, we can work in a limit where the cyclotron frequency is taken to infinity, effectively projecting to a single Landau level. This, surprisingly, controls the important divergences and removes ambiguities found in prior attempts at CSRPAE. Examining BCS pairing of composite fermions we find that the angular momentum channel l=+1 dominates for all distances d between layers and at all frequency scales. Examining BCS pairing of composite fermion electrons in one layer with composite fermion holes in the opposite layer, we find the l=0 pairing channel dominates for all d and all frequencies. The strength of the pairing in these two different descriptions of the same phase of matter is found to be almost identical. This agrees well with our understanding that these are two different but dual descriptions of the same phase of matter.</description>

      <title>Potential of non-conventional superconductors for particle accelerator cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting RadioFrequency (SRF) cavities have been developed for modern particle accelerator projects in the world. These cavities are mainly made of bulk niobium operated in superfluid or normal fluid helium. Due to the price increase in niobium material as well as helium, superconductors beyond the niobium are investigated for more sustainable accelerators. In this paper, we consider the most fundamental loss mechanism of microwaves inside various superconductors caused by thermally excited quasi-particles in the Meissner state.</description>
