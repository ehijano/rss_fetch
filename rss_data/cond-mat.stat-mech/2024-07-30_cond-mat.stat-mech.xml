      <title>$\alpha$ Annealing of Ant Colony Optimization in the infinite-range Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ant colony optimization (ACO) leverages the parameter $\alpha$ to modulate the decision function's sensitivity to pheromone levels, balancing the exploration of diverse solutions with the exploitation of promising areas. Identifying the optimal value for $\alpha$ and establishing an effective annealing schedule remain significant challenges, particularly in complex optimization scenarios. This study investigates the $\alpha$-annealing process of the linear Ant System within the infinite-range Ising model to address these challenges. Here, "linear" refers to the decision function employed by the ants. By systematically increasing $\alpha$, we explore its impact on enhancing the search for the ground state. We derive the Fokker-Planck equation for the pheromone ratios and obtain the joint probability density function (PDF) in stationary states. As $\alpha$ increases, the joint PDF transitions from a mono-modal to a multi-modal state. In the homogeneous fully connected Ising model, $\alpha$-annealing facilitates the transition from a trivial solution at $\alpha=0$ to the ground state. The parameter $\alpha$ in the annealing process plays a role analogous to the transverse field in quantum annealing. Our findings demonstrate the potential of $\alpha$-annealing in navigating complex optimization problems, suggesting its broader application beyond the infinite-range Ising model.</description>

      <title>Exact finite-size corrections in the dimer model on a cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact finite-size corrections to the free energy $F$ of the dimer model on lattice $\mathcal{M} \times \mathcal{N}$ with cylindrical boundary conditions have been derived for three cases where the lattice is completely covered by dimers: $\mathcal{M} = 2M$, $\mathcal{N} = 2N$; $\mathcal{M} = 2M - 1$, $\mathcal{N} = 2N$; and $\mathcal{M} = 2M$, $\mathcal{N} = 2N - 1$. For these types of cylinders, ratios $r_p(\rho)$ of the $p$th coefficient of $F$ have been calculated for the infinitely long cylinder (${\mathcal M} \rightarrow \infty$) and infinitely long strip (${\mathcal N} \rightarrow \infty$) at varying aspect ratios. As in previous studies of the dimer model on the rectangular lattice with free boundary conditions and for the Ising model with Brascamp-Kunz boundary conditions, the limiting values $p \to \infty$ exhibit abrupt anomalous behaviour of ratios $r_p(\rho)$ at certain values of $\rho$. These critical values of $\rho$ and the limiting values of the finite-size expansion coefficient ratios vary between the different models.</description>

      <title>Mahler measures, elliptic curves and $L$-functions for the free energy of the Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes links between the Ising model and elliptic curves via Mahler measures. First, we reformulate the partition function of the Ising model on the square, triangular and honeycomb lattices in terms of the Mahler measure of a Laurent polynomial whose variety's projective closure defines an elliptic curve. Next, we obtain hypergeometric formulas for the partition functions on the triangular and honeycomb lattices and review the known series for the square lattice. Finally, at specific temperatures we express the free energy in terms of a Hasse-Weil $L$-function of an elliptic curve. At the critical point of the phase transition on all three lattices, we obtain the free energy more simply in terms of a Dirichlet $L$-function. These findings suggest that the connection between statistical mechanics and analytic number theory may run deeper than previously believed.</description>

      <title>Activity leads to topological phase transition in 2D populations of heterogeneous oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Populations of heterogeneous, noisy oscillators on a two-dimensional lattice display short-range order. Here, we show that if the oscillators are allowed to actively move in space, the system undergoes instead a Berezenskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition and exhibits quasi-long-range order. This fundamental result connects two paradigmatic models -- XY and Kuramoto model -- and provides insight on the emergence of order in active systems.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature topological invariant for higher-order topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of temperature on the higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs). The finite-temperature topological invariants for the HOTIs can be constructed by generalizing the Resta's polarization for the ground state to the ensemble geometric phase (EGP) for the mixed states, [C.-E. Bardyn, L. Wawer, A. Altland, M. Fleischhauer, and S. Diehl, PhysRevX.8.011035}{Phys. Rev. X 8, 011035 (2018)}]. The EGP is consistent with the Resta's polarization both at zero temperature and at finite temperatures in the thermodynamic limit. {We find that the temperature can change the critical point and thus induces a phase transition from a topologically-trivial phase to a nontrivial phase in a finite-size system, manifesting changes in the winding of the EGP.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek behavior in a topological phase transition with a quadratic band crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism describes the scaling behavior when driving a system across a continuous symmetry-breaking transition. Previous studies have shown that the KZ-like scaling behavior also lies in the topological transitions in the Qi-Wu-Zhang model (2D) and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model (1D), although symmetry breaking does not exist here. Both models with linear band crossings give that $\nu=1$ and $z=1$. We wonder whether different critical exponents can be acquired in topological transitions beyond linear band crossing. In this work, we look into the KZ behavior in a topological 2D checkerboard lattice with a quadratic band crossing. We investigate from dual perspectives: momentum distribution of the Berry curvature in clean systems for simplicity, and real-space analysis of domain-like local Chern marker configurations in disordered systems, which is a more intuitive analog to conventional KZ description. In equilibrium, we find the correlation length diverges with a power $\nu\simeq 1/2$. Then, by slowly quenching the system across the topological phase transition, we find that the freeze-out time $t_\mathrm{f}$ and the unfrozen length scale $\xi(t_\mathrm{f})$ both satisfy the KZ scaling, verifying $z\simeq 2$. We subsequently explore KZ behavior in topological phase transitions with other higher-order band crossing and find the relationship between the critical exponents and the order. Our results extend the understanding of the KZ mechanism and non-equilibrium topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Exponential change of relaxation rate by quenched disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the asymptotic relaxation rate of a Brownian particle in a harmonic potential perturbed by quenched Gaussian disorder, a simplified model for rugged energy landscapes in complex systems. Depending on the properties of the disorder, we show that the mean and variance of the asymptotic relaxation rate are non-monotonous functions of the parameters for a broad class of disorders. In particular, the rate of relaxation may either increase or decrease exponentially compared to the unperturbed case. In the limit of weak disorder, we derive the probability distribution of the asymptotic relaxation rate and show that it is Gaussian, with analytic expressions for the mean and variance that feature universal limits. In comparison with other, well-studied anomalous-relaxation effects that often lead to sub-exponential changes in the relaxation rate, our results show that the effect of disorder is always stronger in the long-time limit. These findings indicate that controlled disorder may serve to tune the relaxation speed in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Polydispersity in Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every realistic instance of a percolation problem is faced with some degree of polydispersity, e.g., the pore size distribution of an inhomogeneous medium, the size distribution of filler particles in composite materials, or the vertex degree of agents in a community network. Such polydispersity is a welcome, because simple to perform, generalization of many theoretical approaches deployed to predict percolation thresholds. These theoretical studies independently found very similar conceptual results for vastly different systems, namely, that the percolation threshold is insensitive to the particular distribution controlling the polydispersity and rather depends only on the first few moments of the distribution. In this article we explain this frequently observed pattern using branching processes. The key observation is that a reasonable degree of polydispersity does effectively not alter the structure of the network that forms at the percolation threshold. As a consequence, the critical parameters of the monodisperse system can be analytically continued to account for polydispersity.</description>

      <title>Holographic dual of defect CFT with corner contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study defect CFT within the framework of holographic duality, emphasizing the impact of corner contributions. We model distinct conformal defects using interface branes that differ in tensions and are connected by a corner. Employing the relationship between CFT scaling dimensions and Euclidean gravity actions, we outline a general procedure for calculating the anomalous dimensions of defect changing operators at nontrivial cusps. Several analytical results are obtained, including the cusp anomalous dimensions at big and small angles. While $1/\phi$ universal divergence appears for small cusp angles due to the fusion of two defects, more interestingly, we uncover a bubble phase rendered by a near zero angle cusp, in which the divergence is absent.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall Edges Beyond the Plasma Analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the plasma analogy is generally unreliable at predicting the edge properties of quantum Hall (QH) states, as it fails to account for the local edge velocity. This discrepancy arises from a fundamental difference between QH droplets and Coulomb gases (CGs): the former are incompressible liquids subject to area-preserving deformations, while the latter are governed by electrostatics and thus involve conformal transformations. We illustrate this QH/CG mismatch across various examples and show its impact on physical quantities, measurable in both solid-state samples and quantum simulators. Specifically, we discuss fluctuations of local observables and their connection to state-of-the-art microwave absorption experiments.</description>

      <title>Exploring the soft pinning effect in the dynamics and the structure dynamics correlation in multicomponent supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multicomponent liquids by increasing the mass of $15\%$ of the particles in a binary Kob-Andersen model. We find that the heavy particles have dual effects on the lighter particles. At higher temperatures, there is a significant decoupling of the dynamics between heavier and lighter particles, with the former resembling a pinned particle to the latter. The dynamics of the lighter particles slow down due to the excluded volume around the nearly immobile heavier particles. Conversely, at lower temperatures, there is a coupling between the dynamics of the heavier and lighter particles. The heavier particles' mass slows down the dynamics of both types of particles. This makes the soft pinning effect of the heavy particles questionable in this regime. We demonstrate that as the mass of the heavy particles increases, the coupling of the dynamics between the lighter and heavier particles weakens. Consequently, the heavier the mass of the heavy particles, the more effectively they act as soft pinning centres in both high and low-temperature regimes. A key finding is that akin to the pinned system, the self and collective dynamics of the lighter particles decouple from each other as the mass of the heavy particles has a more pronounced impact on the latter. We analyze the structure dynamics correlation by considering the system under the binary and modified quaternary framework, the latter describing the pinned system. Our findings indicate that whenever the heavy mass particles function as soft pinning centres, the modified quaternary framework predicts a higher correlation.</description>

      <title>How to define temperature in active systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are used to measure temperature with a thermometer and we know from everyday life that different types of thermometers measure the same temperature. This experience can be based on equilibrium thermodynamics, which explains the equivalence of different possibilities to define temperature. In contrast, for systems out of equilibrium such as active matter, measurements performed with different thermometers can generally lead to different temperature values. In the present work, we systematically compare different possibilities to define temperature for active systems. Based on simulations and theory for inertial active Brownian particles, we find that different temperatures generally lead to different temperature values, as expected. Remarkably, however, we find that different temperatures not only lead to the same values near equilibrium (low P\'eclet number or high particle mass), but even far from equilibrium and in cases where entropy production is large, several different temperatures approximately coincide. In particular, we find that the kinetic temperature, the configurational temperature, and temperatures based on higher moments of the velocity distribution constitute a class of temperatures that all assume very similar values over a wide parameter range. The effective temperature also leads to similar temperature values but only in a limited parameter regime. Notably, temperatures exploiting the virial theorem, the Stokes-Einstein relation, or a harmonic confinement form a second class of temperatures whose values approximately coincide with each other but which strongly differ from those of the first class. Finally, we identify advantages and disadvantages of the different possibilities to define temperature and discuss their relevance for measuring the temperature of an active system.</description>

      <title>On The Effect Of Size On The Kinetics Of Reactions In Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reactions in solution require "contact" between the reagents. We can predict the rate at which reagents come into "contact" (at least in dilute conditions), but if the initial collision does not lead to reaction, what happens then? The collision rates in solution-phase reactions are generally described (explicitly or implicitly) with the Smoluchowski equation. Unfortunately, that model describes coagulations in gases, not reactions in solutions. The model is memory-less, i.e., collisions are treated as random processes, unaware of each other in space and time. The reality is that unreactive collisions create memory: particles (even molecules) "remember" they just collided, i.e, the probability of collision depends on how far back in time their prior collision happened. As we show here, this purely geometric and statistical fact is valid as long as their size is larger than the Kuhn length of their Brownian motion in solution. Under these conditions, particles in solution form, even in the absence of attractive interactions, relatively long-lived "clusters" kept together by the statistical unlikeliness of separating. We show here through Brownian dynamics simulations that, as a result of this memory, the collision rates and the lifetimes of these clusters, differently from what predicted by Smoluchowski's model, are proportional to the ratio between the radius of the colliders and the Kuhn length of their path in solution, with a coefficient close to unity!</description>

      <title>A spring-block theory of feature learning in deep neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central question in deep learning is how deep neural networks (DNNs) learn features. DNN layers progressively collapse data into a regular low-dimensional geometry. This collective effect of non-linearity, noise, learning rate, width, depth, and numerous other parameters, has eluded first-principles theories which are built from microscopic neuronal dynamics. Here we present a noise-non-linearity phase diagram that highlights where shallow or deep layers learn features more effectively. We then propose a macroscopic mechanical theory of feature learning that accurately reproduces this phase diagram, offering a clear intuition for why and how some DNNs are ``lazy'' and some are ``active'', and relating the distribution of feature learning over layers with test accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the exact ground state energy of the quasi-one dimensional restricted $\pm J$ Ising spin glass in a uniform magnetic field using the transfer matrix method. Magnetic field dependence allows us to derive the magnetization as a function of concentration and magnetic field. It turns out that, in the limit of zero field, the magnetization tends to a nonzero value with a singular dependence on the magnetic field. We derive the explicit form of the singularity in thermodynamic quantities such as energy $E\simeq E_0+m_0 h + E_1e^{-h_0/h}$, which is an essential singularity known as Griffiths singularity. We confirm our analytical results using the numerical approach based on iterative equations for energy.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for velocity profile of granular flow in rotating drums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically analyze the steady flow of two-dimensional granular materials in a rotating drum using the discrete element method and a continuum model. The velocity fields obtained from both methods are quantitatively consistent. Two distinct regions exist in the granular flow: the surface flow layer and the static flow regime associated with the rigid rotation near the bottom. The thickness of the surface flow layer increases with the drum diameter and shows a slight dependence on the angular velocity of the rotating drum. Scaling laws for the velocity profile and the surface layer thickness are derived analytically based on the continuum model. The validity of the scaling laws is confirmed numerically.</description>

      <title>Nearest-Neighbours Neural Network architecture for efficient sampling of statistical physics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of sampling efficiently the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution of disordered systems is important both for the theoretical understanding of these models and for the solution of practical optimization problems. Unfortunately, this task is known to be hard, especially for spin glasses at low temperatures. Recently, many attempts have been made to tackle the problem by mixing classical Monte Carlo schemes with newly devised Neural Networks that learn to propose smart moves. In this article we introduce the Nearest-Neighbours Neural Network (4N) architecture, a physically-interpretable deep architecture whose number of parameters scales linearly with the size of the system and that can be applied to a large variety of topologies. We show that the 4N architecture can accurately learn the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution for the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model, and specifically for some of its most difficult instances. In particular, it captures properties such as the energy, the correlation function and the overlap probability distribution. Finally, we show that the 4N performance increases with the number of layers, in a way that clearly connects to the correlation length of the system, thus providing a simple and interpretable criterion to choose the optimal depth.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion in quantum system driven by heavy-tailed stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a stochastically driven non-equilibrium quantum system where the driving protocols consist of hopping and waiting processes. The waiting times between two hopping processes satisfy a heavy-tailed distribution. By calculating the squared width of the wavepackets, our findings demonstrate the emergence of various anomalous transport phenomenons when the system remains unchanged within the heavy-tailed regime, including superdiffusive, subdiffusive, and standard diffusive motion. Only subdiffusion occurs when the system has evolved during the waiting process. All these transport behaviors are accompanied by a breakdown of ergodicity, highlighting the complex dynamics induced by the stochastic driving mechanism.</description>

      <title>The evolution of cooperation with Q-learning: the impact of information perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inherent huge complexities in human beings show a remarkable diversity in response to complex surroundings, enabling us to tackle problems from different perspectives. In the realm of cooperation studies, however, existing work assumes that individuals get access to the same kind of information to make their decisions, in contrast to the facts that individuals often perceive differently. Here, within the reinforcement learning framework, we investigate the impact of information perception on the evolution of cooperation in a 2-person scenario when playing the prisoner's dilemma game. We demonstrate that distinctly different evolution processes are observed in three information perception scenarios, revealing that the structure of information significantly affects the emergence of cooperation. Notably, the asymmetric information scenario exhibits a rich dynamical process, including the cooperation emergence, breakdown, and reconstruction, akin to psychological changes in humans. Our findings indicate that the information structure is vital to the emergence of cooperation, shedding new light on establishing mutually stable cooperative relationships and understanding human behavioral complexities in general.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Farmland Biodiversity Loss: A Bio-Economic Model of Land Consolidation and Pesticide Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biodiversity loss driven by agricultural intensification is a pressing global issue, with significant implications for ecosystem stability and human well-being. We design an integrated bio-economic agent-based model, informed by historical data from the French agricultural sector, to project future biodiversity trends and evaluate policy interventions. Our model predicts further biodiversity decline under a business-as-usual scenario, primarily due to intensified land consolidation. We evaluate two policy options: reducing pesticide use and subsidizing small farmers. While pesticide reduction rapidly benefits biodiversity in the beginning, it eventually leads to increased land consolidation and further biodiversity loss. In contrast, subsidizing small farmers by reallocating a small fraction of existing subsidies, stabilizes farm sizes and enhances biodiversity in the long run. The most effective strategy results from combining both policies, leveraging pesticide reduction alongside targeted subsidies to balance economic pressures and consistently improve biodiversity.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cooperation in the public goods game with Q-learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent paradigm shifts from imitation learning to reinforcement learning (RL) is shown to be productive in understanding human behaviors. In the RL paradigm, individuals search for optimal strategies through interaction with the environment to make decisions. This implies that gathering, processing, and utilizing information from their surroundings are crucial. However, existing studies typically study pairwise games such as the prisoners' dilemma and employ a self-regarding setup, where individuals play against one opponent based solely on their own strategies, neglecting the environmental information. In this work, we investigate the evolution of cooperation with the multiplayer game -- the public goods game using the Q-learning algorithm by leveraging the environmental information. Specifically, the decision-making of players is based upon the cooperation information in their neighborhood. Our results show that cooperation is more likely to emerge compared to the case of imitation learning by using Fermi rule. Of particular interest is the observation of an anomalous non-monotonic dependence which is revealed when voluntary participation is further introduced. The analysis of the Q-table explains the mechanisms behind the cooperation evolution. Our findings indicate the fundamental role of environment information in the RL paradigm to understand the evolution of cooperation, and human behaviors in general.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Correlations in Dual-Unitary Quantum Circuits: Partial Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the notion of quantum chaos is tied to random matrix spectral correlations, also eigenstate properties in chaotic systems are often assumed to be described by random matrix theory. Analytic insights into eigenstate correlations can be obtained by the recently introduced partial spectral form factor. Here, we study the partial spectral form factor in chaotic dual-unitary quantum circuits in the thermodynamic limit. We compute the latter for a finite subsystem in a brickwork circuit coupled to an infinite complement. For initial times, shorter than the subsystem's size, spatial locality and (dual) unitarity implies a constant partial spectral form factor, clearly deviating from the linear ramp of the random matrix prediction. In contrast, for larger times we prove, that the partial spectral form factor follows the random matrix result up to exponentially suppressed corrections. We supplement our exact analytical results by semi-analytic computations performed in the thermodynamic limit as well as with numerics for finite-size systems.</description>

      <title>Julian Hirniak, an early proponent of periodic chemical reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we present and discuss the work and scientific legacy of Julian Hirniak, the Ukrainian chemist and physicist who published two articles in 1908 and 1911 about periodic chemical reactions. Over the last 110+ years, his theoretical work has often been cited favorably in connection with Alfred Lotka's theoretical model of an oscillating reaction system. Other authors have pointed out thermodynamic problems in Hirniak's reaction scheme. Based on English translations of his 1908 Ukrainian and 1911 German articles, we show that Hirniak's claim (that a cycle of inter-conversions of three chemical isomers in a closed reaction vessel can show damped periodic behavior) violates the \textit{Principle of Detailed Balance} (i.e., the Second Law of Thermodynamics), and that Hirniak was aware of this Principle. We also discuss his results in relation to Lotka's first model of damped oscillations in an open system of chemical reactions involving an auto-catalytic reaction operating far from equilibrium. Taking hints from both Hirniak and Lotka, we show that the mundane case of a kinase enzyme catalyzing the phosphorylation of a sugar can satisfy Hirniak's conditions for damped oscillations to its steady state flux (i.e., the Michaelis--Menten rate law), but that the oscillations are so highly damped as to be unobservable. Finally, we examine historical and factual misunderstandings related to Julian Hirniak and his publications.</description>

      <title>Viscous liquid dynamics modeled as random walks within overlapping hyperspheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hypersphere model is a simple one-parameter model of the potential energy landscape of viscous liquids, which consists of a percolating system of hyperspheres of equal sizes randomly distributed in $R^{3N}$ where $N$ is the number of particles. We study random walks within overlapping hyperspheres in 12 to 45 dimensions, utilizing an algorithm for on-the-fly placement of the hyperspheres in conjunction with the kinetic Monte Carlo method. We find behavior typical of viscous liquids; thus decreasing the hypersphere density (corresponding to decreasing the temperature) leads to a slowing down of the dynamics by many orders of magnitude. The shape of the mean-square displacement as a function of time is found to be very similar to that of the Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones mixture and the Random Barrier Model, which predicts well the frequency-dependent fluidity of nine glass-forming liquids of different chemistry [Bierwirth et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 248001 (2017)].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the thermally induced back-action effects in absorption-sensitive micro- and nanomechanical resonators. We propose a unified approach, enabling to simultaneously address both the effective dynamics and non-equilibrium phononic state, depending on the position of a confined sensing (and heating) probe at the surface of the mechanical device. We present an analytical solution for a unidimensional resonator whose thermomechanical deformation profile generally follows that of the mechanical losses. In particular, we find that both the dynamics and the mechanical fluctuations strongly depend on the loss distribution. The effect of the quantum fluctuations of the heat source is also discussed. Our approach provides a thorough, general platform for analyzing thermal back-action effects and their consequences, which may be of significance for future development in ultrasensitive nanomechanical research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.14418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of chemical reactions and mechanical properties including failure from atoms to the micrometer scale remains a longstanding challenge in chemistry and materials science. Bottlenecks include computational feasibility, reliability, and cost. We introduce a method for reactive molecular dynamics simulations using a clean replacement of non-reactive classical harmonic bond potentials with reactive, energy-conserving Morse potentials, called the Reactive INTERFACE Force Field (IFF-R). IFF-R is compatible with force fields for organic and inorganic compounds such as IFF, CHARMM, PCFF, OPLS-AA, and AMBER. Bond dissociation is enabled by three interpretable Morse parameters per bond type and zero energy upon disconnect. Use cases for bond breaking in molecules, failure of polymers, carbon nanostructures, proteins, composite materials, and metals are shown. The simulation of bond forming reactions was included via template-based methods. IFF-R maintains the accuracy of the corresponding non-reactive force fields and is about 30 times faster than prior reactive simulation methods.</description>

Abstract: We determine the full statistics of nonstationary heat transfer in the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti lattice gas model at long times by uncovering and exploiting complete integrability of the underlying equations of the macroscopic fluctuation theory. These equations are closely related to the derivative nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (DNLS), and we solve them by the Zakharov-Shabat inverse scattering method (ISM) adapted by Kaup and Newell (1978) for the DNLS. We obtain explicit results for the exact large deviation function of the transferred heat for an initially localized heat pulse, where we uncover a nontrivial symmetry relation.</description>

Abstract: All real physical processes, including of the first-passage time, occur with a change in entropy. This circumstance is not taken into account when studying the first-passage time, but is illustrated in this article using the example of electron transfer through a metallic double dot. The statistics of the first-passage time of a random process N(t) for electrons transferred through a metallic double dot is considered. The expressions for the average first-passage time are compared with and without taking into account the change in entropy during this time. External influences on the average value of the first-passage time are considered for the case of DC bias voltage.</description>

Abstract: An analogy is drawn between version of non-equilibrium thermodynamics a distribution-based containing an additional thermodynamic first-passage time parameter, nonequilibrium statistical operator method and extended irreversible thermodynamics with flows as an additional thermodynamic parameter. Thermodynamics containing an additional thermodynamic first-passage time parameter maps to extended irreversible thermodynamics. Various conditions for the dependence of the distribution parameters of the first-passage time on the random value of energy, the first thermodynamic parameter, are considered. Time parameter relaxation time {\tau} of extended irreversible thermodynamics is replaced by the average first-passage time. Expressions are obtained for the thermodynamic parameter, the conjugate of the first passage time through the entropy change, and for the average first passage time through the flows.</description>

      <title>Duality between open systems and closed bilayer systems, and thermofield double states as quantum many-body scars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a duality between open many-body systems governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation and satisfying the detailed balance condition on the one side, and closed bilayer systems with a self-adjoint Hamiltonian on the other side. Under this duality, the identity operator on the open system side maps to the thermofield double state which turns out to be a quantum many-body scar of the dual Hamiltonian $\mathcal H$. A remarkable feature of this thermofield scar is a tunable entanglement entropy controlled by the reservoir temperature on the open system side. Further, we identify broad classes of many-body open systems with nontrivial explicit eigen operators $Q$ of the Lindbladian superoperator. The expectation values of the corresponding observables exhibit a simple exponential decay, $\langle Q\rangle_t=e^{-\Gamma t} \langle Q \rangle_0$, irrespectively of the initial state. Under the above duality, these eigen operators give rise to additional (towers of) scars. Finally, we point out that more general superoperators (not necessarily of the GKSL form) can be mapped to self-adjoint Hamiltonians of bilayer systems harbouring scars, and provide an example thereof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A natural criticism of the optimal protocol of the irreversible work found for weakly driven processes is its experimental difficulty in being implementable due to its singular part. In this work, I explore the possibility of taking its continuous linear part as an acceptable near-optimal protocol. First, I prove that such a solution is the optimal protocol for non-singular admissible functions. I corroborate this result by observing successful comparisons with test protocols on six reasonable examples. Also, extending such analysis, I conclude that the error committed on this near-optimal protocol is considerable compared to the first-order singular approximation solution, except for sudden and slowly-varying processes. A conjecture is made about a general structure of a near-optimal protocol for systems under arbitrarily strong perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markovian open many-body quantum systems display complicated relaxation dynamics. The spectral gap of the Liouvillian characterizes the asymptotic decay rate towards the stationary state, but it has recently been pointed out that the spectral gap does not necessarily determine the overall relaxation time. Our understanding on the relaxation process before the asymptotically long-time regime is still limited. We here present a collective relaxation dynamics of autocorrelation functions in the stationary state. As a key quantity in the analysis, we introduce the instantaneous decay rate, which characterizes the transient relaxation and converges to the conventional asymptotic decay rate in the long-time limit. Our theory predicts that a bulk-dissipated system generically shows an accelerated decay before the asymptotic regime due to the scrambling of quantum information associated with the operator spreading.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the role of the spectral dimension $d_s$ in determining the universality of phase transitions on a complex network. Due to its structural heterogeneity, a complex network generally acts as a disordered system. Specifically, we study the synchronization and entrainment transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of the Kuramoto model and the phase transition of the equilibrium dynamics of the classical $XY$ model, thereby covering a broad spectrum from nonlinear dynamics to statistical and condensed matter physics. Using linear theory, we obtain a general relationship between the dynamics occurring on the network and the underlying network properties. This yields the lower critical spectral dimension of the phase synchronization and entrainment transitions in the Kuramoto model as $d_s=4$ and $d_s=2$ respectively, whereas for the phase transition in the $XY$ model it is $d_s=2$. To test our theoretical hypotheses, we employ a network where any two nodes on the network are connected with a probability proportional to a power law of the distance between the nodes; this realizes any desired $d_s\in [1, \infty)$. Our detailed numerical study agrees well with the prediction of linear theory for the phase synchronization transition in the Kuramoto model. However, it shows a clear entrainment transition in the Kuramoto model and phase transition in the $XY$ model at $d_s \gtrsim 3$, not $d_s=2$ as predicted by linear theory. Our study indicates that network disorder in the region $2 \leq d_s \lesssim 3$ introduces strong finite-size fluctuations, which makes it extremely difficult to probe the existence of the ordered phase as predicted, affecting the dynamics profoundly.</description>

Abstract: We rigorously prove that the Heisenberg chain with next-nearest-neighbor interaction, which is anticipated to be non-integrable, is indeed non-integrable in the sense that this system has no nontrivial local conserved quantity. Our result covers two important models, the Majundhar-Ghosh model and the Shastry-Sutherland model, as special cases. These models are shown to be non-integrable while have some solvable energy eigenstates.</description>

Abstract: Non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems (NFTs) relate work performed on a system as its Hamiltonian varies with time, to equilibrium data of the initial and final states. In a classical context the system energy can be directly measured, while a quantum implementation requires the incorporation of a work-agent. We demonstrate that the uncertainty principle imposes inherent quantum limitations on the applicability of the NFT for probing non-trivial mesoscopic systems. We work out the NFT validity regime for the simplest quantum-dot toy model, and discuss future applications.</description>

      <title>Second Law of Thermodynamics without Einstein Relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials that are constantly driven out of thermodynamic equilibrium, such as active and living systems, typically violate the Einstein relation. This may arise from active contributions to particle fluctuations which are unrelated to the dissipative resistance of the surrounding medium. We show that in these cases the widely used relation between informatic entropy production and heat dissipation does not hold. Consequently, fluctuation relations for the mechanical work, such as the Jarzynski and Crooks theorems, are invalid. We relate the breaking of the correspondence between entropy production and heat dissipation to departure from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We propose a temperature-like variable which restores this correspondence and gives rise to a generalized second law of thermodynamics, whereby the dissipated heat is necessarily nonnegative and vanishes at equilibrium. The Clausius inequality, Carnot maximum efficiency theorem, and relation between the extractable work and the change of free energy are recovered as well.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space Diffusion in Systems with Approximate Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random matrix theory (RMT) universality is the defining property of quantum mechanical chaotic systems, and can be probed by observables like the spectral form factor (SFF). In this paper, we describe systematic deviations from RMT behaviour at intermediate time scales in systems with approximate symmetries. At early times, the symmetries allow us to organize the Hilbert space into approximately decoupled sectors, each of which contributes independently to the SFF. At late times, the SFF transitions into the final ramp of the fully mixed chaotic Hamiltonian. For approximate continuous symmetries, the transitional behaviour is governed by a universal process that we call Hilbert space diffusion. The diffusion constant corresponding to this process is related to the relaxation rate of the associated nearly conserved charge. By implementing a chaotic sigma model for Hilbert-space diffusion, we formulate an analytic theory of this process which agrees quantitatively with our numerical results for different examples.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the classical thermal Mpemba effect (where an initially hot system relaxes faster to the final equilibrium state than a cold one) to open quantum systems coupled to several reservoirs. We show that, in general, two different types of quantum Mpemba effects are possible. They may be distinguished by quantum state tomography. However, the existence of a quantum Mpemba effect (without determining the type) can already be established by measuring simpler observables such as currents or energies. We illustrate our general results for the experimentally feasible case of an interacting two-site Kitaev model coupled to two metallic leads.</description>

      <title>Structural analysis of Gibbs states and metastates in short-range classical spin glasses: indecomposable metastates, dynamically-frozen states, and metasymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider short-range classical spin glasses, or other disordered systems, consisting of Ising spins. For a low-temperature Gibbs state in infinite size in such a system, for given random bonds, it is controversial whether its decomposition into pure states will be trivial or non-trivial. We undertake a general study of the overall structure of this problem, based on metastates, which are essential to prove the existence of a thermodynamic limit. A metastate is a probability distribution on Gibbs states, for given disorder, that satisfies certain covariance properties. First, we prove that any metastate can be decomposed as a mixture of indecomposable metastates, and that all Gibbs states drawn from an indecomposable metastate are alike macroscopically. Next, we consider stochastic stability of a metastate under random perturbations of the disorder, and prove that any metastate is stochastically stable. Using related methods and older results, we prove that if the pure-state decomposition of any Gibbs states drawn from an indecomposable metastate is countably infinite, then the weights in the decomposition follow a Poisson-Dirichlet distribution with a fixed value of the single parameter describing such distributions, and also that if the overlap takes a finite number of values, then the pure states are organized as an ultrametric space, as in $k$-RSB. Dynamically-frozen states play a role in the analysis of Gibbs states drawn from a metastate, either as states or as parts of states. Using a mapping into real Hilbert space, we prove further results about Gibbs states, and classify them into six types. Metastate-average states are studied, and can be related to states arising dynamically at long times after a quench from high temperature, under some conditions.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable non-unitary time evolution in quantum critical systems I: Effect of complex spacetime metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this series of works, we study exactly solvable non-unitary time evolutions in one-dimensional quantum critical systems ranging from quantum quenches to time-dependent drivings. In this part I, we are motivated by the recent works of Kontsevich and Segal [1] and Witten [2] on allowable complex spacetime metrics in quantum field theories. In general, such complex spacetime metrics will lead to non-unitary time evolutions. In this work, we study the universal features of such non-unitary time evolutions based on exactly solvable setups. Various physical quantities including entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement spectrum, entanglement entropy, and energy density at an arbitrary time can be exactly solved. Due to the damping effect introduced by the complex time, the excitations in the initial state are gradually damped out in time. The non-equilibrium dynamics exhibits universal features that are qualitatively different from the case of real-time evolutions. For instance, for an infinite system after a global quench, the entanglement entropy of the semi-infinite subsystem will grow logarithmically in time, in contrast to the linear growth in a real-time evolution. Moreover, we study numerically the time-dependent driven quantum critical systems with allowable complex spacetime metrics. It is found that the competition between driving and damping leads to a steady state with an interesting entanglement structure.</description>

Abstract: We examine the transition from trivial to non-trivial phases in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model subjected to disorder in a quasi-periodic environment. We analytically determine the phase boundary, and characterize the localization of normal modes using their inverse participation ratio. We compute energy-dependent mobility edges and provide evidence for the emergence of a topological Anderson insulator within specific parameter ranges. Whereas the phase transition boundary is affected by the quasi-periodic modulation, the topologically insulating Anderson phase is stable with respect to the chiral disorder in a quasi-periodic setup. Additionally, our results also uncover a re-entrant topological phase transition from non-trivial to trivial phases for certain values of quasi-periodic modulation with fixed chiral disorder.</description>

Abstract: The NLTS (No Low-Energy Trivial State) conjecture of Freedman and Hastings [2014] posits that there exist families of Hamiltonians with all low energy states of non-trivial complexity (with complexity measured by the quantum circuit depth preparing the state). We prove this conjecture by showing that the recently discovered families of constant-rate and linear-distance QLDPC codes correspond to NLTS local Hamiltonians.</description>

Abstract: There is a current interest in quantum thermodynamics in the context of open quantum systems. An important issue is the consistency of quantum thermodynamics, in particular the second law of thermodynamics, i.e., the flow of heat from a hot reservoir to a cold reservoir. Here recent emphasis has been on composite system and in particular the issue regarding the application of local or global master equations. In order to contribute to this discussion we discuss two cases, namely as an example a single qubit and as a simple composite system two coupled qubits driven by two heat reservoirs at different temperatures, respectively. Applying a global Lindblad master equation approach we present explicit expressions for the heat currents in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics. The analysis is carried out in the Born-Markov approximation. We also discuss issues regarding the possible presence of coherences in the steady state.</description>

Abstract: Understanding equilibration and thermalization in isolated many-body quantum systems is a central challenge in quantum physics. The traditional approach focuses on the study of the full state of the quantum system which, at equilibrium, is best described by the Diagonal Ensemble. Here, we present Observable Statistical Mechanics, a novel paradigm that shifts attention from the full quantum state to the statistics of measurement outcomes. This approach is grounded in the Maximum Observable Entropy Principle, positing that equilibrium measurement statistics tend to maximize observable entropy under conserved average energy. By focusing on accessible measurements, the theory accurately predicts equilibrium probability distributions without needing detailed microscopic information like the energy eigenstates. Extensive numerical experiments on 7 spin-1/2 Hamiltonians demonstrate the broad applicability and robustness of this framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14120v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stationary (late-time) training regime of single- and two-layer underparameterized linear neural networks within the continuum limit of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for synthetic Gaussian data. In the case of a single-layer network in the weakly underparameterized regime, the spectrum of the noise covariance matrix deviates notably from the Hessian, which can be attributed to the broken detailed balance of SGD dynamics. The weight fluctuations are in this case generally anisotropic, but effectively experience an isotropic loss. For an underparameterized two-layer network, we describe the stochastic dynamics of the weights in each layer and analyze the associated stationary covariances. We identify the inter-layer coupling as a distinct source of anisotropy for the weight fluctuations. In contrast to the single-layer case, the weight fluctuations are effectively subject to an anisotropic loss, the flatness of which is inversely related to the fluctuation variance. We thereby provide an analytical derivation of the recently observed inverse variance-flatness relation in a model of a deep linear neural network.</description>

Abstract: The Bose polaron is a quasiparticle that arises from the interaction between impurities and Bogoliubov excitation in Bose-Einstein condensates, analogous to the polaron formed by electrons and phonons in solid-state physics. In this paper, we investigate the effect of phase separation on weakly coupled and strongly coupled Bose polarons. Our findings reveal that phase separation induces a remarkable alteration in the properties of weakly coupled Bose polarons. However, in the case of strong coupling, phase separation cannot destroy the highly self-trapping state of Bose polarons.</description>

Abstract: We study the T-system of type $A_\infty$, also known as the octahedron recurrence/equation, viewed as a 2+1-dimensional discrete evolution equation. Generalizing the study of [P. Di Francesco and R. Soto-Garrido. Arctic curves of the octahedron equation. J. Phys. A, 47(28):285204, 34, 2014], we consider initial data along parallel ``slanted" planes perpendicular to an arbitrary admissible direction $(r,s,t)\in {\mathbb Z}_+^3$. The solution of the T-system is interpreted as the partition function of a dimer model on some suitable ``pinecone" graph introduced in [M. Bousquet-M\'elou, J. Propp, and J. West. Perfect matchings for the three-term Gale-Robinson sequences. Electron. J. Combin., 16(1):Research Paper 125, 37, 2009]. The T-system formulation and some exact solutions in uniform or periodic cases allow us to explore the thermodynamic limit of the corresponding dimer models and to derive exact arctic curves separating the various phases of the system.</description>

Abstract: Mittag-Leffler correlated noise (M-L noise) plays a crucial role in the dynamics of complex systems, yet the scientific community has lacked tools for its direct generation. Addressing this gap, our work introduces GenML, a Python library specifically designed for generating M-L noise. We detail the architecture and functionalities of GenML and its underlying algorithmic approach, which enables the precise simulation of M-L noise. The effectiveness of GenML is validated through quantitative analyses of autocorrelation functions and diffusion behaviors, showcasing its capability to accurately replicate theoretical noise properties. Our contribution with GenML enables the effective application of M-L noise data in numerical simulation and data-driven methods for describing complex systems, moving beyond mere theoretical modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data describing the three-dimensional structure of physical networks is increasingly available, leading to a surge of interest in network science to explore the relationship between the shape and connectivity of physical networks. We contribute to this effort by standardizing and analyzing 15 data sets from different domains. Each network is made of tube-like objects bound together at junction points, which we treat as nodes, with the connections between them considered as links. We divide these networks into three categories: lattice-like networks, trees, and linked trees. The degree distribution of these physical networks is bounded, with most nodes having degrees one or three. Characterizing the physical properties of links, we show that links have an elongated shape and tend to follow a nearly straight trajectory, while a small fraction of links follow a winding path. These typical node and link properties must be reflected by physical network models. We also measure how confined a link is in space by comparing its trajectory to a randomized null model, showing that links that are central in the abstract network tend to be physically confined by their neighbors. The fact that the shape and connectivity of the physical networks are intertwined highlights that their three-dimensional layout must be taken into account to understand the evolution and function of physical networks.</description>

      <title>Two liquid states of distinguishable helium-4: the existence of another non-superfluid frozen by heating</title>

Abstract: We show that there can exist two liquid states in distinguishable helium-4 ($^4$He) obeying Boltzmann statistics by path integral centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations. This is an indication of quantum liquid polyamorphism induced by nuclear quantum effect. For 0.08-3.3 K and 1-500 bar, we extensively conducted the isothermal-isobaric CMD simulations to explore not only possible states and state diagram but the state characteristics. The distinguishable $^4$He below 25 bar does not freeze down to 0.1 K even though it includes no Bosonic exchange effect and therefore no Bose condensation. One liquid state, low quantum-dispersion liquid (LQDL), is nearly identical to normal liquid He-I of real $^4$He. The other is high quantum-dispersion liquid (HQDL) consisting of atoms with longer quantum wavelength. This is another non-superfluid existing below 0.5 K or the temperatures of LQDL. The HQDL is also a low-entropy and fragile liquid to exhibit, unlike conventional liquids, rather gas-like relaxation of velocity autocorrelation function, while there the atoms diffuse without noticeable contribution from quantum tunneling. The LQDL-HQDL transition is not a thermodynamic phase transition but a continuous crossover accompanied by the change of the expansion factor of quantum wavelength. Freezing of HQDL into the low quantum-dispersion amorphous solid occurs by heating from 0.2 to 0.3 K at 40-50 bar, while this $P$-$T$ condition coincides with the Kim-Chan normal-supersolid phase boundary of real $^4$He. The obtained state diagram was compared with that of the confined subnano-scale $^4$He systems where Bosonic correlation is considerably suppressed.</description>

      <title>Random close packing of binary hard spheres favors the stability of neutron-rich atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spite of the success of the Bethe-Weizs\"acker mass formula in its modern numerical and predictive implementations, the common-knowledge principle that it is electrostatics which, ultimately, favors neutron-rich nuclei still presents unclear aspects. For example, while it is true that the Coulomb interaction promotes the tendency towards neutron-rich nuclei, the opposite effects of Majorana exchange forces and Pauli exclusion are known to counteract this tendency. We show that a recent analytical progress in the mathematical description of random close packing of spheres with different sizes provides a missing contribution to the theoretical description of the $Z$ versus $N$ slope in the nuclides chart. In particular, the theory predicts, on purely geometric grounds, that the most stable nuclei are those with ratio $Z/N \approx 0.75$. This new "geometric" random-packing contribution to the semi-empirical mass formula may be the missing aspect of nuclear structure that tilts the balance towards neutron-rich nuclei in the Segr\`e stability chart.</description>

      <title>Holographic Action Principle for $T\bar{T}$-deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the action principle for the holographic $T\bar{T}$-deformation. We develop a scheme in which one can holographically reproduce the action of the Liouville theory deformed by $T\bar{T}$-insertion. This scheme necessitates considering the bending energy of the finite cut-off surface. Following our proposal, one observes a perfect match between the actions of deformed theory on the field theory and gravity sides.</description>
