      <title>Minimal subshifts of prescribed mean dimension over general alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a countable infinite amenable group, $K$ a finite-dimensional compact metrizable space, and $(K^G,\sigma)$ the full $G$-shift on $K^G$. For any $r\in [0,{\rm mdim}(K^G,\sigma))$, we construct a minimal subshift $(X,\sigma)$ of $(K^G,\sigma)$ with mdim$(X,\sigma)=r$. Furthermore, we construct a subshift of $([0,1]^G,\sigma)$ such that its mean dimension is $1$, and that the set of all attainable values of the mean dimension of its minimal subsystems is exactly the interval $[0,1)$.</description>

      <title>Moment-optimal finitary isomorphism for i.i.d. processes of equal entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finitary isomorphism theorem, due to Keane and Smorodinsky, raised the natural question of how "finite" the isomorphism can be, in terms of moments of the coding radius. More precisely, for which values does there exist an isomorphism between any two i.i.d. processes of equal entropy, with coding radii exhibiting finite t-moments? [3, 4]. Parry [13] and Krieger [10] showed that those finite moments must be lesser than 1 in general, and Harvey and Peres [5] showed that they must be lesser than 1/2 in general. However, the question for the range between 0 and 1/2 remained open, and in fact no general construction of an isomorphism was shown to exhibit any non trivial finite moments. In the present work we settle this problem, showing that between any two aperiodic Markov processes (and i.i.d. processes in particular) of the same entropy, there exists an isomorphism f with coding radii exhibiting finite t-moments for all t in (0,1/2). The isomorphism is constructed explicitly, and the tails of the radii are shown to be optimal up to a poly-logarithmic factor.</description>

      <title>Pullback measure attractors and limiting behaviors of McKean-Vlasov stochastic delay lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-term behavior of the distribution of the solution process to the non-autonomous McKean-Vlasov stochastic delay lattice system defined on the integer set $\mathbb{Z}$. Specifically, we first establish the well-posedness of solutions for this non-autonomous, distribution-dependent stochastic delay lattice system. Then, we prove the existence and uniqueness of pullback measure attractors for the non-autonomous dynamical system generated by the solution operators, defined in the space of probability measures. Furthermore, as an application of the pullback measure attractor, we prove the ergodicity and exponentially mixing of invariant measures for the system under appropriate conditions. Finally, we establish the upper semi-continuity of these attractors as the distribution-dependent stochastic delay lattice system converges to a distribution-independent system.</description>

      <title>Spirals, Tic-Tac-Toe Partition, and Deep Diagonal Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deep diagonal map $T_k$ acts on planar polygons by connecting the $k$-th diagonals and intersecting them successively. The map $T_2$ is the pentagram map and $T_k$ is a generalization. We study the action of $T_k$ on two special subsets of the so-called twisted polygons, which we name \textit{$k$-spirals of type $\alpha$ and $\beta$}. Both types of $k$-spirals are twisted $n$-gons that resemble the shape of inward spirals on the affine patch under suitable projective normalization. We show that for $k \geq 3$, $T_{k}$ preserves both types of $k$-spirals. In particular, we show that the two types of $3$-spirals have precompact forward and backward $T_3$ orbits, and these special orbits in the moduli space are partitioned into squares of a $3 \times 3$ tic-tac-toe grid. This establishes the action of $T_k$ on $k$-spirals as a nice geometric generalization of $T_2$ on convex polygons.</description>

      <title>Mathematical and physical billiard in pyramids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this experimental work we study billiard trajectories in triangular pyramids and try to establish conditions that guarantee the existence (or absence) of 4-cycles (there can be not more, than three of them). We formulate conjectures and prove some statements. For example, if a pyramid has two orthogonal faces, then it has not more than two 4-cycles. Also we study 4-cycles of the "physical" billiard in pyramids, i.e. in the presence of gravity. Here we present our observations for a generic case.</description>

      <title>Fractionally modulated discrete Carleson's Theorem and pointwise Ergodic Theorems along certain curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $c\in(1,2)$ we consider the following operators \[ \mathcal{C}_{c}f(x) = \sup_{\lambda \in [-1/2,1/2)}\bigg| \sum_{n \neq 0}f(x-n) \frac{e^{2\pi i\lambda \lfloor |n|^{c} \rfloor}}{n}\bigg|\text{,}\quad \mathcal{C}^{\mathsf{sgn}}_{c}f(x) = \sup_{\lambda \in [-1/2,1/2)}\bigg| \sum_{n \neq 0}f(x-n) \frac{e^{2\pi i\lambda \mathsf{sign(n)} \lfloor |n|^{c} \rfloor}}{n}\bigg| \text{,}
  \] and prove that both extend boundedly on $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$, $p\in(1,\infty)$. The second main result is establishing almost everywhere pointwise convergence for the following ergodic averages
  \[
  A_Nf(x)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^Nf(T^nS^{\lfloor n^c\rfloor}x)\text{,}
  \]
  where $T,S\colon X\to X$ are commuting measure-preserving transformations on a $\sigma$-finite measure space $(X,\mu)$, and $f\in L_{\mu}^p(X)$, $p\in(1,\infty)$. The point of departure for both proofs is the study of exponential sums with phases $\xi_2 \lfloor |n^c|\rfloor+ \xi_1n$ through the use of a simple variant of the circle method.</description>

      <title>The multilayer garbage disposal game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multilayer garbage disposal game is an evolution of the garbage disposal game. Each layer represents a social relationship within a system of finitely many individuals and finitely many layers. An agent can redistribute their garbage and offload it onto their social neighbors in each layer at each time step. We study the game from a mathematical perspective rather than applying game theory. We investigate the scenario where all agents choose to average their garbage before offloading an equal proportion of it onto their social neighbors. It turns out that the garbage amounts of all agents in all layers converge to the initial average of all agents across all layers when all social graphs are connected and have order at least three. This implies that the winners are those agents whose initial total garbage exceeds the average total garbage across all agents.</description>

Abstract: This note initiates the study of the Fatou\,--\,Julia sets of a complex harmonic mapping. Along with some fundamental properties of the Fatou and the Julia sets, we observe some contrasting behaviour of these sets as those with in case of a holomorphic function.

      <title>Finest decomposition coarsening of reaction networks of biochemical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biochemical reaction networks are typically modeled by $\dfrac{dx}{dt}=N\cdot K(x)=Y\cdot I_a\cdot K(x)$, with $x$ and $K(x)$ as the concentration and rate vectors, respectively, and $N$, $Y$, and $I_a$ as the stoichiometric, molecularity, and incidence matrices, respectively. Steady states, which describe their long-term behaviors, are determined by solving $N\cdot K(x)=0$, while complex balanced steady states are found by solving $I_a \cdot K(x)=0$. To investigate these complex networks, decomposition techniques are important, in particular, for computing steady states. Previously, we identified a widespread property across many networks: the existence of independent and incidence-independent decompositions, characterized by the ability to directly sum the stoichiometric and incidence matrices of the subnetworks, respectively, to match those of the entire network. Here, we discover the ubiquitous property that we call the Finest Decomposition Coarsening (FDC), where the finest independent decomposition (FID) is a coarsening of the finest incidence-independent decomposition (FIID). To support the analysis of this property, we introduce a MATLAB package designed to compute both these decompositions. We then characterize the FDC property and its relationship to structural factors such as the invertibility of the molecularity matrix. We also introduce and characterize the Finest Decompositions Equality (FDE) property, where FIID equals FID. Notably, we show that all deficiency zero networks exhibit the FDE property. Furthermore, we establish important relationships of the FID and FIID with decomposition of the network into its connected components. Our results highlight the prevalence of the coarsening property in reaction networks and deepens the understanding of the algebraic structure and dynamics of biochemical networks.</description>

      <title>What Leads to Administrative Bloat? A Dynamic Model of Administrative Cost and Waste</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a quantitative, dynamic model that captures how environmental change, alignment with the environment, managerial decisions, and resource constraints interact to give rise to administrative bloat in organizations, resulting in organizational failure. Inspired by empirical findings, we model codified processes that, while initially useful, become obsolete as conditions change, consuming resources until actively removed. Our model predicts a critical threshold in management decision parameters -- the propensity to create processes in response to problems, and the propensity to prune obsolete processes in response to administrative burden. This threshold determines two possible outcomes: a sustainable equilibrium, where administrative costs stabilize below resource limits, and runaway administrative bloat, where costs -- dominated by obsolete processes -- grow to resource capacity. The threshold worsens with faster environmental changes. A short-term environmental shock exceeding a critical threshold can push organizations from sustainability into bloat cycles, highlighting the risks posed by events like technological upheaval. Importantly, process creation and pruning propensities have asymmetrical impacts on outcomes. Avoiding administrative bloat requires carefully balancing codified and ad-hoc solutions, weighing error costs, and anticipating future process obsolescence. Finally, We also discuss how our model may be applied to generate insight from existing and future data.</description>

Abstract: Let $\{f_\mu\}_{\mu \in \mathbb{D}}$ be a family of automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^2$ unfolding a generic homoclinic tangency associated to a fixed point $p$ belonging to a horseshoe. We prove that if the linearized versions of the Cantor sets representing the local intersections of the stable and unstable manifolds of $p$ with the horseshoe have stable intersections, then the set of parameters $\mu$ corresponding to automorphisms with persistent tangencies has positive density at $\mu = 0$.</description>

      <title>Fourier Decay from $L^2$-Flattening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified approach for establishing rates of decay for the Fourier transform of a wide class of dynamically defined measures. Among the key features of the method is the systematic use of the $L^2$-flattening theorem obtained in \cite{Khalil-Mixing}, coupled with non-concentration estimates for the derivatives of the underlying dynamical system. This method yields polylogarithmic Fourier decay for Diophantine self-similar measures, and polynomial decay for Patterson-Sullivan measures of convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds, Gibbs measures associated to non-integrable $C^2$ conformal systems, as well as stationary measures for carpet-like non-conformal iterated function systems. Applications include essential spectral gaps on convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds, fractal uncertainty principles, and equidistribution properties of typical vectors in fractal sets.</description>

Abstract: We consider a sequence of $C^2$ (or $C^3$) Anosov maps of the two-dimensional torus that satisfy a common cone condition, and show that if their $C^2$ (respectively, $C^3$) norms are uniformly bounded, then the non-stationary stable foliation must be of class $C^1$ (respectively, $C^{1+\text{H\"older}}$). This generalizes the classical results on smoothness of the invariant foliations of Anosov maps. We also provide an example that shows that an assumption on boundedness of the norms cannot be removed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain an a-posteriori theorem for the existence of partly hyperbolic invariant tori in analytic Hamiltonian systems: autonomous, periodic, and quasi-periodic. The method of proof is based on the convergence of a KAM iterative scheme to solve the invariance equations of tori and their invariant bundles under the framework of the parameterization method. Starting from parameterizations analytic in a complex strip and satisfying their invariance equations approximatly, we derive conditions for the existence of analytic parameterizations in a smaller strip satisfying the invariance equations exactly. The proof relies on the careful treatment of the analyticity loss with each iterative step and on the control of geometric properties of symplectic flavour. We also provide all the necessary explicit constants to perform computer assisted proofs.</description>

      <title>Integrable dynamics in projective geometry via dimers and triple crossing diagram maps on the cylinder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.12692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce twisted triple crossing diagram maps, collections of points in projective space associated to bipartite graphs on the cylinder, and use them to provide geometric realizations of the cluster integrable systems of Goncharov and Kenyon constructed from toric dimer models. Using this notion, we provide geometric proofs that the pentagram map and the cross-ratio dynamics integrable systems are cluster integrable systems. We show that in appropriate coordinates, cross-ratio dynamics is described by geometric R-matrices, which solves the open question of finding a cluster algebra structure describing cross-ratio dynamics.</description>

      <title>Clustering Time-Evolving Networks Using the Spatio-Temporal Graph Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12864v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-evolving graphs arise frequently when modeling complex dynamical systems such as social networks, traffic flow, and biological processes. Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</description>
