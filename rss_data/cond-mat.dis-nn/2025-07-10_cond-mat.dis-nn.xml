      <title>Randomly measured quantum particles and thermal noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the motion of a quantum particle whose position is measured in random places at random moments in time. We contrast this motion with the motion of a quantum particle in a potential which varies randomly in space and in time, which could also be thought of as (possibly thermal) noise. We calculate expectations of observables both linear and nonlinear in the density matrix. We demonstrate explicitly that while linear observables cannot distinguish between random measurements and random noise, measurable distinctions can be seen in nonlinear observables.</description>

      <title>Organic Electronic Classifiers for Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This monograph describes nine years of research carried out at the Institute for Electronics, Micro-electronics and Nanotechnologies (IEMN), developed around defining a generic concept for detection, filling a void between metrological sensors and biological senses, sensing an environment's qualities along with their measurable properties in information generation technologies. The first chapter introduces fundamental notions of recognition for complex environments, such as for their chemistry, for which organic semiconductors can embed two new functionalities in consumer electronics. The second and third chapters mostly summarize contributions to the state-of-the-art literature on these matters: in the second chapter, on studying conducting polymers as both chemical detectors and conductimetric transducers, and the third chapter, on studying electropolymerization sensitivity to conceptualize evolutionary electronics. The fourth chapter presents several results on the conception of several "classifiers" exploiting both functionalities: in tasks aiming at integrating different sensitivities at a very small scale, at broadening sensing devices' receptive fields based on experience, and at physically engraving the experience data in a sensing hardware. Along with this monograph are also associated four appendices, summarizing different elements related to the context of this research.</description>

      <title>Analytic toolkit for the Anderson model with arbitrary disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Anderson model in one dimension is a quantum particle on a discrete chain of sites with nearest-neighbor hopping and random on-site potentials. It is a progenitor of many further models of disordered systems, and it has spurred numerous developments in diverse branches of physics. The literature is silent, however, on practical analytic tools for computing the density-of-states of this model when the distribution of the on-site potentials is arbitrary. Here, supersymmetry-based techniques are employed to give an explicit linear integral equation whose solutions control the density-of-states. The output of this analytic procedure is in perfect agreement with numerical sampling. By Thouless formula, these results immediately provide analytic control over the localization length.</description>

      <title>High Proton Conductivity of HxWO3 at Intermediate Temperatures: Unlocking Its Application as a Mixed Ionic-Electronic Conductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen tungsten bronzes (HxWO3), known for their mixed protonic-electronic conduction near room temperature, are extensively studied for electrochromic and gasochromic applications. However, their proton transport properties at elevated temperatures, particularly in the intermediate-temperature range (200-500 {\deg}C), remain unexplored. This study revealed the proton transport behavior of HxWO3, focusing on its potential as a proton-conducting mixed ionic-electronic conductor (MIEC) for intermediate-temperature electrochemical applications. By employing a proton-conducting phosphate glass as an electron-blocking electrode, we selectively measured the partial proton conductivity of sintered HxWO3. Hydrogen incorporation into the sintered WO3 pellet was found to occur preferentially near the surface, forming an approximately 500-micrometer-thick hydrogen-rich region. This region reached a composition of x = 0.24 and exhibited proton conductivity exceeding 10^-1 S/cm at 275 {\deg}C, well above those of state-of-the-art perovskite proton conductors. Impedance spectroscopy revealed distinct features of proton transport, including an isotope effect. The proton diffusion coefficient was 100-1000 times greater than that of H0.0001TiO2, which exhibits mixed protonic-electronic conduction via hydrogen dissolution. The larger proton diffusion coefficient of H0.24WO3 suggests that large polaron formation enhances proton mobility.These findings unlock new functionality of HxWO3 as a MIEC in the intermediate-temperature range, paving the way for the development of next-generation hydrogen energy conversion systems.</description>

      <title>Algebraic States in Continuum in $ d\gt 1$ Dimensional Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the existence of algebraically localized eigenstates embedded within the continuum spectrum of 2D non-Hermitian systems with a single impurity. These modes, which we term algebraic states in continuum (AICs), decay algebraically as $1/|r|$ from the impurity site, and their energies lie within the bulk continuum spectrum under periodic boundary conditions. We analytically derive the threshold condition for the impurity strength required to generate such states. Remarkably, AICs are forbidden in Hermitian systems and in 1D non-Hermitian systems, making them unique to non-Hermitian systems in two and higher dimensions. To detect AICs, we introduce a local density of states as an experimental observable, which is readily accessible in photonic/acoustic platforms.</description>

      <title>Balanced multi-species spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a special class of multi-species spin glass models: ones in which the species proportions serve to ``balance'' out the interaction strengths. For this class, we prove a free energy lower bound that does not require any convexity assumption, and applies to both Ising and spherical models. The lower bound is the free energy of a single-species model whose $p$-spin inverse-temperature parameter is exactly the variance of the $p$-spin component of the multi-species Hamiltonian. We further demonstrate that this lower bound is actually an equality in many cases, including: at high temperatures for all models, at all temperatures for convex models, and at zero temperature for pure bipartite spherical models. When translated to a statement about the injective norm of a nonsymmetric Gaussian tensor, our lower bound matches an upper bound recently established by Dartois and McKenna.</description>

      <title>Subwavelength Localisation in Disordered Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13954v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elucidate the different mechanisms of wave localisation in disordered finite systems of subwavelength resonators, where the disorder is in the spatial arrangement of the resonators. To do so, we employ the capacitance matrix formalism and develop a variety of tools to understand localisation in this setting. Namely, we adapt the Thouless criterion of localisation to quantify the various mechanisms of localisation. We also employ a propagation matrix approach to prove a Saxon-Hutner type theorem ensuring the existence of band gaps for disordered systems and to predict the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. We further investigate the stabilities of bandgaps and localised eigenmodes with respect to fluctuations in the system by introducing a method of defect mode prediction based on the discrete Green function and illuminating the phenomena of Anderson localisation and level repulsion under global disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the motion of a quantum particle whose position is measured in random places at random moments in time. We show that a freely moving particle measured in this way undergoes superdiffusion, while a charged particle moving in a magnetic field confined to the lowest Landau level undergoes conventional diffusion. We also look at a particle moving in one dimensional space in a random time-independent potential, so that it is Anderson localized, which is also measured at random points in space and randomly in time. We find that random measurements break localization and this particle also undergoes diffusion. To address these questions, we develop formalism similar to that employed when studying classical and quantum problems with time-dependent noise.</description>

      <title>How to Train an Oscillator Ising Machine using Equilibrium Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) are prime candidates for use as neuromorphic machine learning processors with Equilibrium Propagation (EP) based on-chip learning. The inherent energy gradient descent dynamics of OIMs, combined with their standard CMOS implementation using existing fabrication processes, provide a natural substrate for EP learning. Our simulations confirm that OIMs satisfy the gradient-descending update property necessary for a scalable Equilibrium Propagation implementation and achieve $\sim 97.2\pm0.1\%$ test accuracy on MNIST and $\sim 88.0\pm0.1\%$ on Fashion-MNIST without requiring any significant hardware modifications. Importantly, OIMs maintain robust performance under realistic hardware constraints, including 10-bit parameter quantization, 4-bit phase measurement precision, and moderate phase noise that can potentially be beneficial with parameter optimization. These results establish OIMs as a promising platform for fast and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing, potentially enabling energy-based learning algorithms that have been previously constrained by computational limitations.</description>

      <title>Field theory for monitored Brownian SYK clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the time evolution of multiple clusters of Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK), i.e. systems of N Majorana fermions with a noisy interaction term. In addition to the unitary evolution, we introduce two-fermion monitorings. We construct a coherent states path integral of the dynamics by generalizing spin coherent states for higher symmetry groups. We then demonstrate that the evolution of the replicated density matrix can be described by an effective field theory for the "light" degrees of freedom, i.e. the quantum fluctuations generated by the unitary evolution. This method is applied to both quadratic, where the field theory reduces to the nonlinear sigma model (NLSM), and also to interacting SYK clusters. We show that in the stationary regime, two monitored clusters exhibit linear-in-N entanglement, with a proportionality factor dependent on the strength of the unitary coupling.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal projections of hypercubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10257v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projections of hypercubes have been applied to visualize high-dimensional binary state spaces in various scientific fields. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization-based algorithms limit the interpretability and reproducibility of the resulting plots. These limitations motivate us to explore theoretically analyzable projection algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA). Here, we investigate the mathematical properties of PCA-projected hypercubes. Our numerical and analytical results show that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions within the hypercubic state space. This property enables the assessment of the asymptotic distribution of projected vertices and error bounds, which characterize the performance of PCA in the projected space. We demonstrate the application of PCA to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems. By adding projected hypercubic edges, these visualizations reveal pathways of correlated spin flips. We confirm that the time-integrated probability flux exhibits patterns consistent with the pathways identified in the projected hypercubic energy landscapes. Using the mean-field model, we show that dominant state transition pathways tend to emerge around the periphery of the projected hypercubes. Our work provides a better understanding of how PCA discovers hidden patterns in high-dimensional binary data.</description>

      <title>(How) Can Transformers Predict Pseudo-Random Numbers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers excel at discovering patterns in sequential data, yet their fundamental limitations and learning mechanisms remain crucial topics of investigation. In this paper, we study the ability of Transformers to learn pseudo-random number sequences from linear congruential generators (LCGs), defined by the recurrence relation $x_{t+1} = a x_t + c \;\mathrm{mod}\; m$. We find that with sufficient architectural capacity and training data variety, Transformers can perform in-context prediction of LCG sequences with unseen moduli ($m$) and parameters ($a,c$). By analyzing the embedding layers and attention patterns, we uncover how Transformers develop algorithmic structures to learn these sequences in two scenarios of increasing complexity. First, we investigate how Transformers learn LCG sequences with unseen ($a, c$) but fixed modulus; and demonstrate successful learning up to $m = 2^{32}$. We find that models learn to factorize $m$ and utilize digit-wise number representations to make sequential predictions. In the second, more challenging scenario of unseen moduli, we show that Transformers can generalize to unseen moduli up to $m_{\text{test}} = 2^{16}$. In this case, the model employs a two-step strategy: first estimating the unknown modulus from the context, then utilizing prime factorizations to generate predictions. For this task, we observe a sharp transition in the accuracy at a critical depth $d= 3$. We also find that the number of in-context sequence elements needed to reach high accuracy scales sublinearly with the modulus.</description>

      <title>Variational Transformer Ansatz for the Density Operator of Steady States in Dissipative Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transformer architecture, known for capturing long-range dependencies and intricate patterns, has extended beyond natural language processing. Recently, it has attracted significant attention in quantum information and condensed matter physics. In this work, we propose the \textit{transformer density operator ansatz} for determining the steady states of dissipative quantum many-body systems. By vectorizing the density operator as a many-body state in a doubled Hilbert space, the transformer encodes the amplitude and phase of the state's coefficients, with its parameters serving as variational variables. Our design preserves translation invariance while leveraging attention mechanisms to capture diverse long-range correlations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by numerically calculating the steady states of dissipative Ising and Heisenberg spin chain models, showing that our method achieves excellent accuracy in predicting mixed steady states.</description>

Abstract: To analyze the $\pm J$ XY spin-glass in three dimensions, we verified a method aimed at obtaining a high-precision dynamical exponent $z$ from the correlation length in the nonequilibrium relaxation process. The obtained $z$ yielded consistent and highly accurate results in previous studies for relatively well-studied models -- specifically, the three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnetic Ising model and the 3D $\pm J$ Ising model. Building on these previous studies, we used this method and the dynamical scaling method to analyze the 3D $\pm J$ XY model and obtained highly precise critical temperatures and exponents. These findings support the spin chirality decoupling picture, explaining the experimental spin-glass phase transition.</description>

Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions (MIET) highlight how local measurements drive quantum systems between area-law and volume-law entangled states. This review surveys MIET in free fermion models, focusing on how unitary hopping competes with measurement-induced non-unitarity. We discuss controversies regarding the existence of MIET in one dimension, the impact of non-Hermitian skin effects, and potential experimental platforms. We conclude with open challenges, including feedback control and higher-dimensional extensions.</description>

      <title>Noise tolerance via reinforcement: Learning a reinforced quantum dynamics</title>

Abstract: The performance of quantum simulations heavily depends on the efficiency of noise mitigation techniques and error correction algorithms. Reinforcement has emerged as a powerful strategy to enhance the efficiency of learning and optimization algorithms. In this study, we demonstrate that a reinforced quantum dynamics can exhibit significant robustness against interactions with a noisy environment. We study a quantum annealing process where, through reinforcement, the system is encouraged to maintain its current state or follow a noise-free evolution. A learning algorithm is employed to derive a concise approximation of this reinforced dynamics, reducing the total evolution time and, consequently, the system's exposure to noisy interactions. This also avoids the complexities associated with implementing quantum feedback in such reinforcement algorithms. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations of reinforced quantum annealing with one- and two-qubit systems under Pauli noise.</description>

      <title>Lost in Retraining: Roaming the Parameter Space of Exponential Families Under Closed-Loop Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Closed-loop learning is the process of repeatedly estimating a model from data generated from the model itself. It is receiving great attention due to the possibility that large neural network models may, in the future, be primarily trained with data generated by artificial neural networks themselves. We study this process for models that belong to exponential families, deriving equations of motions that govern the dynamics of the parameters. We show that maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters endows sufficient statistics with the martingale property and that as a result the process converges to absorbing states that amplify initial biases present in the data. However, we show that this outcome may be prevented if the data contains at least one data point generated from a ground truth model, by relying on maximum a posteriori estimation or by introducing regularisation.</description>
