      <title>A [CII]-158-micron Survey of DLA galaxies at z~4: Observations of Dense and Metal-Enriched Neutral Gas within the Circumgalactic Medium of Star-Forming Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a survey undertaken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to study the galaxies associated with a representative sample of 16 damped Ly-alpha absorbers (DLAs) at z~4.1-4.5, using the [CII]-158-micron ([CII]) line. We detect seven [CII]-emitting galaxies in the fields of 5 DLAs, all of which have absorption metallicity [M/H] &gt; -1.5. We find that the detectability of these HI-selected galaxies with ALMA is a strong function of DLA metallicity, with a detection rate of 71^{+11}_{-20}% for DLAs with [M/H] &gt; -1.5 and 0^{+18}% for DLAs with [M/H] &lt;-1.5. The identified DLA galaxies have far-infrared properties similar to those of typical star-forming galaxies at z ~ 4, with estimated obscured star-formation rates ranging from ~6 Msun/yr to 110 Msun/yr. High-metallicity DLAs therefore provide an efficient way to identify and study samples of high-redshift, star-forming galaxies without preselecting the galaxies by their emission properties. The agreement between the velocities of the metal absorption lines of the DLA and the [CII] emission line of the DLA galaxy indicates that the metals within the DLA originated in the galaxy. With observed impact parameters between 14 and 59 kpc, this indicates that star-forming galaxies at z ~ 4 have a substantial reservoir of dense, cold neutral gas within their circumgalactic medium that has been enriched with metals from the galaxy.</description>

      <title>ALMA Observations of [OI]145um and [NII]205um Emission lines from Star-Forming Galaxies at $z\sim7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of new observations of [OI]145um and [NII]205um emission lines from four star-forming galaxies at redshifts between $z=6.58$ and $7.68$ that have previous detections of \Ciium\ and dust continua. Using ALMA, we successfully detect [OI]145um emission from all targets at $&gt;4\,\sigma$ significance. However, [NII]205um emission is undetected in all galaxies (SNR $&lt;3.5\,\sigma$) except for a tentative detection from A1689-zD1. From the observed high [CII]/[NII] emission line ratios ($\gtrsim20 - 80$), we find that most of the [CII]158um emission arise from neutral gas regions ($3\,\sigma$ lower limits of $\gtrsim 74 - 96\%$). From [OI]145um, [CII]158um lines, and infrared luminosities, we estimate the neutral gas densities of $n_{\rm H}=10^{3.5}$ - $10^6\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$ and the far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation strengths of $G_0\sim10^{2.5}$-$10^{3}$. While the neutral gas densities are similar to those of high-redshift starburst galaxies, the FUV strengths are lower compared to both local and high-redshift starbursts. Finally, we estimate atomic hydrogen masses using [OI]145um emission lines and the oxygen abundances measured from recent JWST observations. We find gas mass ratios of $f_{\rm gas}\sim0.3$ - $0.8$, which are similar to earlier studies using [CII]158um. Starting from this pilot observation, future large [OI]145um emission line surveys will provide us with currently little-known neutral gas properties of star-forming galaxies in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of Incompleteness on Identifying and Interpreting Galaxy Protocluster Populations with the TNG-Cluster Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the TNG-Cluster simulation to examine how stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) incompleteness affect the identification of density peaks within galaxy protoclusters at different redshifts. We focus on 352 protoclusters, defined as the set of galaxies that will reside within the virialized region of a $z=0$ cluster halo with total mass $\sim10^{14.3-15.5}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$, and consider only galaxies with ${M}_{\star}&gt; 10^{8.5}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ (our baseline) at any redshift. We find that ${M}_{\star}$-limited (${M}_{\star} &gt; 10^{9.5}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$) and SFR-limited ($\rm{SFR} &gt; 10~{\rm M}_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$) subpopulations only recover the true highest galaxy density peak in $\lesssim40\%$ of cases within an accuracy of $1.0$ pMpc ($\sim 2-2.5$ arcmin) at $z &gt; 2$. We find that at $z&gt;2$ the highest galaxy density peaks do not generally coincide with the highest dark matter or stellar mass density peaks, and this separation is larger than 0.5 pMpc in $\sim80\%$ of cases. Consequently, the region surrounding the true highest galaxy density peaks are not generally sites of enhanced star formation or accelerated mass growth relative to the remainder of the protocluster. Lastly, we find that the $\sim4$ arcmin apertures typically used to define spectroscopically-confirmed protoclusters are generally much smaller than the $8$ arcmin apertures needed to study the progenitors of the most massive galaxy clusters at $z &gt; 2$.</description>

      <title>MARTA: Temperature-temperature relationships and strong-line metallicity calibrations from multiple auroral lines detections at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first results from MARTA (Measuring Abundances at high Redshift with the T$_e$ Approach), a programme leveraging ultra-deep, medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy to probe the interstellar medium (ISM) of star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 2 - 3$. We report detections of one or more auroral lines, including [O III]$\lambda4363$, [O II]$\lambda\lambda7320,7330$, [S II] $\lambda4068$, and [S III] $\lambda6312$ for 16 galaxies in the sample, providing measurements of multiple ionic temperatures. We tested the validity of the T[O II]-T[O III] relation at high redshift considering a total sample of 21 objects including literature data, and obtained a shallower slope than in the low-$z$ literature. However, such a slope is consistent with low-redshift data when ultra-low metallicity objects are considered. We assessed the correlation of the T[O II]-T[O III] relationship and its scatter on different physical parameters, finding a mild correlation with the ionisation parameter and radiation field hardness, while no significant correlation with gas density. The location of high-redshift data is also consistent with the low-$z$ literature in the T[O II]-T[S II], and T[S III]-T[O III] relations, although this conclusion is limited with low-number statistics. Finally, we leveraged our sample together with a comprehensive compilation of galaxies with [O III]$\lambda4363$ detections from the literature to recalibrate classical strong-line diagnostics at high redshift. MARTA represents a key addition in this space because it provides direct metallicities at moderately high oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H) $\sim8.0-8.4$).</description>

      <title>Metal-rich stellar counterpart of the Radcliffe Wave and the 3D chemical footprints of the Milky Way spiral arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping the Milky Way spiral arms in the vertical direction remains a challenging task that has received little attention. Taking advantage of recent results that link the position of the Galactic spiral arms to metal-rich regions in the disc, we analyse a sample of young giant stars from {\it Gaia} DR3 and use their metallicity distribution to produce a 3D metallicity excess map. The map shows signatures of the spiral arms, whose vertical height vary across the Galactic disc, reaching up to 400 pc in amplitude and exhibiting vertical asymmetries with respect to the midplane. Specifically, the Perseus arm displays a high vertical asymmetry consistent with the Galactic warp. Moreover, we find evidence of a metal-rich stellar structure that oscillates vertically, nearly in phase with the arrangement of star-forming regions named the Radcliffe Wave. This new structure is larger and extends beyond the Radcliffe Wave, reaching vertical amplitudes of $\sim$ 270 pc and extending for at least 4 kpc in length. We confirm that for at least half of its length this Extended Radcliffe Wave is the inner edge of the Local Arm. The finding of a metal-rich stellar counterpart of the Radcliffe Wave shows that mapping the three-dimensional metallicity distribution of young stellar populations reveals key information about the structures and chemical enrichment in the Galactic disc.</description>

      <title>Construction of ground state solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson system using genetic algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the construction of the ground state of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations using genetic algorithms. By employing numerical solutions, we develop an empirical formula for the density that works within the considered parameter space. Through the analysis of both numerical and empirical solutions, we investigate the stability of these ground state solutions. Our findings reveal that while the numerical solution outperforms the empirical formula, both solutions lead to similar oscillation modes. We observe that the stability of the solutions depends on specific values of the central density and the nonlinear self-interaction term, and establish an empirical criterion delineating the conditions under which the solutions exhibit stability or instability.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Spectral Energy Distributions of Luminous Broad Absorption Line Quasars at High Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the multiwavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 65 luminous broad absorption line (BAL) quasars with redshifts $1.55 \lesssim z \lesssim 3.50$ from the Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph - Distant Quasar Survey (GNIRS-DQS). We integrate data from a variety of ground- and space-based observatories to construct a comprehensive spectral profile of these objects from radio through X-rays. In addition, we present a mid-infrared to X-ray composite SED of these sources. Our dataset represents the most uniform sample of BAL quasars, providing a statistically robust set of SEDs. Our findings indicate that the BAL quasars in the GNIRS-DQS sample exhibit significant reddening in the ultraviolet-optical continuum relative to their non-BAL counterparts, consistent with previous studies. Notably, our analysis reveals no significant differences in the mid- or near-infrared spectral regime between BAL and non-BAL quasars. In line with previous work, we find no strong evidence that BAL and non-BAL quasars possess fundamentally different SEDs, also consistent with recent findings that both groups display similar rest-frame optical emission-line properties.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Mechanism Hybrid Model of Peaked-Spectrum Radio Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The peaked-spectrum (PS) sources exhibit turnover characteristics in their broad radio spectra. However, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains elusive. The two most common hypotheses are synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) and free-free absorption (FFA). By incorporating multiple absorption scenarios, we propose a multi-mechanism hybrid (MMH) model, which aligns well with current observational data and provides a good physical explanation. Using the GLEAM survey data, we identified a sample of 4,315 sources with peak frequencies approximately between 72--3000 MHz, most of which are MHz-peaked-spectrum sources (MPS). Our analysis shows that instead of SSA, the FFA is the dominant mechanism in producing the spectral turnover for most of the sources in this sample. The index of the optically thick spectrum alpha_thick has a lower boundary due to the FFA, and the steeper alpha_thick indicates a complex multi-absorption mechanism. In particular, the external FFA produces substantial alpha_thick, which exhibits a weak correlation with the peak frequency. Future ultra-long wavelength observations would also provide data on the spectrum of these sources at even lower frequencies. Determining the absorption mechanism that shaped the spectrum of these sources would be a crucial part of understanding their nature.</description>

      <title>Supernova Siblings and Spectroscopic Host-Galaxy Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past century, supernova (SN) searches have detected multiple supernovae (SNe) in hundreds of individual galaxies. So-called SN siblings discovered in the same galaxy present an opportunity to constrain the dependence of the properties of SNe on those of their host galaxies. To investigate whether there is a connection between sibling SNe in galaxies that have hosted multiple SNe and the properties of galaxies, we have acquired integrated optical spectroscopy of 59 galaxies with multiple core-collapse SNe. Perhaps surprisingly, a strong majority of host-galaxy spectra fall within the composite region of the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram. We find a statistically significant difference (KS test p-value = 0.044) between the distributions of the [NII] $\lambda$6583/H$\alpha$ of galaxies that have hosted a majority SN Ibc and those that have hosted a majority SN II, where the majority SN Ibc galaxies have, on average, higher ratios. The difference between the distributions of [NII] $\lambda$6583/H$\alpha$ may arise from either increased contribution from AGN or LINERs in SN Ibc host galaxies, greater metallicity for SN Ibc host galaxies, or both. When comparing the inferred oxygen abundance and the ionization parameter for the galaxies in the Star-Forming region on the BPT diagram, we find statistically significant differences between the distributions for SN Ibc hosts and SN II hosts (p=0.008 and p=0.001, respectively), as well as SN Ib hosts and SN II hosts (p=0.030 and p=0.006, respectively). We also compare the H$\alpha$ equivalent width distributions, also integrated across the galaxies, and find no significant difference.</description>

      <title>Probing the Cosmic Reionization History with JWST: Gunn-Peterson and Ly$\alpha$ Damping Wing Absorption at $4.5 &lt; z &lt; 13$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a statistical analysis of Ly$\alpha$ absorption using 581 galaxies at $z=4.5$-13 observed with multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy programs, including JADES, UNCOVER, CEERS, and GO/DDT. We carefully construct composite spectra binned by redshift with homogeneous UV properties (UV magnitudes, UV slopes, and Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths) and identify significant Ly$\alpha$ forest signals in galaxies at $z\sim5$-6, which diminish toward higher redshifts. We also find UV continuum breaks at rest-frame 1216\AA\ that soften beyond $z\gtrsim6$, confirming the effects of cosmic reionization through a self-consistent transition from Gunn-Peterson to Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption in galaxies. Fair comparisons of composite spectra with matched UV magnitudes and slopes across redshift reveal that UV-faint galaxies clearly show stronger Ly$\alpha$ absorption than UV-bright galaxies towards high redshift, providing insights into the topological evolution of reionization. We estimate Ly$\alpha$ transmission at the Gunn-Peterson trough and Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption by comparing the galaxy spectra to low-$z$ ($z\sim2$-5) galaxy templates that include galactic and circumgalactic absorption and Ly$\alpha$ emission. Using these measurements together with reionization simulations, we derive volume average neutral hydrogen fractions of $\langle x_{\rm HI} \rangle$ = ${0.00}^{+0.12}_{-0.00}$, ${0.25}^{+0.10}_{-0.20}$, ${0.65}^{+0.27}_{-0.35}$, ${1.00}^{+0.00}_{-0.20}$, and ${1.00}^{+0.00}_{-0.40}$ at $z\sim5$, 6, 7, 9, and 10, respectively. These values align with a reionization history characterized by a rapid transition around $z\sim7$-8, consistent with Ly$\alpha$ emitter observations. While the physical driver of this rapid reionization remains unclear, it may involve the emergence of hidden AGN populations and/or the onset of Lyman-continuum escape from galaxies.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Physical Conditions and Star Formation Processes in the G47 Filamentary Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength study of the filamentary cloud G47 (d $\sim$4.44 kpc), which hosts the mid-infrared bubbles N98, B1, and B2. The SMGPS 1.3 GHz continuum map detects ionized emission toward all the bubbles, marking the first detection of ionized emission toward the B2 bubble. Analysis of the unWISE 12.0 $\mu$m image, Spitzer 8.0 $\mu$m image, and the Herschel column density and temperature maps reveals two previously unreported hub-filament system candidates associated with the HII regions B2 and N98, which are powered by massive OB stars. This indirectly favours the applicability of a global non-isotropic collapse (GNIC) scenario for massive star formation in N98 and B2. The position-position-velocity diagram of FUGIN $^{13}$CO(1-0) shows significant velocity variations from 61 to 53 km s$^{-1}$ toward areas between B2 and N98, where the magnetic field morphology exhibits significant curvature, and high velocity dispersion (i.e., 2.3--3.1 km s$^{-1}$) is observed. This may be explained by the expansion of the HII regions B2 and N98. The energy budget of the cloud, estimated using SOFIA/HAWC+ and molecular line data, suggests that the magnetic field dominates over turbulence and gravity in G47. Furthermore, the radial column density and velocity profiles of G47 display signatures of converging flows in a sheet-like structure. The relative orientations between the magnetic field and local gravity suggest that G47 may undergo gravitational contraction along the magnetic field lines once it becomes magnetically supercritical.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Photometry and Reddening Estimation of 105 Galactic Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04930v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on observing unstudied Galactic open clusters in the Ultraviolet (UV) wavelength range and analyzing their photometric data. The Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) enables us to precisely study known Galactic open clusters. We conducted observations using the 1.54-meter Danish Telescope (DK1.54) in Chile and the 2.15-meter telescope at the Complejo Astronomico El Leoncito (CASLEO) in Argentina, employing UV filters. Furthermore, we have collected available photometric and astrometric data for our observed clusters. We aim to estimate the reddening of Galactic open clusters using UV photometry. We applied isochrone fitting to determine the reddening of the clusters using well-known members. As a final result, we present the reddening values of 105 Galactic open clusters in the UV, as determined by our photometry.</description>

      <title>On the Origins of "Hostless'' Supernovae: Testing the Faint-end Galaxy Luminosity Function and Supernova Progenitors with Events in Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present arguments on the likely origins of supernovae without associated host galaxies from open field, non-clustered, environments. We show why it is unlikely these ``hostless'' supernovae stem from escaped hyper-velocity stars (HVS) in any appreciable numbers, especially for core-collapse supernovae. It is highly likely that hostless events arise from dwarf host galaxies too faint to be detected in their parent surveys. Several detections and numerous upper limits suggest a large number of field dwarfs, to $M_V&gt;-14$, which themselves may be important to constraining the slope of the low-mass end of the UV luminosity function, understanding galaxy evolution, and putting $\Lambda$CDM into context. Moreover, the detailed study of these mass and metallicity-constrained host environments, and the variety of supernovae that occur within them, could provide more stringent constraints on the nature of progenitor systems.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the 7-ring PAH Cyanocoronene (C$_{24}$H$_{11}$CN) in GOTHAM Observations of TMC-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the synthesis and laboratory rotational spectroscopy of the 7-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) cyanocoronene (C$_{24}$H$_{11}$CN) using a laser-ablation assisted cavity-enhanced Fourier transform microwave spectrometer. A total of 71 transitions were measured and assigned between 6.8--10.6\,GHz. Using these assignments, we searched for emission from cyanocoronene in the GBT Observations of TMC-1: Hunting Aromatic Molecules (GOTHAM) project observations of the cold dark molecular cloud TMC-1 using the 100\,m Green Bank Telescope (GBT). We detect a number of individually resolved transitions in ultrasensitive X-band observations and perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to derive best-fit parameters, including a total column density of $N(\mathrm{C}_{24}\mathrm{H}_{11}\mathrm{CN}) = 2.69^{+0.26}_{-0.23} \times 10^{12}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ at a temperature of $6.05^{+0.38}_{-0.37}\,$K. A spectral stacking and matched filtering analysis provides a robust 17.3$\,\sigma$ significance to the overall detection. The derived column density is comparable to that of cyano-substituted naphthalene, acenaphthylene, and pyrene, defying the trend of decreasing abundance with increasing molecular size and complexity found for carbon chains. We discuss the implications of the detection for our understanding of interstellar PAH chemistry and highlight major open questions and next steps.</description>

      <title>Behind the Spotlight: A systematic assessment of outshining using NIRCam medium-bands in the JADES Origins Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial resolution and sensitivity of JWST's NIRCam instrument has revolutionised our ability to probe the internal structure of early galaxies. By leveraging deep medium-band imaging in the Jades Origins Field, we assemble comprehensive spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using 19 photometric bands for over 200 high-redshift galaxies ($z \geq 4.5$). We present an analysis of this sample with particular emphasis on investigating the "outshining" phenomenon, which can bias the inferred stellar populations by masking the presence of evolved stellar populations ($\geq$ 100 Myr) with the light of bright, young O and B-type stars. We address this problem by performing spatially-resolved SED-fitting of both binned and full pixel-by-pixel photometry, which we compare to the traditional integrated approach. We find evidence for systematic underestimation of stellar mass in low-mass galaxies ($\leq 10^9 \rm M_\odot$) with bursty star formation, which can exceed a factor of 10 in individual cases, but on average is typically a factor of 1.25-2.5, depending on the binning methodology and SFH model used. The observed mass offset correlates with burstiness (SFR$_{10 \ \rm Myr}$/SFR$_{100 \ \rm Myr}$) and sSFR, such that galaxies with recently rising SFHs have larger mass offsets. The integrated SFH models which produce the most consistent stellar masses are the double power-law and non-parametric `continuity' models, although no integrated model fully reproduces all resolved SFHs. We apply an outshining correction factor to the Stellar Mass Function at $z=7$, finding little impact within the uncertainties. We conclude that outshining can be important in individual low-mass galaxies, but the overall impact is limited and should be considered alongside other systematic SED fitting effects.</description>

      <title>Decoding the variability in the star-formation histories of z ~ 0.8 galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scatter of the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) holds a wealth of information about how galaxies evolve. The timescales encoded in this scatter can provide valuable insight into the relative importance of the physical processes regulating star formation. In this paper, we present a detailed observational analysis of the timescales imprinted in galaxy star-formation history (SFH) fluctuations by using the stochastic SFH model to fit 1928 massive, z ~ 0.8 galaxies in the LEGA-C survey. We find that the total intrinsic scatter of the SFMS is ~0.3 dex in galaxies with stellar masses $\gtrsim 10^{10}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$. This scatter decreases as the timescale over which SFRs are averaged increases, declining to a non-negligible ~0.15 - 0.25 dex at 2 Gyr, underscoring the importance of long-timescale SFH diversity to the SFMS scatter. Furthermore, galaxies currently above (below) the SFMS tend to have been above (below) the SFMS for at least ~1 Gyr, providing evidence that individual galaxies may follow different median tracks through SFR$-\mathrm{M}_*$ space. On shorter timescales (~30 - 100 Myr), galaxies' SFRs also vary on the order of ~0.1 - 0.2 dex. Our work supports the idea that the SFMS emerges from a population average of the pathways that individual galaxies trace through the SFR$-\mathrm{M}_*$ plane. The scatter reflects the long-term heterogeneity of these paths likely set by the evolutionary timescales of halo growth and cooling, accentuated by short-term variations reflecting the dynamical timescale of the galaxy and its interstellar medium. Our results emphasize the dynamic nature of the SFMS and the importance of understanding the diverse processes governing star formation.</description>

      <title>The ISW-Lensing Bispectrum &amp; Trispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization fluctuations are correlated with the gravitational lensing potential. Famously, this induces a CMB three-point function, whose shape can be used to constrain dark energy and modifications to gravity. An analogous effect occurs at higher-order, producing an ISW-lensing trispectrum whose amplitude is hitherto unconstrained. We present a detailed discussion of this effect, and define minimum-variance estimators for the ISW-lensing three- and four-point functions. These are implemented within the PolySpec code, and bear strong similarities to the quadratic estimators used in lensing analyses. Applying these tools to Planck, we obtain strong detections of the bispectrum amplitude (consistent with previous works), but find only weak constraints on the trispectrum, due to a strong cancellation between the various ISW-induced contributions. We additionally forecast the constraints from future datasets, finding that (a) simple estimators for the ISW-lensing bispectrum will be severely limited by non-Gaussian modifications to the covariance, and (b) the ISW-lensing trispectrum will be very challenging to detect even with high-resolution future experiments. We finally consider the induced bias on primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes (and lensing itself), which we show to be large for the bispectrum (as expected) but negligible for the trispectrum.</description>

      <title>Galactic-scale Feeding Reveals Warped Hypermagnetized Multiphase Circumbinary Accretion Around Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries in gaseous and stellar environments are prime targets for next-generation space-based gravitational wave detectors. Yet, realistic accretion conditions under which these binary systems evolve are not fully understood. In this work, we demonstrate the hypermagnetized multi-phase nature of the surrounding accretion flow formed by large-scale feeding from a galaxy background. Our simulations indicate that the hypermagnetized circumbinary disk is eccentric and warped, hosting a hot gas core for a parsec-scale separated binary. We also observe collimated bipolar magnetic tower-like outflows launched from each SMBH.</description>

      <title>Emission line stacking of 21cm intensity maps with MeerKLASS: Inference pipeline and application to the L-band deep-field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel analysis of observational systematics through the emission line stacking of the MeerKLASS L-band deep-field intensity maps, following the detection reported in arXiv:2407.21626. A stacking signal is obtained by stacking the 21cm intensity map cubelets around the galaxy positions from the GAMA survey at $0.39\lesssim z \lesssim 0.46$. An extensive simulation framework is built to study the viability of the stacking detection, the covariance estimation, and the model inference, which are then applied to the data. The statistical significance of the detection is $8.66\sigma$ when averaged into an angular map, and $7.45\sigma$ when averaged into a spectrum. The stacked spectrum exhibits an oscillating component of systematics, and we provide evidence that the systematics is a convolutional effect on the map data. The frequency of the oscillation matches the diffraction from the secondary reflector into the primary beam of the MeerKAT telescope. Bayesian inference can be used to constrain the systematics and the average HI emission of the galaxies. The fitting of the parameters gives a constraint on the systematics frequency $\nu_{\rm sys}\,[{\rm MHz}] = 17.90^{+6.53}_{-4.27}$. The amplitude of the systematics is $&gt;6.71\%$ at the 95\% confidence level. A tentative measurement of the average HI mass of the sources is achieved at ${\rm log}_{10}[\langle M_{\rm HI}\rangle/M_\odot ]=9.84^{+0.48}_{-0.59}$, limited by the narrow redshift bin of the data, the existence of the systematics, and the low-density galaxy sample. These shortfalls will be resolved for future MeerKLASS data to enable accurate measurements of the HI density through stacking of 21cm intensity maps.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Coma Cluster Structure: From the Core to the Hubble Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Coma cluster, embedded in a cosmic filament, is a complex and dynamically active structure in the local Universe. Applying a density-based member selection (dbscan) to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we identify its virilised core and zero-velocity boundary. Cross-correlating with the Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) catalogue enables a velocity-distance analysis, incorporating radial infall models and redshift-independent distance estimators. This reveals, for the first time, the Hubble flow surrounding Coma, a first step to investigate the entanglement between the dark matter in bound objects and the dark energy driving the expansion of their surroundings. The distance to the Coma centre is determined as $69.959 \pm 0.012 \, h^{-1}~\text{Mpc}$. From dbscan, we infer a virial radius of $r_{\rm vir} = \left(1.95 \pm 0.12\right)\,h^{-1}~\text{Mpc}$ and a turnaround of $r_{\rm ta} \geq 4.87~{h}^{-1}~\mbox{Mpc}$. Combining the SDSS redshifts with the CF4 distances, we estimate the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = (73.10 \pm 0.92)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}/\mbox{Mpc}$. However, with different calibrations for the distance moduli, $H_0$ varies between $[72, 80]$ km/s/Mpc. Mass estimates via caustics, the virial theorem, and the Hubble-flow method yield $M = [0.77, 2.0] \times 10^{15}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$, consistent with prior studies. Our systematic approach maps the structure of Coma into the local Hubble flow and shows the degeneracies between dynamical parameters such as the Hubble constant, the virial radius, and the total mass.</description>

      <title>Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Observations of supermassive black hole binary candidates. Strong sinusoidal variations at 95, 147 and 225 GHz in PKS 2131$-$021 and PKS J0805$-$0111</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large sinusoidal variations in the radio light curves of the blazars PKS J0805$-$0111 and PKS 2131$-$021 have recently been discovered with an 18-year monitoring programme by the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, making these systems strong supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) candidates. The sinusoidal variations in PKS 2131$-$021 dominate its light curves from 2.7 GHz to optical frequencies. We report sinusoidal variations observed in both objects with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) at 95, 147 and 225 GHz consistent with the radio light curves. The ACT 95 GHz light curve of PKS 2131$-$021 agrees well with the contemporaneous 91.5 GHz ALMA light curve and is comparable in quality. Broadband, intermittent, sinusoidal variations are also observed in PKS J0805$-$0111, for which there are no ALMA or other millimetre light curves, showing that PKS 2131$-$021 is not an isolated case and that these three properties could be common in blazar SMBHB phenomenology. In both blazars the sinusoid phase as a function of frequency as well as the achromaticity of the sinusoid amplitudes are consistent with the expected signature of jets in SMBHB systems. Monitoring of ~8000 blazars by the Simons Observatory over the next decade should provide a large number of SMBHB candidates that will shed light on the nature of the nanohertz gravitational-wave background.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Weak CN Spectral Absorption Feature in Red Supergiant Stars in the Andromeda (M31) and Triangulum (M33) Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Keck DEIMOS spectra of stars in the Andromeda (M31) and Triangulum (M33) galaxies, selected from the large multi-band (near ultraviolet, visible light, and near infrared) Hubble Space Telescope surveys PHAT and PHATTER, respectively, we have identified a subset of stars that contain a previously unnoticed weak spectral absorption feature around 8000 Angstrom (0.8 micron). This absorption feature appears to be associated with the cyanogen (CN) molecule. Strong CN spectral absorption is a standard feature of carbon stars, which are thought to be intermediate mass (2-3 ~ M_sun) stars with C/O &gt; 1 in the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase of stellar evolution. However, the stars that are the focus of this paper are characterized by a weak version of this CN spectral absorption feature in a spectrum that is otherwise dominated by normal O-rich spectral absorption lines such as TiO and/or the Ca near infrared triplet. We have dubbed these stars "weak CN" stars. We present an automated method for identifying weak CN stars in M31 and M33, and examine their photometric properties in relation to model isochrones and stellar tracks. We find that weak CN stars tend to be fairly localized in color-magnitude space, and appear to be red supergiant stars with masses ranging from 5-10 M_sun, overall lifetimes of about 40-50 Myr, and currently in the core He burning phase of stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>Supernovae at Distances &lt; 40 Mpc: II. Supernova Rate in the Local Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04507v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context.This is the second paper of a series aiming to determine the birth rates of supernovae in the local Universe. Aims. In this paper, we aim to estimate the SN rates in the local universe and fit the delay-time distribution of SNe Ia to put constraints on their progenitor scenarios. Methods.We performed a Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the volumetric rates with the nearby SN sample introduced in Paper I of the series. The rate evolution of core-collapse SNe well traces the evolution of cosmic star formation history; while that of SNe Ia involves the convolution of cosmic star-formation history and a two-component delay-time distribution including a power law and a Gaussian component. Results.The volumetric rates of type Ia, Ibc and II SNe are derived as $0.325\pm0.040^{+0.016}_{-0.010}$, $0.160\pm0.028^{+0.044}_{-0.014}$, and $0.528\pm0.051^{+0.162}_{-0.013}$ (in unit of $10^{-4} yr^{-1} Mpc^{-3} h^3_{70}$), respectively. The rate of CCSNe is consistent with previous estimates. The newly derived local SN Ia rate is larger than existing results given at redshifts 0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.1, favoring an increased rate from the universe at z ~ 0.1 to the local universe. A two-component model can well fit the rate variation, with the power law component accounting for the rate evolution at larger redshifts and the Gaussian component with a delay time of 12.63$\pm$0.38 Gyr accounting for the local rate evolution. This delayed component with such a longer delay time suggests that the progenitors of these SNe Ia were formed at around 1 Gyr after the birth of the universe, which could only be explained by a double-degenerate progenitor scenario. This is evidenced by the comparison with the PTF sample of SNe Ia at z = 0.073, which reveals that the increase in SN Ia rate at z &lt; 0.01 is primarily due to the SNe Ia of massive E and S0 galaxies with old stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Novel Polarimetric Analysis of Near Horizon Flaring Episodes in M87* in Millimeter Wavelength</title>

Abstract: Recent multi-wavelength observations of M87* \citep{2024A&amp;A...692A.140A} revealed a high-energy $\gamma$-ray flare without a corresponding millimeter counterpart. We present a theoretical polarimetric study to evaluate the presence and nature of a potential millimeter flare in M87*, using a suite of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations with varying black hole (BH) spins and magnetic field configurations. We find that the emergence of a millimeter flare is strongly influenced by both spin and magnetic structure, with limited sensitivity to the electron distribution (thermal vs. non-thermal). We model the intensity light curve with a damped random walk (DRW) and compare the characteristic timescale ($\tau$) with recent SMA observations, finding that the simulated $\tau$ exceeds observed values by over an order of magnitude. In a flaring case with BH spin a=+0.5, we identify a distinct millimeter flare followed by an order-of-magnitude flux drop. All Stokes parameters show variability near the flare, including a sign reversal in the electric vector position angle. While most $\beta_m$ modes remain stable, the $EB$-correlation phase is highly sensitive to both the flare peak and decay. We examine polarimetric signatures in photon sub-rings, focusing on modes ns=0 and ns=1. The ns=0 signal closely matches the full image, while ns=1 reveals distinct behaviors, highlighting the potential of space VLBI to isolate sub-ring features. Finally, we analyze the magnetic and velocity field evolution during the flare, finding that magnetic reconnection weakens during the flux decay, and the clockwise velocity flow transitions into an outflow-dominated regime. These results suggest that transient radio variability near flares encodes key information about black hole spin and magnetic field structure, offering a novel probe into the physics of active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Binary neutron star merger offsets from their host galaxies II. Short-duration gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mergers of binary neutron stars (BNSs) and neutron star-black holes (NSBHs) binaries have long been linked to short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). However, despite their stellar progenitors, SGRBs are often found outside the stellar light of the host galaxy. This is commonly attributed to supernova kicks, which displace the SGRB progenitors from the original stellar population. Our goal is to use stellar population synthesis models to reproduce and interpret the observed offsets of a statistical sample of SGRBs, using realistic galactic models based on the observed host properties. We derive the host galaxy potentials from the observed properties on a case-by-case basis, and simulate the galactic trajectories of synthetic BNSs and NSBHs from the BPASS code using three different kick prescriptions. We compare predicted and observed offsets to investigate the impact of velocity kicks, host galaxy types, and host association criteria. The results confirm that the locations of the SGRB population are consistent with the expectations of kicked BNS or BHNS progenitors, implying that such mergers are the dominant (if not only) progenitor system. Predictions for NSBHs provide a significantly worse fit compared to BNSs, while we find no significant difference when comparing different kick prescriptions. For late-type hosts, we find the best agreement when including hosts with a probability of chance alignment Pch up to 20%, while lower Pch thresholds lead us to overestimate SGRB offsets. We argue that Pch is biased against viable hosts at the largest offsets, and suggest the use of less conservative Pch thresholds for late-type hosts. For early-type hosts, the predictions underestimate SGRB offsets in a few cases regardless of the Pch threshold applied. We argue that this is likely due to the models missing galaxy evolution, or spurious host associations.</description>

      <title>IAEmu: Learning Galaxy Intrinsic Alignment Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies, a key contaminant in weak lensing analyses, arise from correlations in galaxy shapes driven by tidal interactions and galaxy formation processes. Accurate IA modeling is essential for robust cosmological inference, but current approaches rely on perturbative methods that break down on nonlinear scales or on expensive simulations. We introduce IAEmu, a neural network-based emulator that predicts the galaxy position-position ($\xi$), position-orientation ($\omega$), and orientation-orientation ($\eta$) correlation functions and their uncertainties using mock catalogs based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework. Compared to simulations, IAEmu achieves ~3% average error for $\xi$ and ~5% for $\omega$, while capturing the stochasticity of $\eta$ without overfitting. The emulator provides both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, helping identify regions where predictions may be less reliable. We also demonstrate generalization to non-HOD alignment signals by fitting to IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation data. As a fully differentiable neural network, IAEmu enables $\sim$10,000$\times$ speed-ups in mapping HOD parameters to correlation functions on GPUs, compared to CPU-based simulations. This acceleration facilitates inverse modeling via gradient-based sampling, making IAEmu a powerful surrogate model for galaxy bias and IA studies with direct applications to Stage IV weak lensing surveys.</description>

Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing at the galaxy scale is a valuable tool for various applications in astrophysics and cosmology. The primary uses of galaxy-scale lensing are to study elliptical galaxies' mass structure and evolution, constrain the stellar initial mass function, and measure cosmological parameters. Since the discovery of the first galaxy-scale lens in the 1980s, this field has made significant advancements in data quality and modeling techniques. In this review, we describe the most common methods for modeling lensing observables, especially imaging data, as they are the most accessible and informative source of lensing observables. We then summarize the primary findings from the literature on the astrophysical and cosmological applications of galaxy-scale lenses. We also discuss the current limitations of the data and methodologies and provide an outlook on the expected improvements in both areas in the near future.</description>

      <title>Deciphering spatially resolved Lyman-alpha profiles in reionization analogs: the Sunburst Arc at cosmic noon</title>

Abstract: The hydrogen Lyman-alpha (Lya) emission line, the brightest spectral feature of a photoionized gas, is considered an indirect tracer of the escape of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons, particularly when the intergalactic medium is too opaque for direct detection. However, resonant scattering complicates interpreting the empirical properties of Lya photons, necessitating radiative transfer simulations to capture their strong coupling with underlying gas kinematics. In this study, we leverage the exceptional spatial resolution from strong gravitational lensing to investigate the connection between Lya line profiles and LyC leakage on scales of a few 100 pc in the Sunburst Arc galaxy at $z\!\sim\!2.37$. New optical echelle spectra obtained using Magellan MIKE show that both the LyC leaking and non-leaking regions exhibit a classic double-peak Lya feature with an enhanced red peak, indicating outflows at multiple locations in the galaxy. Both regions also show a central Gaussian peak atop the double peaks, indicating directly escaped Lya photons independent of LyC leakage. We introduce a machine learning-based method for emulating Lya simulations to quantify intrinsic dynamics ($\sigma_{\mathrm{int}}$), neutral hydrogen column density ($N_{\mathrm{HI}}$), outflow velocity ($v_{\mathrm{exp}}$), and effective temperature ($T$) across continuous parameter spaces. By comparing the spatially and spectrally resolved Lya lines in Sunburst, we argue that the directly escaped Lya photons originate in a volume-filling, warm ionized medium spanning $\sim\!1$ kpc, while the LyC leakage is confined to regions of $\lesssim\!200$ pc. These sub-kpc variations in Lya profiles highlight the complexity of interpreting integrated properties in the presence of inhomogeneous mixtures of gas and young stars, emphasizing the need for spatially and spectrally resolved observations of distant galaxies.</description>

      <title>A model for the emission line galaxy luminosity function and flux ratios at high-redshifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present $[OIII]/H_{\rm \beta}$ emision line flux ratio predictions for galaxies at $z \sim 7-9$ using the MAPPINGS V v5.2.0 photoionization modelling code combined with an analytic galaxy formation model. Properties such as pressure and ionization parameter that determine emission line properties are thought to evolve towards high redshift. In order to determine the range of expected interstellar conditions we extend previous modelling of the Star Formation Rate Density (SFRD) function to calculate the metallicity and ionization parameter, and incorporate the potential impact of turbulence on the density of the ISM. To validate our emission line predictions we calculate the [OIII] line luminosity and its dependence on UV luminosity, as well as the flux ratio $[OIII]/H_{\rm \beta}$ and its variation with the line luminosity, finding that both reproduce recent JWST observations from the FRESCO survey. We also use our model to predict the number counts of emission line galaxies across a range of redshift as well as the dependence of $[OIII]/H_{\rm \beta}$ on ionization parameter and metallicity. Finally, we show that the dependence of flux ratio on luminosity may provide a diagnostic of turbulent motion in galactic discs.</description>

      <title>Galaxy formation physics behind bar formation: A view from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a suite of zoom-in cosmological simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies with a prominent disc component and a strong bar in their centre, based on a subsample of barred galaxies from the TNG50 magneto-hydrodynamic simulation. We modify the physical models that regulate star formation, namely, supernova feedback and black hole quasar feedback, to examine how they affect the disc and bar formation. We find that, independently of the feedback prescriptions, all galaxies show a similar morphology, which is dominant in comparison with the bulge mass. The black hole quasar feedback models used in this study do not affect bar formation, although they can affect the bar strength and length. The energy released by the supernovae causes a delay in the time of bar formation and, in models with the strongest feedback, galaxies form stable discs against bar formation. This could be understood since supernova feedback influences disc and bulge assembly, resulting in discs with lower mass content, radial velocity dispersion and larger size as the supernova feedback strength increases. We study disc stability using three bar instability criteria proposed in the literature. We find that galaxies with varied supernovae and black hole quasar feedback satisfy these criteria at the moment of bar formation, except in extreme cases where the galaxy lacks or has weak supernova feedback. In these models, two of three criteria fail to forecast the existence (or absence) of a bar, probably because they do not account for the influence of a massive and compact bulge. Our findings provide insights into the physical processes behind bar formation and highlight the importance of additional conditions, other than a massive and compact disc that promote bar formation.</description>

      <title>Impact of the shape of the prestellar density fluctuations on the core mass function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that departure from sphericity in the geometry of primordial dark matter halos modifies their mass function. The ellipsoidal collapse model yields a better agreement with simulations of hierarchical clustering than the original, spherical model. In the present paper, we examine the same issue in the context of star formation by studying the impact of non-sphericity of density perturbations in a gravoturbulent medium on the prestellar core mass function (CMF). An important question, notably, is to find out how ellipsoidal, instead of spherical, initial density fluctuations modify both the high-mass and low-mass tails of the CMF. Our study shows that triaxial density fluctuations indeed depart from a purely spherical form but the deformation (prolateness and ellipticity) remains modest, suggesting that the usual hypothesis of spherical collapse in existing theories of the IMF is reasonable. We find that, as in the cosmological case, the departure from sphericity increases the collapse barrier, stabilizing the prestellar cores. The striking difference between the stellar case and the cosmological one for the ellipsoidal collapse model is that, although in both cases the less dense structures are the most deformed, they correspond to small scales, thus low mass halos in cosmology but to large scales, thus large mass cores in star formation. As a result, the high mass range of the CMF is the most affected by the ellipsoidal collapse, resulting in a slightly less steep slope than the one predicted with the spherical hypothesis and a peak slightly shifted toward lower masses.</description>

      <title>A new constraint on galaxy-halo connections of [O II] emitters via HOD modelling with angular clustering and luminosity functions from the Subaru HSC survey</title>

Abstract: Establishing a robust connection model between emission-line galaxies (ELGs) and their host dark haloes is of paramount importance in anticipation of upcoming redshift surveys. We propose a novel halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework that incorporates galaxy luminosity, a key observable reflecting ELG star-formation activity, into the galaxy occupation model. This innovation enables prediction of galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) and facilitates joint analyses using both angular correlation functions (ACFs) and LFs. Using physical information from luminosity, our model provides more robust constraints on the ELG-halo connection compared to methods relying solely on ACF and number density constraints. Our model was applied to [O II]-emitting galaxies observed at two redshift slices at $z=1.193$ and $1.471$ from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam PDR2. Our model effectively reproduces observed ACFs and LFs observed in both redshift slices. Compared to the established \citeauthor{geach12} HOD model, our approach offers a more nuanced depiction of ELG occupation across halo mass ranges, suggesting a more realistic representation of ELG environments. Our findings suggest that ELGs at $z\sim1.4$ may evolve into Milky-Way-like galaxies, as their inferred halo masses evolve accordingly based on the extended Press--Schechter formalism, highlighting their role as potential building blocks in galaxy formation scenarios. By incorporating the LF as a constraint linking galaxy luminosity to halo properties, our HOD model provides a more precise understanding of ELG-host halo relationships. Furthermore, this approach facilitates the generation of high-quality ELG mock catalogues of for future surveys. As the LF is a fundamental observable, our framework is potentially applicable to diverse galaxy populations, offering a versatile tool for analysing data from next-generation galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Loop I/NPS morphology predictions in the ultralong-wavelength band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loop I/North Polar Spur (NPS) is the giant arc structure above the Galactic plane observed at radio wavelengths ($\lesssim 10$ GHz). There has been long-standing debate about its origin. While many people believe that it black consists of nearby supernova remnants (SNRs), some others consider it as a giant bubble close to the Galactic Center (GC), associated with the Fermi Bubble and the eROSITA X-ray bubble. At ultra-long wavelengths (wavelength $\gtrsim 10$ m or frequency $\lesssim 30$ MHz), particularly below $\sim 10$ MHz, the free-free absorption of the radio signal by diffuse electrons in the interstellar medium (ISM) becomes significant, resulting in different sky morphologies from those at higher frequencies. In this paper, we develop emissivity models for the two Loop I/NPS origin scenarios, and predict the Loop I/NPS morphology at ultra-long wavelengths in both scenarios, taking into account the free-free absorption effect.We find that in the SNRs model, the full Loop I/NPS will still be a bright arc even at $\sim 1$ MHz. In the GC model, the arc is fully visible only above $\sim 3$ MHz. While below this frequency, it is visible only at Galactic latitudes $b\gtrsim 30\degree$; the $b\lesssim 30 \degree$ part becomes invisible due to the absorption by the ISM electrons between the GC and the Sun. The upcoming space missions aiming at ultra-long wavelengths, such as the DSL and the FARSIDE, can potentially distinguish these two scenarios and provide decisive information about the origin of the Loop I/NPS.</description>

Abstract: The origin of the cluster of S-stars located in the Galactic Centre is tied to the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, but exactly how is still debated. In this paper, we investigate whether the Hills mechanism can simultaneously reproduce both the S-star cluster's properties and the observed number of hypervelocity stars. To do so, we forward-model the capture and disruption of binary stars originating from the nuclear star cluster (NSC) and the clockwise disk (CWD). We find that the ratio of evolved to main-sequence S-stars is highly sensitive to the origin of the binaries, and that neither the injection of binaries from the CWD nor from the NSC exclusively can reproduce all observations. However, when considering the injection of binaries from both locations, we are able to reproduce all the observations simultaneously, including the number of observed hypervelocity stars, the evolutionary stage of the S-stars, their luminosity function and the distribution of their semi-major axes. The implications of our findings include that ~90% of hypervelocity stars ejected over the past ~10 Myr should originate from the CWD, that the main-sequence S-stars originated in the CWD, and that the evolved S-stars originated in an old stellar population such as the NSC.</description>

Abstract: [ABRIDGED] DIBs are faint absorption features of mainly unknown origin. Observational constraints on their carriers have been provided in the vast majority of the cases via observations in our Galaxy. Detections in other galaxies are scarce. However, they can further constrain the nature of the carriers by sampling different environments and they can put into test the ubiquity of the molecules creating these features. Using the MUSE data of the LIRG NGC 6240, we mapped the DIB5780 over an almost contiguous area of ~76.96 kpc^2 in the center of the system. We also traced the DIBl6284 over two separate areas toward the north and south of the system, with an extent of ~21.22 kpc^2 and ~31.41 kpc^2 (with a total detected area of ~59.78 kpc^2). This is the first time that the l6284 DIB has been mapped outside our Galaxy. Both maps were compared with the attenuation on the overall stellar population and the ionised gas. Both DIBs are detected in locations with high attenuation (E(B-V)_Gas} &gt; 0.3 and E(B-V)_Stellar &gt;0.1), supporting the connection between DIB carriers and dust. Moreover, when compared with other galaxies, DIBs correlate better with stellar than with the ionised gas attenuation. The DIBl6284 presents a stronger correlation with reddening than the l5780 DIB does that can be attributed to a different nature of the carriers causing these DIBs, or a combined effect of a dependency with the metallicity and the different locations where these DIBs have been measured. In addition, we show that NaI D strongly correlates with both DIBs and advocate the usage of DIBs as a first order tracer for amount of material, in the case where NaI D reaches saturation. The findings here show that DIB carriers can exist and survive in an environment as extreme as a galaxy hosting AGN and allow to envision the possibilities integral field spectrographs have to study DIBs well beyond our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Formation of the Little Red Dots from the Core-collapse of Self-interacting Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a statistical study on the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) seeded by gravothermal core-collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos at high redshifts, using a semi-analytical framework based on Monte-Carlo merger trees. We demonstrate that BH formation via gravothermal collapse naturally occurs in high-concentration halos at a characteristic mass scale determined by the SIDM cross section, and only during the early Universe. This mechanism is particularly promising for explaining the abundance of little red dots (LRDs) -- a population of early, apparently galaxy-less active galactic nuclei hosting supermassive BHs. By incorporating this seeding process with simplified models of BH growth and mergers, we successfully reproduce the observed LRD mass function for moderately large cross sections of $\sigma_{0m} \sim 30 \mathrm{cm^2\,g^{-1}}$ and $\omega \sim 80\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, intriguingly consistent with independent local constraints derived from galaxy rotation curves. Our results highlight the potential of high-redshift BH statistics as a complementary probe for constraining SIDM models.</description>

      <title>The MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS) data release 3: Cold atomic gas associated with the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results of a blind search for Galactic HI 21-cm absorption lines toward 19130 radio sources, using 390 pointings of MALS, each pointing centered on a source brighter than 200 mJy. We detected 3640 HI absorption features. This represents the largest Galactic HI absorption line catalog to date. Based on the strong correlation between the HI 21-cm emission line column densities ($N_{HI}$) and the visual extinction ($A_V$) measured toward the pointing center, along with the confinement of the absorption features to a narrow range in radial velocities (-25$&lt;v_{\rm LSR}$[kms$^{-1}$]$&lt;$+25), we infer that the detected absorption lines form a homogeneous sample of HI clouds in the local interstellar medium (LISM). The HI 21-cm absorption optical depth is linearly correlated to $N_{HI}$ and $A_V$, up to $A_V$ of about 1 mag. Above this threshold, $A_V$ traces the total hydrogen content, and consequently, $A_V$ and $N_{HI}$ scale, differently. The slopes of $N_{HI}$ distributions of central sight lines with HI 21-cm absorption detections and non-detection differ at $&gt;2\sigma$. A similar difference is observed for H$_2$ detections and non-detections in damped Lyman-alpha systems at $z$ &gt; 1.8, implying that turbulence-driven WNM-to-CNM conversion is the common governing factor for the presence of HI 21-cm and H$_2$ absorption. Through a comparison of central and off-axis absorption features, we find that the slope of rms fluctuations in the optical depth variations in the quiescent gas associated with LISM is shallower than the earlier measurements in the disk. The densities (20-30 cm$^{-3}$) inferred from the optical depth variations are typical of the CNM values. The negligible velocity shifts between central and off-axis absorbers are in line with the hypothesis that the CNM and LNM clouds freeze out of the extended WNM phase.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Nature of Virgil: An Obscured AGN Lurking Within an Apparently Normal Lyman-{\alpha} Emitter During Cosmic Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the MIRI Extremely Red Object Virgil, a Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter at $z_{spec} = 6.6379 \pm 0.0035$ with the photometric properties of a Little Red Dot. Leveraging new JWST/MIRI imaging from the MIDIS and PAHSPECS programs, we confirm Virgil's extraordinary nature among galaxies in JADES/GOODS-South, exhibiting a strikingly red NIRCam-to-MIRI color (F444W $-$ F1500W = $2.84\pm0.04$ mag). Deep NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy from the OASIS program offers key insights into the host galaxy, revealing properties of an average star-forming galaxy during Cosmic Reionization, such as a subsolar metallicity, low-to-moderate dust content, and a relatively high ionization parameter and electron temperature. By estimating the star formation rate of Virgil from UV and H$\alpha$, we find evidence that the galaxy is either entering or fading out of a bursty episode. Although line-ratio diagnostics employed at high-$z$ would classify Virgil as an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), this classification becomes ambiguous once redshift evolution is considered. Nonetheless, Virgil occupies the same parameter space as recently confirmed AGNs at similar redshifts. The new deep MIRI data at 15 $\mu$m reinforce the AGN nature of Virgil, as inferred from multiple spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes. Virgil's rising infrared SED and UV excess resemble those of Dust-Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) studied with Spitzer at Cosmic Noon, particularly blue-excess HotDOGs. Our results highlight the need for a multi-wavelength approach incorporating MIRI to uncover such extreme sources at $z\gtrsim6$ and to shed light on the interplay between galaxy evolution and early black hole growth during Cosmic Reionization.</description>

      <title>The first Palomar Gattini-IR catalog of J-band light curves: construction and public data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Palomar Gattini-IR (PGIR) is a wide-field, synoptic infrared time domain survey covering $\approx 15000$\,sq.\,deg. of the \textbf{accessible} sky at $\approx 1-3$\,night cadence to a depth of $J\approx 13.0$ and $\approx 14.9$\,Vega mag in and outside the Galactic plane, respectively. Here, we present the first data release of $J$-band light curves of 2MASS sources within the survey footprint covering approximately the first four years of operations. We describe the construction of the source catalog based on 2MASS point sources, followed by exposure filtering criteria and forced PSF photometry. The catalog contains light curves of $\approx 286$\,million unique sources with 2MASS magnitudes of $J &lt; 15.5$\,mag, with a total of $\approx 50$\,billion photometric measurements and $\approx 20$\,billion individual source detections at signal-to-noise-ratio $&gt; 3$. We demonstrate the photometric fidelity of the catalog by i) quantifying the magnitude-dependent accuracy and uncertainty of the photometry with respect to 2MASS and ii) comparing against forced PGIR aperture photometry for known variable sources. We present simple filtering criteria for selecting reliable photometric measurements as well as example \texttt{Python} notebooks for users. This catalog is textbf{one of} the largest compilation of nightly cadence, synoptic infrared light curves to date, comparable to those in the largest optical surveys, providing a stepping stone to upcoming infrared surveys in the coming decade.</description>

Abstract: We consider Thomson-like processes between dark matter dark photons and free electrons in the Milky Way. The result is a radio signal background that can be detectable with current or future radio telescope arrays. In particular, we computed sensitivity prospects for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope and for the future Square Kilometer Array (SKA), concluding that unconstrained parameter space in a wide range of dark photon masses can be probed.</description>

      <title>Evaluating quenching in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation with spectral covariance in the optical window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations provide valuable insights on galaxy evolution when coupled with observational data. Comparisons with real galaxies are typically performed via scaling relations of the observables. Here we follow an alternative approach based on the spectral covariance in a model-independent way. We build upon previous work by Sharbaf et al. that studied the covariance of high quality SDSS continuum-subtracted spectra in a relatively narrow range of velocity dispersion ($\sigma\in [100,150]$\,km\,s$^{-1}$). Here the same analysis is applied to synthetic data from the EAGLE and Illustris TNG100 simulations, to assess the ability of these runs to mimic real galaxies. The real and simulated spectra are consistent regarding spectral covariance, although with subtle differences that can inform the implementation of subgrid physics. Spectral fitting done a posteriori on stacks segregated with respect to latent space reveals that the first principal component (PC1) is predominantly influenced by the stellar age distribution, with an underlying age-metallicity degeneracy. Good agreement is found regarding star formation prescriptions but there is disagreement with AGN feedback, that also affects the subset of quiescent galaxies. We show a substantial difference in the implementation of the AGN subgrid prescriptions, regarding central black hole seeding, that could lead to the mismatch. Differences are manifest between these two simulations in the star formation histories stacked with respect to latent space. We emphasise that this methodology only relies on the spectral covariance to assess whether simulations provide a true representation of galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Blue Loops, Cepheids, and Forays into Axions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The blue loop stage of intermediate mass stars has been called a "magnifying glass", where even seemingly small effects in prior stages of evolution, as well as assumptions about stellar composition, rotation, and convection, produce discernible changes. As such, blue loops, and especially the existence and properties of Cepheids, can serve as a laboratory where feebly connected Beyond Standard Model particles such as axions can be gainfully studied. We undertake a careful study of the effects of these putative particles on the blue loop, paying close attention to the evolution of the core potential and the hydrogen profile. Our simulations, performed with MESA, place bounds on the axion-photon coupling using the galactic Cepheid S Mus, with dynamically-determined mass of $6 M_\odot$, as a benchmark. The effects of varying convective overshoot on the core potential and hydrogen profile, and the ensuing changes in the axion constraints, are carefully studied. Along the way, we explore the "mirror principle" induced by the hydrogen burning shell and contrast our results with those existing in the literature. Less conservative (but more stringent) bounds on the axion-photon coupling are given for a $9 M_\odot$ model, which is the heaviest that can be simulated if overshoot is incorporated, and tentative projections are given for a $12 M_\odot$ model, which is approximately the heaviest tail of the mass distribution of galactic Cepheids determined by pulsation models using Gaia DR2. Our main message is that the reliable simulation and observation (ideally, through dynamical mass determination) of massive Cepheids constitutes an important frontier in axion searches, challenges in modeling uncertainties in the microphysics of the blue loop stage notwithstanding.</description>

      <title>The Three Hundred Project hydrodynamical simulations: Hydrodynamical weak-lensing cluster mass biases and richnesses using different hydro models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass of galaxy clusters estimated from weak-lensing observations is affected by projection effects, leading to a systematic underestimation compared to the true cluster mass, varying with both mass and redshift. The magnitude depends on the criteria used to select clusters and the spatial scale over which their mass is measured. We leverage hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters carried out with GadgetX and GIZMO-SIMBA as part of the Three Hundred project. We used them to quantify weak-lensing mass biases with respect also to the results from dark matter-only simulations. We also investigate how the biases propagate into the richness-mass relation. We aim to shed light on the effect of the presence of baryons on the weak-lensing mass bias and also whether this bias depends on the galaxy formation recipe; we seek to model the richness-mass relation that can be used as guidelines for observational experiments for cluster cosmology. We produced weak-lensing simulations of random projections to model the expected excess surface mass density profile of clusters up to redshift $z=1$. We then estimated the observed richness by counting the number of galaxies in a cylinder and correcting by projected contaminants. We derived the weak-lensing mass-richness relation and found consistency across hydrodynamical simulations. The intercept parameter of the relation is independent of redshift but varies with the minimum of the stellar mass to define the richness. At the same time, the slope is relatively constant up to $z=0.55$. The scatter in observed richness at a fixed weak-lensing mass increases linearly with redshift at a fixed stellar mass cut. As expected, we observed that the scatter in richness at a given true mass is smaller than at a given weak-lensing mass. Our results for the weak-lensing mass-richness relation align well with SDSS redMaPPer cluster analyses. [Abridged]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct linear analyses of convection in domains larger than the temperature scale height. We employ both analytical and numerical methods in these analyses. In the case excluding all dissipation, the typical time scale of convection is determined by the free fall time over the temperature scale height. We quantitatively show the condition for the Boussinesq and Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximations to be applicable. We provide a reassessment of the critical Rayleigh number, a key indicator of convection, and show that WKB approximation tends to underestimate the critical Rayleigh number, particularly when the temperature scale height is comparable to or smaller than the domain height. We show clear explanation why both thermal conduction and viscosity are required for stabilizing negative entropy gradient medium.</description>
