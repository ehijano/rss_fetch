      <title>Unveiling Patterns in European Airbnb Prices: A Comprehensive Analytical Study Using Machine Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the burgeoning market of short-term rentals, understanding pricing dynamics is crucial for a range of stake-holders. This study delves into the factors influencing Airbnb pricing in major European cities, employing a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle. We utilize advanced regression techniques, including linear, polynomial, and random forest models, to analyze a diverse array of determinants, such as location characteristics, property types, and host-related factors. Our findings reveal nuanced insights into the variables most significantly impacting pricing, highlighting the varying roles of geographical, structural, and host-specific attributes. This research not only sheds light on the complex pricing landscape of Airbnb accommodations in Europe but also offers valuable implications for hosts seeking to optimize pricing strategies and for travelers aiming to understand pricing trends. Furthermore, the study contributes to the broader discourse on pricing mechanisms in the shared economy, suggesting avenues for future research in this rapidly evolving sector.</description>

      <title>Decarbonization analysis on residential end uses in the emerging economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the historical emission patterns and decarbonization efforts of China and India, the largest emerging emitters in residential building operations. Using a novel carbon intensity model and structural decomposition approach, it assesses the operational decarbonization progress over the past two decades. Results show significant decarbonization, with China and India collectively reducing 1498.3 and 399.7 MtCO2, respectively. Electrification notably contributed to decarbonizing space cooling and appliances in both countries.</description>

      <title>Policy Changes and Growth Slowdown: Assessing the Lost Decade of the Latin American Miracle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Latin American region has suffered an economic slowdown since the end of the commodities boom. Within this context, Chile was the poster child of economic growth and development up until 2014. Since then, Chile has also been trapped in a decade of slow economic growth. Chile's sudden slowdown and recent growth path divergence have posed a puzzle for economic growth and development economics. This paper examines this slowdown from an empirical perspective and determines how much can be attributed to internal and external causes. Using a synthetic control approach and a structural time series Bayesian estimation, our findings suggest that at least two-thirds of the Chilean slowdown is attributable to internal causes driven by a policy regime change in 2014, with external factors playing a secondary role. The net effect of this set of internal reforms resulted in a nearly 10% reduction in real GDP per capita over five years and led to a 1.8% decline in average GDP growth rates from 2015 to 2019. Our results are consistent with the literature that establishes that external shocks can explain only a small fraction of the poor economic performance of developing countries, suggesting that internal factors are the primary source of subpar performance. This research sheds light on the potential effects of policy regime shifts in economic growth, thus providing valuable insights for development economics and, more specifically, emerging economies.</description>

      <title>In the Shadow of Smith`s Invisible Hand: Risks to Economic Stability and Social Wellbeing in the Age of Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Work is fundamental to societal prosperity and mental health, providing financial security, identity, purpose, and social integration. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has catalysed debate on job displacement. Some argue that many new jobs and industries will emerge to offset the displacement, while others foresee a widespread decoupling of economic productivity from human input threatening jobs on an unprecedented scale. This study explores the conditions under which both may be true and examines the potential for a self-reinforcing cycle of recessionary pressures that would necessitate sustained government intervention to maintain job security and economic stability. A system dynamics model was developed to undertake ex ante analysis of the effect of AI-capital deepening on labour underutilisation and demand in the economy. Results indicate that even a moderate increase in the AI-capital-to-labour ratio could increase labour underutilisation to double its current level, decrease per capita disposable income by 26% (95% interval, 20.6% - 31.8%), and decrease the consumption index by 21% (95% interval, 13.6% - 28.3%) by mid-2050. To prevent a reduction in per capita disposable income due to the estimated increase in underutilization, at least a 10.8-fold increase in the new job creation rate would be necessary. Results demonstrate the feasibility of an AI-capital- to-labour ratio threshold beyond which even high rates of new job creation cannot prevent declines in consumption. The precise threshold will vary across economies, emphasizing the urgent need for empirical research tailored to specific contexts. This study underscores the need for governments, civic organisations, and business to work together to ensure a smooth transition to an AI- dominated economy to safeguard the Mental Wealth of nations.</description>

      <title>Sequential Choices, Option Values, and the Returns to Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using detailed Norwegian data on earnings, education and work histories, we estimate a dynamic structural model of education and sector choices that captures rich life-cycle patterns by ability. We validate the model against variation in education choices induced by a compulsory schooling reform. Our approach allows us to estimate the ex-ante returns to different education tracks across the life-cycle by individual ability and quantify the contribution of option values. We find substantial heterogeneity in returns and establish crucial roles for option values and re-enrollment in determining education choices and the impact of schooling policies.</description>

      <title>A Better Test of Choice Overload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Choice overload - by which larger choice sets are detrimental to a chooser's wellbeing - is potentially of great importance to the design of economic policy. Yet the current evidence on its prevalence is inconclusive. We argue that existing tests are likely to be underpowered and hence that choice overload may occur more often than the literature suggests. We propose more powerful tests based on richer data and characterization theorems for the Random Utility Model. These new approaches come with significant econometric challenges, which we show how to address. We apply our tests to new experimental data and find strong evidence of choice overload that would likely be missed using current approaches.</description>

      <title>Shall We Team Up: Exploring Spontaneous Cooperation of Competing LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been utilized in social simulations, where they are often guided by carefully crafted instructions to stably exhibit human-like behaviors during simulations. Nevertheless, we doubt the necessity of shaping agents' behaviors for accurate social simulations. Instead, this paper emphasizes the importance of spontaneous phenomena, wherein agents deeply engage in contexts and make adaptive decisions without explicit directions. We explored spontaneous cooperation across three competitive scenarios and successfully simulated the gradual emergence of cooperation, findings that align closely with human behavioral data. This approach not only aids the computational social science community in bridging the gap between simulations and real-world dynamics but also offers the AI community a novel method to assess LLMs' capability of deliberate reasoning.</description>
