      <title>MATI: A GPU-Accelerated Toolbox for Microstructural Diffusion MRI Simulation and Data Fitting with a User-Friendly GUI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MATI (Microstructural Analysis Toolbox for Imaging) is a versatile MATLAB-based toolbox that combines both simulation and data fitting capabilities for microstructural dMRI research. It provides a user-friendly, GUI-driven interface that enables researchers, including those without programming experience, to perform advanced MRI simulations and data analyses. For simulation, MATI supports arbitrary microstructural modeled tissues and pulse sequences. For data fitting, MATI supports a range of fitting methods including traditional non-linear least squares, Bayesian approaches, machine learning, and dictionary matching methods, allowing users to tailor analyses based on specific research needs. Optimized with vectorized matrix operations and high-performance numerical libraries, MATI achieves high computational efficiency, enabling rapid simulations and data fitting on CPU and GPU hardware. While designed for microstructural dMRI, MATI's generalized framework can be extended to other imaging methods, making it a flexible and scalable tool for quantitative MRI research. By enhancing accessibility and efficiency, MATI offers a significant step toward translating advanced imaging techniques into clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Effect of the geometry of butt-joint implant-supported restorations on the fatigue life of prosthetic screws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statement of problem. Dental implant geometry affects the mechanical performance and fatigue behavior of butt-joint implant-supported restorations. However, failure of the implant component has been generally studied by ignoring the prosthetic screw, which is frequently the critical restoration component Purpose. Evaluate the effect of 3 main implant geometric parameters: the implant body diameter, the platform diameter, and the implant-abutment connection type (external versus internal butt-joint) on the fatigue life of the prosthetic screw. The experimental values were further compared with the theoretical ones obtained by using a previously published methodology M&amp;M. 4 different designs of direct-to-implant dental restorations from the manufacturer BTI were tested. Forty-eight fatigue tests were performed in an axial fatigue testing machine according to ISO 14801. Linear regression models, 95% interval confidence bands for the linear regression, and 95% prediction intervals of the fatigue load-life results were obtained and compared through an analysis of covariance to determine the influence of the 3 parameters under study on the fatigue behavior Results. Linear regression models showed a statistical difference when the implant body diameter was increased by 1 mm; an average 3.5-fold increase in fatigue life was observed. Increasing the implant abutment connection diameter by 1.4 mm also showed a significant difference, leading to 7-fold longer fatigue life on average. No significant statistical evidence was found to demonstrate a difference in fatigue life between internal and external connections Conclusions. Increasing the implant platform and body diameter significantly improved the fatigue life of the screw, whereas external and internal connections provided similar results. In addition, experimental results proved the accuracy of the fatigue life prediction methodology</description>
