      <title>Synchronization facilitated by frequency differences: Dynamics of coupled-oscillator systems with damaged elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the synchronization dynamics of coupled-oscillator systems in which some of the oscillators are damaged and lose their autonomous oscillations. The damaged elements are modeled using damped oscillators; thus, the system is composed of both limit-cycle oscillators and damped oscillators. In this system, as is commonly observed in conventional coupled limit-cycle oscillators, synchronization among oscillators is destroyed when the difference between the natural frequencies of the oscillators increases. However, in the presence of damped oscillators, synchronization can be facilitated by further increasing the frequency difference from the desynchronization state. We conduct numerical simulations on coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators and investigate this reentrance of synchronization systematically. We also propose an approximate theory to predict the stability of the synchronization state based on a linear stability analysis of the fixed point, which reveals the appearance of the Hopf modes. Using this theory, we argue that the reentrance of synchronization driven by increasing frequency differences can be observed in a wide range of coupled-oscillator systems with damaged elements.</description>

      <title>Topological transitions in swarmalators systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After its development, the swarmalators model attracted a great deal of attention since it was found to be very suitable to reproduce several behaviors in collective dynamics. However, few works explain the transitions that are observed while varying system parameters. In this letter, we demonstrate that the changes observed in swarmalator dynamics are governed by changes in the system's topology. To provide a deeper understanding of these changes, we present a topological framework for the swarmalator system and determine the topological charge $Q$ and the helicity $\gamma$ of the corresponding topology. Investigations on synchronization and transition to synchronization are studied using this topological charge and the variance of the helicity.</description>

      <title>Global stabilization and emergence tracking via aquatic control in an age-structured mosquito model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an age-structured, non-autonomous logistic model describing the aquatic and adult stages of the dynamics of malaria-vector mosquitoes. We propose a biological control strategy targeting the aquatic compartment and implement a tracking control for its emergence. A feedback control law guarantees stabilization of the emergent population density, specifically the global asymptotic stability of the logistic model. Additionally, a feedforward controller combined with feedback is introduced to steer the emergent density toward a time-varying reference trajectory. The analytical findings are corroborated and illustrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A Complex Topological Phase in C-Spin Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a new theoretical model for active matter ("complementary-spins" or c-spins), exploring the interplay of positional and orientational order in mobile agents with rotational freedom, divided into two populations with contrasting interactions. The system's behavior depends on its size and a control parameter (circular anisotropy) that splits the agents' natural rotational frequencies. Key findings include distinct phases based on anisotropy: Small Anisotropy: Stable, regular equilibrium patterns emerge. Moderate Anisotropy: Formation of complex, non-equilibrium topological point defects (vortex states), which are bistable with uniform patterns. These robust, self-repairing defects exhibit counter-rotating c-spin loop trains, spin-momentum locking, and dissipationless flow, classified by a two-valued topological charge. High Anisotropy: Transition to active turbulence and loss of order. Statistical analysis reveals a double phase transition at a critical value: a standard symmetry-breaking transition and a novel topological phase transition activating the vortex complexes. Increasing system size enhances organizational complexity and the development of spin-momentum locked transport networks. This model provides a new framework for understanding robustness and morphogenesis in living systems.</description>

      <title>Regime shifts and transformations in social-ecological systems: Advancing critical frontiers for safe and just futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current research challenges in sustainability science require us to consider nonlinear changes e.g. shifts that do not happen gradually but can be sudden and difficult to predict. Central questions are therefore how we can prevent harmful shifts, promote desirable ones, and better anticipate both. The regime shifts and transformations literature is well-equipped to address these questions. Yet, even though both research streams stem from the same intellectual roots, they have developed along different paths, with limited exchange between the two, missing opportunities for cross- fertilisation. We here review the definitions and history of both research streams to disentangle common grounds and differences. We propose avenues for future research and highlight how stronger integration of both research streams could support the development of more powerful approaches to help us navigate toward safe and just futures.</description>

      <title>An asymptotic stability proof and a port-Hamiltonian physics-informed neural network approach to chaotic synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study chaotic synchronization in a five-dimensional Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model augmented with electromagnetic induction and a switchable memristive autapse. For two diffusively coupled neurons, we derive the linearized error dynamics and prove global asymptotic stability of the synchronization manifold using a quadratic Lyapunov function. Verifiable sufficient conditions follow from Sylvester's criterion, and convergence is established using Barbalat's lemma. A Helmholtz decomposition splits the error field into conservative and dissipative parts, yielding a closed-form synchronization energy and its dissipation law, which quantify the energetic cost of synchrony. Numerical simulations confirm complete synchronization, monotone decay of the synchronization energy, and close agreement between Lyapunov and Hamiltonian diagnostics across parameter sweeps. Building on these results, we introduce a port-Hamiltonian physics-informed neural network that embeds the conservative/dissipative structure through tailored losses and structural priors. The learned Hamiltonian and energy-rate match analytical benchmarks, providing an energy-aware, data-driven template for modeling and control of nonlinear neuronal synchronization.</description>

      <title>Three Strongly Coupled Kerr Parametric Oscillators Forming a Boltzmann Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupled Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) are a promising resource for classical and quantum analog computation, for example to find the ground state of Ising Hamiltonians. Yet, the state space of strongly coupled KPO networks is very involved. As such, their phase diagram sometimes features either too few or too many states, including some that cannot be mapped to Ising spin configurations. This complexity makes it challenging to find and meet the conditions under which an analog optimization algorithm can be successful. Here, we demonstrate how to use three strongly coupled KPOs as a simulator for an Ising Hamiltonian, and estimate its ground state using a Boltzmann sampling measurement. While fully classical, our work is directly relevant for quantum systems operating on coherent states.</description>

      <title>Associative Memory and Generative Diffusion in the Zero-noise Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that generative diffusion processes converge to associative memory systems at vanishing noise levels and characterizes the stability, robustness, memorization, and generation dynamics of both model classes. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are shown to be universal approximators of associative memory models, with diffusion processes as their white-noise perturbations. The universal properties of associative memory that follow are used to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise diminishes. Structural stability of Morse-Smale flows -- that is, the robustness of their global critical point structure -- implies the stability of both trajectories and invariant measures for diffusions in the zero-noise limit. The learning and generation landscapes of these models appear as parameterized families of gradient flows and their stochastic perturbations, and the bifurcation theory for Morse-Smale systems implies that they are generically stable except at isolated parameter values, where enumerable sets of local and global bifurcations govern transitions between stable systems in parameter space. These landscapes are thus characterized by ordered bifurcation sequences that create, destroy, or alter connections between rest points and are robust under small stochastic or deterministic perturbations. The framework is agnostic to model formulation, which we verify with examples from energy-based models, denoising diffusion models, and classical and modern Hopfield networks. We additionally derive structural stability criteria for Hopfield-type networks and find that simple cases violate them. Collectively, our geometric approach provides insight into the classification, stability, and emergence of memory and generative landscapes.</description>

      <title>Finite Population Dynamics Resolve the Central Paradox of the Inspection Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Inspection Game is the canonical model for the strategic conflict between law enforcement (inspectors) and citizens (potential criminals). Its classical Mixed-Strategy Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) is afflicted by a paradox: the equilibrium crime rate is independent of both the penalty size ($p$) and the crime gain ($g$), undermining the efficacy of deterrence policy. We re-examine this challenge using evolutionary game theory, focusing on the long-term fixation probabilities of strategies in finite, asymmetric population sizes subject to demographic noise. The deterministic limit of our model exhibits stable limit cycles around the MSNE, which coincides with the neutral fixed point of the equilibrium analysis. Crucially, in finite populations, demographic noise drives the system away from this cycle and toward absorbing states. Our results demonstrate that high absolute penalties $p$ are highly effective at suppressing crime by influencing the geometry of the deterministic dynamics, which in turn biases the fixation probability toward the criminal extinction absorbing state, thereby restoring the intuitive role of $p$. Furthermore, we reveal a U-shaped policy landscape where both high penalties and light penalties (where $p \approx g$) are successful suppressors, maximizing criminal risk at intermediate penalty levels. Most critically, we analyze the realistic asymptotic limit of extreme population sizes asymmetry, where inspectors are exceedingly rare. In this limit, the system's dynamic outcome is entirely decoupled from the citizen payoff parameters $p$ and $g$, and is instead determined by the initial frequency of crime relative to the deterrence threshold (the ratio of inspection cost to reward for catching a criminal). This highlights that effective crime suppression requires managing the interaction between deterministic dynamics, demographic noise, and initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Regret, Uncertainty, and Bounded Rationality in Norm-Driven Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces an agent-based model to study how regret, uncertainty, and social norms interact to shape vaccination behavior during epidemics. The model integrates three behavioral mechanisms, anticipated regret, evolving norms, and uncertainty-dependent trust, within a unified learning framework. Grounded in psychology and behavioral economics, it captures how individuals make probabilistic choices influenced by material payoffs, fear, trust, and social approval. Simulations of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered process show that collective outcomes are best when agents display an intermediate level of rationality; they deliberate enough to respond to risk but remain flexible enough to adapt, avoiding the instability of both random and overly rigid decision-making. Regret exerts a dual influence; moderate levels encourage adaptive self-correction, while excessive regret or greed destabilize choices. Uncertainty has a similarly non-linear effect; moderate ambiguity promotes caution, but too much uncertainty disrupts coordination. Social norms restore cooperation by compensating for incomplete information. Personal norms guide behavior when individuals have reliable information and feel confident in their judgments. Injunctive norms-signals of others' approval-become more influential under uncertainty, while descriptive norms, which arise from observing others' actions, provide informational cues that help people decide what to do when direct knowledge is limited. Overall, the model provides a psychologically grounded, computationally explicit account of how emotion, cognition, and social norms govern preventive behavior during epidemics.</description>
