      <title>Proceedings 13th International Workshop on Developments in Computational Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This volume contains the proceedings of DCM 2023, the 13th International Workshop on Developments in Computational Models held on 2 July 2023 in Rome, Italy. DCM 2023 was organised as a one-day satellite event of FSCD 2023, the 8th International Conference on Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers who are currently developing new computation models or new features for traditional computation models, in order to foster their interaction, to provide a forum for presenting new ideas and work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn about current activities in this area.</description>

      <title>Active learning of digenic functions with boolean matrix logic programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply logic-based machine learning techniques to facilitate cellular engineering and drive biological discovery, based on comprehensive databases of metabolic processes called genome-scale metabolic network models (GEMs). Predicted host behaviours are not always correctly described by GEMs. Learning the intricate genetic interactions within GEMs presents computational and empirical challenges. To address these, we describe a novel approach called Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP) by leveraging boolean matrices to evaluate large logic programs. We introduce a new system, $BMLP_{active}$, which efficiently explores the genomic hypothesis space by guiding informative experimentation through active learning. In contrast to sub-symbolic methods, $BMLP_{active}$ encodes a state-of-the-art GEM of a widely accepted bacterial host in an interpretable and logical representation using datalog logic programs. Notably, $BMLP_{active}$ can successfully learn the interaction between a gene pair with fewer training examples than random experimentation, overcoming the increase in experimental design space. $BMLP_{active}$ enables rapid optimisation of metabolic models and offers a realistic approach to a self-driving lab for microbial engineering.</description>
