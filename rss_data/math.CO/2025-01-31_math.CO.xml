      <title>An exact closed walks series formula for the complexity of regular graphs and some related bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of a graph is the number of its labeled spanning trees. In this work complexity is studied in settings that admit regular graphs. An exact formula is established linking complexity of the complement of a regular graph to numbers of closed walks in the graph by way of an infinite alternating series. Some consequences of this result yield infinite classes of lower and upper bounds on the complexity of such graphs. Applications of these mathematical results to biological problems on neuronal activity are described.</description>

      <title>Kohnert posets and polynomials of northeast diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kohnert polynomials and their associated posets are combinatorial objects with deep geometric and representation theoretic connections, generalizing both Schubert polynomials and type A Demazure characters. In this paper, we explore the properties of Kohnert polynomials and their posets indexed by northeast diagrams. We give separate classifications of the bounded, ranked, and multiplicity-free Kohnert posets for northeast diagrams, each of which can be computed in polynomial time with respect to the number of cells in the diagram. As an initial application, we specialize these classifications to simple criteria in the case of lock diagrams.</description>

      <title>Convolution numbers: the cyclic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolution sums are introduced and special instances of the cyclic convolution on finite sets is examined in more detail. The distributions that emerge are multidimensional generalizations of the Catalan and Narayana numbers. This work yields a closed form solution for 1-dimensional marginals and certain bivariate marginals in the cyclic prime case. It is explained how a sufficiently high resolution of understanding these multidimensional distributions yields an approach to attack the Hadamard matrix conjecture.</description>

      <title>Cointeraction on noncrossing partitions and related polynomial invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure of bialgebras in cointeraction on noncrossing partitions appearing in the theory of free probability. Its first coproduct is given by separation of the blocks of the partitions into two parts, with respect to the nestings, while the second one is given by fusion of blocks. This structure implies the existence of a unique polynomial invariant respecting the product and both coproducts:we give a combinatorial interpretation of this polynomial invariant, study its values at -1 and use it for the computation of the antipode. We also give several results on its coefficients, in the simplest case where the considered noncrossing partitions have no nesting. This leads to unexpected links with harmonic nested sums, Riordan arrays and generalized Stirling numbers. This polynomial invariant is related to other ones, counting increasing or strictly increasing maps for the nesting order on noncrossing partitions, through the action of several characters.</description>

      <title>On 3-isoregularity of multicirculants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is said to be $k$-{\em isoregular} if any two vertex subsets of cardinality at most $k$, that induce subgraphs of the same isomorphism type, have the same number of neighbors. It is shown that no $3$-isoregular bicirculant (and more generally, no locally $3$-isoregular bicirculant) of order twice an odd number exists. Further, partial results for bicirculants of order twice an even number as well as tricirculants of specific orders, are also obtained. Since $3$-isoregular graphs are necessarily strongly regular, the above result about bicirculants, among other, brings us a step closer to obtaining a direct proof of a classical consequence of the Classification of Finite Simple Groups that no simply primitive group of degree twice a prime exists for primes greater than $5$.</description>

      <title>Triangle-free $d$-degenerate graphs have small fractional chromatic number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known conjecture by Harris states that any triangle-free $d$-degenerate graph has fractional chromatic number at most $O\left(\frac{d}{\ln d}\right)$. This conjecture has gained much attention in recent years, and is known to have many interesting implications, including a conjecture by Esperet, Kang and Thomass\'e that any triangle-free graph with minimum degree $d$ contains a bipartite induced subgraph of minimum degree $\Omega(\log d)$. Despite this attention, Harris' conjecture has remained wide open with no known improvement on the trivial upper bound, until now.
  In this article, we give an elegant proof of Harris' conjecture. In particular, we show that any triangle-free $d$-degenerate graph has fractional chromatic number at most $(4+o(1))\frac{d}{\ln d}.$ The conjecture of Esperet et al. follows as a direct consequence. We also prove a more general result, showing that for any triangle-free graph $G$, there exists a random independent set in which each vertex $v$ is included with probability $\Omega(p(v))$, where $p:V(G)\rightarrow [0,1]$ is any function that satisfies a natural condition.</description>

      <title>On the minimum cut-sets of the power graph of a finite cyclic group, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power graph $\mathcal{P}(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is the simple graph with vertex set $G$ and two distinct vertices are adjacent if one of them is a power of the other. Let $n=p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}\cdots p_r^{n_r},$ where $p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_r$ are primes with $p_1&lt;p_2&lt;\cdots &lt;p_r$ and $n_1,n_2,\ldots, n_r$ are positive integers. For the cyclic group $C_n$ of order $n$, the minimum cut-sets of $\mathcal{P}(C_n)$ are characterized in \cite{cps} for $r\leq 3$. Recently, in \cite{MPS}, certain cut-sets of $\mathcal{P}(C_n)$ are identified such that any minimum cut-set of $\mathcal{P}(C_n)$ must be one of them. In this paper, for $r\geq 4$, we explicitly determine the minimum cut-sets, in particular, the vertex connectivity of $\mathcal{P}(C_n)$ when: (i) $n_r\geq 2$, (ii) $r=4$ and $n_r=1$, and (iii) $r=5$, $n_r=1$, $p_1\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Cayley graphs on elementary abelian groups of extreme degree have complete cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and \v{S}\'{a}mal asked whether every cubelike graph has a cubelike core. Man\v{c}inska, Pivotto, Roberson and Royle answered this question in the affirmative for cubelike graphs whose core has at most $32$ vertices. When the core of a cubelike graph has at most $16$ vertices, they gave a list of these cores, from which it follows that every cubelike graph with degree strictly less than $5$ has a complete core. We prove the following extension: if the degree of a cubelike graph is either strictly less than $5$ or at least $5$ less than the number of its vertices, then its core is complete and induced by a $\mathbb{F}_2$-vector subspace of its vertices. Thus we also answer Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and \v{S}\'{a}mal's question in the affirmative for cubelike graphs with degree at least $5$ less than the number of vertices. Our result is sharp as the $5$-regular folded $5$-cube and its graph complement are both non-complete cubelike graph cores. We also prove analogous results for Cayley graphs on elementary abelian $p$-groups for odd primes $p$.</description>

Abstract: Dirac and Motzkin conjectured that any set X of $n$ non-collinear points in the plane has an element incident with at least $\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$ lines spanned by X. In this paper we prove that any set X of $n$ non-collinear points in the plane, distributed on three lines passing through a common point, has an element incident with at least $\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$ lines spanned by X.</description>

      <title>Character factorisations, $z$-asymmetric partitions and plethysm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Verschiebung operators $\varphi_t $ are a family of endomorphisms on the ring of symmetric functions, one for each integer $t\geq2$. Their action on the Schur basis has its origins in work of Littlewood and Richardson, and is intimately related with the decomposition of a partition into its $t$-core and $t$-quotient. Namely, they showed that the action on $s_\lambda$ is zero if the $t$-core of the indexing partition is nonempty, and otherwise it factors as a product of Schur functions indexed by the $t$-quotient. Much more recently, Lecouvey and, independently, Ayyer and Kumari have provided similar formulae for the characters of the symplectic and orthogonal groups, where again the combinatorics of cores and quotients plays a fundamental role. We embed all of these character factorisations in an infinite family involving an integer $z$ and parameter $q$ using a very general symmetric function defined by Hamel and King. The proof hinges on a new characterisation of the $t$-cores and $t$-quotients of $z$-asymmetric partitions which generalise the well-known classifications for self-conjugate and doubled distinct partitions. We also explain the connection between these results, plethysms of symmetric functions and characters of the symmetric group.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every tree of maximum degree $\Delta$ with $\ell$ leaves contains paths between leaves of at least $\log_{\Delta-1}((\Delta-2)\ell)$ distinct lengths. This settles in a strong form a conjecture of Narins, Pokrovskiy and Szab\'o. We also make progress towards another conjecture of the same authors, by proving that every tree with no vertex of degree 2 and diameter at least $N$ contains $N^{2/3}/6$ distinct leaf-to-leaf path lengths between $0$ and $N$.</description>

Abstract: Infinitary Combinatorics shows interesting contrasts, with many similarities but also several important differences with its finite analog. The purpose of this paper is to present some concrete examples, both of similarities and of radical differences, in order to provide some intuition about the behaviour of infinity in the combinatorial setting. Our examples are taken from the branch of mathematics known as Graph Theory.

Abstract: We study the geometry of convex lattice $n$-gons with $n$ boundary lattice points and $k\geq 3$ collinear interior lattice points. We describe a process to construct a primitive lattice triangle from an edge of a convex lattice $n$-gon, hence adding one edge in a way so that the number of boundary points increases by $1$, while the number of interior points remains unchanged. We also present the necessary conditions to construct such a primitive lattice triangle, as well as an upper bound for the number of times this is possible. Finally, we apply the previous results to fully classify the positive integers for which there exists a convex $n$-gon with $k$ collinear and non-collinear interior points.</description>

Abstract: By studying lattices of normal subgroups, especially those of the socle and radical, an expression is obtained for the minimal number of conjugacy classes required to generate a group. This number is shown to be captured by the character table. The Moebius function is then used to extract information on the faithful irreducible representations of a group.</description>

Abstract: In a quest to thoroughly understand the first-order transduction hierarchy of hereditary graph classes, some questions in particular stand out; such as, what properties hold for graph classes that are first-order transductions of planar graphs (and of similar classes)? When addressing this (so-far wide open) question, we turn to the concept of a product structure - being a subgraph of the strong product of a path and a graph of bounded tree-width, introduced by Dujmovic et al. [JACM 2020]. Namely, we prove that any graph class which is a first-order transduction of a class admitting such product structure, up to perturbations also meets a structural description generalizing the concept of a product structure in a dense hereditary way - the latter concept being introduced just recently by Hlineny and Jedelsky under the name of H-clique-width [MFCS 2024]. Using this characterization, we show that the class of the 3D grids, as well as a class of certain modifications of 2D grids, are not first-order transducible from classes admitting a product structure, and in particular not from the class of planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Four bases for the Onsager Lie algebra related by a $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Onsager Lie algebra $O$ is an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra defined by generators $A$, $B$ and relations $[A, [A, [A, B]]] = 4[A, B]$ and $[B, [B, [B, A]]] = 4[B, A]$. Using an embedding of $O$ into the tetrahedron Lie algebra $\boxtimes$, we obtain four direct sum decompositions of the vector space $O$, each consisting of three summands. As we will show, there is a natural action of $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ on these decompositions. For each decomposition, we provide a basis for each summand. Moreover, we describe the Lie bracket action on these bases and show how they are recursively constructed from the generators $A$, $B$ of $O$. Finally, we discuss the action of $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ on these bases and determine some transition matrices among the bases.</description>

Abstract: We give a classification for the irreducible $\mathfrak{u}$-diagonalizable representations of the degenerate affine Hecke algebra of type $G(\ell,1,n)$. Precisely we show that such $H_{\ell,n}$-modules are indexed by $\ell$-skew shapes and that the representation indexed by a skew shape $D$ has a basis of eigenvectors indexed by standard Young tableaux of shape $D$.</description>

      <title>Neural Discovery in Mathematics: Do Machines Dream of Colored Planes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how neural networks can drive mathematical discovery through a case study of the Hadwiger-Nelson problem, a long-standing open problem from discrete geometry and combinatorics about coloring the plane avoiding monochromatic unit-distance pairs. Using neural networks as approximators, we reformulate this mixed discrete-continuous geometric coloring problem as an optimization task with a probabilistic, differentiable loss function. This enables gradient-based exploration of admissible configurations that most significantly led to the discovery of two novel six-colorings, providing the first improvements in thirty years to the off-diagonal variant of the original problem (Mundinger et al., 2024a). Here, we establish the underlying machine learning approach used to obtain these results and demonstrate its broader applicability through additional results and numerical insights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove oscillation stability for the Banach space $\ell_\infty$: every weak-* Borel, uniformily continuous map from the unit sphere of this space to a compact metric space can be made arbitrarily close to a constant map when restricted to the unit sphere of a suitable linear isometric subcopy of $\ell_\infty$. We also give a new proof of oscillation stability for the Urysohn sphere (a result by Nguyen Van Th\'e--Sauer): every uniformily continuous map from the Urysohn sphere to a compact metric space can be made arbitrarily close to a constant map when restricted to a suitable isometric subcopy of the Urysohn sphere. Both proofs are based on Carlson-Simpson's dual Ramsey theorem.</description>

Abstract: For graphs $G$ and $H$, we consider Ramsey numbers $r(G,H)$ with tight lower bounds, namely, $r(G,H) \geq (\chi(G)-1)(|H|-1)+1,$ where $\chi(G)$ denotes the chromatic number of $G$ and $|H|$ denotes the number of vertices in $H$. We say $H$ is $G$-good if the equality holds.
  Let $G+H$ be the join graph obtained from graphs $G$ and $H$ by adding all edges between the disjoint vertex sets of $G$ and $H$. Let $nH$ denote the union graph of $n$ disjoint copies of $H$. We show that $K_1+nH$ is $K_p$-good if $n$ is sufficiently large. In particular, the fan-graph $F_n=K_1 + n K_2$ is $K_p$-good if $n\geq 27p^2$, improving previous tower-type lower bounds for $n$ due to Li and Rousseau (1996). Moreover, we give a stronger lower bound inequality for Ramsey number $r(G, K_1+F)$ for the case of $G=K_p(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_p)$, the complete $p$-partite graph with $a_1=1$ and $a_i \leq a_{i+1}$. In particular, using a stability-supersaturation lemma by Fox, He and Wigderson (2021), we show that for any fixed graph $H$, \begin{align*} r(G,K_1+nH) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} (p-1)(n |H|+a_2-1)+1 &amp; \textrm{if $n|H|+a_2-1$ is even or $a_2-1$ is even,}\\ (p-1)(n |H|+a_2-2)+1 &amp; \textrm{otherwise,} \end{array}
  \right. \end{align*} where $G=K_p(1,a_2, \dots, a_p)$ with $a_i$'s satisfying some mild conditions and $n$ is sufficiently large. The special case of $H=K_1$ gives an answer to Burr's question (1981) about the discrepancy of $r(G, K_{1,n})$ from $G$-goodness for sufficiently large $n$. All bounds of $n$ we obtain are not of tower-types.</description>

Abstract: Newton's identities provide a way to express elementary symmetric polynomials in terms of power polynomials over fields of characteristic zero. In this article, we study the failure of this relation in positive characteristic and what can be recovered. In particular, we show how one can write the elementary symmetric polynomials as rational functions in the power polynomials over any commutative unital ring.</description>

      <title>Edge Addition and the Change in Kemeny's Constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a connected graph $G$, Kemeny's constant $\mathcal{K}({G})$ measures the average travel time for a random walk to reach a randomly selected vertex. It is known that when an edge is added to $G$, the value of Kemeny's constant may either decrease, increase, or stay the same. In this paper, we present a quantitative analysis of this behaviour when the initial graph is a tree with $n$ vertices. We prove that when an edge is added into a tree on $n$ vertices, the maximum possible increase in Kemeny's constant is roughly $\frac{2}{3}n,$ while the maximum possible decrease is roughly $\frac{3}{16}n^2$. We also identify the trees, and the edges to be added, that correspond to the maximum increase and maximum decrease. Throughout, both matrix theoretic and graph theoretic techniques are employed.</description>

      <title>A classification of $1$-homogeneous distance-regular graphs with positive intersection number $a_1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a graph with diameter at least two. Then $\Gamma$ is said to be $1$-homogeneous (in the sense of Nomura) whenever for every pair of adjacent vertices $x$ and $y$ in $\Gamma$, the distance partition of the vertex set of $\Gamma$ with respect to both $x$ and $y$ is equitable, and the parameters corresponding to equitable partitions are independent of the choice of $x$ and $y$. Assume that $\Gamma$ is $1$-homogeneous distance-regular with intersection number $a_1&gt;0$ and diameter $D\geqslant 5$. Define $b=b_1/(\theta_1+1)$, where $b_1$ is the intersection number and $\theta_1$ is the second largest eigenvalue of $\Gamma$. We show that if intersection number $c_2$ is at least $2$, then $b\geqslant 1$ and one of the following (i)--(vi) holds: (i) $\Gamma$ is a regular near $2D$-gon, (ii) $\Gamma$ is a Johnson graph $J(2D,D)$, (iii) $\Gamma$ is a halved $\ell$-cube with $\ell \in \{2D,2D+1\}$, (iv) $\Gamma$ is a folded Johnson graph $\bar{J}(4D,2D)$, (v) $\Gamma$ is a folded halved $(4D)$-cube, (vi) the valency of $\Gamma$ is bounded by a function of $b$. Using this result, we characterize $1$-homogeneous graphs with classical parameters and $a_1&gt;0$, as well as tight distance-regular graphs.</description>

Abstract: Generalizing both Dirac's condition and Ore's condition for Hamilton cycles, Chvatal in 1972 established a degree sequence condition for the existence of a Hamilton cycle in a graph. Hoang in 1995 generalized Chvatal's degree sequence condition for 1-tough graphs and conjectured a t-tough analogue for any positive integer t at least 1. Hoang in the same paper verified his conjecture for t at most 3 and recently Hoang and Robin arXiv:2303.03479v2 verified the conjecture for t = 4. In this paper, we confirm the conjecture for all t at least 4.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hoffman's bound is a well-known spectral bound on the chromatic number of a graph, known to be tight for instance for bipartite graphs. While Hoffman colorings (colorings attaining the bound) were studied before for regular graphs, for general graphs not much is known. We investigate tightness of the Hoffman bound, with a particular focus on irregular graphs, obtaining several results on the graph structure of Hoffman colorings. In particular, we prove a Decomposition Theorem, which characterizes the structure of Hoffman colorings, and we use it to completely classify Hoffman colorability of cone graphs and line graphs. We also prove a partial converse, the Composition Theorem, leading to an algorithm for computing all connected Hoffman colorable graphs for some given number of vertices and colors. Since several graph coloring parameters are known to be sandwiched between the Hoffman bound and the chromatic number, as a byproduct of our results, we obtain the values of these chromatic parameters.</description>

Abstract: We analyze a combinatorial rule satisfied by the signs of principal minors of a real symmetric matrix. The sign patterns satisfying this rule are equivalent to uniform oriented Lagrangian matroids. We first discuss their structure and symmetries and then study their asymptotics, proving that almost all of them are not representable by real symmetric matrices. We offer several conjectures and experimental results concerning representable sign patterns and the topology of their representation spaces.</description>

      <title>On Geometry and Combinatorics of Finite Classical Polar Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polar spaces over finite fields are fundamental in combinatorial geometry. The concept of polar space was firstly introduced by F. Veldkamp who gave a system of 10 axioms in the spirit of Universal Algebra. Later the axioms were simplified by J. Tits, who introduced the concept of subspaces. Later on, from the point of view of incidence geometry, axioms of polar spaces were also given by F. Buekenhout and E. Shult in 1974. The reader can find the three systems of axioms of polar spaces in Appendix A. Examples of polar spaces are the so called Finite classical polar spaces, i.e. incidence structures arising from quadrics, symplectic forms and Hermitian forms, which are in correspondance with reflexive sesquilinear forms. It is still an open problem to show whether or not classical polar spaces are the only example of finite polar spaces.
  Nowadays, some research problems related to finite classical polar space are: existence of spreads and ovoids; existence of regular systems and $m$-ovoids; upper or lower bounds on partial spreads and partial ovoids. Moreover, polar spaces are in relation with combinatorial objects as regular graphs, block designs and association schemes.
  In this Ph.D. Thesis we investigate the geometry of finite classical polar spaces, giving contributions to the above problems. The thesis is organized as follows. Part I is more focused on the geometric aspects of polar spaces, while in Part II some combinatorial objects are introduced such as regular graphs, association schemes and combinatorial designs. Finally Appendix B, C and D are dedicated to give more details on, respectively, maximal curves, linear codes and combinatorial designs, giving useful results and definitions.</description>

Abstract: We study a game in which one keeps flipping a coin until a given finite string of heads and tails occurs. We find the expected number of coin flips to end the game when the ending string consists of at most four maximal runs of heads or tails or alternates between heads and tails. This leads to some summation identities involving certain generalizations of the Fibonacci numbers.</description>

      <title>A survey of the monotonicity and non-contradiction of consensus methods and supertree methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.04502v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent study, Bryant, Francis and Steel investigated the concept of \enquote{future-proofing} consensus methods in phylogenetics. That is, they investigated if such methods can be robust against the introduction of additional data like added trees or new species. In the present manuscript, we analyze consensus methods under a different aspect of introducing new data, namely concerning the discovery of new clades. In evolutionary biology, often formerly unresolved clades get resolved by refined reconstruction methods or new genetic data analyses. In our manuscript we investigate which properties of consensus methods can guarantee that such new insights do not disagree with previously found consensus trees, but merely refine them, a property termed \emph{monotonicity}. Along the lines of analyzing monotonicity, we also study two {established} supertree methods, namely Matrix Representation with Parsimony (MRP) and Matrix Representation with Compatibility (MRC), which have also been suggested as consensus methods in the literature. While we (just like Bryant, Francis and Steel in their recent study) unfortunately have to conclude some negative answers concerning general consensus methods, we also state some relevant and positive results concerning the majority rule ($\mathtt{MR}$) and strict consensus methods, which are amongst the most frequently used consensus methods. Moreover, we show that there exist infinitely many consensus methods which are monotonic and have some other desirable properties.

      <title>Fairness in Social Influence Maximization via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17736v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study fairness in social influence maximization, whereby one seeks to select seeds that spread a given information throughout a network, ensuring balanced outreach among different communities (e.g. demographic groups). In the literature, fairness is often quantified in terms of the expected outreach within individual communities. In this paper, we demonstrate that such fairness metrics can be misleading since they overlook the stochastic nature of information diffusion processes. When information diffusion occurs in a probabilistic manner, multiple outreach scenarios can occur. As such, outcomes such as ``In 50% of the cases, no one in group 1 gets the information, while everyone in group 2 does, and in the other 50%, it is the opposite'', which always results in largely unfair outcomes, are classified as fair by a variety of fairness metrics in the literature. We tackle this problem by designing a new fairness metric, mutual fairness, that captures variability in outreach through optimal transport theory. We propose a new seed-selection algorithm that optimizes both outreach and mutual fairness, and we show its efficacy on several real datasets. We find that our algorithm increases fairness with only a minor decrease (and at times, even an increase) in efficiency.</description>

      <title>Seminorm estimates and joint ergodicity for pairwise independent Hardy sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a robust structure theory for multiple ergodic averages of commuting transformations along Hardy sequences of polynomial growth. We then apply it to derive a number of novel results on joint ergodicity, recurrence and convergence. In particular, we prove joint ergodicity for (a) pairwise independent Hardy sequences and weakly mixing transformations, (b) strongly independent Hardy sequences and ergodic transformations, (c) strongly irrationally independent Hardy sequences and totally ergodic transformations.
  We use these joint ergodicity results to provide new recurrence results for multidimensional patterns along strongly independent Hardy sequences, showing for instance that all subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ of positive upper density contain patterns
  \[ (m_1, m_2),\; (m_1 + \lfloor{n^{3/2}}\rfloor, m_2),\; (m_1, m_2 + \lfloor{n^{3/2} + n^{1/2}}\rfloor).\]
  Last but not least, we positively resolve the joint ergodicity classification problem for pairwise independent Hardy sequences, of which the aforementioned families are special cases.
  While building on recent technical advances (e.g. PET coefficient tracking schemes and joint ergodicity criteria), our work introduces a number of technical developments of its own. We construct a suitable generalization of Host-Kra and box seminorms that quantitatively control ergodic averages along Hardy sequences. We subsequently use them to obtain Host-Kra seminorm estimates for averages along all pairwise independent Hardy sequences. Furthermore, we develop an ergodic version of the quantitative concatenation argument that has recently found extensive use in combinatorics, number theory and harmonic analysis. Lastly, we improve simultaneous Taylor approximations for Hardy sequences.</description>

      <title>Construction, Transformation and Structures of 2x2 Space-Filling Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16962v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2x2 space-filling curve is a type of generalized space-filling curve characterized by a basic unit is in a "U-shape" that traverses a 2x2 grid. In this work, we propose a universal framework for constructing general 2x2 curves where self-similarity is not strictly required. The construction is based on a novel set of grammars that define the expansion of curves from level 0 (a single point) to level 1 (units in U-shapes), which ultimately determines all $36 \times 2^k$ possible forms of curves on any level $k$ initialized from single points. We further developed an encoding system in which each unique form of the curve is associated with a specific combination of an initial seed and a sequence of codes that sufficiently describes both the global and local structures of the curve. We demonstrated that this encoding system is a powerful tool for studying 2x2 curves and we established comprehensive theoretical foundations from the following three key perspectives: 1) We provided a deterministic encoding for any unit on any level and position on the curve, enabling the study of curve generation across arbitrary parts on the curve and ranges of iterations; 2) We gave deterministic encodings for various curve transformations, including rotations, reflections and reversals; 3) We provided deterministic forms of families of curves exhibiting specific structures, including homogeneous curves, curves with identical shapes, partially identical shapes, and with completely distinct shapes. We also explored families of recursive curves, subunit identically or differently shaped curves, completely non-recursive curves, symmetric curves and closed curves. Finally, we proposed a method to calculate the location of any point on the curve arithmetically, within a time complexity linear to the level of the curve.</description>
