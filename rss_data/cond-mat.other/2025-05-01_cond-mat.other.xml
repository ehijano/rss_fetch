      <title>Comment on 'Anomalies in the Electronic Stopping of Slow Antiprotons in LiF', arXiv:2501.14381</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work contains detailed discussions on the contents of Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 076401 (2025), in the following denoted PRL134. In this comment, we revisit and elaborate on the Adiabatic Ionization Model (AIM) for the energy loss of antiparticles in matter, with particular reference to its theoretical foundation as established previously. The AIM framework plays a central role in describing the ionization dynamics in the low-velocity regime considered by the authors of PRL134. Calculated AIM results for the energy loss of antiprotons in LiF crystals are compared to experimental data and different other models, pointing to severe problems of the PRL134 results.
  Beyond this specific comparative theoretical investigation, we critically examine several statements and assumptions made in PRL134. Certain claims presented therein appear to be inconsistent with established theoretical principles or are insufficiently justified by the data and arguments provided. As such, we believe that further clarification, and in some cases, a more rigorous justification, is necessary to substantiate those points.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of State Spaces into Subobjects in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive formalism for decomposing the state space of a quantum field into several entangled subobjects, i.e., fields generating a subspace of states. Projecting some of the subobjects onto degenerate background states reduces the system to an effective field theory depending on parameters representing the degeneracies. Notably, these parameters are not exogenous. The entanglement among subobjects in the initial system manifests as an interrelation between parameters and non-projected subobjects. Untangling this dependency necessitates imposing linear first-order equations on the effective field. The geometric characteristics of the parameter spaces depend on both the effective field and the background of the projected subobjects. The system, governed by arbitrary variables, has no dynamics, but the projection of some subobjects can be interpreted as slicing the original state space according to the lowest eigenvalues of a parameter-dependent family of operators. The slices can be endowed with amplitudes similar to some transitions between each other, contingent upon these eigenvalues. Averaging over all possible transitions shows that the amplitudes are higher for maps with increased eigenvalue than for maps with decreasing eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Neural Galerkin Method for Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a classical computational method for quantum dynamics that relies on a global-in-time variational principle. Unlike conventional time-stepping approaches, our scheme computes the entire state trajectory over a finite time window by minimizing a loss function that enforces the Schr\"odinger's equation. The variational state is parametrized with a Galerkin-inspired ansatz based on a time-dependent linear combination of time-independent Neural Quantum States. This structure is particularly well-suited for exploring long-time dynamics and enables bounding the error with the exact evolution via the global loss function. We showcase the method by simulating global quantum quenches in the paradigmatic Transverse-Field Ising model in both 1D and 2D, uncovering signatures of ergodicity breaking and absence of thermalization in two dimensions. Overall, our method is competitive compared to state-of-the-art time-dependent variational approaches, while unlocking previously inaccessible dynamical regimes of strongly interacting quantum systems.</description>
