      <title>A cluster criterion for potential degeneracy of superelliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field with a discrete valuation; let $p$ be a prime; and let $C$ be the curve defined by an equation of the form $y^p = f(x)$. We show that the curve $C$ has a model over an algebraic extension of $K$ whose special fiber consists of genus-$0$ components and has at worst nodal singularities if and only if the cluster data of the roots of $f$ satisfies a certain criterion, and when these hold, we show explicitly how to build the minimal regular model of $C$. We develop an interpretation of cluster data in terms of a convex hull in the Berkovich projective line and express the above results directly in terms of this convex hull.</description>

      <title>Isomorphisms and automorphisms of multiprojective bundles and symmetric powers of projective bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe when two multiprojective bundles (fibre products of projective bundles over the same base) over projective spaces are isomorphic as abstract varieties. We also describe when two relative symmetric powers of projective bundles over projective spaces are isomorphic. Finally, we describe the automorphisms of multiprojective bundles and relative symmetric powers of projective bundles over projective spaces.</description>

      <title>F4 and desmic quartic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The desmic pencil of quartic surfaces is part of a beautiful, but mostly forgotten chapter of the classical theory of algebraic surfaces: it is the only non-degenerate pencil of surfaces in P3 containing at least three completely reducible members. We observe in this note that it is closely related to the Weyl group of the root system F4, and can be recovered from a series of symmetric spaces deduced from the exceptional Lie algebras. We discuss the main properties of the pencil from this Lie theoretic point of view.</description>

Abstract: We survey over some recent applications of motivic homotopy theory in the definition and the study of $p$-adic cohomology theories. In particular, we revisit the proof of the $p$-adic weight-monodromy conjecture for smooth projective hypersurfaces in light of the motivic definition of nearby cycles and monodromy operators.</description>

      <title>Filtrations and asymptotic geometry of non-Archimedean norms on section rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the metric study of a construction of G\'erardin of the action of the boundary at infinity of the space of norms on a non-Archimedean vector space, and its generalisation to graded algebras. Namely, given (X,L) a polarised variety over an arbitrary non-Archimedean field, we show that there is a jointly d_1-contracting action of the space of filtrations of the section ring R(X,L) on the space of graded norms on R(X,L). This naturally yields non-Archimedean geodesic rays and infinite-dimensional flats in this setting, generalising previous work of the author and Witt Nystr\"om. It is further shown that relative limit measures converge along geodesic rays, providing a result on the d_p-radial geometry of graded norms, analogous to a recent result of Finski in the Archimedean case.</description>

      <title>A canonical Fano threefold has Fano index $\leq 66$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano index of a canonical weak Fano $3$-fold is at most $66$. This upper bound is optimal and gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Chengxi Wang in dimension $3$. During the proof, we establish a new Riemmann--Roch formula for canonical $3$-folds and provide a detailed study of non-isolated singularities on canonical Fano $3$-folds, concerning both their local and global properties. Our proof also involves a Kawamata--Miyaoka type inequality and geometry of foliations of rank $2$ on canonical Fano $3$-folds.</description>

      <title>A new coding theory, for normal surfaces, and ADE singularities, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we extend the theory of the binary codes (the strict code $\mathcal{K}$ and the extended code $\mathcal{K}'$), associated to a projective nodal surface, to a coding theory for normal surfaces, with special consideration of the surfaces with ADE (Rational Double Points) singularities.
  We define a new theory of generalized labeled codes, establish in the geometric case basic restrictions for the weights of these codes, and some basic inequality. A crucial method that we establish is the extension of the concept of `code shortening' to the case of generalized codes: this is the algebraic counterpart of the geometric notion of a partial smoothing of the singular points, and leads to the concept of ancestors, which we illustrate through several examples.</description>

      <title>Higher G-theory of simplicial toric varieties and vanishing of Chow groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper gives computations of all the $G$-theory groups of several classes of simplicial toric varieties, including all affine toric surfaces when the base field is algebraically closed and has characteristic zero, all weighted projective spaces over any field and resolution of singularities of all affine toric surfaces $\operatorname{Spec}(k[x,xy,xy^2,...,xy^d])$ over any field $k$. The $G$-theory groups $G_0,G_1,G_2$ are computed for the product of any two weighted projective spaces over any field. The dimension of the rational vector space $G_0(X)\otimes\mathbb{Q}$ for any complete, simplicial toric variety $X$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero is shown to be equal to the sum of the Betti numbers of even degrees. We also prove that the Chow group $A^2(X)$ of codimension 2 cycles vanishes for any affine, smooth toric variety, thereby proving a special case of my conjecture that the order of this Chow group $A^2(X)$ divides the determinant of the matrix whose columns are the minimal generators of the fan for any affine, simplicial toric variety $X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06548v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define real origami (that is, origami equipped with a real structure) and enumerate them using the combinatorics of zonal polynomials. We explicitly express in terms of sums of divisors the numbers of genus 2 real origami with 2 simple zeros and the numbers of genus 3 real origami with 2 double zeros showing that their generating functions are quantum modular forms. Furthermore, we show that by replacing zonal polynomials with Schur polynomials we can effectively count the classical (complex) origami. As a byproduct, we establish a connection between classical origami and a specific class of double Hurwitz numbers. Finally, we discuss some conjectures and open questions involving Jack functions, quantum modular forms, and integrable hierarchies.</description>

      <title>The twisted geometry of 6d F-theory vacua with discrete gauge symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fate of discrete gauge groups and discrete charges of gravitational theories under twisted circle compactification. We then apply our results to six-dimensional F-theory vacua with discrete gauge symmetries and relate them to the geometry of the genus one fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds that underlie the dual M-theory compactifications. This leads us to introduce a class of geometries, which we call almost generic elliptic/genus one fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds, and to make detailed conjectures about their properties. A second twisted circle compactification relates these M-theory vacua to Type IIA compactifications with flat but topologically non-trivial B-fields along the internal geometry. The A-model topological string partition function on such configurations is intimately tied to the twisted-twined elliptic genera of the six-dimensional non-critical strings of the associated F-theory vacuum. The modular properties of the twisted-twined elliptic genera imply new twisted derived equivalences. We thus recover and significantly extend earlier results from both the physical and the mathematical literature. An important outcome of our study is that if the discrete gauge symmetry is not cyclic, then no smooth genus one fibration exists that represents the associated axio-dilaton profile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.06917v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Canonical bundle formula due to Kawamata and others has played fundamental roles in algebraic geometry. We show that the canonical bundle formula has analytic characterization in terms of fiberwise integration, which confirms a folklore conjecture. The proof uses $L^2$ metrics and the valuative equivalence of plurisubharmonic singularities. As an application, we identify the singularity of the Ohsawa measure in a general $L^2$ extension theorem of Demailly for log canonical pairs. As another consequence, we give a partial answer to a question of Berndtsson on semipositivity theorems.</description>

      <title>Parabolic Crystalline Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10449v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of crystalline representations was established by Fontaine and Laffaille, Faltings, and others. In this paper, we develop a parabolic version of this theory. The key point is the construction of the parabolic version of Fontaine-Faltings modules and Faltings' $\mathbb D$-functor. The theory of Higgs-de Rham flows can be used to efficiently construct crystalline representations. We have established a parabolic version and utilized it to construct infinitely many crystalline representations. The twisted versions discussed in Sun, Yang, and Zuo's work can be seen as a special case, where the parabolic weights are equal at every infinity point.</description>

Abstract: We compute the topological monodromy of every family of complete intersection curves. Like in the case of plane curves previously treated by the second-named author, we find the answer is given by the $r$-spin mapping class group associated to the maximal root of the adjoint line bundle. Our main innovation is a suite of tools for studying the monodromy of sections of a tensor product of very ample line bundles in terms of the monodromy of sections of the factors, allowing for an induction on (multi-)degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the tropical Abel--Prym map $\Psi\colon \widetilde\Gamma\to Prym(\widetilde\Gamma/\Gamma)$ associated with a free double cover $\pi\colon \widetilde\Gamma\to \Gamma$ of hyperelliptic metric graphs is harmonic of degree $2$ in accordance with the already established algebraic result. We then prove a partial converse. Contrary to the analogous algebraic result, when the source graph of the double cover is not hyperelliptic, the Abel--Prym map is often not injective.
  When the source graph is hyperelliptic, we show that the Abel--Prym graph $\Psi(\widetilde\Gamma)$ is a hyperelliptic metric graph of genus $g_{\Gamma}-1$ whose Jacobian is isomorphic, as pptav, to the Prym variety of the cover. En route,
  we count the number of distinct free double covers by hyperelliptic metric graphs.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly describe the tropicalization of a cluster variety of finite type C, realizing it as the space of axially symmetric phylogenetic trees. We also find all occurring sign patterns of coordinates, for both the cluster variety and the cluster configuration space. We show that each of the corresponding signed tropicalizations is, combinatorially, dual to either a cyclohedron or an associahedron. As additional results, we construct Gr\"obner and tropical bases for the defining ideals of both varieties, and classify the arising toric degenerations.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{u}_\zeta^\vee$ denote the small quantum group associated with a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^\vee$ and a root of unity $\zeta$. In [9], a geometric realization of $Z(\mathfrak{u}_\zeta^\vee)^{G^\vee}$, the $G^\vee$-invariant part of the center of $\mathfrak{u}_\zeta^\vee$, was proposed. We compute the dimension of the geometric subalgebra of the center and in the case where $G=SL_n$, we study a bigraded refinement of the result.</description>
