      <title>High-density and scalable graphene Hall sensor arrays through monolithic CMOS integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic devices made from two-dimensional materials (2DMs) significantly outperform their silicon counterparts; however, silicon CMOS technology remains commercially predominant as it offers the capability to operate dense arrays of devices in a scalable fashion. In particular, graphene Hall sensors (GHSs) offer great improvements in magnetic field sensitivity and resolution compared to silicon Hall-effect sensors, making them extremely appealing for magnetic field imaging and biosensing. At present, GHS arrays have limited scalability compared to silicon CMOS since they require planar routing for biasing and multiplexing. In this work, we explore strategies to realize high-density graphene Hall sensor arrays by vertically connecting GHSs with silicon CMOS biasing and multiplexing circuitry, allowing the routing and circuitry to scale with the array. We investigate the importance of design choices in the chip layout and post-fabrication process in maximizing the reliability of graphene transfer onto mm-scale CMOS dies. Our experimental results validate the success of the integration process by showing for the first time that GHSs can be monolithically integrated with CMOS with high yield to form sensor arrays. We expect that these results will lead to further improvements in magnetic sensing technology and broader advancements in large-scale heterogeneous 2DM-CMOS systems.</description>

      <title>Comparative Simulation of CEvNS Recoil Observables in Geant4 Using Germanium, Argon, and Xenon Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Geant4-based simulation study of Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CEvNS) for three commonly used detector targets: Germanium, Argon, and Xenon. A custom CEvNS model was implemented, including differential cross sections and Helm form factors. Recoil energy spectra, angular distributions, and form factor effects were analyzed using ROOT. The results reveal expected trends: heavier nuclei lead to lower recoil energies and increased form factor suppression. This work provides a simulation framework to support future theoretical and experimental studies in neutrino physics and dark matter searches.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Microscopy via Automation: Dual Magnification ESEM Imaging by Frame Alternation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) experiments, the acquisition parameters are generally kept constant throughout the collection of a data set. This limits data collection to one data set at a time, and frequent human interaction is required to maintain the image quality. Here, we use a custom-designed automation interface to minimize such supervision and allow for the collection of multiple interlaced data sets simultaneously. The oscillatory modes of an example catalytic system (hydrogen oxidation over Co foil) were employed as a tunable spatiotemporal test case. Using our automation interface, we can implement more advanced acquisition programs into the microscope that allow dual imaging - effectively bridging reaction monitoring between different length scales. By using automation to change the settings of the acquisition after each frame, we are able to capture alternating magnifications of the same process and sample location. Both a low magnification overview of the mesoscopic surface dynamics and a high magnification field of view of the ongoing structural changes of a selected surface motif were acquired. Using such truly correlative data captured with the dual magnification method, cross-scale correlations about catalytic systems including phase information can be established.</description>

      <title>Half-life Measurements of Highly Charged Radioisotopes by Nuclear Recoil in a Penning Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for measuring the half-life of highly charged radioisotopes by non-destructive nuclear recoil detection in a Penning ion trap. A specific emphasis is placed on $\rm ^7Be^{3+}$, which plays a crucial role in stellar evolution and the production of solar neutrinos. The determination of the half-life is necessary to constrain the free electron capture rate in the solar environment, but is difficult to measure by existing techniques. Simulations of the sympathetic cooling of the recoiled daughter nuclei ($\rm ^7Li^{3+}$) with the trapped cloud of $\rm ^7Be^{3+}$ demonstrate a decay detection efficiency of $99.5\%$. A statistical analysis of half-life measurements on ensembles containing hundreds of ions shows that a final statistical uncertainty of less than $5\%$ is achieved with only 500 measured decays. By coherent control of hyperfine populations in trapped ions, the fidelity of the technique we describe enables the direct measurement and manipulation of state-dependent decay branching ratios for the first time.</description>

      <title>Intermediate Silicon Tracker in sPHENIX at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sPHENIX collaboration has been taking data since 2023 at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in BNL to study the Quark-Gluon Plasma and cold Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The tracking system of sPHENIX consists of a time projection chamber, a MAPS-based vertex detector, and an intermediate silicon tracker (INTT). Together with the sPHENIX full barrel calorimeter system, the measurement of the heavy-flavor jets and the upsilon-state identification are enabled. INTT, surrounding the collision point azimuthally at approximately 10 cm away with two layers of silicon strip sensors, detects hit points in the intermediate area of the tracking system to enhance tracking precision. Thanks to the good timing resolution of INTT, it also provides timing information to corresponding hits of other tracking detectors. This capability eliminates pile-up events due to misidentifying bunch crossings. This proceeding discusses the achievements of INTT using Au+Au collision data taken in 2023, and the status of INTT commissioning with proton+proton collisions in 2024.</description>

      <title>Imaging 3D Printed Fracture Networks under Stress using X-Ray Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel experimental approach based on 3D printing and X-ray computed tomography to characterize fracture aperture distribution and evolution in 3D fracture networks under varying stress loading conditions. We validate our methodology by comparing experimentally measured stress-dependent fracture apertures with both analytical solutions and numerical simulations, for both single fracture and fracture network scenarios. We show that, for fracture deformation under linear elastic regime, our experimental results agree with numerical simulation. Furthermore, by combining our new experimental methodology with advanced numerical simulations, we illuminate the complex interplay of stress and topology in fracture network deformation. Our approach opens the door for experimentally observing deformable fracture networks under stress in 3D space, which has significant implications for understanding and predicting many geophysical problems involving fractured geological media.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for 3D Characterization of AGATA Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise localization of gamma-ray interactions is crucial for the performance of AGATA. The Pulse Shape Analysis (PSA) method used for the position estimation relies on simulated signals database. The Pulse Shape Comparison Scanning (PSCS) method was used to scan AGATA crystals in order to produce an experimental database. This paper presents a novel approach using LSTM neural networks to determine the 3D interaction position of gamma rays within AGATA crystals, trained on data from the Strasbourg scanning tables, allowing for constructing experimental database. A custom masked loss function is introduced to enable training with incomplete position information. The database generated by this new method outperforms the simulated database used so far, and the experimental database obtained from the conventional PSCS algorithm. Crucially, the neural network approach effectively generalizes even when trained with only one known coordinate per interaction, paving the way for simplified 1D scanning procedures.</description>

      <title>Radiation-tolerant polarized solid target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarized targets evolved into indispensable tools in particle and nuclear physics. However, the polarized solid target is degraded by high-intense beam irradiation, known as radiation damage due to target heating and radical generation. We demonstrated a radiation-tolerant polarized solid target operating at room temperature. An annealing allows the spontaneous repair of the damage by reducing unwanted radicals. Using a single crystal of $\it p$-terphenyl doped with 0.01 mol\% pentacene-$\it d$$_{14}$, Dynamic Nuclear Polarization using photoexcited triplet electrons (Triplet-DNP) was applied to proton spins at room temperature and in 0.39 T. For the proof of concept, a deuteron beam with an energy of 135 MeV/u and the intensities of 10$^7$-10$^9$ counts per second (cps) was irradiated. The proton polarization was determined to be 3.0\% $\pm$0.2\%$\rm{{(stat.)}}$ $\pm$0.1\%$\rm {{(sys.)}}$ from a scattering asymmetry. The polarization was almost not attenuated up to 10$^9$ cps, but the target crystal was yellowed. The visible-light absorption spectroscopy suggested irreversible radiation damage due to missing protons by the knock-out reaction. The room-temperature polarized solid target allows impractical experiments with the conventional target system, leading to a next-generation spin-dependent accelerator science.</description>

      <title>Experimental Scheme for Polarizing the Boron Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unravelling the internal structure of hadrons and nuclei in terms of the quarks and gluons of Quantum Chromodynamics is a central focus of current nuclear physics research. Directly observing gluonic states in the nucleus would be groundbreaking and is an objective of the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Over thirty years ago, Jaffe and Manohar identified a new double-helicity flip structure function, directly sensitive to exotic gluons. They pointed out that this could be measured in inclusive high-energy electron scattering from a transversely polarized nuclear target with spin $I \ge 1$. Here, we identify the spin-3 nucleus boron-10 as a particularly interesting system to search for exotic gluons. Leveraging technical advances in atomic physics over the past decade, we outline an experimental scheme to directly optically pump a beam of stable boron atoms to polarize the nuclear spin. Technical challenges to realize a spin-polarized beam of boron-10 in the EIC are discussed. The proposed scheme will also polarize the $^{11}$B nucleus, which could significantly enhance the pB fusion cross section.</description>

      <title>Morphological Granulometric Analysis of Particle Imagery from Microgravity Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of our work is to analyze size distributions of particles and their agglomerates in imagery from astrophysical microgravity experiments. The data acquired in these experiments are given by sequences consisting of several hundred images. It is desirable to establish an automated routine that helps to assess size distributions of important image structures and their dynamics in a statistical way.
  The main technique we adopt to this end is the morphological granulometry. After preprocessing steps that facilitate granulometric analysis, we show how to extract useful information on size of particle agglomerates as well as underlying dynamics. At hand of the discussion of two different microgravity key experiments we demonstrate that the granulometric analysis enables to assess important experimental aspects. We conjecture that our developments are a useful basis for the quantitative assessment of microgravity particle experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein Telescope is the next-generation gravitational wave interferometer which, compared to current detectors, will enable the observation of gravitational signals at lower frequencies with a sensitivity improved by approximately two orders of magnitude. Achieving such exceptional sensitivity requires minimizing all sources of noise. In the low-frequency regime, magnetic noise is one of the dominant. This article examines the effectiveness and limitations of a passive mitigation technique: ferromagnetic shielding.</description>

      <title>Introducing a Markov Chain-Based Time Calibration Procedure for Multi-Channel Particle Detectors: Application to the SuperFGD and ToF Detectors of the T2K Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter-channel mis-synchronisation can be a limiting factor to the time resolution of high performance timing detectors with multiple readout channels and independent electronics units. In these systems, time calibration methods employed must be able to efficiently correct for minimal mis-synchronisation between channels and achieve the best detector performance. We present an iterative time calibration method based on Markov Chains, suitable for detector systems with multiple readout channels. Starting from correlated hit pairs alone, and without requiring an external reference time measurement, the method solves for fixed per-channel offsets, with precision limited only by the intrinsic single-channel resolution. A mathematical proof that the method is able to find the correct time offsets to be assigned to each detector channel in order to achieve inter-channel synchronisation is given, and it is shown that the number of iterations to reach convergence within the desired precision is controllable with a single parameter. Numerical studies are used to confirm unbiased recovery of true offsets. Finally, the application of the calibration method to the Super Fine-Grained Detector (SuperFGD) and the Time of Flight (TOF) detector at the upgraded T2K near detector (ND280) shows good improvement in overall timing resolution, demonstrating the effectiveness in a real-world scenario and scalability.</description>

      <title>AC Magnetometry Loop Tracer Compatible with Magnetic Calorimetry for Power Loss Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have garnered significant attention for various applications in the high-kHz-to-MHz range, although their magnetic characterization at these operational conditions has been limited. However, a number of recent studies have showcased high-frequency and high-field amplitude AC magnetometry loop tracers capable of retrieving the magnetic AC hysteresis curve and the associated magnetic properties. In this paper, we present an easily constructable loop tracer that is retrofitted into an existing AC calorimetry setup. This enables the loop tracer to function simultaneously with the AC calorimetry setup and also to be run as a high-frequency AC susceptometer. The loop tracer is shown to work in the frequency range 160-922 kHz with maximum applied fields from 18 to 46 mT depending on the frequency. An iron oxide nanoflower sample is used to test the loop tracer, showcasing high reproducibility in measured magnetic parameters as well as quantitative agreement between the different measurement methods in the setup.</description>

      <title>Experimental plasmonic sensing of malaria using an aluminum metasurface</title>

Abstract: A wide range of methods currently exist for testing the presence of malaria, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. New technologies are urgently needed to develop more effective diagnosis tools to fight and eradicate malaria. Optical biosensors that employ surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques are a promising category of devices for detecting malaria biomarkers. One such biomarker is plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), a protein produced during the life cycle of the malaria parasite, which is a metabolic enzyme found in all plasmodium species, including the most widespread falciparum. This work reports on the design, probing, and experimental performance of an optical biosensor for detecting pLDH based on SPR and extraordinary optical transmission. The biosensor is composed of an aluminum metasurface made from an array of nanoholes. The sensor operates in the visible spectral region and achieves label-free sensing of plasmodium falciparum LDH (pfLDH) spiked in phosphate-buffered saline. The sensor has a spectral sensitivity of 360 nm/RIU and an LOD of 1.3 nM, equivalent to 45.6 ng/mL of pfLDH. This type of optical biosensor may offer a cost-effective and high sensitivity method for active infection diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Low-Energy Particle Remnants in High-Energy Collisions at the LHC with a Skipper-CCD detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We deployed MOSKITA $\sim$33 m away from the CMS collision point, the first skipper-CCD detector probing low-energy particles produced in high-energy collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this work, we search for beam-related events using data collected in 2024 during beam-on and beam-off periods. The dataset corresponds to integrated luminosities of 113.3 fb$^{-1}$ and 1.54 nb$^{-1}$ for the proton-proton and Pb-Pb collision periods, respectively. We report observed event rates in a model-independent framework across two ionization regions: $\leq20e^-$ and $&gt;20e^-$. For the low-energy region, we perform a likelihood analysis to test the null hypothesis of no beam-correlated signal. We found no significant correlation during proton-proton and Pb-Pb collisions. For the high-energy region, we present the energy spectra for both collision periods and compare event rates for images with and without luminosity. We observe a slight increase in the event rate following the Pb-Pb collisions, coinciding with a rise in the single-electron rate, which will be investigated in future work. Using the low-energy proton-proton results, we place 95% C.L. constraints on the mass-millicharge parameter space of millicharged particles. Overall, the results in this work demonstrate the viability of skipper-CCD technology to explore new physics at high-energy colliders and motivate future searches with more massive detectors.</description>

      <title>Enhanced UV Detection in GaN-Based Photodetectors through InN/AlN Heterostructure Integration and Doping-Engineered PIN Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive simulation-based optimization of gallium nitride (GaN)-based metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors designed for ultraviolet (UV) applications. The proposed device architecture incorporates a novel indium nitride/gallium nitride/aluminum nitride (InN/GaN/AlN) heterostructure integrated on a sapphire substrate, combined with refined doping strategies and interdigitated electrode geometry. By systematically analyzing the effects of mesa layer thickness, buffer layers, substrate type, and doping concentrations, we demonstrate significant enhancements in photocurrent generation, photoabsorption rate, and spectral responsivity. Notably, replacing the conventional sapphire substrate with silicon carbide (SiC) and introducing low-level p-type and n-type (p-n) doping into the GaN region enables p-i-n diode-like behavior, contributing to reduced dark current and improved UV selectivity. Building upon these structural enhancements, the final geometric optimization of the nickel/gold (Ni/Au) electrode fingers led to an approximately eight-fold increase in photocurrent compared to the initial design, representing the most significant contribution to the improvement in absorption efficiency. These findings offer an effective route for designing next-generation MSM photodetectors with improved sensitivity, noise performance, and thermal compatibility, suitable for high-performance ultraviolet detection applications.</description>

      <title>Dark Count Rate Stability of JUNO 20-inch PMTs in Mass Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is an ambitious multipurpose neutrino experiment designed to determine the neutrino mass ordering, with an impressive energy resolution goal of at least 3% at 1 MeV. To achieve a photon detection coverage of approximately 75%, JUNO will utilize two types of 20-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs): the large PMT (LPMT) and the microchannel plate PMT (MCP-PMT). A significant concern in high-precision neutrino measurements is the dark count rate (DCR) of PMTs, which introduces noise that can adversely affect energy measurement accuracy. During the mass testing phase of the JUNO 20-inch PMTs, comprehensive measurements of the DCR were undertaken. These measurements not only captured the DCR values of individual PMTs but also examined the stability and temperature dependence of the DCR at an operating gain of (1x10^7). This paper presents a detailed characterization of the DCR of the JUNO 20-inch PMTs, investigating factors such as cooling time, temperature variations, and long-term stability using the JUNO Pan-Asia PMT testing facilities. The results reveal distinct DCR characteristics between the two types of PMTs, providing valuable insights into the nature of DCR and its implications for JUNO's scientific objectives. In addition to performance characterization, we implemented a monitoring system to track DCR stability over time. Notably, several spikes in DCR were identified, prompting a preliminary investigation into their causes. Potential factors contributing to these spikes, such as flasher events, were explored using coincidence rate analysis and complementary imaging techniques. The findings from this study are crucial for optimizing the performance of PMTs in JUNO, ultimately aiding the experiment in achieving its goals related to neutrino physics.</description>

      <title>Malter-Driven Electron Emission as a Source of Noise in LXe TPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent single-electron emission ("hot spots") has been observed in multiple liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chambers (TPCs), often persisting long after ionizing events. Although typically discussed in operational terms, the behavior is consistent with Malter-type emission triggered by ion accumulation on resistive oxide surfaces. In this note, we discuss such effects and recommend material choices and design strategies to mitigate them in future detectors. This mechanism is especially relevant to experiments targeting ultra-low energy thresholds, where even small background emissions can limit sensitivity.</description>

      <title>AI-Enhanced Self-Triggering for Extensive Air Showers: Performance and FPGA Feasibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous self-triggering for radio detection of extensive air showers remains challenging in realistic environments dominated by strong and variable radio-frequency interference. Traditional radio-array operations rely on external particle-detector triggers, limiting sensitivity and increasing system complexity. In this work, I present a proof-of-principle study demonstrating that deep-learning-based triggering can operate in such high-noise conditions and can be implemented within the strict latency constraints of large-scale radio observatories. Using measured high-interference noise traces combined with simulated cosmic-ray pulses, a fully convolutional network classifier was trained and optimised for robust separation of signals from background at MHz-scale trigger-trial rates. The trained model was quantised with HLS4ML to fixed-point precision and synthesised using Vitis HLS for multiple FPGA targets. The quantised implementation preserves the floating-point model performance (AUC_float = 0.997, AUC_quant = 0.996) while achieving microsecond-scale inference latencies. These results show that modern FPGA-based AI inference, enabled by high-level synthesis, can provide low-latency, radio-only triggering for next-generation cosmic-ray observatories, potentially removing the need for external trigger systems and reducing array complexity.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the signal to noise ratio of 2-photon microscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signal to noise ratio (SNR) is a key performance metric of an imaging instrument. Here we describe characterisation of SNR of a custom 2-photon microscope and compare the SNR performance of our microscope with selected commercial 2-photon microscopes. The methodology described in this paper can serve as guidance for others wishing to characterise and benchmark their 2-photon or other point-scanning microscopes.</description>
