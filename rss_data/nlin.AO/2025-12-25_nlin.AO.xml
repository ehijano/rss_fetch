      <title>Epidemics models in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lectures are based on material which was presented in the 2025 Summer school at Funda\c{c}\~ao Getulio Vargas. The aim of this series is to introduce graduate students with a little background in the field of dynamical systems and network theory to epidemic models. Our goal is to give a succinct and self-contained description of the models</description>

      <title>Flocking phase transition and threat responses in bio-inspired autonomous drone swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective motion inspired by animal groups offers powerful design principles for autonomous aerial swarms. We present a bio-inspired 3D flocking algorithm in which each drone interacts only with a minimal set of influential neighbors, relying solely on local alignment and attraction cues. By systematically tuning these two interaction gains, we map a phase diagram revealing sharp transitions between swarming and schooling, as well as a critical region where susceptibility, polarization fluctuations, and reorganization capacity peak. Outdoor experiments with a swarm of ten drones, combined with simulations using a calibrated flight-dynamics model, show that operating near this transition enhances responsiveness to external disturbances. When confronted with an intruder, the swarm performs rapid collective turns, transient expansions, and reliably recovers high alignment within seconds. These results demonstrate that minimal local-interaction rules are sufficient to generate multiple collective phases and that simple gain modulation offers an efficient mechanism to adjust stability, flexibility, and resilience in drone swarms.</description>

      <title>Collective behaviors of self-propelled particles with tunable alignment angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel aligning active matter model by extending the nematic alignment rule in self-propelled rods to tunable alignment angles, as represented by collision of cone-shaped particles. Non-vanishing alignment angles introduce frustration in the many-body interactions, and we investigate its effect on the collective behavior of the system. Through numerical simulations of an agent-based microscopic model, we found that the system exhibits distinct phenomenology compared to the original self-propelled rods. In particular, anti-parallel bands are observed in an intermediate parameter range. The linear stability analysis of the continuum description derived from the Boltzmann approach demonstrates qualitative consistency with the microscopic model, while frustration due to many-body interactions in the latter destabilizes homogeneous nematic order over a wide range of the alignment angle.</description>
