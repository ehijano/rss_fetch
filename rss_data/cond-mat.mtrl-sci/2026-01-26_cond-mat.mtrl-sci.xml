      <title>Towards a single-junction non-concentrator metal halide perovskite hot carrier solar cell: review of current gaps and opportunities in understanding slow hot carrier cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photovoltaic solar cell is a mature technology, with silicon-based technologies deployed at scale, yet current technologies are limited by the Shockley-Queisser thermodynamic limit, known since the early 1960s. The single-junction non-concentrator hot carrier solar cell operating at ambient temperature - with its theoretically predicted ultimate power conversion efficiency limit of nearly 70% that is twice the Shockley-Queisser limit and is higher than what can be achieved with even n=6 multijunction solar cells - has remained an elusive yet hot research target since the early 1980s. Metal halide perovskite semiconductors were discovered in the late 1970s and photovoltaic applications have been intensively researched and developed since the early 2010s. Current technology development of perovskite solar cells is heavily motivated by their expected cheap processing costs relative to other Shockley-Queisser limited technologies. History has shown that very few absorber materials develop into viable solar cell technologies, and it has been recognized that given the declining costs of silicon-based technologies, a new material must offer potential for both lower cost and higher efficiencies than the Shockley-Queisser limit. Slow cooling of photocarriers with energy in excess of the band edges (hot carriers), which is the first prerequisite of a solar absorbing material for building a hot carrier solar cell technology, has been reported in perovskites since the 2010s. The goal of this review is to illuminate the path towards a single-junction perovskite hot carrier solar cell technology by emphasizing uncertainties in understanding slow hot carrier cooling and recommending approaches to resolve them.</description>

      <title>Thermally-Activated Epitaxy of NbO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a thermally-activated epitaxy window for the growth of NbO at temperatures exceeding 1000 $^o$C. NbO films grown in this mode display superior structural and transport properties, which are reproducible across a window of oxygen partial pressure. Through comprehensive analysis, we propose the prototypical electrical properties of NbO, for which a consensus has not yet been made. This study unequivocally demonstrates the utility of high temperatures in the thin film synthesis of refractory metal compounds.</description>

      <title>Nuclear quadrupole interaction and zero first-order Zeeman transitions of $^{167}$Er$^{3+}$ in CaWO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report microwave spectroscopy of $^{167}$Er$^{3+}$ doped in CaWO$_4$ which reveals the hyperfine splitting of the erbium electronic ground state ($Z_1$, $J_\mathrm{eff.}$=15/2) induced by the $I$=7/2 nuclear spin. From spectra measured below$\sim$50 mK in magnetic fields up to 200 mT, we extract spin Hamiltonian parameters including the electron $\textbf{g}$, hyperfine $\textbf{A}$, and nuclear electric quadrupolar $\textbf{Q}$ tensors. Crucially, our analysis demonstrate unambiguously, that the previously unobserved nuclear electric quadrupolar moment is essential to reproduce the experimental data. With these refined parameters, we identify zero first-order Zeeman (ZEFOZ) transitions at zero magnetic field. Extending the analysis to finite fields, we uncover that ZEFOZ points lie either along the $c$ axis or within the $a$-$b$ plane. These results establish CaWO$_4$ as a promising host for long lifetime quantum memories.</description>

      <title>Energy Eigenstates of Electrons, Magnons and Phonons in Fe$_3$O$_4$ (magnetite), MnFe$_2$O$_4$ (jacobsite), and mixed Mn-Zn ferrites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report first-principles calculations of the electronic structure, magnon excitations, and phonons in magnetite (Fe$_3$O$_4$), jacobsite (MnFe$_2$O$_4$), and mixed manganese-zinc ferrites (Mn$_{x}$,Zn$_{1-x}$)Fe$_2$O$_4$ for representative compositions ($0\le x \le 1$) and A/B-site cation arrangements. Electronic structures are computed using density functional theory (DFT) augmented by rotationally invariant DFT+U+J, with on-site Hubbard and Hund's parameters, $U$ and $J$, respectively, determined self-consistently by spin-polarized linear-response perturbations of the chosen correlated subspaces (including, where applied, the ligand $2p$ subspace). A classical Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian is parameterized by mapping DFT+U+J total energies for multiple collinear spin configurations onto nearest-neighbor exchange couplings, which are then used to obtain magnon dispersions and magnon densities of states within linear spin-wave theory. Phonon spectra and densities of states are obtained from finite-displacement force constants and dynamical matrices computed on the same DFT+U+J-relaxed structures. Overall, the workflow provides a consistent, composition- and configuration-aware route to electronic, vibrational, and magnetic excitation spectra across the Mn/Zn ferrite space.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced metastable cation disorder in metal halide double perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-free perovskites have emerged as environmentally benign alternatives to lead-halide counterparts for optoelectronics. Among them, the double perovskite Cs2AgInCl6 family exhibits remarkable white-light emission with proper composition engineering, enabled by strong electron-phonon coupling and the formation of self-trapped excitons (STEs). Despite these advantages, the fundamental photo- and structural dynamics governing their excited-state behavior remain poorly understood. Here, we report a long-lived metastable phase in the Cs2AgInCl6 double perovskite family and unravel this process and the concomitant electronic and structural evolution using a suite of tools including transient optical spectroscopy, time-resolved X-ray diffraction (TR-XRD) and X-ray absorption (TR-XAS). We show that the photoinduced, transient metastable phase is associated with B-site (Ag-In) disorder, which induces a dramatically reduced optical bandgap. Supported by TR-XRD and first-principles calculations, the Ag-In disorder drives the formation of Ag-rich and In-rich domains with millisecond lifetimes, with lifetimes increasing at lower temperatures. TR-XAS further reveals that photogenerated STEs oxidize Ag+ to Ag2+, facilitating this highly temporally asymmetric order-disorder transition. Our findings demonstrate a new mechanism, mediated by hole-localized STE formation, that enables prolongation of transient light-induced states to the multi-millisecond regime in double perovskites, opening possibilities to harvesting the functional properties of metastable phases of these materials.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic thermodynamics redefines metastability and parent phases in ferroelectric HfO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hafnia (HfO2) is a silicon-compatible dielectric material, yet stabilizing its desired but metastable ferroelectric phase remains challenging. Phase stability predictions by density functional theory (DFT) have provided crucial guidance, but most simulations neglected or only treated finite temperature effects with (quasi-)harmonic approximation due to high computational cost of DFT. Here, we develop a machine learning force field and perform thermodynamic calculations for HfO2 using self-consistent phonon theory to address growing evidence of anharmonicity. Our results reveal that the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase oIII exhibits metastability below 0.1kBT under most conditions within the simulated regime of temperature and pressure (600 K &lt;= T &lt;= 1500 K and 0 &lt;= p &lt;= 7.5 GPa), contradicting previous harmonic predictions of metastability above 1500 K at ambient pressure. We further report evidence for temperature- and pressure-dependent ferroelectric parent phase despite efforts to identify a universal one. This study highlights the importance of anharmonicity and provides an effective approach for its treatment in the design of HfO2-based ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Simulations of High Temperature Decomposition of Metal-Organic Frameworks to form Amorphous Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic framework (MOF) derived materials formed through high temperature processes show great potential as catalysts. However, understanding of structure-property relationships between the initial MOF and the resulting MOF-derived catalyst is limited because the amorphous nature of the catalyst challenges standard structural characterization methods. Neural network approaches that learn interatomic potentials from density functional theory offer a promising solution. We simulated the pyrolysis of UiO-66, UiO-67 and MIP-206 using both foundational and fine-tuned machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). To mimic experimental conditions, an atmosphere of CO2 and H2 was introduced and the structures were doped with 20 wt% copper to probe the effect of copper on the structural evolution of MOFs. These simulations provide atomistic insights into gas evolution, metal nanoparticle formation, and linker decomposition that were compared to available experimental data. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of MLIPs to accurately model high temperature MOF dynamics under experimentally relevant conditions and guide the design of new catalytic materials.</description>

      <title>Electrically Accessible Metamagnetic Transition via a Doping-Induced Low-Energy Magnetic State in Antiferromagnetic Insulator RFeO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-energy antiferromagnetic phase transitions offer an appealing platform for low-power spintronic functionalities, yet their direct electrical access in insulating antiferromagnets remains challenging, particularly in the low-field regime where subtle Neeel vector reorientations dominate. Here, we demonstrate that targeted rare-earth-site engineering enables an electrically accessible metamagnetic transition in the insulating orthoferrite Ho0.5Dy0.5FeO3. By combining the distinct spin-reorientation sequences of DyFeO3 and HoFeO3, Dy substitution stabilizes a dual spin-reorientation pathway, hosting an intermediate state with a reduced energy barrier. This low-energy antiferromagnetic state can be tuned into the weak-ferromagnetic state under low magnetic fields. The critical field decreases with increasing temperature, providing a favorable window for functional manipulation. Both longitudinal and transverse spin Hall magnetoresistance channels exhibit clear and reproducible signatures of the metamagnetic transitions. Owing to the enhanced sensitivity of the transverse channel, additional low-field features are resolved, reflecting the projection of the Neel vector onto the spin-accumulation direction. Electrical transport measurements correlate directly with the magnetically determined phase boundaries, establishing a purely electrical access to low-energy phase transitions and to illustrate a viable pathway for exploring low-power spin dynamics in insulating oxide antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Dielectric, magnetic and lattice dynamics properties of double perovskite (Ca0.5Mn1.5)MnWO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent dielectric and magnetic studies of (Ca0.5Mn1.5)MnWO6 ceramics [A.A. Belik, Chem. Mater. 36, 7604 (2024)] have classified this material as a rare hybrid multiferroic, with both antiferromagnetic and (anti)ferroelectric ordering occurring at the same temperature of 22 K. The pronounced dielectric anomaly observed at this temperature indicated that the structural change is primarily induced by a phonon soft mode and not by a spin arrangement, as is usually the case in type II multiferroics. However, our comprehensive investigation involving new ceramic samples as well as the sample from the above-mentioned reference does not support this conclusion. Low-temperature polarization measurements revealed no evidence of either ferroelectric or antiferroelectric order in both sample series. The dielectric permittivity exhibits only a slight change at the antiferromagnetic transition, and phonon modes observed in IR and Raman spectra show no indication of a symmetry change at low temperatures. In the new samples the Neel temperature is shifted to TN = 18 K. XRD, SEM, EDS and WDS analyses confirmed the composition (Ca0.5Mn1.5)MnWO6 of both ceramics, but also indicated a small amount (percentage points) of MnO and CaO impurities in the sample from the previous publication and Mn3O4, CaWO4 secondary phases (&lt;4%) in the new ceramics. The differences in dielectric and magnetic properties of the two samples can therefore be explained by their different chemical purity. The small dielectric anomaly of the new sample at the antiferromagnetic transition temperature is explained by a spin-phonon coupling. We conclude that (Ca0.5Mn1.5)MnWO6 is not a multiferroic, but a paraelectric antiferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Mobile charges in MoS2/high-k oxide transistors: from abnormal instabilities to memory-like dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MoS$_2$ field-effect transistors (FETs) with high-\textit{k} oxides currently lag behind silicon standards in bias and temperature stability due to ubiquitous border oxide traps that cause clockwise (CW) hysteresis in gate transfer characteristics. While suppressing this effect is typically mandatory for logic FETs, here we explore an alternative strategy where the initial CW hysteresis can be dynamically overcome by stronger counterclockwise (CCW) hysteresis towards memory-like dynamics. We systematically compare hysteresis in similar back-gated MoS$_2$/HfO$_2$ and MoS$_2$/Al$_2$O$_3$ FETs up to 275\textdegree C. At room temperature, both devices initially show sizable CW hysteresis. However, at 175\textdegree C MoS$_2$/HfO$_2$ FETs exhibit dominant CCW dynamics coupled with self-doping and negative differential resistance (NDR) effects. Our compact model suggests that this behavior is caused by the drift of mobile oxygen vacancies (\textit{V}\({}_{\mathrm{O}}^{+}\) or \textit{V}\({}_{\mathrm{O}}^{2+}\)) within HfO$_2$ which also causes negative $V_{\mathrm{th}}$ shift under a constant positive bias stress. This alternative mechanism effectively overrides the initial CW hysteresis and enables intrinsic memory functionality that can be enhanced by using narrower gate bias sweep ranges. In contrast, the MoS$_2$/Al$_2$O$_3$ FETs display only minor CCW dynamics even at 275\textdegree C due to higher drift activation energies for the same vacancies, thereby maintaining superior stability. Our results reveal an insulators selection paradigm: Al$_2$O$_3$ layers are better suited to suppress detrimental negative $V_{\mathrm{th}}$ shifts in MoS$_2$ logic FETs at high temperatures, whereas their HfO$_2$ counterparts can serve as active memory layers that would exploit these abnormal instabilities.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure, phase stability, and transport properties of the AlTiVCr lightweight high-entropy alloy: A computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and phase stability of the AlTiVCr lightweight high-entropy alloy using a combination of ab initio electronic structure calculations, a concentration wave analysis, and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations. In alignment both with experimental data and with results obtained using other computational approaches, we predict a $\textrm{B2}$ (CsCl) chemical ordering emerging in this alloy at comparatively high temperatures, which is driven by Al and Ti moving to separate sublattices, while V and Cr express weaker site preferences. The impact of this $\textrm{B2}$ chemical ordering on the electronic transport properties of the alloy is investigated within a Kubo-Greenwood linear response framework and it is found that, counter-intuitively, the alloy's residual resistivity increases as the material transitions from the $\textrm{A2}$ (disordered bcc) phase to our predicted $\textrm{B2}$ (partially) ordered structure. This is understood to result primarily from a reduction in the density of electronic states at the Fermi level induced by the chemical ordering. At low temperatures, our atomistic Monte Carlo simulations then reveal subsequent sublattice orderings, with the ground-state configuration predicted to be a fully-ordered, single-phase structure with vanishing associated residual resistivity. These results give fresh, insight into the atomic-scale structure and consequent physical properties of this well-studied, technologically relevant material.</description>

      <title>Synergistic effects of ferromagnetic elements and LAGP solid electrolyte in suppressing and trapping polysulfide shuttle transfers in lithium-sulfur batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large - scale commercialization of promising lithium - sulfur (Li - S) batteries remains limited by the polysulfide shuttle effect, which causes rapid capacity fading and poor cycle life. In this study, we present a scalable strategy to mitigate this challenge by modifying polyethylene (PE) separators with ferromagnetic and solid - state ionic coatings. Thin films of nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), and the Li - ion - conducting ceramic Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP) were deposited via ion beam sputtering, while Ni ion implantation was also employed to modify the PE substrate. The electrochemical performance of pristine and modified separators was evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and staircase voltammetry (SV) in liquid electrolyte within H - cell configurations. Surface morphology and elemental composition were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS). The results show that LAGP-based coatings significantly enhance separator stability and effectively suppress polysulfide diffusion, leading to lower redox peak intensities and improved cycling performance. In contrast, Ni coatings exhibited poor long - term stability, likely due to parasitic reactions or delamination during its life time. The combined LAGP/Co architecture provided the most effective suppression of the polysulfide shuttle, attributed to synergistic ionic and catalytic effects that promote interfacial stability and selective ion transport. Ni implantation into PE showed only a negligible effect. This study highlights the potential of integrating solid ionic conductors with ferromagnetic layers to design multifunctional separators for high-performance Li - S batteries.</description>

      <title>Role of defects in the thermodynamic stability of grain boundary phases at asymmetric tilt boundaries in copper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundaries can exist as different grain boundary phases (also called complexions) with individual atomic structures. The thermodynamics of these defect phases in high-angle grain boundaries were studied mostly with atomistic and phase field computer simulations, but almost exclusively for special, symmetric boundaries. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations combined with structure search methods, as well as scanning transmission electron microscopy experiments to take a step towards understanding more general grain boundaries. Using the example of $\Sigma$37c $[11\overline{1}]$ tilt boundaries in Cu, we show how the grain boundary phase transition on a symmetric boundary plane is changed by the geometrically necessary defects introduced in inclined, asymmetric boundaries. We analyze the disconnections - which are dislocation-like line defects of grain boundaries - both in the simulations, as well as in experimental Cu and Al samples. A main finding is that defect energies can have a major influence on the stability of grain boundary phases, even at small inclinations. Furthermore, some defects are not able to effect large inclinations. At that point, defective asymmetric GB phases compete with grain boundaries faceting into the adjacent symmetric GB phases.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Origin of Piezomagnetism in Mn$_3$Sn: A Dual Real- and $k$-Space Picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles study on the origin of the piezomagnetic effect in the non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn, a material known for exhibiting a large anomalous Hall effect. We investigate strain-induced variations of electronic and magnetic states and elucidate the mechanism of the piezomagnetic effect from both real-space and momentum-space perspectives. In real space, the emergence of piezomagnetism is understood to arise from rotations of the magnetic moments at specific Mn sites, which directly couple to the strain. Through detailed electronic structure analysis, we identify the Fermi surfaces that play a crucial role in the emergence of piezomagnetism. Our results reveal that specific Fermi surface features undergo pseudo-degeneracy lifting under applied strain, which significantly contributes to the induced net magnetization. By combining these complementary real-space and momentum-space pictures, our dual-space analysis provides deep insight into the microscopic origins of strain-driven magnetization in Mn$_3$Sn.</description>

      <title>AI-enhanced discovery and accelerated synthesis of metal phosphosulfides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal phosphosulfides have emerged as unique multifunctional materials, but they present unique synthesis challenges compared to more established material classes such as oxides and nitrides. As a consequence, experimental development and theoretical understanding of phosphosulfides have focused on individual compounds rather than on accelerated broad-range exploration. In this work, we first evaluate the synthesizability and band gaps of 909 hypothetical ternary phosphosulfides by density functional theory. We find 19 previously unknown thermodynamically stable compounds, including the first Si- and Ge-based phosphosulfides. For rapid band gap prediction, we then develop a multi-fidelity machine learning model to translate semilocal density functional theory band gaps into experimentally calibrated band gaps. Importantly, we extend the accelerated material development workflow to the experimental domain by demonstrating a route to high-throughput synthesis and characterization of virtually any phosphosulfide material system. The method is based on thin-film combinatorial libraries and yields over 100 unique compositions in each experiment, enabling us to synthesize four distinct phosphosulfide compounds in only four combinatorial experiments without prior synthesis recipes and without compromising on material quality. Thus, we argue that accelerated materials development workflows combining theory, artificial intelligence, synthesis, and characterization can be viable even for experimentally challenging inorganic materials.</description>

      <title>Control of helix orientation in chiral magnets via lateral confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helimagnetic materials offer a versatile platform for spin-based device concepts owing to their long-range, tunable spiral order. Here, we demonstrate controlled manipulation of the helimagnetic propagation vector q by geometrical confinement, using FeGe as a model DMI-driven chiral magnet. Micromagnetic simulations based on the nonlinear sigma model reveal that open boundaries give rise to a chiral surface twist acting as an effective surface anisotropy, which dictates the preferred helix orientation in the absence of magnetostatic shape effects. This geometry-induced anisotropy is quantitatively captured by an analytical model derived from the DMI boundary condition. Magnetic force microscopy measurements on focused-ion-beam structured FeGe confirm the predicted orientation behavior and establish geometry-controlled helimagnetic order as a robust, tunable mechanism for steering DMI-stabilized spin-spiral states. The concept provides a general route toward device-level control of chiral magnetic order in of non-centrosymmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Engineering the electronic structure of TiO$_2$ by transition metal doping: A First Principles DFT Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By means of first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we perform a comparative analysis of the electronic and magnetic properties of transition metal-doped TiO$_2$. The electronic band gaps of Ti$_x$M$_{1-x}$O$_2$, where M represents 3d-transition metals such as Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn have been determined using the PBE functional within the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) scheme, and also using the hybrid HSE06 functional. In the context of pure TiO$_2$, the partial density of states (PDOS) reveals that the electronic band gap emerges between the O-2p and Ti-3d orbitals. It is suggested that the Ti-3d ($t_{2g}$) states play a more prominent role in bonding compared to the Ti-3d ($e_g$) states. We performed DFT calculations to investigate the impact of doping with other 3d transition metal atoms, leading to the emergence of impurity states within the band gap. The hybridization between the oxygen 2p orbitals and the titanium 3d orbitals in TiO$_2$ is altered by the introduction of doping with 3d transition metals because of the change in the oxidation state of titanium, shifting from solely 4+ to a combination of 4+ and 3+ states. The calculation of spin-polarized density demonstrates the emergence of ferromagnetic properties, particularly in titanium dioxide doped with chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe) with large magnetic moments. Our work demonstrates the significant impact of doping transition metals on TiO$_2$, allowing for the precise manipulation of electrical and magnetic properties, and thus holds great potential for the development of spin-based memory devices with possible neuromorphic applications.</description>

      <title>Controlling Mixed Mo/MoS$_2$ Domains on Si by Molecular Beam Epitaxy for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) is a prototypical layered transition-metal dichalcogenide whose electrocatalytic performance is governed by a delicate balance between crystallinity, defect density, and electronic conductivity. Here we report a systematic molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) study in which annealing temperature, deposition cycle number, and Mo/S thickness ratio were independently varied to control the structural and electronic properties of MoS$_2$ thin films. The successful epitaxial growth of atomically uniform MoS$_2$ directly on Si substrates enables strong interfacial coupling and efficient charge transfer, offering a viable route toward semiconductor-integrated catalytic architectures. X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption analyses reveal that higher annealing temperatures and excessive deposition cycles enhance crystallinity but reduce edge-site density and electrical conductivity, leading to diminished hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. In contrast, intermediate cycle numbers and sulfur-deficient growth conditions yield heterostructures composed of MoS$_2$ with residual metallic Mo and sulfur vacancies, which activate otherwise inert basal planes while providing conductive pathways. These defect-engineered films deliver the best catalytic performance, achieving overpotentials as low as -0.33 V at -10 mA cm$^{-2}$, enlarged electrochemical surface area (ECSA) up to 8.0 cm$^2$, and mass-based turnover frequencies exceeding 23 mmol H$_2$ g$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$, more than double those of stoichiometric counterparts. Our findings establish sulfur stoichiometry and growth kinetics as powerful levers to tune the interplay between structural order and catalytic activity in MBE-grown MoS$_2$ and point toward a broader strategy for engineering layered catalysts at the atomic scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite major experimental progresses in time-resolved and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, a quantitative, microscopic framework for interpreting exciton-induced modifications of electronic band structures -- applicable even beyond the low-density limit -- is still lacking. Here we close this gap by introducing a unified approach that links the dynamics of coherent and incoherent excitons to distinct and experimentally observable excitonic sidebands. Our central result is a general, first-principles formula for time-resolved photoemission spectra, applicable across a broad range of temperatures, excitation densities, and pump-probe delays. This advance provides a predictive tool for quantitatively tracking excitonic dynamics in complex materials.</description>

      <title>Charting the Landscape of Oxygen Ion Conductors: A 60-Year Dataset with Interpretable Regression Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen ion conductors are indispensable materials for such as solid oxide fuel cells, sensors, and membranes. Despite extensive research across diverse structural families, systematic data enabling comparative analysis remain scarce. Here, we present a curated dataset of oxygen ion conductors compiled from $84$ experimental reports spanning $60$ years, covering $483$ materials. Each record includes activation energy ($E_a$) and prefactor ($A$) derived from Arrhenius plots, alongside detailed metadata on structure, composition, measurement method, and data source. When the original papers derive these using an erroneous Arrhenius equation $\sigma_T=A\exp{\left(-\frac{E_a}{RT}\right)}$, where ($\sigma_T$ is the oxygen ion conductivity at temperature $T$ and $R$ is the gas constant), we replotted these using the correct one, $\sigma_{T}T=A\exp{\left(-\frac{E_a}{RT}\right)}$. To illustrate how the database can be used, we constructed interpretable regression models for predicting oxygen ionic conductivity. Two symbolic regression models for E_a and A suggest that oxygen ion transport is primarily governed by local coordination environment and the electrostatic interactions, respectively. This dataset establishes a reliable foundation for data-driven discovery and predictive modeling of next-generation oxygen ion conductors.</description>

      <title>Strong Spin-Lattice Interaction in Layered Antiferromagnetic CrCl$_\textrm{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the coupling between lattice vibrations and magnetic order is crucial for controlling properties of two-dimensional magnetic materials. Here, we investigate the vibrational properties of bulk and thick-flake CrCl$_\textrm{3}$ using polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy, complemented by photoluminescence, photoluminescence excitation, and optical absorption measurements. Symmetry analysis, supported by first-principles phonon calculations, enables the unambiguous assignment of all eight Raman-active modes, four $\textrm{A}_\textrm{g}$ and four $\textrm{E}_\textrm{g}$, previously predicted only theoretically. Excitation-energy-dependent measurements reveal that the strong enhancement of selected phonon modes originates primarily from interference effects rather than resonant Raman scattering. Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy further reveals pronounced signatures of spin-phonon coupling across the transition from a fully antiferromagnetic phase, through an intermediate regime with local, domain-like ferromagnetic order, to the paramagnetic phase, accompanied by a clear rhombohedral-to-monoclinic structural transition. Together, these results demonstrate how lattice, electronic, and magnetic degrees of freedom collectively govern the Raman response of CrCl$_\textrm{3}$.</description>

      <title>Connecting bond switching to fracture toughness of calcium aluminosilicate glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fracture toughness is a critical mechanical property of glasses, but a detailed understanding of its link to composition and structure is still missing. Here, focusing on the industrially important family of calcium aluminosilicate glasses, we measure the fracture toughness of two glass series using the single-edge precracked beam method, one based on tectosilicate compositions with varying silica contents and the other covering both percalcic and peraluminous compositions with varying Al/Ca ratio. To elucidate the structural origins of the variation in fracture toughness, we perform X-ray total scattering measurements and molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings show that local coordination changes of especially Al atoms, so-called bond switching, feature an overall positive correlation with fracture toughness. We also compare this variation with that in other mechanical properties, including elastic moduli, hardness, and crack initiation resistance. We find that various structural aspects need to be considered to describe and understand the mechanical properties of calcium aluminosilicate glasses.</description>

      <title>Atomically Resolved Acoustic Dynamics Coupled with Magnetic Order in a van der Waals Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoelastic coupling in van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials enables a unique interplay between the spin and lattice degrees of freedom. Characterizing the elastic responses with atomic and femtosecond resolution across the magnetic transition is essential for guiding the design of magnetically tunable actuators and strain-mediated spintronic devices. Here, ultrafast x-ray diffraction employed at a free-electron laser reveals that the atomic displacements, wave vectors, and dispersion relations of acoustic phonon modes in a vdW antiferromagnet FePS$_3$ are coupled with the magnetic order, by tracking both in-plane and out-of-plane Bragg peaks upon optical excitation across the N\'eel temperature (T$_N$). One transverse mode shows that a quasi-out-of-plane atomic displacement undergoes a significant directional change across T$_N$. Its quasi-in-plane wave vector is derived by the comparison between the measured sound velocity and the first-principles calculations. The other transverse mode is an interlayer shear acoustic mode whose amplitude is strongly enhanced in the antiferromagnetic phase, exhibiting eight times stronger amplitude than the longitudinal acoustic mode below T$_N$. The atomically resolved characterization of acoustic phonon dynamics that couple with magnetic ordering opens opportunities for harnessing unique magnetoelastic coupling in vdW magnets on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Tunable Edelstein effect in intrinsic two-dimensional ferroelectric metal PtBi$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Edelstein effect, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and is therefore highly promising for future spintronic devices, can be realized and non-volatilely manipulated in ferroelectric materials owing to their broken inversion symmetry and switchable polarization states. To date, most ferroelectric systems reported to exhibit the Edelstein effect are semiconductors, requiring extrinsic doping for functionality. In contrast, the Edelstein effect has rarely been reported in metallic ferroelectric systems, where doping is unnecessary. Using first-principles calculations, we predict that a pronounced Edelstein effect can be realized in the recently proposed intrinsic two-dimensional ferroelectric metal PtBi$_{2}$ monolayer, where the sign of the Edelstein coefficient is coupled to the direction of ferroelectric polarization through the polarization-switching-induced reversal of spin textures, thereby enabling non-volatile control of charge-spin conversion. The Edelstein effect reaches a magnitude of $10^{11}~\hbar/(\textup{A} \cdot \textup{cm})$, which is sizable compared to previously reported ferroelectric systems. Microscopically, the Edelstein effect in a PtBi$_2$ monolayer originates from competing contributions of inner Rashba-like electron pockets and outer hole pockets with opposite signs; an upward shift of the Fermi level alters their balance and can reverse the sign of the Edelstein effect. Upon applying biaxial strain, the Fermi-surface electronic structure is strongly modified, resulting in a pronounced change of the Edelstein effect: a 2 \% compressive strain suppresses the Edelstein effect by about 50 \%. Our results not only identify a promising material platform for tunable charge-spin conversion but also provide new insights into the functional potential of metallic ferroelectric systems.</description>

      <title>Fractional Order Thermo Piezoelectric Modelling of qP Wave Interaction and Energy Partition at Welded Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analytical model is developed to investigate the interaction of quasi longitudinal (qP) waves with a perfectly bonded interface between a thermo piezoelectric half space and a functionally graded piezoelectric half space. The formulation is based on the fractional order Lord Shulman generalized thermoelasticity theory, which provides an enhanced description of coupled thermo electro mechanical wave behaviour. Rotational effects are incorporated into the constitutive relations and equations of motion for both media, while the lower half space is assumed to be subjected to initial stress. Closed form solutions for reflection and transmission coefficients are obtained, together with associated energy partition factors, allowing a comprehensive assessment of interface wave characteristics. Numerical simulations carried out using MATLAB demonstrate that the reflection and transmission responses are strongly influenced by initial stress, fractional order parameter, and thermal relaxation time. The calculated energy ratios of scattered waves satisfy the energy conservation condition, confirming the mathematical consistency of the formulation. The findings of this study are relevant to the design and analysis of smart sensors, rotating and aerospace structures, vibration control systems, and energy harvesting devices employing functionally graded thermo piezoelectric materials under fractional order effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active learning for photonic crystals explores the integration of analytic approximate Bayesian last layer neural networks (LL-BNNs) with uncertainty-driven sample selection to accelerate photonic band gap prediction. We employ an analytic LL-BNN formulation, corresponding to the infinite Monte Carlo sample limit, to obtain uncertainty estimates that are strongly correlated with the true predictive error on unlabeled candidate structures. These uncertainty scores drive an active learning strategy that prioritizes the most informative simulations during training. Applied to the task of predicting band gap sizes in two-dimensional, two-tone photonic crystals, our approach achieves up to a 2.6x reduction in required training data compared to a random sampling baseline while maintaining predictive accuracy. The efficiency gains arise from concentrating computational resources on high uncertainty regions of the design space rather than sampling uniformly. Given the substantial cost of full band structure simulations, especially in three dimensions, this data efficiency enables rapid and scalable surrogate modeling. Our results suggest that analytic LL-BNN based active learning can substantially accelerate topological optimization and inverse design workflows for photonic crystals, and more broadly, offers a general framework for data efficient regression across scientific machine learning domains.</description>

One such compound is EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$, which has recently garnered interest due to its strong interplay between the Eu magnetism and charge carriers. However the topology of the electronic band structure, which depends on the ground state magnetic configuration of the europium sublattice, has not been determined. Based on our \textit{ab-initio} calculations, we find that an in-plane and out-of-plane \textit{A}-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order generates a topological crystalline insulator and Dirac semimetal respectively, whereas a ferromagnetic (FM) order stabilizes a Weyl semimetal. Our resonant x-ray elastic scattering measurements of single-crystal thin film EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ reveal both a sharp magnetic peak at $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,\frac{1}{2})$ and broad $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,1)$ below $T_{\mathrm{N}}=12.9$\,K, which is associated with an \textit{A}-type AFM and FM order, respectively. Our measurements indicate that the FM and AFM layers are spatially separated along the crystal $c$ axis, with the former limited to the top three atomic layers. We propose that EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ behaves as a Weyl semimetal in the surface FM layers, and as a topological crystalline insulator in the lower AFM layers.</description>

      <title>Reducing TLS loss in tantalum CPW resonators using titanium sacrificial layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a substantial reduction in two-level system loss in tantalum coplanar waveguide resonators fabricated on high-resistivity silicon substrates through the use of an ultrathin titanium sacrificial layer. A 0.2nm titanium film, deposited atop pre-sputtered {\alpha}-tantalum, acts as a solid-state oxygen getter that chemically modifies the native Ta oxide at the metal-air interface. After device fabrication, the titanium layer is removed using buffered oxide etchant, leaving behind a chemically reduced Ta oxide surface. Subsequent high-vacuum annealing further suppresses two-level system loss. Resonators treated with this process exhibit internal quality factors Qi exceeding an average of 1.5 million in the single-photon regime across ten devices, over three times higher than otherwise identical devices lacking the titanium layer. These results highlight the critical role of interfacial oxide chemistry in superconducting loss and reinforce atomic-scale surface engineering as an effective approach to improving coherence in tantalum-based quantum circuits. The method is compatible with existing fabrication workflows applicable to tantalum films, offering a practical route to further extending T1 lifetimes in superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Many Body Quantum Embedding and Local Correlation in Crystalline Materials using Interpolative Separable Density Fitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient implementation of ab initio many-body quantum embedding and local correlation methods for infinite periodic systems through translational symmetry adapted interpolative separable density fitting, an approach which reduces the scaling of the calculations to only linear with the number of k-points. Employing this methodology, we compute correlated ground-state coupled cluster energies within density matrix embedding and local natural orbital correlation frameworks for both weakly and strongly correlated solids, using up to 1000 k-points. By extrapolating the local correlation domains and k-point sampling we further obtain estimates of the full coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples ground-state energies in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Kondo-assisted N\'eel order in a Kondo necklace model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between Kondo screening and magnetic order has long been a central issue in the physics of strongly correlated systems. While the Kondo effect has traditionally been understood to suppress magnetism through the formation of local singlets, recent studies suggest that Kondo interactions may enhance magnetic order under certain conditions. However, these scenarios often rely on complex electronic structures, including orbital and charge degrees of freedom, making the essential mechanisms difficult to isolate. Here we report the realization of a spin-(1/2,1) Kondo necklace model in a Ni-based complex-a minimal spin-only analog of the Kondo lattice that isolates quantum spin correlations by eliminating charge degrees of freedom. Thermodynamic measurements identify a magnetic phase transition and a field-induced quantum phase transition. Perturbative analysis reveals that the Kondo coupling mediates effective antiferromagnetic interactions between the spin-1 sites, stabilizing the N\'eel order across the entire chain. Our results establish a universal boundary in Kondo physics, where coupling to spin-1/2 moments yields singlets, but to spin-1 and higher stabilizes magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Realization of a triangular spin necklace in a verdazyl-based Ni complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We successfully synthesized a verdazyl-based complex, ($m$-Py-V)$_3$[Ni(NO$_3$)$_2$], in which Ni$^{2+}$ ions and verdazyl radicals form a one-dimensional, triangular spin necklace consisting of spin-1/2 and spin-1 units. Molecular orbital calculations reveal strong antiferromagnetic (AF) interactions between inversion-related radical pairs that form spin-1/2 singlet dimers. The remaining verdazyl and Ni$^{2+}$ spins form frustrated triangular units, creating a distinctive spin network. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements identify a phase transition to an AF order. The application of magnetic fields suppresses the phase transition signal, suggesting field-induced decoupling of the spin-1 moments. Electron spin resonance measurements are used to evaluate the easy-axis anisotropy of spin-1, which may promote the AF order. This work provides a rare example of a geometrically frustrated quantum spin chain realized via molecular design, thereby offering a platform for exploring frustration-driven quantum phases in low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Diffusive and hydrodynamic magnetotransport around a density perturbation in a two-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study current flow around a circular density depletion in a two-dimensional electron gas in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The depletion is parametrized by a power-law tail with an exponent $\beta &gt; 2$. We show that current and electrochemical potential are exponentially suppressed inside a surrounding area much larger than the geometric size of the depletion region. The corresponding ``no-go'' radius grows as a certain power of the magnetic field. Residual current and potential exhibit spiraling patterns inside the no-go region. Outside of it, they acquire corrections inversely proportional to the distance, which is known as the Landauer resistivity dipole. The Landauer dipole is rotated by the angle $\pi (1 - 1 / \beta)$ with respect to the direction of the average electric field. We also consider the effect of electron viscosity and show that the variation of the no-go radius with magnetic field becomes more rapid if viscosity is large enough. In that regime the size of the Landauer dipole is set by the Gurzhi length, which is much larger than the no-go radius, which is in turn much larger than the geometric size of the depletion. Our results may be useful for interpreting nanoimaging of current distribution in graphene and other two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-field simulations are a practical but also expensive tool to calculate microstructural evolution. This work aims to compare explicit time integrators for a broad class of phase-field models involving coupling between the phase-field and concentration. Particular integrators are adapted to constraints on the phase-field as well as storage scheme implications. Reproducible benchmarks are defined with a focus on having exact sharp interface solutions, allowing for identification of dominant error terms. Speedups of 4 to 114 over the classic forward Euler integrator are achievable while still using a fully explicit scheme without appreciable accuracy loss. Application examples include final stage sintering with pores slowing down grain growth as they move and merge over time.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Terahertz Photoresponse via Acoustic Plasmon Cavity Resonances in Scalable Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise control and nanoscale confinement of terahertz (THz) fields are essential requirements for emerging applications in photonics, quantum technologies, wireless communications, and sensing. Here, we demonstrate a polaritonic cavity enhanced THz photoresponse in an antenna coupled device based on chemical vapor deposited (CVD) monolayer graphene. The dipole antenna lobes simultaneously serve as two gate electrodes, concentrate the impinging THz field, and efficiently launch acoustic graphene plasmons (AGPs), which drive a strong photo-thermoelectric (PTE) signal. Between 6 and 90 K, the photovoltage exhibits pronounced peaks, modulating the PTE response by up to 40\%, that we attribute to AGPs forming a Fabry P\'erot THz cavity in the full or half graphene channel. Combined full wave and transport thermal simulations accurately reproduce the gate controlled plasmon wavelength, spatial absorption profile, and the resulting nonuniform electron heating responsible for the PTE response. The lateral and vertical maximum confinement factors of the AGP wavelength relative to the incident wavelength are 165 and 4000, respectively, for frequencies from 1.83 to 2.52 THz. These results demonstrate that wafer scalable CVD graphene, without hBN encapsulation, can host coherent AGP resonances and exhibit an efficient polaritonic enhanced photoresponse under appropriate gating, antenna coupling, and AGP cavity design, opening a route to scalable, polarization and frequency selective, liquid nitrogen cooled, and low power consumption THz detection platforms based on plasmon thermoelectric transduction.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the carbon dioxide hydrate-water interfacial energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon dioxide hydrates are ice-like nonstoichiometric inclusion solid compounds with importance to global climate change, and gas transportation and storage. The thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms that control carbon dioxide nucleation critically depend on hydrate-water interfacial free energy. Interfacial energies show large uncertainties due to the conditions at which experiments are performed. Under these circumstances, we hypothesize that accurate molecular models for water and carbon dioxide combined with computer simulation tools can offer an alternative but complementary way to estimate interfacial energies at coexistence conditions from a molecular perspective. We have evaluated the interfacial free energy of carbon dioxide hydrates at coexistence conditions (three-phase equilibrium or dissociation line) implementing advanced computational methodologies, including the novel Mold Integration methodology. Our calculations are based on the definition of the interfacial free energy, standard statistical thermodynamic techniques, and the use of the most reliable and used molecular models for water (TIP4P/Ice) and carbon dioxide (TraPPE) available in the literature. We find that simulations provide an interfacial energy value, at coexistence conditions, consistent with the experiments from its thermodynamic definition. Our calculations are reliable since are based on the use of two molecular models that accurately predict: (1) The ice-water interfacial free energy; and (2) the dissociation line of carbon dioxide hydrates. Computer simulation predictions provide alternative but reliable estimates of the carbon dioxide interfacial energy. Our pioneering work demonstrates that is possible to predict interfacial energies of hydrates from a truly computational molecular perspective and opens a new door to the determination of free energies of hydrates.</description>

      <title>Observation of an isolated flat band in the van der Waals crystal NbOCl$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dispersionless electronic bands lead to an extremely high density of states and suppressed kinetic energy, thereby increasing electronic correlations and instabilities that can shape emergent ordered states, such as excitonic, ferromagnetic, and superconducting phases. A flat band that extends over the entire momentum space and is well isolated from other dispersive bands is, therefore, particularly interesting. Here, the band structure of the van der Waals crystal NbOCl$_2$ is revealed by utilizing photoelectron momentum microscopy. We directly map out an electronic band that is flat throughout the entire Brillouin zone and features a width of only $\sim$100 meV. This band is well isolated from both the conduction and remote valence bands. Moreover, the quasiparticle band gap shows a high tunability upon the deposition of caesium atoms on the surface. By combining the single-particle band structure with the optical transmission spectrum, the optical gap is identified. The fully isolated flat band in a van der Waals crystal provides a qualitatively new testbed for exploring flat-band physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles study of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) for a wide range of twist angles, with a focus on structural and electronic properties. By employing density functional theory (DFT) with an optimized local basis set, we simulate tBLG, obtaining fully relaxed commensurate structures for twist angles down to 0.987{\deg}. For all angles the lattice relaxation agrees well with continuum elastic models. For angles accessible to plane-wave DFT (VASP), we provide a detailed comparison with our local basis DFT (SIESTA) calculations, demonstrating excellent agreement in both the atomic and electronic structure. The dependence of the Fermi velocity and band width on the twist angle shows qualitative agreement with results from an `exact' $\mathbf{k \cdot p}$ continuum model, but reveals a small twist angle offset. Additionally, we provide details of the low-energy wavefunction character, band inversion and symmetries. Our results provide an ab initio reference point for the microscopic structure and electronic properties of tBLG which will serve as the foundation for future studies incorporating many-body effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive and validate a partition function for low-dimensional systems interacting with a heat bath, addressing the general issue of thermodynamic modeling of nanoscale systems. In contrast to bulk systems in the canonical (NVT) ensemble where the partition function is solely determined by the Hamiltonian of the system and the temperature of the heat bath, our formulation demonstrates that accounting for the interactions with the heat bath is essential for describing the statistical mechanics of low-dimensional materials. To validate our theoretical findings, we develop a molecular dynamics (MD) algorithm for directly modeling the heat bath as a gas reservoir. We first validate our approach using a 1D harmonic oscillator, calculating its length distribution through explicit numerical integration and confirming these results with MD simulations. We then extend our method to investigate the out-of-plane fluctuations of a 2D graphene monolayer immersed in a gas at finite temperature and pressure. Comparisons with conventional NVT ensemble simulations controlled by a thermostat reveal that environmental interactions significantly influence the properties of the 2D material system.</description>

Abstract: VN precipitates used to strengthen ARAFM steels for fusion applications dissolve under high Fe ion irradiation (100 dpa at 10^-3 dpa s^-1, 600 C). This study examined point defects and solute substitutions using atom probe tomography, machine learning interatomic potentials, and density functional theory. Combined with transmission electron microscopy, results show N-vacancies and substitutional Cr exist in VN precipitates before irradiation. Monte Carlo simulations and collision cascade simulations confirm ordered vacancies at operating temperatures help mitigate irradiation damage. However, solute additions disrupt vacancy ordering and enhance irradiation-induced damage, potentially accelerating dissolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A thorough spectroscopic characterisation of two samples of highly hydrogenated monolayer graphene transferred on nickel grids is herein reported. With X ray photoemission spectroscopy on the C 1s core-level, a 100$\%$ $sp^3$ distortion was observed after the hydrogenation of a more $sp^3$-like defected graphene, while a flatter, more $sp^2$-arranged, graphene reached a 62$\%$ $sp^3$ saturation. Electron energy loss spectroscopy showed the $\pi$-plasmon excitation quenching for the 100$\%$ $sp^3$ sample and a significant reduction for the other one. The high loading levels of hydrogenation led to the opening of a wide optical band gap (6.3 and 6.2 eV). The C-H stretching vibrational mode was also observed, as a direct footprint of graphene hydrogenation. Finally, valence band measurements of the 62$\%$ saturated sample suggest the coexistence of one-side and two-side hydrogenation morphologies.</description>

      <title>A new angle on stacking faults: Overcoming the edge-on limit in high-resolution defect analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15510</link>

Abstract: The nature of stacking faults - whether intrinsic or extrinsic - plays a pivotal role in defect-mediated processes in crystalline materials. Yet, current electron microscopy techniques for their reliable analysis remain limited to either conventional fringe-contrast imaging of inclined faults or atomic-resolution imaging of edge-on configurations. Here, we overcome this dichotomy by introducing a high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) method that enables full structural discrimination of inclined stacking faults, as demonstrated for various faults in fcc, $L1_2$, and sphalerite crystals. This approach eliminates a long-standing geometric constraint on high-resolution analysis, providing comprehensive access to stacking faults on all glide planes along the widely used [001] and [110] zone axes. We demonstrate the robustness of the method in a CoNi-based superalloy, achieving clear discrimination of fault types even for overlapping configurations and foil thicknesses exceeding 100 nm. The analysis of bounding dislocations, revealing the fault's formation mechanism, is also presented for inclined geometries. Simulations reveal that fault-induced de-channeling is key to contrast formation and is strongly governed by the fault's depth within the sample. Leveraging this effect, we further establish a route to artificially generate ultrathin TEM lamellae - bounded by the stacking fault itself - thereby enhancing contrast for atomic-scale studies of long-range ordering, compositional fluctuations, and nanoclustering.</description>

      <title>First-principles calculation of electronic and topological properties of low-dimensional tellurium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural, electronic, vibrational, and topological properties of tellurium across its dimensional hierarchy, including bulk trigonal Te-I, two-dimensional tellurene polymorphs, and one-dimensional helical nanowires. Using density functional theory with full inclusion of spin-orbit coupling, we confirm that bulk Te-I is a narrow-gap semiconductor hosting Weyl nodes arising from broken inversion symmetry and degenerate phonon modes suggestive of chiral phonon behavior. In contrast, two-dimensional alpha and beta-tellurene are found to be topologically trivial, with no spin-orbit-driven band inversion in the occupied manifold. Beyond these established phases, we find that buckled kagome and buckled square tellurene lattices exhibit a nontrivial two-dimensional topology of the occupied electronic bands, indicating incipient quantum spin Hall character in metallic systems. In contrast, one-side hydrogen-passivated hexagonal tellurene realizes a fully gapped quantum spin Hall phase with a robust Z2 = 1 invariant, preserved under applied strain and chemical functionalization. In the one-dimensional limit, helical tellurium nanowires preserve chirality and host edge-localized states accompanied by pronounced anisotropy in carrier effective masses. These results establish tellurium as a highly tunable platform for engineering topological phenomena across dimensionality, bridging three-dimensional Weyl physics, two-dimensional quantum spin Hall and incipient Z2 phases, and one-dimensional helical systems.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap -- Imaging Buried Interfaces in Twisted Oxide Moir\'es</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to tune electronic structure in twisted stacks of two-dimensional (2D) materials has motivated the exploration of similar moir\'e physics with twisted oxide membranes. Due to the intrinsic three-dimensional nature of bonding in many oxides, achieving atomic-level coupling is significantly more challenging than with van der Waals materials. Although clean interfaces with atomic-level proximity have been demonstrated in ceramic bicrystals using high-temperature and high-pressure processing to facilitate atomic diffusion that flattens rough interfaces, such conditions are not readily accessible when bonding oxide membranes. This study shows how topographic mismatch due to surface roughness of the membranes can restrict atomic-scale proximity at the interface to isolated patches even after contaminants and amorphous interlayers are eliminated. In interfaces between 2D materials and oxide membranes the reduced ability of the 2D material to conform to the membrane's step-terrace topography also limits atomic-scale contact. When imaging stacked membranes in projection, we find conventional through-focal imaging to be relatively insensitive to the buried interface, whereas electron ptychography detects structural variations on the order of a nanometer. These findings highlight interface roughness as a key challenge for the field of oxide twistronics and emphasize the need for reliable characterization methods, both in cross-section and projection.</description>

      <title>Multimode Jahn-Teller Effect in Negatively Charged Nitrogen-Vacancy Center in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first-principles study of the multimode Jahn-Teller (JT) effect in the exctied $^{3}E$ state of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Using density functional theory combined with an intrinsic distortion path (IDP) analysis, we resolve the full activation pathways of the JT distortion and quantitatively decompose the distortion into contributions from individual vibrational modes. We find that multiple vibrational modes participate cooperatively in the JT dynamics, giving rise to a shallow adiabatic potential energy surface with low barriers, consistent with thermally activated pseudorotation. The dominant JT-active modes are found to closely correspond to vibrational features observed in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES), in agreement with recent ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our results establish a microscopic, mode-resolved picture of vibronic coupling in the excited-state NV center and provide new insight into dephasing, relaxation, and optically driven dynamics relevant to solid-state quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Electric Charge Transport and Dielectric Properties of the Barium Titanate Ceramics Obtained by Spark-Plasma Sintering with Different Carbon Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Barium titanate (BaTiO3) ceramics with a different content of carbon were synthesized by spark-plasma sintering (SPS) at the temperature of 1100 C in vacuum under pressure. The concentration and distribution of carbon impurity inside the samples is estimated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The resistivity vs temperature and electric field dependences of the SPS ceramics with different carbon concentration have been studied. It is shown that their conduction is determined by the variable range hopping mechanism and obeys the Mott law. The density of localized states and localization radius of the electron wave function are determined. The difference in low-temperature resistivity of the SPS ceramics is caused by carbon concentration and connected with it variation of the dielectric permittivity. The relative dielectric permittivity of the SPS ceramics is colossal and reaches the values of 10^5 - 10^6 order. The larger carbon concentration is, the smaller the permittivity and resistivity are within the Mott hopping conduction temperature range. In the range from 250 K to 408 K one observes that the dielectric permittivity strongly increases forming a maximum in all samples, which may be related to the phase transition. Along with this, resistivity manifests a simultaneous sharp decrease. The decrease of resistivity along with the characteristic dependence of resistivity vs dielectric permittivity in the Mott conduction temperature range, evidences the validity of Heywang model for the description of SPS ceramics conduction mechanisms. The resistivity strongly decreases with increasing frequency in the AC regime, which agrees both with models of hopping conduction and effects based on the Maxwell-Wagner model. The studied SPS BaTiO3 ceramics are attractive for applications in energy storage and sensorics.</description>

      <title>Water wave scattering by a surface-mounted rectangular anisotropic elastic plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of water wave scattering by a rectangular anisotropic elastic plate mounted on the ocean surface, with either free, clamped or simply-supported edges. The problem is obtained as an expansion over the dry modes of the elastic plate, which are computed using a Rayleigh--Ritz method. In turn, the component diffraction and radiation problems are solved by formulating a boundary integral equation and solving numerically using a constant panel method. The results are presented to highlight the resonant responses of the plate under different forcing scenarios. In particular, we illustrate how the excitation of certain modes can be forbidden due to symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum Extreme Reservoir Computing for Phase Classification of Polymer Alloy Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to offer new opportunities to process high-dimensional data efficiently by exploiting the exponentially large state space of quantum systems. In this work, we apply quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC) to the classification of microstructure images of polymer alloys generated using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). While previous QML efforts have primarily focused on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, our work demonstrates the applicability of QERC to engineering data with direct materials relevance. Through numerical experiments, we examine the influence of key computational parameters-including the number of qubits, sampling cost (the number of measurement shots), and reservoir configuration-on classification performance. The resulting phase classifications are depicted as phase diagrams that illustrate the phase transitions in polymer morphology, establishing an understandable connection between quantum model outputs and material behavior. These results illustrate QERC performance on realistic materials datasets and suggest practical guidelines for quantum encoder design and model generalization. This work establishes a foundation for integrating quantum learning techniques into materials informatics.</description>
