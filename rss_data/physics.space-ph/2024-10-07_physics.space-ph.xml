      <title>Atmospheres of Solar System Moons and Pluto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The atmospheres within our Solar System can be categorized into four distinct climate regimes: "terrestrial", "Jovian", "condensable", and "exosphere". Beyond the three terrestrial planets (excluding Mercury) and the four giant planets, collisional atmospheres are also found on smaller celestial bodies such as Jupiter's moon Io, Saturn's moon Titan, Neptune's moon Triton, and Pluto. This article reviews the key characteristics of these atmospheres and the underlying physical and chemical processes that govern them. I focus on their thermal structures, chemical constituents, wind patterns, and the origins and losses of the atmospheres, and highlight the critical roles of surface ices and liquids, atmospheric hazes, and the space environments of their host planets in shaping these atmospheres. I dedicated this article to Prof. Zuo Xiao (1936-2024) at Peking University.</description>

      <title>Origins of Very Low Helium Abundance Streams Detected in the Solar Wind Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The abundance of helium ($A_{He}$) in the solar wind exhibits variations typically in the range from 2-5% with respect to solar cycle activity and solar wind velocity. However, there are instances where the observed $A_{He}$ is exceptionally low ($&lt;$ 1%). These low-$A_{He}$ occurrences are detected both near the Sun and at 1 AU. The low $A_{He}$ events are generally observed near the heliospheric current sheet. We analyzed 28 low-$A_{He}$ events observed by the Wind spacecraft and 4 by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) to understand their origin. In this work, we make use of the ADAPT-WSA model to derive the sources of our events at the base of the solar corona. The modeling suggests that the low-$A_{He}$ events originated from the boundaries of coronal holes, primarily from large quiescent helmet streamers. We argue that the cusp above the core of the streamer can produce such very low helium abundance events. The streamer core serves as an ideal location for gravitational settling to occur as demonstrated by previous models, leading to the release of this plasma through reconnection near the cusp, resulting in low $A_{He}$ events. Furthermore, observations from Ulysses provide direct evidence that these events originated from coronal streamers.</description>

      <title>Photospheric hot spots at solar coronal loop footpoints revealed by hyperspectral imaging observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poynting flux generated by random shuffling of photospheric magnetic footpoints is transferred through the upper atmosphere of the Sun where the plasma is heated to over 1 MK in the corona. High spatiotemporal resolution observations of the lower atmosphere at the base of coronal magnetic loops are crucial to better understand the nature of the footpoint dynamics and the details of magnetic processes that eventually channel energy into the corona. Here we report high spatial resolution ($\sim$0.1\arcsec) and cadence (1.33 s) hyperspectral imaging of the solar H$\alpha$ line, acquired by the Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager prototype installed at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, that reveal photospheric hot spots at the base of solar coronal loops. These hot spots manifest themselves as H$\alpha$ wing enhancements, occurring on small spatial scales of $\sim$0.2\arcsec, and timescales of less than 100 s. By assuming that the H$\alpha$ wings and the continuum form under the local thermodynamic equilibrium condition, we inverted the H$\alpha$ line profiles and found that the hot spots are compatible with a temperature increase of about 1000 K above the ambient quiet-Sun temperature. The H$\alpha$ wing integrated Stokes $V/I$ maps indicate that hot spots are related to magnetic patches with field strengths comparable to or even stronger than the surrounding network elements. But they do not show the presence of parasitic polarity magnetic field that would support the interpretation that these hot spots are reconnection-driven Ellerman bombs, we interpret these features as proxies of locations where convection-driven magnetic field intensification in the photosphere can lead to energy transfer into higher layers. We suggest that such hot spots at coronal loop footpoints may be indicative of the specific locations and onset of energy flux injection into the upper atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Forecasting High-Speed Solar Wind Streams from Solar Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar wind, a stream of charged particles originating from the Sun and transcending interplanetary space, poses risks to technology and astronauts. In this work, we present a prediction model to forecast the solar wind speed at the Earth, focusing on high-speed streams (HSSs) and their solar source regions, coronal holes. As input features, we use the coronal hole area, extracted from solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images and mapped on a fixed grid, as well as the solar wind speed 27 days before. We use a polynomial regression model and a distribution transformation to predict the solar wind speed with a lead time of four days. Our forecast achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 68.1 km/s for the solar wind speed prediction and an RMSE of 76.8 km/s for the HSS peak velocity prediction for the period 2010 to 2019. The study shows that a small number of physical features explains most of the solar wind variation, and that focusing on these features with simple but robust machine learning algorithms even outperforms current approaches based on deep neural networks. In addition, we explain why the typically used loss function, the mean squared error, systematically underestimates the HSS peak velocities and effectively aggravates the space weather forecasts in operational settings. We show how a distribution transformation can resolve this issue.</description>

      <title>Provably Positivity-Preserving Constrained Transport (PPCT) Second-Order Scheme for Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes a robust and efficient second-order positivity-preserving constrained transport (PPCT) scheme for ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on non-staggered Cartesian meshes. The PPCT scheme ensures two critical physical constraints: a globally discrete divergence-free (DDF) condition on the magnetic field and the positivity of density and pressure. The method is inspired by a novel splitting technique from [T.A. Dao, M. Nazarov and I. Tomas, J. Comput. Phys., 508:113009, 2024], which divides the MHD system into an Euler subsystem with steady magnetic fields and a magnetic subsystem with steady density and internal energy. To achieve these structure-preserving properties, the PPCT scheme combines a positivity-preserving (PP) finite volume method for the Euler subsystem with a finite difference constrained transport (CT) method for the magnetic subsystem via Strang splitting. The finite volume method employs a new PP limiter that retains second-order accuracy and enforces the positivity of density and pressure, with rigorous proof provided using the geometric quasilinearization (GQL) approach [K. Wu and C.-W. Shu, SIAM Review, 65:1031-1073, 2023]. For the magnetic subsystem, we develop an implicit finite difference CT method that conserves energy and maintains a globally DDF constraint. This nonlinear system is efficiently solved to machine precision using an iterative algorithm. Since the CT method is unconditionally energy-stable and conserves steady density and internal energy, the PPCT scheme requires only a mild CFL condition for the finite volume method to ensure stability and the PP property. While the focus is on 2D cases for clarity, the extension to 3D is discussed. Several challenging numerical experiments, including highly magnetized MHD jets with high Mach numbers, validate the PPCT scheme's accuracy, robustness, and high resolution.</description>

      <title>Dominance of 2-Minute Oscillations near the Alfv\'en Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alfv\'en waves, considered one of the primary candidates for heating and accelerating the fast solar wind, are ubiquitous in spacecraft observations, yet their origin remains elusive. In this study, we analyze data from the first 19 encounters of the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and report dominance of 2-minute oscillations near the Alfv\'en surface. The frequency-rectified trace magnetic power spectral density (PSD) of these oscillations indicates that the fluctuation energy is concentrated around 2 minutes for the ``youngest'' solar wind. Further analysis using wavelet spectrograms reveals that these oscillations primarily consist of outward-propagating, spherically polarized Alfv\'en wave bursts. Through Doppler analysis, we show that the wave frequency observed in the spacecraft frame can be mapped directly to the launch frequency at the base of the corona, where previous studies have identified a distinct peak around 2 minutes ($\sim 8$ mHz) in the spectrum of swaying motions of coronal structures observed by SDO AIA. These findings strongly suggest that the Alfv\'en waves originate from the solar atmosphere. Furthermore, statistical analysis of the PSD deformation beyond the Alfv\'en surface supports the idea of dynamic formation of the otherwise absent $1/f$ range in the solar wind turbulence spectrum.</description>
