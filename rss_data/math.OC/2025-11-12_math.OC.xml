      <title>The pickup and delivery problem with time windows and scheduling on the edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows and Scheduling on the Edges (PDPTW-SE), a generalization of the PDPTW that integrates vehicle routing and machine scheduling. The problem involves defining routes for transportation requests with specific pickup and delivery locations using a heterogeneous vehicle fleet, while machines must be scheduled to traverse certain edges. The objective is to minimize the total completion time subject to capacity, time window, and precedence constraints. We propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) formulation, including preprocessing and valid inequalities, and a multi-start heuristic with a linear programming (LP) improvement procedure. A benchmark set with two instance families is also introduced: (i) coordination of pickups and deliveries across islands requiring cargo ships, and (ii) transport across multiple floors, as in hospitals, requiring elevator scheduling. Computational experiments show that the solver on the MIP formulation solves instances with up to 12 requests and finds feasible solutions for 95.0% of the 320 instances with up to 12 requests. For these, the heuristic consistently provides feasible solutions with low deviations, often matching or outperforming the MIP results. For the remaining 160 instances with 40 and 60 requests, only the heuristic finds feasible solutions. We thus recommend the MIP for short-horizon instances (up to 12 requests) and the heuristic for larger or long-horizon instances. Results also highlight the LP improvement procedure's relevance, reducing solution values by at least 5% on average in general. For larger, tightly constrained instances, an additional machine helps with feasibility and solution quality.</description>

      <title>Geometric Conditions for Lossless Convexification in Fuel-Optimal Control of Linear Systems with Discrete-Valued Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory generation for autonomous systems with discrete-valued actuators is challenging due to the mixed-integer nature of the resulting optimization problems, which are generally intractable for real-time, safety-critical applications. Lossless convexification offers an alternative by reformulating mixed-integer programs as equivalent convex programs that can be solved efficiently with guaranteed convergence. This paper develops a lossless convexification framework for the fuel-optimal control of linear systems with discrete-valued inputs. We extend existing Mayer-form results by showing that, under simple geometric conditions, system normality is preserved when reformulating Lagrange-form problems into Mayer-form. Furthermore, we derive explicit algebraic conditions for normality in systems with cross-polytopic input sets. Leveraging these results and an extreme-point relaxation, we demonstrate that the fuel-optimal control problem admits a lossless convexification, enabling real-time, discrete-valued solutions without resorting to mixed-integer optimization. Numerical results from Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the proposed approach consistently yields discrete-valued control inputs with computation times compatible with real-time implementation.</description>

      <title>Linear Programming Hierarchies Collapse under Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of symmetries is one of the central structural features that make some integer programs challenging for state-of-the-art solvers. In this work, we study the efficacy of Linear Programming (LP) hierarchies in the presence of symmetries. Our main theorem unveils a connection between the algebraic structure of these relaxations and the geometry of the initial integer-empty polytope: We show that under $(k+1)$-transitive symmetries--a measure of the underlying symmetry in the problem--the corresponding relaxation at level $k$ of the hierarchy is non-empty if and only if the initial polytope intersects all $(n-k)$-dimensional faces of the hypercube. In particular, the hierarchies of Sherali-Adams, Lov\'asz-Schrijver, and the Lift-and-Project closure are equally effective at detecting integer emptiness. Our result provides a unifying, group-theoretic characterization of the poor performance of LP-based hierarchies, and offers a simple procedure for proving lower bounds on the integrality gaps of symmetric polytopes under these hierarchies.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing System for Physical Internet Enabled Hyperconnected Less-than-Truckload Freight Logistics Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Less than truckload shipping plays a critical role in modern supply chains by consolidating freight from multiple shippers into shared vehicles. Despite its operational flexibility and potential sustainability benefits, the LTL sector faces persistent challenges, including high per unit costs and financial instability, as evidenced by recent industry bankruptcies. This paper investigates two structural issues limiting LTL performance, including the constrained consolidation potential imposed by proprietary logistics networks, and the inefficiency of fixed pricing models that fail to reflect realtime network conditions. To address these, we explore a Physical Internet enabled, hyperconnected LTL logistics system based on open asset sharing and dynamic flow consolidation. We then propose a dynamic pricing framework tailored for this network. Through a simulation based study grounded in Freight Analysis Framework data and cost estimates from industry sources, we evaluate system performance across three demand and cost uncertainty scenarios in the Southeastern U.S. The results validate our system effectiveness and suggest a promising path forward for building more efficient LTL logistics operations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Containerized Modular Capacity Planning and Resource Allocation in Hyperconnected Supply Chain Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growth of data-driven services and expansion of mobile application usage, traditional methods of capacity and resource planning methods may not be efficient and often fall short in meeting rapid changes in the business landscape. Motivated by modularity, containerization, and open sharing concepts from Physical Internet (PI), this paper proposes an effective approach to determine facility capacity and production schedule to meet current and future demands by dynamically allocating Mobile Production Containers (MPCs). In this work, we develop an iterative two-stage decision making model with dynamic rolling horizon approach. The first stage is capacity planning stage, where the model determines key decisions such as project selection, facility opening periods and project-facility assignment. The second stage is resource planning stage, where the MPC allocation and relocation schedule and weekly production schedule are decided. To validate the proposed model, we conduct a case study over a modular construction supply chain focusing on the southeast US region. The results demonstrate our model not only delivers a consistent production schedule with balanced workload but also enhances resource utilization, leading to cost effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Characterization of regularity via variational stability of alternating projections sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of regular pair $(A,B)$ for two nonempty closed convex subsets $A$ and~$B$ of a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ was introduced by Borwein and Bauschke in 1993 to ensure convergence (in norm) of the alternating projection method to some point of the best approximation set. In 2022, De Bernardi and Miglierina showed that regularity of the pair $(A,B)$ guarantees, additionally, the convergence for any variational perturbation of the alternating projection method, provided the corresponding best approximation sets are bounded. The aim of this paper is to show that the converse assertion is also true.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zhong-Ping Jiang devoted a large part of his work to the study of the stability properties of interconnected systems. In this short paper we celebrate Zhong-Ping Jiang's 60th birthday by studying a special class of families of interconnected systems: the so-called strings. We develop trajectory-based and Lyapunov-based tools that allow the verification of string stability to homogeneous bidirectional strings. The obtained results are applied to the problem of cruise controller design for a string of vehicles.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control is almost Optimal for Heterogeneous Restless Multi-armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general infinite horizon Heterogeneous Restless multi-armed Bandit (RMAB). Heterogeneity is a fundamental problem for many real-world systems largely because it resists many concentration arguments. In this paper, we assume that each of the $N$ arms can have different model parameters. We show that, under a mild assumption of uniform ergodicity, a natural finite-horizon LP-update policy with randomized rounding, that was originally proposed for the homogeneous case, achieves an $O(\log N\sqrt{1/N})$ optimality gap in infinite time average reward problems for fully heterogeneous RMABs. In doing so, we show results that provide strong theoretical guarantees on a well-known algorithm that works very well in practice. The LP-update policy is a model predictive approach that computes a decision at time $t$ by planing over a time-horizon $\{t\dots t+\tau\}$. Our simulation section demonstrates that our algorithm works extremely well even when $\tau$ is very small and set to $5$, which makes it computationally efficient. Our theoretical results draw on techniques from the model predictive control literature by invoking the concept of \emph{dissipativity} and generalize quite easily to the more general weakly coupled heterogeneous Markov Decision Process setting. In addition, we draw a parallel between our own policy and the LP-index policy by showing that the LP-index policy corresponds to $\tau=1$. We describe where the latter's shortcomings arise from and how under our mild assumption we are able to address these shortcomings. The proof of our main theorem answers an open problem posed by (Brown et al 2020), paving the way for several new questions on the LP-update policies.</description>

      <title>Multistart Large Neighborhood Search for the liquefied natural gas transportation and trading over long-term time horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) transportation is a critical component of the energy industry. It enables the efficient and large-scale movement of natural gas across vast distances by converting it into a liquid form, thereby addressing global demand and connecting suppliers with consumers. In this study, we present the Multistart Large Neighborhood Search heuristic for the LNG transportation problem, which involves hundreds of contracts and a planning horizon of two to three years. Our model incorporates several fuel types, LNG sloshing in the tank, and speed- and load-dependent consumption rates. We also consider flexible contracts with LNG volume variability, enabling volume optimizations and multiple discharges. A tensor-train optimizer defines the parameters of Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) models, allowing better solution space exploration. On the historic and artificially generated data, our approach outperforms the baseline linear-programming model by 35% and 44%, respectively, while the time overhead is only several minutes.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Strategies for Singular Dividend Control Problems under the Mean-Variance Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the optimal dividend problem of de Finetti by adding a variance term to the usual criterion of maximizing the expected discounted dividends paid until ruin, in a singular control framework. Investors do not like variability in their dividend distribution, and the mean-variance (MV) criterion balances the desire for large expected dividend payments with small variability in those payments. The resulting MV singular dividend control problem is time-inconsistent, and we follow a game-theoretic approach to find a time-consistent equilibrium strategy. Our main contribution is a new verification theorem for the novel dividend problem, in which the MV criterion is applied to an integral of the control until ruin, a random time that is endogenous to the problem. We demonstrate the use of the verification theorem in two cases for which we obtain the equilibrium dividend strategy (semi-)explicitly, and we provide a numerical example to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Maximizing the Score in "Ticket to Ride"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give two graph-theoretic models and a mixed-integer program to calculate the maximum achievable score in the popular board game "Ticket to Ride." In Ticket to Ride, players compete to claim railway routes on a map, with points awarded based on the length of each route and the successful completion of destination tickets connecting specific city pairs. Each player has 45 train cars available, and each route can be chosen by only one player. Using the mixed-integer programming model, we examine the optimal solution with the 45 allocatable train cars, leading to an optimal score of 285 points. We also calculate the optimal solutions for up to 50 train cars. We determine the most frequently chosen tickets and routes over these 50 instances, giving insight into how optimization might be used to balance games. In particular, we identify several instances in which the point values can be adjusted to better balance the game.</description>

      <title>Solving Quadratic Programs with Slack Variables via ADMM without Increasing the Problem Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximal methods such as the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) are effective at solving constrained quadratic programs (QPs). To tackle infeasible QPs, slack variables are often introduced to ensure feasibility, which changes the structure of the problem, increases its size, and slows down numerical resolution. In this letter, we propose a simple ADMM scheme to tackle QPs with slack variables without increasing the size of the original problem. The only modification is a slightly different projection in the z-update, while the rest of the algorithm remains standard. We prove that the method is equivalent to applying ADMM to the QP with additional slack variables, even though slack variables are not added. Numerical experiments show speedups of the approach.</description>

      <title>Service Rate Control in Queues with Abandonments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Markovian single server queue with impatient customers. There is a customer abandonment cost and a holding cost for customers in the system. We consider two versions of the problem. In the first version, customers pay a reward at the time of arrival whereas in the second version, reward is received at the time of service completion. Service rate attains values in a compact set and there is a cost associated with each service rate. Under these assumptions, our objective is to characterize the service rate policy that maximizes the infinite-horizon discounted reward and the long-run average reward. We show that for systems with an infinite buffer, the optimal service rate policy is monotone. However, the optimal policy is not necessarily monotone when capacity is finite. Furthermore, we prove that the set of possible optimal actions can be reduced to the lower boundary of the convex hull of the action space and develop an efficient policy iteration algorithm. Finally, we show that the optimal service rate converges as the state goes to infinity which allows us to truncate the state space to numerically compute the optimal service rate when system has infinite buffer space.</description>

      <title>Dual MPC for Active Learning of Nonparametric Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript presents a dual model predictive controller (DMPC) that balances the two objectives of dual control, namely, system identification and control. In particular, we propose a Gaussian process (GP)-based MPC that uses the posterior GP covariance for active learning. The DMPC can steer the system towards states that have high covariance, or to the setpoint, thereby balancing system identification and control performance (exploration vs. exploitation). We establish robust constraint satisfaction of the novel DMPC through the use of a contingency plan. We demonstrate the DMPC in a numerical study of a nonlinear system with nonparametric uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Optimal Cash Transfers and Microinsurance to Reduce Social Protection Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Design and implementation of appropriate social protection strategies is one of the main targets of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1: No Poverty. Cash transfer (CT) programmes are considered one of the main social protection strategies and an instrument for achieving SDG 1. Targeting consists of establishing eligibility criteria for beneficiaries of CT programmes. In low-income countries, where resources are limited, proper targeting of CTs is essential for an efficient use of resources. Given the growing importance of microinsurance as a complementary tool to social protection strategies, this study examines its role as a supplement to CT programmes. In this article, we adopt the piecewise-deterministic Markov process introduced in Kovacevic and Pflug (2011) to model the capital of a household, which when exposed to large proportional capital losses (in contrast to the classical Cram\'er-Lundberg model) can push them into the poverty area. Striving for cost-effective CT programmes, we optimise the expected discounted cost of keeping the household's capital above the poverty line by means of injection of capital (as a direct capital transfer). Using dynamic programming techniques, we derive the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation associated with the optimal control problem of determining the amount of capital to inject over time. We show that this equation admits a viscosity solution that can be approximated numerically. Moreover, in certain special cases, we obtain closed-form expressions for the solution. Numerical examples show that there is an optimal level of injection above the poverty threshold, suggesting that efficient use of resources is achieved when CTs are preventive rather than reactive, since injecting capital into households when their capital levels are above the poverty line is less costly than to do so only when it falls below the threshold.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Analysis of Continuous-time Finite-state Mean Field Games with Discounted Payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of continuous-time dynamic games involving a large number of players. Each player selects actions from a finite set and evolves through a finite set of states. State transitions occur stochastically and depend on the player's chosen action. A player's single-stage reward depends on their state, action, and the population-wide distribution of states and actions, capturing aggregate effects such as congestion in traffic networks. Each player seeks to maximize a discounted infinite-horizon reward. Existing evolutionary game-theoretic approaches introduce a model for the way individual players update their decisions in static environments without individual state dynamics. In contrast, this work develops an evolutionary framework for dynamic games with explicit state evolution, which is necessary to model many applications. We introduce a mean field approximation of the finite-population game and establish approximation guarantees. Since state-of-the-art solution concepts for dynamic games lack an evolutionary interpretation, we propose a new concept - the Mixed Stationary Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) - which admits one. We characterize an equivalence between MSNE and the rest points of the proposed mean field evolutionary model and we give conditions for the evolutionary stability of MSNE.</description>

      <title>Local Path Planning with Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance in Unstructured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obstacle avoidance and path planning are essential for guiding unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) through environments that are densely populated with dynamic obstacles. This paper develops a novel approach that combines tangentbased path planning and extrapolation methods to create a new decision-making algorithm for local path planning. In the assumed scenario, a UGV has a prior knowledge of its initial and target points within the dynamic environment. A global path has already been computed, and the robot is provided with waypoints along this path. As the UGV travels between these waypoints, the algorithm aims to avoid collisions with dynamic obstacles. These obstacles follow polynomial trajectories, with their initial positions randomized in the local map and velocities randomized between O and the allowable physical velocity limit of the robot, along with some random accelerations. The developed algorithm is tested in several scenarios where many dynamic obstacles move randomly in the environment. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed local path planning strategy by gradually generating a collision free path which allows the robot to navigate safely between initial and the target locations.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Time-Varying Perturbed Quantum Systems via Reduced Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In practical applications, quantum systems are inevitably subject to significant uncertainties, including unknown initial states, imprecise physical parameters, and unmodeled environmental noise, all of which pose major challenges to robust quantum feedback control. This paper proposes a feedback stabilization strategy based on a reduced quantum filter that achieves robustness against time-varying Hamiltonian perturbations and additional dissipative effects, without requiring prior knowledge of the initial state or exact system parameters. The proposed filter estimates only O(N) real variables corresponding to the diagonal elements of the system density matrix in a quantum non-demolition basis in contrast to the O(N^2) variables required by a full stochastic master equation, where N is the Hilbert space dimension. This dimensionality reduction substantially simplifies real-time computation and feedback implementation while preserving both convergence and robustness guarantees. Rigorous analysis further establishes global exponential stability of the target subspace. The results provide a scalable framework for robust and efficient measurement-based feedback control applicable to high-dimensional perturbed open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Stability of Certainty-Equivalent Adaptive LQR for Linear Systems with Unknown Time-Varying Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard model-based control design deteriorates when the system dynamics change during operation. To overcome this challenge, online and adaptive methods have been proposed in the literature. In this work, we consider the class of discrete-time linear systems with unknown time-varying parameters. We propose a simple, modular, and computationally tractable approach by combining two classical and well-known building blocks from estimation and control: the least mean square filter and the certainty-equivalent linear quadratic regulator. Despite both building blocks being simple and off-the-shelf, our analysis shows that they can be seamlessly combined to a powerful pipeline with stability guarantees. Namely, finite-gain $\ell^2$-stability of the closed-loop interconnection of the unknown system, the parameter estimator, and the controller is proven, despite the presence of unknown disturbances and time-varying parametric uncertainties. Real-world applicability of the proposed algorithm is showcased by simulations carried out on a nonlinear planar quadrotor.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Safety Guarantee for Stochastic Control Systems Using Average Reward MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety in stochastic control systems, which are subject to random noise with a known probability distribution, aims to compute policies that satisfy predefined operational constraints with high confidence throughout the uncertain evolution of the state variables. The unpredictable evolution of state variables poses a significant challenge for meeting predefined constraints using various control methods. To address this, we present a new algorithm that computes safe policies to determine the safety level across a finite state set. This algorithm reduces the safety objective to the standard average reward Markov Decision Process (MDP) objective. This reduction enables us to use standard techniques, such as linear programs, to compute and analyze safe policies. We validate the proposed method numerically on the Double Integrator and the Inverted Pendulum systems. Results indicate that the average-reward MDPs solution is more comprehensive, converges faster, and offers higher quality compared to the minimum discounted-reward solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) provide a promising tool for stability and robustness analysis of multi-input-multi-output systems. In this paper, we provide tools for exact and computable constructions of the SRG for closed linear operators, based on maximum and minimum gain computations. The results are suitable for bounded and unbounded operators, and we specify how they can be used to draw SRGs for the typical operators that are used to model linear-time-invariant dynamical systems. Furthermore, for the special case of state-space models, we show how the Bounded Real Lemma can be used to construct the SRG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The slime mould Physarum polycephalum displays adaptive transport dynamics and network formation that have inspired its use as a model of biological computation. We develop a Lagrangian formulation of Physarum's adaptive dynamics on predefined graphs, showing that steady states arise as extrema of a least-action functional balancing metabolic dissipation and transport efficiency. The organism's apparent ability to find optimal paths between nutrient sources and sinks emerges from minimizing global energy dissipation under predefined boundary conditions that specify the problem to be solved. Applied to ring, tree, and lattice geometries, the framework accurately reproduces the optimal conductance and flux configurations observed experimentally. These results show that Physarum's problem-solving on constrained topologies follows a physics-based variational principle, revealing least-action dynamics as the foundation of its adaptive organization.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Euclidean Two-point Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a bootstrap approach to Euclidean two-point correlators, in the thermal or ground state of quantum mechanical systems. We formulate the problem of bounding the two-point correlator as a semidefinite programming problem, subject to the constraints of reflection positivity, the Heisenberg equations of motion, and the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition or ground-state positivity. In the dual formulation, the Heisenberg equations of motion become "inequalities of motion" on the Lagrange multipliers that enforce the constraints. This enables us to derive rigorous bounds on continuous-time two-point correlators using a finite-dimensional semidefinite or polynomial matrix program. We illustrate this method by bootstrapping the two-point correlators of the ungauged one-matrix quantum mechanics, from which we extract the spectrum and matrix elements of the low-lying adjoint states. Along the way, we provide a new derivation of the energy-entropy balance inequality and establish a connection between the high-temperature two-point correlator bootstrap and the matrix integral bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of DRS as the 2 Operator Resolvent-Splitting and Impossibility of 3 Operator Resolvent-Splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:1802.07534v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the success of Douglas--Rachford splitting (DRS), it is natural to ask whether DRS can be generalized. Are there other 2 operator resolvent-splittings sharing the favorable properties of DRS? Can DRS be generalized to 3 operators? This work presents the answers: no and no. In a certain sense, DRS is the unique 2 operator resolvent-splitting, and generalizing DRS to 3 operators is impossible without lifting, where lifting roughly corresponds to enlarging the problem size. The impossibility result further raises a question. How much lifting is necessary to generalize DRS to 3 operators? This work presents the answer by providing a novel 3 operator resolvent-splitting with provably minimal lifting that directly generalizes DRS.</description>

      <title>Semi-discrete unbalanced optimal transport and quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:1808.01962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the class of optimal entropy-transport problems introduced by Liero, Mielke and Savar\'e in Inventiones Mathematicae 211 in 2018. This class of unbalanced transport metrics allows for transport between measures of different total mass, unlike classical optimal transport where both measures must have the same total mass. In particular, we develop the theory for the important subclass of semi-discrete unbalanced transport problems, where one of the measures is diffuse (absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure) and the other is discrete (a sum of Dirac masses). We characterize the optimal solutions and show they can be written in terms of generalized Laguerre diagrams. We use this to develop an efficient method for solving the semi-discrete unbalanced transport problem numerically. As an application we study the unbalanced quantization problem, where one looks for the best approximation of a diffuse measure by a discrete measure with respect to an unbalanced transport metric. We prove a type of crystallization result in two dimensions -- optimality of a locally triangular lattice with spatially varying density -- and compute the asymptotic quantization error as the number of Dirac masses tends to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of chance-constrained programs in which profit needs to be maximized while enforcing that a given adverse event remains rare. Using techniques from large deviations and extreme value theory, we show how the optimal value scales as the prescribed bound on the violation probability becomes small and how convex programs emerge in the limit. We use our results to analyze the performance of existing popular approaches in the rare-event regime. We show that the popular CVaR and sample approximations have optimality properties under light-tailed assumptions on the randomness, while they behave sub-optimal in a heavy-tailed setting. Our results are derived using large deviations theory, extreme value theory, process techniques, and random set theory.</description>

      <title>Tight MIP Formulations for Optimal Operation and Investment of Storage Including Reserves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast and accurate large-scale energy system models are needed to investigate the potential of storage to complement the fluctuating energy production of renewable energy systems. However, standard Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) models that describe optimal investment and operation of these storage units, including the optional capacity to provide up/down reserves, do not scale well. To improve scalability, the integrality constraints are often relaxed, resulting in Linear Programming (LP) relaxations that allow simultaneous charging and discharging, while this is not feasible in practice. To address this, we derive the convex hull of the solutions for the optimal operation of storage for one time period, as well as for problems including investments and reserves, guaranteeing that no tighter MIP formulation or better LP approximation exists for one time period. When incorporating this convex hull into a multi-period formulation and including it in large-scale energy system models, the improved LP relaxations can better prevent simultaneous charging and discharging, and the tighter MIP could positively affect the solving time. We demonstrate this with illustrative case studies of a unit commitment problem and a transmission expansion planning problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random search methods are widely used for global optimization due to their theoretical generality and implementation simplicity. This paper proposes a depth-first directional search (DFDS) algorithm for globally solving nonconvex optimization problems. Motivated by the penetrating beam of a searchlight, DFDS performs a complete stepping line search along each sampled direction before proceeding to the next, contrasting with existing directional search methods that prioritize broad exploratory coverage. We establish the convergence and computational complexity of DFDS through a novel geometric framework that models the success probability of finding a global optimizer as the surface area of a spherical cap. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate that DFDS achieves significantly higher accuracy in locating the global optimum compared to other random search methods under the same function evaluation budget.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing a smooth function, given as finite sum of black-box functions, over a convex set. In order to advantageously exploit the structure of the problem, for instance when the terms of the objective functions are partially separable, noisy, costly or with first-order information partially accessible, we propose a framework where the penalty decomposition approach is combined with a derivative-free line-search-based method. Under standard assumptions, we state theoretical results showing that the proposed algorithm is well-defined and globally convergent to stationary points. The results of preliminary numerical experiments, performed on test problems with number of variables up to thousands, show the validity of the proposed method compared with a standard derivative-free line-search algorithm. Moreover, it is shown that the method is easily parallelizable and hence capable of taking advantage of parallelization of computation, when possible.</description>

      <title>Barrier relaxations of the classical and quantum optimal transport problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last fifteen years a significant progress was achieved by considering an entropic relaxation of the classical multi-partite optimal transport problem (MPOTP). The entropic relaxation gives rise to the rescaling problem of a given tensor. This rescaling can be achieved fast with the Sinkhorn type algorithms. Recently, it was shown that a similar approach works for the quantum MPOTP. However, the analog of the rescaling Sinkhorn algorithm is much more complicated than in the classical MPOTP. In this paper we show that the interior point method (IPM) for the primary and dual problems of classical and quantum MPOTP problems can be considered as barrier relaxations of the optimal transport problems (OTP). It is well known that the dual of the OTP are advantageous as it has much less variables than the primary problem. The IPM for the dual problem of the classical MPOTP are not as fast as the Sinkhorn type algorithm. However, IPM method for the dual of the quantum MPOTP seems to work quite efficiently.</description>

Abstract: Fixed-point equations with Lipschitz operators have been studied for more than a century, and are central to problems in mathematical optimization, game theory, economics, and dynamical systems, among others. When the Lipschitz constant of the operator is larger than one (i.e., when the operator is expansive), it is well known that approximating fixed-point equations becomes computationally intractable even in basic finite-dimensional settings. In this work, we aim to push these complexity boundaries by introducing algorithms that can address problems with mildly expansive (i.e., with Lipschitz constant slightly larger than one) operators not excluded by existing lower bounds, attaining the best possible fixed-point error up to universal constants. We further introduce a class of \emph{gradually expansive operators} that allow for constant (up to $\approx 1.4$) expansion between points, for which we prove convergence to $\epsilon$-approximate fixed points in order-$(1/\epsilon)$ iterations for $\epsilon &gt; 0.$ Our algorithms automatically adapt to the Lipschitz constant of the operator and attain optimal oracle complexity bounds when the input operator is nonexpansive or contractive. Our results apply to general, possibly infinite-dimensional normed vector spaces and can be extended to non-positively curved geodesic metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Provably data-driven projection method for quadratic programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projection methods aim to reduce the dimensionality of the optimization instance, thereby improving the scalability of high-dimensional problems. Recently, Sakaue and Oki proposed a data-driven approach for linear programs (LPs), where the projection matrix is learned from observed problem instances drawn from an application-specific distribution of problems. We analyze the generalization guarantee for the data-driven projection matrix learning for convex quadratic programs (QPs). Unlike in LPs, the optimal solutions of convex QPs are not confined to the vertices of the feasible polyhedron, and this complicates the analysis of the optimal value function. To overcome this challenge, we demonstrate that the solutions of convex QPs can be localized within a feasible region corresponding to a special active set, utilizing Caratheodory's theorem. Building on such observation, we propose the unrolled active set method, which models the computation of the optimal value as a Goldberg-Jerrum (GJ) algorithm with bounded complexities, thereby establishing learning guarantees. We then further extend our analysis to other settings, including learning to match the optimal solution and input-aware setting, where we learn a mapping from QP problem instances to projection matrices.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantification of Time-Series Prediction Error: Optimal Selection Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty is almost ubiquitous in safety-critical autonomous systems due to dynamic environments and the integration of learning-based components. Quantifying this uncertainty--particularly for time-series predictions in multi-stage optimization--is essential for safe control and verification tasks. Conformal Prediction (CP) is a distribution-free uncertainty quantification tool with rigorous finite-sample guarantees, but its performance relies on the design of the nonconformity measure, which remains challenging for time-series data. Existing methods either overfit on small datasets, or are computationally intensive on long-time-horizon problems and/or large datasets. To overcome these issues, we propose a new parameterization of the score functions and formulate an optimization program to compute the associated parameters. The optimal parameters directly lead to norm-ball regions that constitute minimal-average-radius conformal sets. We then provide a reformulation of the underlying optimization program to enable faster computation. We provide theoretical proofs on both the validity and efficiency of predictors constructed based on the proposed approach. Numerical results on various case studies demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency, with much lower computational requirements.</description>

      <title>Krylov Subspace Acceleration for First-Order Splitting Methods in Convex Quadratic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an acceleration scheme for first-order methods (FOMs) for convex quadratic programs (QPs) that is analogous to Anderson acceleration and the Generalized Minimal Residual algorithm for linear systems. We motivate our proposed method from the observation that FOMs applied to QPs typically consist of piecewise-affine operators. We describe our Krylov subspace acceleration scheme, contrasting it with existing Anderson acceleration schemes and showing that it largely avoids the latter's well-known ill-conditioning issues in regions of slow convergence. We demonstrate the performance of our scheme relative to Anderson acceleration using standard collections of problems from model predictive control and statistical learning applications. We show that our method is faster than Anderson acceleration across the board in terms of iteration count, and in many cases in computation time, particularly for optimal control and for problems solved to high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for interacting particle dynamics for finding mixed equilibria in zero-sum games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.15177v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding equilibrium points in continuous minmax games has become a key problem within machine learning, in part due to its connection to the training of generative adversarial networks and reinforcement learning. Because of existence and robustness issues, recent developments have shifted from pure equilibria to focusing on mixed equilibrium points. In this work we consider a method for finding mixed equilibria in two-layer zero-sum games based on entropic regularisation, where the two competing strategies are represented by two sets of interacting particles. We show that the sequence of empirical measures of the particle system satisfies a large deviation principle as the number of particles grows to infinity, and how this implies convergence of the empirical measure and the associated Nikaid\^o-Isoda error, complementing existing law of large numbers results.</description>

      <title>Certified Robust Invariant Polytope Training in Neural Controlled ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear control system modeled as an ordinary differential equation subject to disturbance, with a state feedback controller parameterized as a feedforward neural network. We propose a framework for training controllers with certified robust forward invariant polytopes, where any trajectory initialized inside the polytope remains within the polytope, regardless of the disturbance. First, we parameterize a family of lifted control systems in a higher dimensional space, where the original neural controlled system evolves on an invariant subspace of each lifted system. We use interval analysis and neural network verifiers to further construct a family of lifted embedding systems, carefully capturing the knowledge of this invariant subspace. If the vector field of any lifted embedding system satisfies a sign constraint at a single point, then a certain convex polytope of the original system is robustly forward invariant. Treating the neural network controller and the lifted system parameters as variables, we propose an algorithm to train controllers with certified forward invariant polytopes in the closed-loop control system. Through two examples, we demonstrate how the simplicity of the sign constraint allows our approach to scale with system dimension to over $50$ states, and outperform state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based sampling approaches in runtime.</description>

Abstract: Thermal states play a fundamental role in various areas of physics, and they are becoming increasingly important in quantum information science, with applications related to semi-definite programming, quantum Boltzmann machine learning, Hamiltonian learning, and the related task of estimating the parameters of a Hamiltonian. Here we establish formulas underlying the basic geometry of parameterized thermal states, and we delineate quantum algorithms for estimating the values of these formulas. More specifically, we establish formulas for the Fisher--Bures and Kubo--Mori information matrices of parameterized thermal states, and our quantum algorithms for estimating their matrix elements involve a combination of classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. These results have applications in developing a natural gradient descent algorithm for quantum Boltzmann machine learning, which takes into account the geometry of thermal states, and in establishing fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a Hamiltonian, when given access to thermal-state samples. For the latter task, and for the special case of estimating a single parameter, we sketch an algorithm that realizes a measurement that is asymptotically optimal for the estimation task. We finally stress that the natural gradient descent algorithm developed here can be used for any machine learning problem that employs the quantum Boltzmann machine ansatz.</description>

      <title>SPO-VCS: An End-to-End Smart Predict-then-Optimize Framework with Alternating Differentiation Method for Relocation Problems in Large-Scale Vehicle Crowd Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ubiquitous mobile devices have catalyzed the development of vehicle crowd sensing (VCS). In particular, vehicle sensing systems show great potential in the flexible acquisition of spatio-temporal urban data through built-in sensors under diverse sensing scenarios. However, vehicle systems often exhibit biased coverage due to the heterogeneous nature of trip requests and routes. To achieve a high sensing coverage, a critical challenge lies in optimally relocating vehicles to minimize the divergence between vehicle distributions and target sensing distributions. Conventional approaches typically employ a two-stage predict-then-optimize (PTO) process: first predicting real-time vehicle distributions and subsequently generating an optimal relocation strategy based on the predictions. However, this approach can lead to suboptimal decision-making due to the propagation of errors from upstream prediction. To this end, we develop an end-to-end Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) framework by integrating optimization into prediction within the deep learning architecture, and the entire framework is trained by minimizing the task-specific matching divergence rather than the upstream prediction error. Methodologically, we formulate the vehicle relocation problem by quadratic programming (QP) and incorporate a novel unrolling approach based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) within the SPO framework to compute gradients of the QP layer, facilitating backpropagation and gradient-based optimization for end-to-end learning. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated by real-world taxi datasets in Hong Kong. Utilizing the alternating differentiation method, the general SPO framework presents a novel concept of addressing decision-making problems with uncertainty, demonstrating significant potential for advancing applications in intelligent transportation systems.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-Order Optimization Finds Flat Minima</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zeroth-order methods are extensively used in machine learning applications where gradients are infeasible or expensive to compute, such as black-box attacks, reinforcement learning, and language model fine-tuning. Existing optimization theory focuses on convergence to an arbitrary stationary point, but less is known on the implicit regularization that provides a fine-grained characterization on which particular solutions are finally reached. We show that zeroth-order optimization with the standard two-point estimator favors solutions with small trace of Hessian, which is widely used in previous work to distinguish between sharp and flat minima. We further provide convergence rates of zeroth-order optimization to approximate flat minima for convex and sufficiently smooth functions, where flat minima are defined as the minimizers that achieve the smallest trace of Hessian among all optimal solutions. Experiments on binary classification tasks with convex losses and language model fine-tuning support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Optimism as Risk-Seeking in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL), where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL (MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice, are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods. Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in MARL.</description>

      <title>Policy Transfer for Continuous-Time Reinforcement Learning: A (Rough) Differential Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies policy transfer, one of the well-known transfer learning techniques adopted in large language models, for two classes of continuous-time reinforcement learning problems. In the first class of continuous-time linear-quadratic systems with Shannon's entropy regularization (a.k.a. LQRs), we fully exploit the Gaussian structure of their optimal policy and the stability of their associated Riccati equations. In the second class where the system has possibly non-linear and bounded dynamics, the key technical component is the stability of diffusion SDEs which is established by invoking the rough path theory. Our work provides the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for continuous-time RL: an optimal policy learned for one RL problem can be used to initialize the search for a near-optimal policy in a closely related RL problem, while maintaining the convergence rate of the original algorithm.
  To illustrate the benefit of policy transfer for RL, we propose a novel policy learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs, which achieves global linear convergence and local super-linear convergence. As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a concrete class of continuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.</description>
