      <title>Statistical QoS Provisioning for Underwater Magnetic Induction Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic induction (MI) communication, with stable channel conditions and small antenna size, is considered as a promising solution for underwater communication network. However, the narrowband nature of the MI link can cause significant delays in the network. To comprehensively ensure the timeliness and effectiveness of the MI network, in this paper we introduce a statistical quality of service (QoS) framework for MI communication, aiming to maximize the achievable rate while provisioning delay and queue-length requirements. Specifically, we employ effective capacity theory to model underwater MI communication. Based on convex optimization theory, we propose a current control strategy that maximizes the effective capacity under the constraints of limited channel capacity and limited power. Simulations demonstrate that the current control strategy proposed for MI communication differs significantly from that in the conventional statistical QoS provisioning framework. In addition, compared to other current control strategies, the proposed strategy substantially improves the achievable rate under various delay QoS requirements.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication for 6G Holographic Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of 6G networks, offering ultra-high bandwidth and ultra-low latency, coupled with the enhancement of terminal device resolutions, holographic communication is gradually becoming a reality. Holographic digital twin (HDT) is considered one of key applications of holographic communication, capable of creating virtual replicas for real-time mapping and prediction of physical entity states, and performing three-dimensional reproduction of spatial information. In this context, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is expected to be a crucial pathway for providing data sources to HDT. This paper proposes a four-layer architecture assisted by ISAC for HDT, integrating emerging paradigms and key technologies to achieve low-cost, high-precision environmental data collection for constructing HDT. Specifically, to enhance sensing resolution, we explore super-resolution techniques from the perspectives of parameter estimation and point cloud construction. Additionally, we focus on multi-point collaborative sensing for constructing HDT, and provide a comprehensive review of four key techniques: node selection, multi-band collaboration, cooperative beamforming, and data fusion. Finally, we highlight several interesting research directions to guide and inspire future work.</description>

      <title>Virtual Encounters of the Haptic Kind: Towards a Multi-User VR System for Real-Time Social Touch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical touch, a fundamental aspect of human social interaction, remains largely absent in real-time virtual communication. We present a haptic-enabled multi-user Virtual Reality (VR) system that facilitates real-time, bi-directional social touch communication among physically distant users. We developed wearable gloves and forearm sleeves, embedded with 26 vibrotactile actuators for each hand and arm, actuated via a WiFi-based communication system. The system enables VR-transmitted data to be universally interpreted by haptic devices, allowing feedback rendering based on their capabilities. Users can perform and receive social touch gestures such as stroke, pat, poke, and squeeze, with other users within a shared virtual space or interact with other virtual objects, and they receive vibrotactile feedback. Through a two-part user study involving six pairs of participants, we investigate the impact of gesture speed, haptic feedback modality, and user roles, during real-time haptic communication in VR, on affective and sensory experiences, as well as evaluate the overall system usability. Our findings highlight key design considerations that significantly improve affective experiences, presence, embodiment, pleasantness, and naturalness, to foster more immersive and expressive mediated social touch experiences in VR.</description>

      <title>The Energy Cost of Artificial Intelligence of Things Lifecycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) coupled with the existing Internet of Things (IoT) enables more autonomous operations across various economic sectors. While this paradigm shift results in increased energy consumption it is difficult to quantify the end-to-end energy consumption of such systems with the conventional metrics as they either focus on the communication, the computation infrastructure or model development. To address this, we propose a new metric, the Energy Cost of AI lifecycle (eCAL). eCAL captures the energy consumption throughout the architectural components and lifecycle of an AI-powered wireless system by analyzing the complexity of data collection and manipulation in individual components and deriving overall and per-bit energy consumption. We show that the better a model and the more it is used, the more energy efficient an inference is. For an example Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) configuration, eCAL for making 100 inferences is 2.73 times higher than for 1000 inferences. Additionally, we developed a modular open source simulation tool to enable researchers, practitioners, and engineers to calculate the end-to-end energy cost with various configurations and across various systems, ensuring adaptability to diverse use cases.</description>

      <title>Hands-on STEM Learning Experiences using Digital Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The facilitation of STEM education can be enhanced by the provision of opportunities for learners to gain a better understanding of science through the utilization of tangible and visual examples. The objective of this work is to present an account of our experiences and activities carried out in Italian schools with this novel approach. The selection of projects and experiences discussed --in which students develop a range of core competencies such as collaboration, creativity, critical thinking, experimentation, prototyping, communication and problem-solving; include tangible complex 3D printed structures, large micro-controller board replicas and the visualization of wind dynamics and tiny invisible elementary particles among others. These hands-on experiences demonstrate the benefits on the use of digital fabrication technologies implemented within a FabLab for STEM learning.</description>
