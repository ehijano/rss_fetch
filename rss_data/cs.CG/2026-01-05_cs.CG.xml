      <title>An Output Sensitive Algorithm for Discrete Convex Hulls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\def\DD{{{\bf \delta}}}\def\CH{{\mathop{\mathrm{ConvexHull}}}}\newcommand{\LL}{{\cal {L}}} \newcommand{\ZZ}{\mathbb{Z}} $ Given a convex body $C$ in the plane, its discrete hull is $C^0 = \CH( C \cap \LL )$, where $\LL = \ZZ \times \ZZ$ is the integer lattice. We present an $O( |C^0| \log \DD(C) )$-time algorithm for calculating the discrete hull of $C$, where $|C^0|$ denotes the number of vertices of $C^0$, and $\DD(C)$ is the diameter of $C$. Actually, using known combinatorial bounds, the running time of the algorithm is $O(\DD(C)^{2/3} \log{\DD(C)})$. In particular, this bound applies when $C$ is a disk.</description>

      <title>On the Largest Convexity Number of Co-Finite Sets in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convexity number of a set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is the minimum number of convex subsets required to cover it. We study the following question: what is the largest possible convexity number $f(n)$ of $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus S$, where $S$ is a set of $n$ points in general position in the plane? We prove that for all $n \geq 4$, $\lfloor\frac{n+5}{2}\rfloor \leq f(n) \leq \frac{7n+44}{11}$. We also show that for every $n \geq 4$, if the points of $S$ are in convex position then the convexity number of $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus S$ is $\lfloor\frac{n+5}{2}\rfloor$. This solves a problem of Lawrence and Morris [Finite sets as complements of finite unions of convex sets, Disc. Comput. Geom. 42 (2009), 206-218].</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Detection and Uncertainty Visualization of Atmospheric Blocking Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric blocking events are quasi-stationary high-pressure systems that disrupt the typical paths of polar and subtropical air currents, often producing prolonged extreme weather events such as summer heat waves or winter cold spells. Despite their critical role in shaping mid-latitude weather, accurately modeling and analyzing blocking events in long meteorological records remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we present an uncertainty visualization framework for detecting and characterizing atmospheric blocking events. First, we introduce a geometry-based detection and tracking method, evaluated on both pre-industrial climate model simulations (UKESM) and reanalysis data (ERA5), which represent historical Earth observations assimilated from satellite and station measurements onto regular numerical grids using weather models. Second, we propose a suite of uncertainty-aware summaries: contour boxplots that capture representative boundaries and their variability, frequency heatmaps that encode occurrences, and 3D temporal stacks that situate these patterns in time. Third, we demonstrate our framework in a case study of the 2003 European heatwave, mapping the spatiotemporal occurrences of blocking events using these summaries. Collectively, these uncertainty visualizations reveal where blocking events are most likely to occur and how their spatial footprints evolve over time. We envision our framework as a valuable tool for climate scientists and meteorologists: by analyzing how blocking frequency, duration, and intensity vary across regions and climate scenarios, it supports both the study of historical blocking events and the assessment of scenario-dependent climate risks associated with changes in extreme weather linked to blocking.</description>

      <title>Braiding vineyards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce and study what we believe is an intriguing and, to the best of our knowledge, previously unknown connection between two areas in computational topology, topological data analysis (TDA) and knot theory. Given a function from a topological space to $\mathbb{R}$, TDA provides tools to simplify and study the importance of topological features: in particular, the $l^{th}$-dimensional persistence diagram encodes the $l$-homology in the sublevel set as the function value increases as a set of points in the plane. Given a continuous one-parameter family of such functions, we can combine the persistence diagrams into an object known as a vineyard, which track the evolution of points in the persistence diagram. If we further restrict that family of functions to be periodic, we identify the two ends of the vineyard, yielding a closed vineyard. This allows the study of monodromy, which in this context means that following the family of functions for a period permutes the set of points in a non-trivial way. In this work, given a link and value $l$, we construct a topological space and periodic family of functions such that the closed $l$-vineyard contains this link. This shows that vineyards are topologically as rich as one could possibly hope. Importantly, it has at least two immediate consequences: First, monodromy of any periodicity can occur in a $l$-vineyard, answering a variant of a question by [Arya et al 2024]. To exhibit this, we also reformulate monodromy in a more geometric way, which may be of interest in itself. Second, distinguishing vineyards is likely to be difficult given the known difficulty of knot and link recognition, which have strong connections to many NP-hard problems.</description>

      <title>New Sufficient Conditions for Linear-Sized Epsilon-Nets and $(p,2)$-Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An $\epsilon$-net theorem for a hypergraph upper bounds the minimum size of a vertex set that pierces all $\epsilon$-heavy hyperedges. A $(p,2)$-theorem bounds from above the minimum size of a vertex set that pierces all hyperedges, in terms of the maximum size of a set of pairwise disjoint hyperedges. Numerous works studied $\epsilon$-net theorems and $(p,2)$-theorems that guarantee the existence of small-sized piercing sets.
  We focus on the question: In which settings the asymptotically smallest possible piercing sets -- i.e., $\epsilon$-nets of size $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ and piercing sets of size $O(p)$ in $(p,2)$-theorems, are guaranteed? We obtain several sufficient criteria for the existence of such linear $\epsilon$-net theorems and $(p,2)$-theorems that unveil interesting connections to graph theory and improve and generalize several previous results. Most notably, we exhibit an unexpected relation of $\epsilon$-nets to the classical Zarankiewicz's problem in graph theory. We show that a linear bound in the Zarankiewicz-type problem that asks for the maximum size of a bipartite graph with no copy of $K_{2,t}$, implies a linear $\epsilon$-net theorem for the corresponding neighborhood hypergraph. We also show that hypergraphs with a hereditarily linear-sized Delaunay graph admit an almost linear $(p,2)$-theorem, and deduce that incidence hypergraphs of non-piercing regions in the plane admit a linear $(p,2)$-theorem, significantly improving previous results on such hypergraphs.
  Our work presents a landscape of sufficient conditions for the existence of linear $\epsilon$-net theorems and $(p,2)$-theorems, with complex interrelations between them. Many of the interrelations are still unknown and call for future research.</description>
