      <title>Contrastive Dimension Reduction: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive dimension reduction (CDR) methods aim to extract signal unique to or enriched in a treatment (foreground) group relative to a control (background) group. This setting arises in many scientific domains, such as genomics, imaging, and time series analysis, where traditional dimension reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) may fail to isolate the signal of interest. In this review, we provide a systematic overview of existing CDR methods. We propose a pipeline for analyzing case-control studies together with a taxonomy of CDR methods based on their assumptions, objectives, and mathematical formulations, unifying disparate approaches under a shared conceptual framework. We highlight key applications and challenges in existing CDR methods, and identify open questions and future directions. By providing a clear framework for CDR and its applications, we aim to facilitate broader adoption and motivate further developments in this emerging field.</description>

      <title>Learning Latent Energy-Based Models via Interacting Particle Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop interacting particle algorithms for learning latent variable models with energy-based priors. To do so, we leverage recent developments in particle-based methods for solving maximum marginal likelihood estimation (MMLE) problems. Specifically, we provide a continuous-time framework for learning latent energy-based models, by defining stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that provably solve the MMLE problem. We obtain a practical algorithm as a discretisation of these SDEs and provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our method on synthetic and image datasets.</description>

      <title>Dendrograms of Mixing Measures for Softmax-Gated Gaussian Mixture of Experts: Consistency without Model Sweeps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified statistical framework for softmax-gated Gaussian mixture of experts (SGMoE) that addresses three long-standing obstacles in parameter estimation and model selection: (i) non-identifiability of gating parameters up to common translations, (ii) intrinsic gate-expert interactions that induce coupled differential relations in the likelihood, and (iii) the tight numerator-denominator coupling in the softmax-induced conditional density. Our approach introduces Voronoi-type loss functions aligned with the gate-partition geometry and establishes finite-sample convergence rates for the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). In over-specified models, we reveal a link between the MLE's convergence rate and the solvability of an associated system of polynomial equations characterizing near-nonidentifiable directions. For model selection, we adapt dendrograms of mixing measures to SGMoE, yielding a consistent, sweep-free selector of the number of experts that attains pointwise-optimal parameter rates under overfitting while avoiding multi-size training. Simulations on synthetic data corroborate the theory, accurately recovering the expert count and achieving the predicted rates for parameter estimation while closely approximating the regression function. Under model misspecification (e.g., $\epsilon$-contamination), the dendrogram selection criterion is robust, recovering the true number of mixture components, while the Akaike information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion, and the integrated completed likelihood tend to overselect as sample size grows. On a maize proteomics dataset of drought-responsive traits, our dendrogram-guided SGMoE selects two experts, exposes a clear mixing-measure hierarchy, stabilizes the likelihood early, and yields interpretable genotype-phenotype maps, outperforming standard criteria without multi-size training.</description>

      <title>Beyond the noise: intrinsic dimension estimation with optimal neighbourhood identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Intrinsic Dimension (ID) is a key concept in unsupervised learning and feature selection, as it is a lower bound to the number of variables which are necessary to describe a system. However, in almost any real-world dataset the ID depends on the scale at which the data are analysed. Quite typically at a small scale, the ID is very large, as the data are affected by measurement errors. At large scale, the ID can also be erroneously large, due to the curvature and the topology of the manifold containing the data. In this work, we introduce an automatic protocol to select the sweet spot, namely the correct range of scales in which the ID is meaningful and useful. This protocol is based on imposing that for distances smaller than the correct scale the density of the data is constant. In the presented framework, to estimate the density it is necessary to know the ID, therefore, this condition is imposed self-consistently. We illustrate the usefulness and robustness of this procedure by benchmarks on artificial and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>A Principled Approach to Bayesian Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Updating $\textit{a priori}$ information given some observed data is the core tenet of Bayesian inference. Bayesian transfer learning extends this idea by incorporating information from a related dataset to improve the inference on the observed target dataset which may have been collected under slightly different settings. The use of related information can be useful when the target dataset is scarce, for example. There exist various Bayesian transfer learning methods that decide how to incorporate the related data in different ways. Unfortunately, there is no principled approach for comparing Bayesian transfer methods in real data settings. Additionally, some Bayesian transfer learning methods, such as the so-called power prior approaches, rely on conjugacy or costly specialised techniques. In this paper, we find an effective approach to compare Bayesian transfer learning methods is to apply leave-one-out cross validation on the target dataset. Further, we introduce a new framework, $\textit{transfer sequential Monte Carlo}$, that efficiently implements power prior methods in an automated fashion. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed methods in two comprehensive simulation studies.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Sliced Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sliced Optimal Transport (SOT) is a rapidly developing branch of optimal transport (OT) that exploits the tractability of one-dimensional OT problems. By combining tools from OT, integral geometry, and computational statistics, SOT enables fast and scalable computation of distances, barycenters, and kernels for probability measures, while retaining rich geometric structure. This paper provides a comprehensive review of SOT, covering its mathematical foundations, methodological advances, computational methods, and applications. We discuss key concepts of OT and one-dimensional OT, the role of tools from integral geometry such as Radon transform in projecting measures, and statistical techniques for estimating sliced distances. The paper further explores recent methodological advances, including non-linear projections, improved Monte Carlo approximations, statistical estimation techniques for one-dimensional optimal transport, weighted slicing techniques, and transportation plan estimation methods. Variational problems, such as minimum sliced Wasserstein estimation, barycenters, gradient flows, kernel constructions, and embeddings are examined alongside extensions to unbalanced, partial, multi-marginal, and Gromov-Wasserstein settings. Applications span machine learning, statistics, computer graphics and computer visions, highlighting SOT's versatility as a practical computational tool. This work will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in machine learning, data sciences, and computational disciplines seeking efficient alternatives to classical OT.</description>

      <title>Examining the Interface Design of Tidyverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tidyverse is a popular meta-package comprising several core R packages to aid in various data science tasks, including data import, manipulation and visualisation. Although functionalities offered by the tidyverse can generally be replicated using other packages, its widespread adoption in both teaching and practice indicates there are factors contributing to its preference, despite some debate over its usage. This suggests that particular aspects, such as interface design, may play a significant role in its selection. Examining the interface design can potentially reveal aspects that aid the design process for developers. While Tidyverse has been lauded for adopting a user-centered design, arguably some elements of the design focus on the work domain instead of the end-user. We examine the Tidyverse interface design via the lens of human computer interaction, with an emphasis on data visualisation and data wrangling, to identify factors that might serve as a model for developers designing their packages. We recommend that developers adopt an iterative design that is informed by user feedback, analysis and complete coverage of the work domain, and ensure perceptual visibility of system constraints and relationships.</description>
