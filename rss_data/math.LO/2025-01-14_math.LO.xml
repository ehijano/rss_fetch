      <title>A Banach space with $L$-orthogonal sequences but without $L$-orthogonal elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the existence of Banach spaces with $L$-orthogonal sequences but without $L$-orthogonal elements is independent of the standard foundation of Mathematics, ZFC. This provides a definitive answer to \cite[Question~1.1]{AvilesMartinezRueda}. Generalizing classical $Q$-point ultrafilters, we introduce the notion of $Q$-measures and provide several results generalizing former theorems by Miller \cite{Miller} and Bartoszynski \cite{Bartoszynski} for $Q$-point ultrafilters.</description>

      <title>Monk Algebras and Representability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ``Monk Algebras and Ramsey Theory,'' \emph{J. Log. Algebr. Methods Program.} (2022), Kramer and Maddux prove various representability results in furtherance of the goal of finding the smallest weakly representable but not representable relation algebra. They also pose many open problems.
  In the present paper, we address problems and issues raised by Kramer and Maddux. In particular, we prove that their Proposition 7 does not generalize, and we answer Problem 1.1 in the negative: relation algebra $1311_{1316}$ is not representable. Thus $1311_{1316}$ is a good candidate for the smallest weakly representable but not representable relation algebra.
  Finally, we give the first known finite cyclic group representations for relation algebras $31_{37}$, $32_{65}$, $1306_{1314}$, and $1314_{1316}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if a locally finite Borel graph with quasitransitive amenable components admits a fractional perfect matching, it will admit a Borel fractional perfect matching. In particular, if a countable amenable quasitransitive graph admits a fractional perfect matching then its Bernoulli graph admits a Borel fractional perfect matching.</description>

      <title>On the axiomatisability of the dual of compact ordered spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the category of Nachbin's compact ordered spaces and order-preserving continuous maps between them is dually equivalent to a variety of algebras, with operations of at most countable arity. Furthermore, we show that the countable bound on the arity is the best possible: the category of compact ordered spaces is not dually equivalent to any variety of finitary algebras. Indeed, the following stronger results hold: the category of compact ordered spaces is not dually equivalent to (i) any finitely accessible category, (ii) any first-order definable class of structures, (iii) any class of finitary algebras closed under products and subalgebras. An explicit equational axiomatisation of the dual of the category of compact ordered spaces is obtained; in fact, we provide a finite one, meaning that our description uses only finitely many function symbols and finitely many equational axioms. In preparation for the latter result, we establish a generalisation of a celebrated theorem by D. Mundici: our result asserts that the category of unital commutative distributive lattice-ordered monoids is equivalent to the category of what we call MV-monoidal algebras. Our proof is independent of Mundici's theorem.</description>

      <title>Probability Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a formal definition of the concept of probability tree and conduct a detailed and comprehensive study of its fundamental structural properties. In particular, we define what we term an inductive probability measure and prove that such trees can be identified with these measures. Furthermore, we prove that probability trees are completely determined by probability measures on the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of the tree's body.
  We then explore applications of probability trees in several areas of mathematics, including probability theory, measure theory, and set theory. In the first, we show that the cumulative distribution of finitely many dependent and non-identically distributed Bernouli tests is bounded by the cumulative distribution of some binomial distribution. In the second, we establish a close relationship between probability trees and the real line, showing that Borel, measurable sets, and their measures can be preserved, as well as other combinatorial properties. Finally, in set theory, we establish that the null ideal associated with suitable probability trees is Tukey equivalent to the null ideal on $[0, 1]$. This leads to a new elementary proof of the fact that the null ideal of a free $\sigma$-finite Borel measure on a Polish space is Tukey equivalent with the null ideal of $\mathbb{R}$, which supports that the associated cardinal characteristics remain invariant across the spaces in which they are defined.</description>

      <title>On the Logical and Algebraic Aspects of Reasoning with Formal Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A formal context consists of objects, properties, and the incidence relation between them. Various notions of concepts defined with respect to formal contexts and their associated algebraic structures have been studied extensively, including formal concepts in formal concept analysis (FCA), rough concepts arising from rough set theory (RST), and semiconcepts and protoconcepts for dealing with negation. While all these kinds of concepts are associated with lattices, semiconcepts and protoconcepts additionally yield an ordered algebraic structure, called double Boolean algebras. As the name suggests, a double Boolean algebra contains two underlying Boolean algebras.
  In this paper, we investigate logical and algebraic aspects of the representation and reasoning about different concepts with respect to formal contexts. We present two-sorted modal logic systems \textbf{KB} and \textbf{KF} for the representation and reasoning of rough concepts and formal concepts respectively. Then, in order to represent and reason about both formal and rough concepts in a single framework, these two logics are unified into a two-sorted Boolean modal logic \textbf{BM}, in which semiconcepts and protoconcepts are also expressible. Based on the logical representation of semiconcepts and protoconcepts, we prove the characterization of double Boolean algebras in terms of their underlying Boolean algebras. Finally, we also discuss the possibilities of extending our logical systems for the representation and reasoning of more fine-grained information in formal contexts.</description>

Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to show the interconnections between {\L}ukasiewicz logic and algebraic geometry using algebraic, geometric and logical instruments. We continue our investigation into a new algebraic geometry based on idempotent semifields, in particular those related with MV-algebras, describing categorical equivalence between different structures related to tropical geometry and many valued logics. Further, we describe such connections in terms of topoi.</description>

      <title>Local tabularity in MS4 with Casari's axiom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study local tabularity (local finiteness) in some extensions of $\mathsf{MS4}$ (monadic $\mathsf{S4}$) that include products of transitive modal logics. Our main results are a syntactic characterization of local finiteness in varieties of $\mathsf{M^{+}S4}$-algebras, where $\mathsf{M^{+}S4}$ denotes the extension of $\mathsf{MS4}$ by the Casari axiom, and $(\mathsf{S4}[2] \times \mathsf{S5})$-algebras. For the latter, we demonstrate that our methods cannot be extended beyond depth 2, as we give a translation of the fusion $\mathsf{S5}_2$ into $\mathsf{S4}[n] \times \mathsf{S5}$ for $n \geq 3$ that preserves and reflects local finiteness, suggesting that a characterization there is difficult. We also establish the finite model property for some of these logics which are not known to be locally tabular.</description>

      <title>Semitopology: a topological approach to decentralised collaborative action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09287v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce semitopology, a generalisation of point-set topology that removes the restriction that intersections of open sets need necessarily be open. The intuition is that points represent participants in a decentralised system, and open sets represent collections of participants that collectively have the authority to collaborate to update their local state; we call this an actionable coalition.
  Examples of actionable coalition include: majority stakes in proof-of-stake blockchains; communicating peers in peer-to-peer networks; and even pedestrians working together to not bump into one another in the street. Where actionable coalitions exist, they have in common that: collaborations are local (updating the states of the participants in the coalition, but not immediately those of the whole system); collaborations are voluntary (up to and including breaking rules); participants may be heterogeneous in their computing power or in their goals (not all pedestrians want to go to the same place); participants can choose with whom to collaborate; and they are not assumed subject to permission or synchronisation by a central authority.
  We develop a topology-flavoured mathematics that goes some way to explaining how and why these complex decentralised systems can exhibit order, and gives us new ways to understand existing practical implementations.</description>

      <title>On the Completeness of Interpolation Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Craig interpolation is a fundamental property of classical and non-classic logics with a plethora of applications from philosophical logic to computer-aided verification. The question of which interpolants can be obtained from an interpolation algorithm is of profound importance. Motivated by this question, we initiate the study of completeness properties of interpolation algorithms. An interpolation algorithm $\mathcal{I}$ is \emph{complete} if, for every semantically possible interpolant $C$ of an implication $A \to B$, there is a proof $P$ of $A \to B$ such that $C$ is logically equivalent to $\mathcal{I}(P)$. We establish incompleteness and different kinds of completeness results for several standard algorithms for resolution and the sequent calculus for propositional, modal, and first-order logic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of pro-Lie Polish abelian groups from the perspective of homological algebra. We extend to this context the type-decomposition of locally compact Polish abelian groups of Hoffmann and Spitzweck, and prove that the category $\mathbf{proLiePAb}$ of pro-Lie Polish abelian groups is a thick subcategory of the category of Polish abelian groups. We completely characterize injective and projective objects in $\mathbf{proLiePAb}$. We conclude that $\mathbf{proLiePAb}$ has enough projectives but not enough injectives and homological dimension $1$. We also completely characterize injective and projective objects in the category of non-Archimedean Polish abelian groups, concluding that it has enough injectives and projectives and homological dimension $1$. Injective objects are also characterized for the categories of topological torsion Polish abelian groups and for Polish abelian topological $p$-groups, showing that these categories have enough injectives and homological dimension $1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we further the study of arrow algebras, simple algebraic structures inducing toposes through the tripos-to-topos construction, by defining appropriate notions of morphisms between them which correspond to morphisms of the associated triposes. Specializing to geometric inclusions, we characterize subtriposes of an arrow tripos in terms of nuclei on the underlying arrow algebra, recovering a classical locale-theoretic result. As an example of application, we lift modified realizability to the setting of arrow algebras, and we establish its functoriality.</description>

      <title>Matroid intersection and packing/covering conjectures are true in the class of finitary matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two finite matroids on the same ground set, a celebrated result of Edmonds says that the ground set can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets in a manner that there is a common independent set in both matroids whose intersection with the first subset spans that subset in the first matroid, and whose intersection with the second subset spans that subset in the second matroid.
  There is a longstanding conjecture regarding the situation of two matroids defined on the same infinite ground set. Infinite matroids were only recently axiomatized in the early 2010s in the work of Bruhn et al., while the conjecture had been proposed during the 1990s for the class of structures that are now called finitary matroids, which are matroids all of whose circuits are finite sets.
  The packing/covering conjecture, due to Bowler and Carmesin, is a related conjecture in the sense that it is true in the class of all matroids if and only if the matroid intersection conjecture is true in the class of all matroids. Given any family of matroids on the same ground set, the conjecture asks if it is possible to partition the ground set into two disjoint subsets in a way such that the corresponding family of matroids restricted to the first subset admits a packing while the family of matroids contracted to the second subset admits a covering.
  We prove both of these conjectures in the class of finitary matroids. Our main tool is nonstandard analysis, specifically the technique of iterated nonstandard extensions. Roughly, we first embed any infinite matroid inside a hyperfinite matroid defined on a subset of the nonstandard extension of the original ground set, and we iteratively nonstandardly extend the hyperfinite structure again in order to prove results in the internal universe that can be directly transferred to obtain results about the matroid(s) we started with.</description>
