      <title>A data-driven approach for star formation parameterization using symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation (SF) in the interstellar medium (ISM) is fundamental to understanding galaxy evolution and planet formation. However, efforts to develop closed-form analytic expressions that link SF with key influencing physical variables, such as gas density and turbulence, remain challenging. In this work, we leverage recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and use symbolic regression (SR) techniques to produce the first data-driven, ML-discovered analytic expressions for SF using the publicly available FIRE-2 simulation suites. Employing a pipeline based on training the genetic algorithm of SR from an open software package called PySR, in tandem with a custom loss function and a model selection technique which compares candidate equations to analytic approaches to describing SF, we produce symbolic representations of a predictive model for the star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$) averaged over both 10 Myr and 100 Myr based on eight extracted variables from FIRE-2 galaxies. The resulting model that PySR finds best describes SF, on both averaging timescales, features equations that incorporates the surface density of gas, $\Sigma_\mathrm{gas}$, the velocity dispersion of gas $\sigma_{\mathrm{gas,~z}}$ and the surface density of stars $\Sigma_\mathrm{*}$. Furthermore, we find that the equations found for the longer SFR timescale all converge to a scaling-relation-like equation, all of which also closely capture the intrinsic physical scatter of the data within the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) plane. This observed convergence to physically interpretable scaling relations at longer SFR timescales demonstrates that our method successfully identifies robust physical relationships rather than fitting to stochastic fluctuations.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Early Massive Galaxy Formation on the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, corrected for foreground effects, form the foundation of cosmology and support the Big Bang model. A previously overlooked foreground component is the formation of massive early-type galaxies (ETGs), which can no longer be ignored, particularly in light of JWST's detection of massive, evolved systems at extreme redshifts (z &gt; 13). The rapid formation of massive ETGs has been advocated in galaxy evolution studies for decades, and recent evidence has compelled even proponents of hierarchical mass assembly to acknowledge the fact that massive ETGs evolve quickly. Constraints from chemical evolution are particularly stringent. Without both intense star formation and a top-heavy galaxy-wide initial mass function of stars (IMF), it is difficult to reconcile stellar population synthesis models with the high metallicity and abundance patterns of alpha elements. We infer from previous studies that the progenitor cloud of each massive ETG must have had a radius of approximately 400 kpc. Comparing this value to the average present-day separation of massive ETGs, their formation may have occurred around 15 &lt; z &lt; 20. We consider this epoch of formation in a flat-LCDM cosmological context, incorporating the known and necessary properties of massive ETGs. Such properties are encapsulated independently by the integrated galaxy-wide IMF (IGIMF) theory. The massive ETG evolution presented in this work is consistent with recent advancements in stellar and galaxy evolution, and is derived entirely without priors or constraints from the CMB. Yet, it emerges as a non-negligible source of CMB foreground contamination. Even in our most conservative estimates, massive ETGs account for 1.4% up to the full present-day CMB energy density.</description>

      <title>Physical Conditions of the Ionized Superwind in NGC 253 with VLT/MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the H$\alpha$-emitting ionized gas in the warm phase of the NGC 253 outflow using integral field spectroscopy from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). In each spaxel, we decompose H$\alpha$, [N II], and [S II] emission lines into a system of up to 3 Gaussian components, accounting for the velocity contributions due to the disk and both intercepted walls of an outflow cone. In the approaching southern lobe of the outflow, we find maximum deprojected outflow velocities down to ~ -500 km/s. Velocity gradients of this outflowing gas range from ~ -350 to -550 km/s/kpc with increasing distance from the nucleus. Additionally, [N II]/H$\alpha$ and [S II]/H$\alpha$ integrated line ratios are suggestive of shocks as the dominant ionization source throughout the wind. Electron densities, inferred from the [S II] doublet, peak at 2100 cm$^{-3}$ near the nucleus and reach $\lesssim 50 $cm$^{-3}$ in the wind. Finally, at an uncertainty of 0.3 dex on the inferred mass of $4\times10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$, the mass-outflow rate of the H$\alpha$-emitting gas in the southern outflow lobe is ~ 0.4 M$_{\odot}$/year. This yields a mass-loading factor of $\eta$ ~ 0.1 and a ~ 2% starburst energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>SHELLQs. Bridging the gap: JWST unveils obscured quasars in the most luminous galaxies at z &gt; 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a surprisingly abundant population of mildly obscured, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the epoch of reionization (EoR). However, the link between these objects and classical unobscured quasars remains a mystery. Here we report the discovery of obscured quasars hosted by the most luminous galaxies at $z &gt; 6$, possibly bridging the gap between the two AGN populations. The 13 objects presented here were originally selected from a rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) imaging survey over $&gt;$1000 deg$^2$, and were known to have luminous ($&gt;10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) narrow Ly$\alpha$ emission. With JWST/NIRSpec follow-up observations, we found that nine of them exhibit a broad component in H I Balmer lines and He I lines, but not in [O III] and other forbidden lines. Mild dust obscuration ($0 &lt; A_V &lt; 3$) is inferred from the Balmer decrements. The estimated intrinsic luminosities suggest that our broad line (BL) objects are the long-sought UV-obscured counterparts of luminous quasars in the EoR. They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses $10^{7.8 - 9.1} M_\odot$, undergoing sub-Eddington to Eddington accretion. Most of the BL objects are spatially unresolved, and are close to "little red dots" with their blue rest-UV and red rest-optical colors. We estimate the AGN number density among similarly luminous Ly$\alpha$ emitters to be larger than $2 \times 10^{-8}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. This density is comparable to that of classical quasars with similar continuum luminosities, suggesting that a substantial fraction of active SMBHs are obscured in the EoR and have been overlooked in past rest-UV surveys.</description>

      <title>Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) XXII. Chandra observations of narrow-line quasar candidates at z&gt;6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on Chandra X-ray observations of four narrow-line quasar candidates at z~6, selected from the SHELLQs project, based on the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. These objects are characterised by narrow (FWHM&lt;310 km/s), luminous (&gt;1e44 erg/s) Lya and faint UV continuum (M_1450 = -22 - -21), prompting us to examine whether they are obscured luminous AGN at the epoch of reionization. However, none of these objects were detected by Chandra, giving an upper limit to their rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosity (Lx) of 2e44 erg/s (2 sigma), assuming a spectral slope Gamma=2. Subsequent rest-frame optical spectroscopy of these objects by the JWST-NIRSpec, presented in a companion paper, show weak broad Balmer emission at the base of narrow cores. With the scaling relation for low-redshift AGN, the observed strong [OIII]5007 flux of these sources would predict Lx to be around 1e45 erg/s, which is well above the Chandra upper limits. These optical spectra and X-ray quietness are reminiscent of JWST-selected broad-line AGN. We attribute the weak broad Balmer emission to the broad-line regions hidden partially by optically-thick obscuring matter which also hides the optical and X-ray continuum emission from the accretion disc. Compton-thick obscuration, which would strongly suppress X-ray emission, could be due to a dense inter-stellar medium that is often present in galaxies at high redshifts. Alternatively, the same effect could be obtained from an inflated disc at the innermost radii in a supercritical accretion flow, when the disc is viewed at inclined angles.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lenses in UNIONS and Euclid (GLUE) I: A Search for Strong Gravitational Lenses in UNIONS with Subaru, CFHT, and Pan-STARRS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of our pipeline for discovering strong gravitational lenses in the ongoing Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS). We successfully train the deep residual neural network (ResNet) based on CMU-Deeplens architecture, which is designed to detect strong lenses in ground-based imaging surveys. We train on images of real strong lenses and deploy on a sample of 8 million galaxies in areas with full coverage in the g, r, and i filters, the first multi-band search for strong gravitational lenses in UNIONS. Following human inspection and grading, we report the discovery of a total of 1346 new strong lens candidates of which 146 are grade A, 199 grade B, and 1001 grade C. Of these candidates, 283 have lens-galaxy spectroscopic redshifts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and an additional 297 from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 (DR1). We find 15 of these systems display evidence of both lens and source galaxy redshifts in spectral superposition. We additionally report the spectroscopic confirmation of seven lensed sources in highquality systems, all with z &gt; 2.1, using the Keck Near-Infrared Echelle Spectrograph (NIRES) and Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS).</description>

      <title>First Light and Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES) -- XVIII: the ionising emissivities and hydrogen recombination line properties of early AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most remarkable results from the \emph{James Webb Space Telescope} has been the discovery of a large population of compact sources exhibiting strong broad H$\alpha$ emission, typically interpreted to be low-luminosity broad-line (Type 1) active galactic nuclei (BLAGN). An important question is whether these observations are in tension with galaxy formation models, and if so how? While comparisons have been made using physical properties (i.e.~black hole mass and accretion rate) inferred from observations, these require the use of SED modelling assumptions, or locally inferred scaling relations, which may be unjustified, at least in the distant high-redshift Universe. In this work we take an alternative approach and forward model predictions from the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom simulations to predict the observable properties of BLAGN. We achieve this by first coupling \flares\ with the \qsosed\ model to predict the ionising photon luminosities of high-redshift ($z&gt;5$) AGN. To model the observed broad H$\alpha$ emission we then assume a constant conversion factor and covering fraction, and the fraction of AGN that have observable broad-lines. With a reasonable choice of these parameters, \flares\ is able to reproduce observational constraints on the H$\alpha$ luminosity function and equivalent width distribution at $z=5$.</description>

      <title>Decoding the molecular torus of NGC 1068: Insights into its structure and kinematics from high-resolution ALMA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We dissect the kinematics and morphology of the molecular gas within the near-nuclear region of NGC 1068 to understand the mechanisms in the central AGN that might be fueling it, and the impact of its energy output on the surrounding molecular gas. We present high angular and spectral resolution ALMA observations of the HCO$^+$4-&gt;3 and CO 3-&gt;2 molecular lines in the near-nuclear region of the prototype Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068. The spatial resolution (1.1~pc) is almost two times better than that of previous works studying the same molecular lines at the same transitions and is the highest resolution achievable with ALMA at these frequencies. Our analysis focuses on moment maps, position-velocity (PV) diagrams, and spectra obtained at the position of the nuclear continuum source, along with a simple kinematic model developed using the 3DBarolo software. Our observations reveal significant asymmetry between the eastern and western sides of the nuclear disc in terms of morphology, velocity, and line intensity. The broad lines seen in the inner 2 pc could be accounted for by either beam smearing or highly turbulent gas in this region. Outside this radius the mean velocities drop to $\pm$30 km/s, which cannot be explained by asymmetric drift. We find low velocity connections extending to 13 pc suggesting interactions with larger scale structures. The CO/HCO$^+$ line ratio at the nucleus reported here are extremely low compared to values in the literature of the same galaxy at lower spatial resolutions.</description>

      <title>Density modulated star formation efficiency: implications for the observed abundance of ultra-violet luminous galaxies at z&gt;10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number density of UV luminous galaxies discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope at ultra high redshift ($z \gtrsim 10$) is higher, and declines much more slowly with increasing redshift, than expected from extrapolations of lower redshift observations or pre-launch physics-based models. Most of these models assume star formation efficiencies (SFE) of only a few percent, motivated by observations of nearby galaxies. In this work, we incorporate a scaling of SFE with gas surface density (which we refer to as Density Modulated SFE; DMSFE), motivated by cloud-scale simulations and theory, into a semi-analytic cosmological model (SAM) of galaxy formation which is calibrated to match the observed rest-UV sizes of high redshift galaxies. We also model the impact of dust and bursty star formation on the SAM-predicted properties of observed galaxies. We show that with plausible values of the main parameters, such as the fraction of gas in dense clouds $f_{\rm dense}$, our new models easily reproduce or even exceed the observed galaxy number densities at $z\sim 6$-17. While no single value of $f_{\rm dense}$ is able to reproduce the very shallow observed decline of the galaxy number density at $z\gtrsim 12$, it is plausible and even expected for $f_{\rm dense}$ to have some effective dependence on cosmic time, which could bring these models into closer agreement with the data. We show that the combined effects of DMSFE, decreasing dust attenuation, and increasingly bursty star formation at earlier cosmic epochs could conspire to reproduce the observed evolution.</description>

      <title>Cluster Lensing Mass Inversion (CLUMI+): Combining Dynamics and Weak Lensing around Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present CLUMI+, a self-consistent, multi-probe methodology for reconstructing the mass distribution in and around galaxy clusters by combining gravitational lensing and dynamical observations. Building on the joint-likelihood framework of Umetsu (2013), CLUMI+ integrates weak-lensing shear and magnification data with projected escape velocity measurements in the cluster infall region, yielding tighter constraints on the gravitational potential without relying on equilibrium assumptions. The mass distribution is modeled using a flexible, piecewise-defined convergence profile that characterizes the azimuthally averaged surface mass density within the lensing field, transitioning to a projected power-law form at larger radii where phase-space constraints complement lensing. Additional strong-lensing constraints are incorporated via central aperture-mass measurements, enabling full-scale mass reconstruction from the cluster core to the outskirts. We validate CLUMI+ using synthetic weak-lensing and phase-space data for a massive cluster from the IllustrisTNG simulations, demonstrating unbiased recovery of projected and three-dimensional mass profiles and achieving 10%--30% improvement in precision at large radii. As a case study, we apply CLUMI+ to Abell 2261, combining Subaru and Hubble Space Telescope weak+strong lensing data with spectroscopic measurements from the Hectospec Cluster Survey. This analysis demonstrates the power of multi-probe, equilibrium-free modeling for robust cluster mass reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Star formation and accretion rates within 500 pc as traced by Gaia DR3 XP spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion rates from protoplanetary disks onto forming stars are a key ingredient in star formation and protoplanetary disk evolution. Extensive efforts surveying individual star forming regions with spectroscopy and narrow-band photometry have been performed to derive accretion rates on large populations of young stellar objects (YSOs). We use Gaia DR3 XP spectra to perform the first all-sky homogeneous analysis of YSO accretion within 500 pc. We characterise the H$\alpha$ line emission of YSOs by using the H$\alpha$ pseudo-equivalent widths and XP spectra from Gaia DR3. We derive accretion luminosities, mass accretion rates and stellar parameters for 145 975 candidate YSO H$\alpha$ emitters all-sky. We describe filtering strategies to select specific sub-samples of YSOs from this catalogue. We identify a large population of low-accreting YSO candidates untraced by previous surveys. The population of low accreting YSOs is mostly spatially dispersed, away from star forming regions or more clustered environments of star formation. Many YSOs appear disconnected from young populations, reminiscent of 'Peter Pan' YSOs. We find $L_{acc}\propto L_\star^{1.41\pm0.02}$ and $\dot M_{acc}\propto M_\star^{2.4\pm0.1}$ for the purest all-sky sample of YSO candidates. By fitting an exponential to the fraction of accreting stars in clusters of different ages in the Sco-Cen complex, we obtain an accretion timescale of 2.7$\pm$0.4 Myr. The percentage of accretors found by fitting a power-law is 70% at 2 Myr and 2.8% at 10 Myr. With this new catalogue of H$\alpha$ emitters we significantly increase the number of YSO candidates with accretion rate estimations in the local neighbourhood. This allows us to study accretion timescales and the spatial and physical properties of YSO accretion from a large, all-sky, and homogeneous sample for the first time. [abridged]</description>

      <title>A Catalog of 12,766 Carbon-enhanced Metal-poor Stars from LAMOST Data Release 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05024</link>

Abstract: Metal-poor stars are a rare and ancient type of stars; Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars are a subset of these celestial bodies that show an enrichment of carbon relative to iron. They are believed to be formed from gas polluted by the first generation of stars after the Big Bang and are important objects for studying the early universe, galaxy evolution, and nucleosynthesis. Due to their rarity, the search for metal-poor stars and CEMP stars is a valuable task. This study investigates the search for CEMP stars based on the low-resolution stellar spectra from LAMOST DR8, and proposes a deep learning scheme. From the LAMOST DR8 spectral library, this work discovered 12,766 CEMP star candidates. For ease of reference and use, we provide the estimated parameters $T_\texttt{eff}$, $\log~g$, [Fe/H] and [C/H] for them.</description>

      <title>Metallicities of 20 Million Giant Stars Based on Gaia XP spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design an uncertainty-aware cost-sensitive neural network (UA-CSNet) to estimate metallicities from dereddened and corrected Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra for giant stars. This method accounts for both stochastic errors in the input spectra and the imbalanced density distribution in [Fe/H] values. With a specialized architecture and training strategy, the UA-CSNet improves the precision of the predicted metallicities, especially for very metal-poor (VMP; $\rm [Fe/H] \leq -2.0$) stars. With the PASTEL catalog as the training sample, our model can estimate metallicities down to $\rm [Fe/H] \sim -4$. We compare our estimates with a number of external catalogs and conduct tests using star clusters, finding overall good agreement. We also confirm that our estimates for VMP stars are unaffected by carbon enhancement. Applying the UA-CSNet, we obtain reliable and precise metallicity estimates for approximately 20 million giant stars, including 360,000 VMP stars and 50,000 extremely metal-poor (EMP; $\rm [Fe/H] \leq -3.0$) stars. The resulting catalog is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.12149/101604. This work highlights the potential of low-resolution spectra for metallicity estimation and provides a valuable dataset for studying the formation and chemo-dynamical evolution of our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of Little Red Dots from Binary Massive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Little red dots (LRDs) are a newly identified class of broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) with a distinctive v-shape spectrum characterized by red optical and blue UV continuum emission. Their high abundance at redshifts of $z\sim6-8$ and decline at lower redshifts suggest a transient origin. We propose that the spectral shape of LRDs originates from compact binary black hole systems, where each black hole is surrounded by a mini-disk and embedded in a larger circum-binary disk. With a binary separation of $\lesssim 10^3$ Schwarzschild radii, the Wien tail of a $T\simeq 5000~{\rm K}$ blackbody spectrum at the inner edge of the circum-binary disk produces the red optical emission, while the mini-disks power the UV continuum. Binary torques carve out a gap between the circum-binary disk and mini-disks, setting the turnover wavelength of the v-shaped spectrum around the Balmer limit. This scenario naturally reproduces LRD spectra requiring only modest dust attenuation ($A_V\lesssim 1$ mag), resolving overestimated luminosities for LRDs in previous studies and alleviating a tension with the so-called Soltan argument. This model predicts a distinct spectral evolution as the binary orbit decays through binary-disk interactions and gravitational waves (GWs), linking early-stage "proto-LRD" binaries to the broader AGN population and late-stage "LRD-descendants" to coalescing binaries detectable in GW experiments.</description>

      <title>Near- to mid-infrared spectroscopic study of ice analysis using the AKARI/IRC and Spitzer/IRS spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the combined 2.5$-$30$\mu$m spectra of four protostars acquired with the infrared camera and the infrared spectrograph on board the AKARI and Spitzer space telescopes, respectively. To analyze the ice absorption features in the 8$-$22$\mu$m, we first performed a continuum determination process on mid-infrared spectra and applied a method to subtract the silicate absorption. We conducted a global fitting process to the absorption features in the combined infrared spectra using the experimental ice absorbance data to identify the intrinsic absorption of each ice component. We first derived the H$_{2}$O ice column densities of both stretch and libration modes at 3.05$\mu$m and 13.6$\mu$m simultaneously. We also identified the absorption features containing NH$_{3}$, CH$_{3}$OH, CO$_{2}$, and CO and decomposed their mixed components and compared their ice abundances at different evolutionary stages of the protostars. We explored possible absorptions of the organic ice species such as HCOOH, CH$_{3}$CHO, and CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$OH in the mid-infrared ranges. The ice analysis method developed in this study can be applied to the ice spectra obtained by the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Radial Profiles of Radio Halos in Massive Galaxy Clusters: Diffuse Giants Over 2 Mpc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new, high frequency radio observations of the merging galaxy clusters PLCK G287.0+32.9, Abell 2744, and Bullet. These clusters are known to host $\sim$Mpc scale sources, known as radio halos, which are formed by the acceleration of cosmic rays by turbulence injected into the intracluster medium during cluster mergers. Our new images reveal previously undetected faint outermost regions of halos, extending to over 2 Mpc. This discovery highlights the presence of radio halos with large extents at high frequencies and suggests that their observable size depends on a combination of the observation sensitivity and uv-coverage, and their radio power. We additionally compare the properties of these three clusters with MACS J0717+3745 and Abell 2142, both of which are known to host prominent large radio halos. Remarkably, all five halos, despite their exceptionally large extents, exhibit properties similar to other classical halos: their radial profiles are described by a single-component exponential fit, they show radial spectral index steepening, and have an average radio emissivity of about $10^{-42}\, \mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-3}\,Hz^{-1}}$. Our results demonstrate that radio halos can extend to the cluster periphery, without the transition to an observationally distinguishable different halo component in the outermost regions. Our findings highlight that careful subtraction of unrelated sources embedded in the halo is necessary to measure the radio surface brightness accurately, as incomplete subtraction can introduce an apparent secondary component in the peripheral regions.</description>

      <title>Gravothermal collapse and the diversity of galactic rotation curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rotation curves of spiral galaxies exhibit a great diversity that challenge our understanding of galaxy formation and the nature of dark matter. Previous studies showed that in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models with a cross section per unit mass of $\sigma/m\approx{\cal O}(1)~{\rm cm^2/g}$, the predicted dark matter central densities are a good match to the observed densities in galaxies. In this work, we explore a regime with a larger cross section of $\sigma/m\approx20\text{-}40~{\rm cm^2/g}$ in dwarf galactic halos. We will show that such strong dark matter self-interactions can further amplify the diversity of halo densities inherited from their assembly history. High concentration halos can enter the gravothermal collapse phase within $10~{\rm Gyr}$, resulting in a high density, while low concentration ones remain in the expansion phase and have a low density. We fit the rotation curves of $14$ representative low surface brightness galaxies and demonstrate how the large range of observed central densities are naturally accommodated in the strong SIDM regime of $\sigma/m\approx20\text{-}40~{\rm cm^2/g}$. Galaxies that are outliers in the previous studies due to their high halo central densities, are no longer outliers in this SIDM regime as their halos would be in the collapse phase. For galaxies with a low density, the SIDM fits are robust to the variation of the cross section. Our findings open up a new window for testing gravothermal collapse, the unique signature of strong dark matter self-interactions, and exploring a broader SIDM model space. As an example, we illustrate how the larger cross sections favored by our fits, together with upper limits from strong lensing observations in clusters, pick out the preferred SIDM model space for a dark matter particle coupled to a light gauge boson in the Born regime.</description>

      <title>Growth of Massive Molecular Cloud Filament by Accretion Flows. II. New Mechanism to Support a Supercritical Filament against Radial Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations indicate that dense molecular filamentary clouds are sites of star formation. The filament width determines the most unstable scale for self-gravitational fragmentation and influences the stellar mass. Therefore, constraining the evolution of filaments and the origin of their properties are important for understanding star formation. Although some observations show a universal width of 0.1 pc, many theoretical studies predict the contraction of thermally supercritical filaments (&gt; 17 Msun pc-1) due to radial collapse. Through non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics simulations with ambipolar diffusion, we explore the formation and evolution of filaments via slow-shock instability at the front of accretion flows. We reveal that ambipolar diffusion allows the gas in the filament to flow across the magnetic fields around the shock front, forming dense blobs behind the concave points of the shock front. The blobs transfer momentum that drives internal turbulence. We name this mechanism the "STORM" (Slow-shock-mediated Turbulent flOw Reinforced by Magnetic diffusion). The persistence and efficiency of the turbulence inside the filament are driven by the magnetic field and the ambipolar diffusion effect, respectively. The STORM mechanism sustains the width even when the filament reaches very large line masses (~ 100 Msun pc-1).</description>

      <title>A Global Census of Metals in the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a census of the mass density of metals and their evolution with cosmic time on a global scale throughout the Universe, synthesizing robust estimates of metals in stars, hot intra-cluster gas, and gaseous absorbers tracing neutral gas as well as ionized gas in the circumgalactic and intergalactic media. We observe an order of magnitude increase in the stellar metal mass density from z~2.5 to 0.7, over which time stars emerge as the most important metal reservoir at low redshifts, housing ~30% of the total expected metal density at z~0.1. Hot virialized intracluster/intragroup gas accounts for ~15% and 10% of metals at z~0.1 and 0.7, respectively. Using metallicity measurements from CCC, KODIAQ-Z, and HD-LLS surveys covering redshifts z&lt;1 to z~2-3.5, we investigate the global distribution of metals in extragalactic cool ionized gas as a function of HI column density. During the period from z~3 to z&lt;1, the global metal density of cool (T~10^{4-5} K) gas has doubled. However, the fractional contribution of the ionized gas to the total expected metal density decreased from ~20% at z~3 to ~4% at z&lt;1. The cosmic metal density of all gas phases has increased with cosmic time, reflecting an ``inside-out'' metal dispersion by feedback mechanisms and galactic outflows.</description>

      <title>The $Hubble$ Missing Globular Cluster Survey. I. Survey overview and the first precise age estimate for ESO452-11 and 2MASS-GC01</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the $Hubble$ Missing Globular Cluster Survey (MGCS), a $Hubble$ $Space$ $Telescope$ Treasury Program dedicated to the observation of all kinematically confirmed Milky Way globular clusters that missed previous $Hubble$ imaging. After introducing the aims of the programme and describing its target clusters, we showcase the first results of the survey. These are related to two clusters, one located at the edge of the Milky Way bulge and observed in optical bands, namely ESO452-11, and one located in the Galactic disc observed in the near-IR, namely 2MASS-GC01. For both clusters, the deep colour-magnitude diagrams obtained from the MGCS observations reach several magnitudes below their main-sequence turn-off and thus enable the first precise estimate of their age. By using the methods developed in the Cluster Ages to Reconstruct the Milky Way Assembly (CARMA) project, we find ESO452-11 to be an old metal-intermediate globular cluster, with ${\rm [M/H]}\simeq-0.80^{+0.08}_{-0.11}$ and an age of ${\rm t}=13.59^{+0.48}_{-0.69}$ Gyr. Its location on the age-metallicity relation makes it consistent with an in situ origin, in agreement with its dynamical properties. On the other hand, the results for 2MASS-GC01 highlight it as a young metal-intermediate cluster, with an age of ${\rm t}=7.22^{+0.93}_{-1.11}$ Gyr at ${\rm [M/H]}=-0.73^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$. Despite the large associated uncertainty, our age estimate for this extremely extincted cluster indicates it to be either the youngest globular cluster known to date or a massive and compact open cluster, which is consistent with its almost circular, disc-like orbit</description>

      <title>Detection for Intermediate-mass Binary Black Holes in Population III Star Clusters with TianQin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Population III star clusters are predicted to form in unenriched dark matter halos. Direct N-body simulation of Pop III clusters implies the possible formation and merger of intermediate-mass binary black holes (IMBBHs). The gravitational wave signals could be detected by space-borne gravitational wave detectors like TianQin. Aims. This study evaluates the potential of TianQin in detecting IMBBHs from Pop III star clusters, focusing on key factors such as the detection horizon, detection number, and Fisher uncertainty. Methods. A Monte Carlo simulation is employed to derive IMBBH sources, utilizing the IMRPhenomD waveform model to simulate catalogs of observable IMBBH mergers. The mass and redshift distributions are derived from direct N-body simulations of IMBBHs in Population III star clusters. Detection numbers are determined by calculating the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of the simulated signals and applying thresholds for detection. Fisher uncertainty is obtained through Fisher information matrix analysis. Results. The findings suggest that TianQin could achieve detection numbers within 5 years ranging from 1 in the most pessimistic scenario to 253 in the most optimistic scenario. Furthermore, TianQin can precisely constrain the IMBBH mass with a relative uncertainty of $10^{-6}$, coalescence time $t_c$ within 1 second, and sky location $\bar{\Omega}_S$ within 1 $\rm{deg}^2$. However, the luminosity distance $D_L$ and inclination angle $\iota$ exhibit substantial degeneracies, limiting their precise estimation.</description>

Abstract: JWST galaxy deep spectral surveys provide a unique opportunity to trace a broad range of evolutionary features of galaxies and the intergalactic medium given the huge distance the photons are propagating. We have analyzed the spectral data of JWST galaxies up to a redshift of around 7 using the Kolmogorov technique, which is an efficient tool for testing the tiny comparative randomness properties of cumulative signals, that is, for distinguishing the contributions of regular and stochastic sub-signals. Our aim is to determine if certain identical spectral features of galaxies have undergone any distortions or systematic evolution across a broad range of redshifts. Our results indicate a change in the spectral properties of the sample galaxies at around z \simeq 2.7 at over a 99% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations: Morphological Analysis of Galaxies in TNG100 Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the morphology of galaxies in the TNG100 simulation by applying mock observation techniques and compare the results with the observational data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By employing a hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach, we classify galaxies into four morphological categories (Ellipticals, S0/a, Sab/Sb, and Sc/Sd/Irregulars). Our findings show that the morphological characteristics of the mock-observed galaxy samples closely match those observed in the SDSS, successfully reproducing key features such as distinct parameter distributions for different types. However, some discrepancies are identified: notably, a significant lack of early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the dwarf galaxy regime ($M_* &lt; 10^{10} M_{\odot}$) and minimal distinction between Sab/Sb and Sc/Sd/Irregular galaxies in the mock-observed samples, unlike the clear differences seen in actual observations. These divergences may stem from simulation properties such as elevated star formation efficiency at low mass end or resolution limits. Observational effects, including the impact of the Point Spread Function, sky background, and instrumental noise, can independently cause approximately 7.87\% morphological misclassifications by our CNN model. Compared to previous studies using gravity-based definitions of galaxies that failed to clearly distinguish the parameter distributions of ETGs versus Late-Type Galaxies, our brightness-based sample definition method better recovers the observed morphological parameter distributions, especially their distinct differences. Our study underscores that, alongside mock observations, employing galaxy segmentation methods consistent with observational practices is crucial for appropriately recovering realistic morphological parameters from simulations and enabling fair comparisons.</description>

Abstract: Physical and chemical conditions (kinetic temperature, volume density, molecular composition) of interstellar clouds are inherent in their mm-submm line spectra, making spectral line profiles powerful diagnostics of source conditions. We introduce a novel bottom-up approach employing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to directly infer physical conditions from line profiles without using radiative transfer equations. We simulated HCN and HNC emission under representative dense molecular cloud and star-forming region conditions across five rotational transitions (J=1-0 to J=5-4) within 30-500 GHz. The generated data cloud was parameterized using line intensities and widths to infer the physical conditions of the analyzed regions. Three ML algorithms were trained, tested, and compared to unravel the excitation conditions of HCN and HNC and their abundance ratio. ML results obtained with two spectral lines, one for each isomer, were compared with a Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) analysis for the cold source R CrA IRS 7B, yielding excitation temperatures and relative abundances in agreement with LTE. The optimized pipeline (training, testing, and prediction) can predict interstellar cloud properties from line profile inputs at lower computational cost than traditional methods. This work represents the first mapping of spectral line profiles to physical conditions by charting isomer abundance ratios and excitation temperatures. Our bottom-up approach, based on simulated and semiempirical spectra, offers a new tool to interpret line observations and estimate interstellar conditions using ML methods.</description>

Abstract: Early B-type stars ($M_i=8-15$ M$_\odot$) are frequently in multiple systems, as evidenced by spectroscopic campaigns in the Milky Way (MW) and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Previous studies have shown no strong metallicity dependence in the close-binary (a&gt;10 au) fraction or orbital-period distributions between the MW's solar metallicity (Z$_\odot$) and that of the LMC (Z=0.5 Z$_\odot$). However, similar analyses in more metal-poor environments are still scarce. We focus on 309 early B-type stars (luminosity classes III-V) from the Binarity at LOw Metallicity campaign in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC, Z=0.2 Z$_\odot$) using VLT/FLAMES multi-epoch spectroscopy. By applying binary detection criteria consistent with previous works, we identify 153 stars (91 SB1, 59 SB2, 3 SB3) exhibiting significant radial-velocity (RV) variations, resulting in an observed multiplicity fraction of $f^{obs}_{mult}=50\pm3\%$. Using Monte Carlo simulations to account for observational biases, we infer an intrinsic close-binary fraction of $f_{mult}=80\pm8\%$. A Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of the peak-to-peak RV distribution ($\Delta{\rm RV}_{\rm max}$) confirms a high multiplicity fraction of $f_{mult}=78\pm5\%$. These findings suggest a possible anti-correlation between metallicity and the fraction of close B-type binaries, with the SMC multiplicity fraction significantly exceeding previous measurements in the LMC and MW. The enhanced fraction of close binaries at SMC's low metallicity may have broad implications for massive-star evolution in the early Universe. More frequent mass transfer and envelope stripping could boost the production of exotic transients, stripped supernovae, gravitational-wave progenitors, and sustained UV ionising flux, potentially affecting cosmic reionisation. Theoretical predictions of binary evolution under metal-poor conditions will provide a key test of our results.</description>

      <title>The eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS): SDSS spectroscopic observations of X-ray sources</title>

Abstract: We present one of the largest uniform optical spectroscopic surveys of X-ray selected sources to date that were observed as a pilot study for the Black Hole Mapper (BHM) survey. The BHM program of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-V is designed to provide optical spectra for hundreds of thousands of X-ray selected sources from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey. This significantly improves our ability to classify and characterise the physical properties of large statistical populations of X-ray emitting objects. Our sample consists of 13079 sources in the eROSITA eFEDS performance verification field, 12011 of which provide reliable redshifts from 0&lt;z&lt;5.8. The vast majority of these objects were detected as point-like sources (X-ray flux limit F(0.5-2 keV)&gt;6.5x10^-15 erg/s/cm^2) and were observed for about 20 years with fibre-fed SDSS spectrographs. After including all available redshift information for the eFEDS sources from the dedicated SDSS-V plate programme and archival data, we visually inspected the SDSS optical spectra to verify the reliability of these redshift measurements and the performance of the SDSS pipeline. The visual inspection allowed us to recover reliable redshifts (for 99% of the spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of &gt;2) and to assign classes to the sources, and we confirm that the vast majority of our sample consists of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Only ~3% of the eFEDS/SDSS sources are Galactic objects. We also show the diversity of the optical spectra of the X-ray selected AGNs and provide spectral stacks with a high signal-to-noise ratio in various sub-samples with different redshift and optical broad-band colours. Our AGN sample contains optical spectra of (broad-line) quasars, narrow-line galaxies, and optically passive galaxies. It is considerably diverse in its colours and in its levels of nuclear obscuration.</description>
