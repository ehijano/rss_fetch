      <title>Spontaneous baryogenesis with large misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the particle production by the Nambu-Goldstone boson in the spontaneous baryogenesis scenario for large misalignment angles. Studying numerically the case of an arbitrary initial phase, we reproduce the cubic dependence on the initial value of the phase of baryon asymmetry in the case of small oscillations and present our results for an initial phase close to {\pi}. Our calculations indicate that there is a saturation of particle production as the initial phase approaches {\pi}. We also discuss the probability distribution of the baryon asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Refining the sensitivity of new physics searches with ancient minerals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paleodetection has been proposed as a competitive method for detecting dark matter and other new physics interactions, complementing conventional direct detection experiments. In this work, we utilise TRIM simulations to improve the modelling of track length distributions. Our findings suggest that previous studies have overestimated the number of tracks caused by weakly interacting particles, and that the lowest observable dark matter mass should be higher than previously predicted. These differences are mainly attributed to the fact that (a) the recoil energy-track length relation is not one-to-one, (b) at low recoil energies, a substantial fraction of recoils do not yield any tracks, and (c) at high energies, electronic stopping becomes dominant, resulting in a track length barrier at $\sim200$ nm. In addition to WIMPs, we also modelled tracks from generalised coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) via new light mediators and estimated the projected sensitivity for these interactions.</description>

      <title>A model for massive quark-gluon string fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A highly under-looked problem in string models of hadronization is taking into account the mass of the parton system and the conservation of the total angular momentum, as these factors can significantly influence the time-space picture of the fragmentation process. In this paper, I present a method to properly define the Nambu-Goto relativistic string with non-zero mass based on the finite order eigenfunction expansion of the initial conditions of the Cauchy problem for string motion. The principles of the fragmentation process are derived for these strings. 4-momentum and total angular momentum conservation laws are taken into account, along with Virasoro conditions. It is shown that very non-trivial consequences arise for non-zero mass strings, including the discrete spectrum of string spin, the discreteness of the possible string breaking points, the close-to-Regge behavior of the spin-mass relation for the light string fragments and the natural stopping mechanism for fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy for exotic hadrons and nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high energy collision experiments with multiple hadron productions, the momentum distribution of the measured hadron pair shows a correlation due to the final state hadron interactions and the quantum statistics. In the past, this femtoscopy technique has been developed to extract the information of the emission source from the momentum correlation functions. Recently, correlation function measurement is utilized also as a new method to determine the hadron interactions. In fact, the ALICE collaboration at LHC measures the correlation functions with various hadron pairs, for which the standard scattering experiment is difficult, providing remarkable progress in the study of the hadron interactions. In this contribution, we introduce the theoretical method to calculate the correlation functions, and present recent results on the study of the antikaon-nucleon interactions and hyperon-nucleus interactions.</description>

      <title>Superheavy Metastable Strings in SO(10)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of $SO(10)$ grand unified symmetry to $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y \times U(1)_\chi$ yields the GUT monopole as well as a comparably heavy $U(1)_\chi$ monopole which also carries $U(1)_Y$ flux. A metastable string scenario in this case requires that the $U(1)_\chi$ symmetry is necessarily broken close to the GUT scale, thus resulting in a dimensionless string tension $G \mu \sim 10^{-6}$. We show that the $\chi$ monopole does not carry any unconfined flux following the electroweak symmetry breaking. Coupled with $G \mu \sim 10^{-6}$, this metastable string network appears to provide a good fit to the recent Pulsar Timing Array data on the stochastic gravitational background. Gauge coupling unification, especially in the presence of low scale supersymmetry, determines the GUT scale and, in combination with constraints from proton decay experiments, one is able to constrain some of the key parameters in this setup. The breaking of $SO(10)$ via $SU(5) \times U(1)_\chi$ also yields superheavy metastable strings with no unconfined flux associated with the monopoles. Finally, we consider $SO(10)$ breaking via $SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_R$, $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ and flipped $SU(5)$ that yield metastable strings where the associated monopoles carry unconfined flux after the electroweak breaking.</description>

      <title>The importance of being discrete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although continuous symmetries may be more appealing, especially the local gauge ones, I argue that discrete symmetries may still play a fundamental role in shaping our understanding of the physics beyond the Standard Model. I exemplify this on the case of left-right symmetry and recall how its spontaneous breaking leads naturally to new weak interactions, and even more interestingly, to neutrino mass and the seesaw mechanism behind its smallness. The minimal realization of this program is shown to be a self-contained theory of the origin and nature of neutrino mass, and of quark mixing angles. I also discuss some new results on the extension of the theory based on Pati-Salam quark-lepton symmetry, and its embedding in $SO(10)$ grand unified theory, where LR symmetry becomes gauged discrete transformation in the form of charge conjugation.</description>

      <title>Extracting Meson Distribution Amplitudes from Nonlocal Euclidean Correlations at Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first complete result for the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) hard matching kernel indispensable for a precision extraction of light meson distribution amplitudes from lattice calculations of equal-time nonlocal Euclidean correlation functions. The results are given in both coordinate and momentum space, with the renormalization and matching accomplished in a state-of-the-art scheme. Our results can be used in both large-momentum effective theory and short-distance factorization approaches. Notably, our coordinate space kernel is directly applicable to nonsinglet quark unpolarized and helicity generalized parton distributions as well. We also illustrate the numerical impact of the NNLO matching, using the pion distribution amplitude as an example.</description>

      <title>Prompt and non-prompt production of charm hadrons in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we use machine learning (ML) based models to separate the prompt and non-prompt production of heavy flavour hadrons, such as $D^0$ and J/$\psi$, in proton-proton collisions at LHC energies. For this purpose, we use PYTHIA~8 to generate events, which provides a good qualitative agreement with experimental measurements of charm hadron production. The input features for the ML models are experimentally measurable. The prediction accuracy of the ML models used in this study reaches up to 99\%. The ML models can be useful in providing precise track-level identification, which is not possible in experiments with traditional methods. The contribution also discusses future applications of the ML models to understand the production of prompt and non-prompt heavy quark hadrons.</description>

      <title>Probing Millicharged Dark Matter with Magnetometer Coupled to Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to detect millicharged dark matter (mDM) by using a high-sensitivity magnetometer coupled with the resonant and broadband readout circuits. In the external magnetic field, the interaction between mDM and the photon field introduces an effective current corresponding to the mDMs annihilation into photons that produces a faint oscillating magnetic field signal, with a frequency uniquely determined by twice the mDM mass. By calculating the expected signal for two experimental configurations -- toroidal and solenoidal magnetic fields -- we show the potential to explore the uncharted regions of mDM parameter space. Our analysis establishes unprecedented constraints on the mDM coupling constant across the mass range $1\times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{eV}$ to $6 \times 10^{-8}~\mathrm{eV}$, surpassing existing experimental limits by more than ten orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Multicomponent Dark Matter with Collider Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work aims to study an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that addresses the prominent SM shortcomings, i.e., can explain the neutrino mass, the dark matter (DM) content, and the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe. The model introduces the possibility of a multicomponent DM scenario leading to distinctive signals at colliders. The SM is extended by a ``dark" $SU(2)_{D}$ gauge symmetry and new fermions and scalar doublets, charged only under $SU(2)_{D}$, that provide candidates for a multicomponent DM. Previously, we have considered in this model the asymmetric DM scenario, while in the present work, we explore the symmetric DM case. We focus on the parameter region where the dark fermion DM annihilates dominantly into the additional dark gauge bosons and the ``inert" doublet DM annihilates to SM states via the SM Higgs resonance. This particular choice of doublet mass ensures that the heavier BSM Higgs always has one decay mode open to DM leading to the possibility of detecting such particles at the LHC, in the missing energy plus dijet ($\cancel{E}_{T}+2j$) final states. We also discuss the prospects for detecting DM through direct and indirect detection experiments and via Long-Lived-Particle searches. Finally, we show that, as typical of other WIMP models, for low DM mass, signals can be expected in future collider experiments, but for the higher mass range above $500$ GeV we have to rely solely on direct detection experiments. Both types of experiments will be essential to fully cover the allowed parameter space.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the viscous properties and the Bjorken expansion of the QGP medium at finite angular velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the viscous properties as well as the Bjorken expansion of a rotating QGP medium. In the noncentral events of heavy-ion collisions, the produced medium can carry a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity. This rotation can significantly affect various properties, including viscous properties and the expansion of the QGP medium. Using a novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation at finite angular velocity, we have calculated the shear and bulk viscosities and compared them with their counterparts in the standard relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach. Our results show that the angular velocity increases both shear and bulk viscosities, suggesting an enhanced momentum transfer within the medium and greater fluctuations in local pressure. This rotational effect on viscosities is more evident at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. Our analysis also shows that, compared to the standard relaxation time approximation, the shear viscosity is lower while the bulk viscosity is higher in the novel relaxation time approximation for all temperatures. Additionally, some observables related to the flow characteristic, fluid behavior and conformal symmetry of the medium are markedly impacted due to rotation. We have also studied the hydrodynamic evolution of matter within the Bjorken boost-invariant scenario and have found that the energy density evolves faster in the presence of finite rotation than in the nonrotating case. Consequently, rapid rotation accelerates the cooling process of the QGP medium.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Baryon Stopping at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nucleon exhibits a rich internal structure governed by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), where its electric charge arises from valence quarks, while its spin and mass emerge from complex interactions among valence quarks, sea (anti-)quarks, and gluons. At the advent of QCD, an alternative hypothesis emerged suggesting, at high energies, the transport of a nucleon's baryon number could be traced by a non-perturbative configuration of gluon fields connecting its three valence quarks, forming a $Y$-shaped topology known as the gluon junction. Recent measurements by the STAR experiment are compatible with this scenario. In light of these measurements, this study aims to explore the mechanisms of baryon transport in high-energy nuclear collisions using the PYTHIA-8 framework, which incorporates a state-of-the-art hadronization model with advanced Color Flow (CF) and Color Reconnection (CR) mechanisms which mimic signatures of a baryon junction. Within this model setup, we investigate (i) the rapidity slope of the net-baryon distributions in photon-included processes ($\gamma$+p) and (ii) baryon over charge transport in the isobaric (Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr) collisions. Our study highlights the importance of the CF and CR mechanisms in PYTHIA-8, which plays a crucial role in baryon transport. The results show that the CF and CR schemes significantly affect the isobaric baryon-to-charge ratio, leading to different predictions for baryon stopping and underscoring the need to account for CF and CR effects in comparisons with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement between gauge boson pairs at a Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is one of significant physics phenomena that can be examined at a particle collider. A muon collider can provide a stage on which we can study substantial physics phenomenon, starting from the precision measurements of the Standard Model and beyond to the undiscovered area of physics. In this work, we present a through study of quantum entanglement in $\mu^+\mu^-\to ZZ$ events at a future muon collider. By fixing the spin density matrix, observables quantifying entanglement between $Z$ boson pairs can be measured. After systematic Monte-Carlo simulation and background analysis, we measure the value of entanglement variables and perform hypothesis testing against the non-entangled hypothesis, finally observing the entanglement of the $ZZ$ system up to $2$ significance level.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the deuteron mass radius via near-threshold $\rho^0$, $\omega$ and $\phi$ meson photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the near-threshold photoproduction of the $\rho^0$, $\omega$, and $\phi$ mesons on a deuterium target, leveraging published datasets from the DESY and SLAC facilities. In our extraction of the deuteron mass radius, we employ a dipole-form scalar gravitational form factor to effectively model the $|t|$-dependence of the differential cross sections associated with vector meson photoproductions. Utilizing the vector-meson dominance model alongside a low-energy Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) theorem assumption, we derive the deuteron mass radius from the near-threshold photoproduction data of the $\rho^0$, $\omega$, and $\phi$ mesons. The mass radii obtained from various datasets demonstrate consistency within the statistical uncertainties, yielding an average value of $2.07 \pm 0.15$ fm. This precision surpasses previous estimates solely based on the $\phi$ meson photoproduction data. Our findings provide novel constraints for theoretical nuclear structure models and significantly enhance our understanding of the mass distribution within the deuteron.</description>

      <title>Axion-like Dark Matter Search with Space-based Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel modification to the optical benches of space-based gravitational wave detectors (SGWDs) to enable the detection of axion-like dark matter (ALDM)-induced birefringence without altering the polarization of inter-spacecraft laser links. Our design introduces an auxiliary interferometer to convert polarization modulation into measurable phase shifts. Analytical expressions for sensitivity to the ALDM-photon coupling are derived for various time-delay interferometry (TDI) combinations. Projected sensitivity curves demonstrate complementary coverage across the ALDM mass range $10^{-19}\sim10^{-14}\mathrm{eV}$. This approach preserves the original interferometric stability while enabling new physics capabilities for SGWDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present automated next-to-leading order QCD and/or electroweak (EW) predictions for photon-photon processes in ultraperipheral high-energy collisions of protons and ions, extending the capabilities of the \textsc{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO} framework together in combination with the \ttt{gamma-UPC} code. Key aspects of this extension are discussed. We compute QCD and/or EW quantum corrections for several phenomenologically interesting processes at LHC and FCC-hh energies.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of singly heavy baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More and more excited baryons have been reported experimentally, but many properties are still unclear. This work attempts to simultaneously study the masses and strong decay widths of some singly heavy baryons, in order to provide possible quantum numbers for these states. The chiral quark model and the $^{3}P_{0}$ decay model are employed to calculate the masses and decay widths of $\Lambda_{c(b)}$ and $\Sigma_{c(b)}$ baryons for all quantum numbers with $2S$, $1P$, and $2P$ waves. We considered not only two-body strong decays but also the influence of three-body decays. Our calculations show that: (i) For states with experimentally determined quantum numbers, such as $\Lambda_c(2595)$, $\Lambda_c(2625)$, $\Lambda_b(5912)$ and $\Lambda_b(5920)$, the results are consistent with experimental data and the conclusions of most theoretical studies. (ii) For states whose quantum numbers have not yet been fully determined experimentally, we provide possible interpretations. For example, our calculations tend to interpret $\Lambda_c(2910)$ is interpreted as a $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$ state with 1P-wave $\rho$-mode or a $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^-$ state with 2P wave $\lambda$-mode. $\Lambda_c(2940)$ can be interpreted as the $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$ state with 2P-wave $\lambda$-mode. For $\Lambda_c(2860)$, we offer a different interpretation, proposing that its mass and width closely match those of a 2P-wave $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^{-}$ state. It is hoped that our calculations can provide valuable information for the experimental and theoretical studies of heavy baryons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we calculate the multipole moments of spin-3/2 doubly heavy baryons within the light cone QCD sum rules. We compare our results on magnetic dipole moments with results existing in the literature. The results obtained in the present work may be useful for a deeper understanding of the properties of doubly heavy baryons as well as in the analysis of their strong and electromagnetic decays.</description>

      <title>A parton shower consistent with parton densities at LO and NLO: PDF2ISR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for obtaining an initial-state parton shower model where the (backward) evolution fully consistent with the (forward) evolution of the collinear parton density used. As a proof-of-concept we use parton densities obtained with the Parton Branching (PB) approach, and modify the default initial-state shower in PYTHIA8 with this method to be consistent with them. PB is ideally suited for checking the validity of our method since, in addition to producing collinear parton densities, it also produces the corresponding transverse-dependent (TMD) ones, and these can then be directly compared to the transverse momentum distribution obtained from the parton shower. We show that TMD distributions which we in this way obtain from our modified PYTHIA8 shower using leading order (LO) parton densities and splitting functions are fully consistent with the corresponding leading order TMD densities. At next-to-leading order (NLO) it is not possible to achieve the same consistency using the built-in LO splitting functions in the shower, but we show that by introducing NLO splitting functions using a reweighting procedure, we can achieve consistency also at NLO. The method presented here, which we have named PDF2ISR, can be easily extended to any collinear parton densities, as long as the exact conditions for the evolution are known. With the PDF2ISR method we obtain an initial-state parton shower which in principle has no free parameters, and is fully consistent with collinear parton densities at LO and NLO.</description>

      <title>Investigating two-zero texture in the light of gauged Type-II seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillation, discovered over two decades ago, confirmed that neutrinos have nonzero masses. Since then, two mass-squared differences have been measured with unprecedented precision, yet the absolute neutrino mass scale remains unknown. Additionally, the fundamental symmetry governing the neutrino mixing pattern is still undetermined. Among various theoretical possibilities, the two-zero texture in the neutrino mass matrix ($m_\nu$) stands out as an attractive framework due to its reduced number of free parameters, enabling definite predictions for the unknown parameters of the PMNS matrix. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the two-zero texture, focusing on its implications for the Dirac CP phase ($\delta$) and the effective Majorana mass ($m_{\beta\beta}$), the latter being crucial for neutrinoless double beta decay. We find that for certain two-zero textures, $m_{\beta\beta}$ reaches a few tens of meV, placing it within the sensitivity range of KamLAND-Zen. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a two-zero texture can naturally emerge in a well-motivated neutrino mass model, specifically the gauged Type-II seesaw mechanism, which requires multiple scalar triplets. Notably, some two-zero patterns cannot be realized in this framework, as more than two independent zeros can appear in $m_\nu$. Finally, we discuss key phenomenological consequences of the gauged Type-II seesaw model.</description>

      <title>Probing the Sivers Asymmetry with Transverse Energy-Energy Correlators in the Small-$x$ Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate transverse energy-energy correlators (TEECs) for both polarized and unpolarized targets in the small-$x$ regime at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Focusing on the approximately back-to-back electroproduction of a hadron-electron pair, we apply transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization formulas that incorporate TMD evolution for both event-shape observables and expand them in terms of the small-$x$ dipole amplitude. This allows us to write the TEEC off the transversely polarized proton in terms of a C-odd interaction, corresponding to an odderon exchange. Due to the charge-conjugation-odd nature of the small-$x$ quark Sivers function, we restrict the sum over final hadronic states to positively and negatively charged hadrons separately. We present numerical predictions for the TEEC Sivers asymmetry at the EIC and find the magnitude of the asymmetry to be on the $0.1 \%$ level. This channel offers a promising avenue for benchmarking the still largely unconstrained odderon amplitude.</description>

      <title>Probing Long-Range Forces in Neutrino Oscillations at the ESSnuSB Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillations constitute an excellent tool to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we investigate the potential of the \ess experiment to constrain the effects of flavour-dependent long-range forces (LRFs) in neutrino oscillations, which may arise due to the extension of the Standard Model gauge group by introducing new $U(1)$ symmetries. Focusing on three specific $U(1)$ symmetries -- $L_e - L_\mu$, $L_e - L_\tau$, and $L_\mu - L_\tau$, we demonstrate that \ess offers a favourable environment to search for LRF effects. Our analyses reveal that \ess can set 90\% confidence level bounds of $V_{e\mu} &lt; 2.99 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{eV}$, $V_{e\tau} &lt; 2.05 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{eV}$, and $V_{\mu\tau} &lt; 1.81 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{eV}$, which are competitive to the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). It is also observed that reducing the systematic uncertainties from $5\%$ to $2\%$ improves the \ess limits on $V_{\alpha\beta}$. Interestingly, we find limited correlations between LRF parameters and the less constrained lepton mixing parameters $\theta_{23}$ and $\delta_{\text{CP}}$, preserving the robustness of ESSnuSB's sensitivity to CP violation. Even under extreme LRF potentials ($V_{\alpha\beta} \gg 10^{-13} \, \text{eV}$), the CP-violation sensitivity and $\delta_{\text{CP}}$ precision remain largely unaffected. These results establish ESSnuSB as a competitive experimental setup for probing LRF effects, complementing constraints from other neutrino sources and offering critical insights into the physics of long-range forces.</description>

      <title>Independent connection in ACTion during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ATC) has recently released new measurements and constraints on inflationary observables. In this paper it is shown that a component of a dynamical affine connection, which is independent of the metric, can easily drive inflation in agreement with these observations. Such geometrical explanation of inflation is analysed in detail here in the minimal model, including the predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and its running $\alpha_s$, the amplitude of the scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Furthermore, this minimal model is shown to provide an inflationary attractor: arbitrary initial values of the kinetic energy density are dynamically attracted down to negligible values compared to the potential energy density in homogeneous and isotropic metrics. The role of the Higgs boson during and after inflation is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Scale separation, rolling solutions and entropy bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit scale separation for compactifications of ten- and eleven-dimensional supergravity. For cosmological solutions rolling down flux-generated potentials, we observe that scale separation is achieved as time flows, and is fairly generic. This is realized without the need of orientifolds nor corrections to the classical supergravity approximation. We then confront scale separation with the Covariant Entropy Bound (CEB) and the CKN bound. We show that a naive application of these bounds to vacua hints at the existence of at least two extra dimensions. For rolling solutions, we observe that the CEB is not always respected, but since these examples lack a cosmic horizon, the application of entropy bounds remains delicate.</description>

      <title>Effective-Field Theories of Analogue Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel method for building a gravitational analog model for a flowing Bose-Einstein condensate. The analogue metric is obtained using effective field theory methods, integrating out the heavy radial fluctuations. In this way, we also obtain interaction terms up to the quartic order in the fields. The microscopic Lagrangian describes a complex massive scalar field, with a global U(1) symmetry, that is spontaneously broken. From the quadratic effective Lagrangian, we obtain a dispersion law for phonons in presence of an acoustic horizon generated by the background flow. We observe that the phonon dispersion relation may exhibit a non-monotonic behavior determined by the Lagrangian's parameters. In this case, a non-trivial minimum appears associated with a characteristic length scale, indicating the breaking of translation symmetry. Then, we determine the constraints on the Lagrangian's parameters to make this happen. Finally, we design an original procedure to calculate the correlation functions through field theory tools. We apply this method to the density-density correlation function, reproducing known results. Moreover, we study the case of a non-monotonic phonon dispersion law, finding the existence of long range order.</description>

      <title>[C II]-deficit caused by self-absorption in an ionized carbon-filled bubble in RCW79</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent spectroscopic observations of the [C\,{\tiny II}] 158$\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ fine-structure line of ionized carbon (C$^+$), using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), have revealed expanding [C\,{\tiny II}] shells in Galactic H\,{\tiny II} regions. We report the discovery of a bubble-shaped source (S144 in RCW79), associated with a compact H\,{\tiny II} region, excited by a single O7.5--9.5V/III star, which is consistent with a scenario that the bubble is still mostly ``filled'' with C$^+$. This indicates most likely a very early evolutionary state, in which the stellar wind has not yet blown material away, as it is the case for more evolved H\,{\tiny II} regions. Using the SimLine non-LTE radiative transfer code, the [C\,{\tiny II}] emission can be modeled to originate from three regions. First, a central H\,{\tiny II} region with little C$^+$ in the fully ionized phase, followed by two layers with gas density around $2500\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ of partially photo-dissociated gas. The second layer is a slowly expanding [C\,{\tiny II}] shell with an expansion velocity of $\sim\,$$2.6\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The outermost layer exhibits a temperature and velocity gradient that produces the observed self-absorption features in the optically thick [C\,{\tiny II}] line ($\tau \sim 4$) leading to an apparent deficit in [C\,{\tiny II}] emission and a low ratio of [C\,{\tiny II}] to total far-infrared (FIR) emission. We developed a procedure to approximate the missing [C\,{\tiny II}] flux and find a linear correlation between [C\,{\tiny II}] and FIR without a [C\,{\tiny II}]-deficit. This demonstrates that at least some of the [C\,{\tiny II}]-deficit found in Galactic H\,{\tiny II} bubbles can be attributed to self-absorption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of general relativity, dark energy was proposed to explain the cosmic acceleration. A pivotal inquiry in cosmology is to determine whether dark energy is the cosmological constant, and if not, the challenge lies in constraining how it evolves with time. In this paper, we utilize the latest observational data to constrain some typical dark energy models, and make a comparison for them according to their capabilities of fitting the current data. Our study is confined to late-universe observations, including the baryon acoustic oscillation, type Ia supernova, cosmic chronometer, and strong gravitational lensing time delay data. We employ the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to assess the worth of models. The AIC analysis indicates that all dark energy models outperform the $\Lambda$CDM model. However, the BIC analysis leaves room for $\Lambda$CDM due to its heavier penalty on the model complexity. Compared to $\Lambda$CDM, most dark energy models are robustly supported by AIC while being explicitly disfavored by BIC. The models that are robustly favored by AIC and not explicitly disfavored by BIC include the $w$CDM, interacting dark energy, and Ricci dark energy models. Furthermore, we observe that an alternative modified gravity model exhibits superior performance when compared with $\Lambda$CDM from both the AIC and BIC perspectives.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of spherically symmetric black hole with cosmological constant and global monopole in bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the scalar, electromagnetic field and Dirac field perturbations of spherically symmetric black hole within the framework of Einstein-bumblebee gravity model with global monopole and cosmological constant. We investigate the effective potentials, greybody factors and quasinormal modes (QNMs) by applying the Klein-Gordon equation, electromagnetic field equation and Dirac equation expressed in Newman-Penrose (NP) formalism. Using the general method of rigorous bound, the greybody factors of scalar, electromagnetic and Dirac field are derived. Applying the sixth order WKB approximation and Pad\'{e} approximation, the QNM frequencies are derived. We also discuss the impact of global monopole $\eta$, cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and Lorentz violation parameter $L$ to the effective potential, greybody factor and QNMs. Increasing the parameter $\eta$ prevents the rise of effective potential for both Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS)-like and Schwarzschild-Anti de Sitter (SAdS)-like black holes with global monopole and consequently increases the greybody factors. However, decreasing the parameter $L$ reduces the rise of effective potential for the SAdS-like black hole with global monopole and it increases the greybody factor but increasing the parameter $L$ has an opposite effect for SdS-like black hole with global monopole. It is also shown that the shadow radius increases with increasing the parameter $\eta$ for both dS and AdS cases. Increasing the value of $L$ tends to increase the shadow radius for dS black hole but it has an opposite effect in AdS case. A careful studying is being carried out to investigate how the absorption cross-section gets affected when the parameter $L$ appears into the picture.</description>

      <title>Glueball mass spectrum at finite temperature revisited: Constant contribution in glueball correlators in the deconfinement phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the glueball properties at finite temperature from the temporal correlation in $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory using anisotropic lattice QCD. Although the existence of a constant contribution to the meson correlation function appearing in the deconfinement phase are known, its effect on the glueball correlation function at finite temperature has not been considered in previous studies. The present study reveals that the constant contribution to the glueball correlation function actually occurs in the three lowest-lying glueball states, corresponding to the $0^{++}$, $2^{++}$ and $0^{-+}$ glueballs, from near the critical temperature of the deconfinement phase transition $T_C$ to the high temperature side. If the existence of constant terms is taken into account in the standard pole-mass analysis, it is observed that the pole-mass of the glueball ground state remains unchanged below $T_c$ and then increases with temperature above $T_C$. The result indicates that the true temperature dependence of the glueball mass above $T_C$ is opposite to the results of the previous studies.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the simultaneous variation of the fine structure constant and electron mass in light of DESI BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological constraints of the time variation of the electron mass $m_e$ and the fine-structure constant $\alpha$, using data of cosmic microwave background, supernovae light curve and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data including the recent DESI BAO DR2 measurements. The results are slightly depending on the BAO data set included in the analysis. The latest DESI BAO DR2 data strongly indicates that $m_e$ or $\alpha$ is slightly larger than the previous data from 6DF+SDSS and DESI BAO DR1. We also compare the varying $m_e$ model, the varying $\alpha$ model, and the simultaneous variation of $m_e$ and $\alpha$. When considering the Hubble tension, a larger electron mass is the most promising option and the variation of the fine-structure constants does not alleviate the tension.</description>

      <title>A Prototype Atom Interferometer to Detect Dark Matter and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AION project has built a tabletop prototype of a single-photon long-baseline atom interferometer using the 87Sr clock transition - a type of quantum sensor designed to search for dark matter and gravitational waves. Our prototype detector operates at the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), producing a signal with no unexpected noise beyond atom shot noise. Importantly, the detector remains at the SQL even when additional laser phase noise is introduced, emulating conditions in a long-baseline detector such as AION or AEDGE where significant laser phase deviations will accumulate during long atom interrogation times. Our results mark a key milestone in extending atom interferometers to long baselines. Such interferometers can complement laser-interferometer gravitational wave detectors by accessing the mid-frequency gravitational wave band around 1 Hz, and can search for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Analogue of Chern-Simons invariant in non-metricity gravity and axion cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a pseudo-scalar quantity, which is an analogue of the Chern-Simons invariant, in the framework of non-metricity gravity. By considering the coupling between the pseudo-scalar quantity and the axion, we give scenarios which may solve the problems of the axion misalignment, the $S_8$ problem, and the beginning of inflation. When the phase transition associated with the spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry of the electroweak theory or grand unified theories (GUTs) occurs, the pseudo-scalar quantity has a non-trivial value, which induces the misalignment of the axion field and axion particles are produced. If the gradient of the potential is small, the $S_8$ problem might be solved. We also propose a mechanism which induces inflation by the misalignment of the axion field generated by the phase transition of the GUTs.</description>

      <title>Event shape dependence of symmetry plane correlations using the Gaussian estimator in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC using AMPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of symmetry plane correlations (SPCs) can be useful in characterizing the direction of the anisotropic emission of produced particles in the final state. The study of SPCs provides an independent method to understand the transport properties of the system formed in heavy-ion collisions. Similar to anisotropic flow coefficients, which are largely influenced by the initial spatial anisotropy, SPCs also depend upon the participant plane correlation measured using the participating nucleons of the collision overlap region. In this paper, SPCs have been studied in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV using the event generator AMPT. In addition to their behaviour with the changing centrality of the collision, their event shape dependence has also been studied for the first time, using the event shape classifier transverse spherocity. The Gaussian estimator has been used to evaluate the correlations, and these have been compared to the participant plane correlations defined in an analogous way to the symmetry plane correlations and a qualitative match has been found between them. These event-shape differentiated symmetry plane correlations can be used to deduce the presence of higher-order anisotropies in the initial energy distribution, thus giving insight into the initial geometry of the colliding system, among other applications like model development and model testing using Bayesian analyses.</description>

      <title>Black holes with electroweak hair -- the detailed derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a very detailed derivation of solutions describing hairy black holes within the gravity-coupled Weinberg-Salam theory, which were previously reported in \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.171402}{Phys.Rev.Lett. 133 (2024) 171402}. These black holes support a strong magnetic field that polarizes the electroweak vacuum and creates a condensate of massive fields carrying superconducting currents along the black hole horizon. The currents, in turn, generate a ``corona'' of magnetic vortex segments attached to the horizon at both ends. The condensate and corona together constitute the black hole hair. The extremal solutions approach, in the far field, the magnetic Reissner-Nordstr\"om configuration, with a total mass that is {\it lower} than the total charge, $M&lt;|Q|$, due to the negative Zeeman energy of the condensate. This makes the removal of the hair energetically unfavorable. The maximally hairy black holes exhibit masses comparable to terrestrial values, with approximately 11\% of their total mass stored in the hair. Given that these solutions arise within a well-tested theoretical framework, they are likely to have physical relevance.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative renormalization group for Higgs-like models in 4D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recently defined a model of 2 coupled SU(2) Higgs doublets which revealed an interesting structure of renormalization group flows to 1-loop when the SU(2) is broken to U(1). In this article we compute the beta functions to 3 loops and show that the 1-loop structure of flows persists to higher orders. For SU(2) broken to U(1), we conjecture a beta function to all orders. The flows can be extended to large coupling using a strong-weak coupling duality $g \to 1/g$. One finds a line of fixed points which are new conformal field theories in 4 spacetime dimensions which are non-unitary due to negative norm states but still have real eigenvalues. We also find massless flows between 2 non-trivial fixed points, and a regime with a cyclic RG flow. For the flows between points on the critical line, we compute the anomalous dimensions of the perturbations in the UV and IR, and identify some special points where anomalous dimensions are rational numbers. The model is non-unitary since the hamiltonian is pseudo-hermitian, $H^\dagger = {\cal K} H {\cal K}^\dagger$. The unitary operator ${\cal K}$ satisfies ${\cal K}^2 =1$ and this allows a projection onto positive norm states with a unitary time evolution with positive probabilities.</description>

Abstract: We measured the strange-meson spectrum in the scattering reaction $K^{-}+p \rightarrow K^{-}\pi^{-}\pi^{-}+p$ with the COMPASS spectrometer at CERN. Using the world's largest sample of this reaction, we performed a comprehensive partial-wave analysis of the mesonic final state. It substantially extends the strange-meson spectrum covering twelve states with masses up to 2.4 GeV/$c^2$. We observe the first candidate for a crypto-exotic strange meson with $J^{P}=0^{-}$ and find $K_3$ and $K_4$ states consistent with predictions for the ground states.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that samples a set of loop momenta distributed as a given Feynman integrand. The algorithm uses the tropical sampling method and can be applied to evaluate phase-space-type integrals efficiently. We provide an implementation, momtrop, and apply it to a series of relevant integrals from the loop-tree duality framework. Compared to naive sampling methods, we observe convergence speedups by factors of more than $10^6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is important to explore the potential existence of lepton asymmetry in the neutrino sector. Conducting a joint analysis of DESI DR2 BAO data and \emph{Planck} 2018 CMB data, we obtain the upper limits on the neutrino degeneracy parameter, i.e., $\xi_{3}&lt;0.56$ for the normal mass hierarchy while $\xi_{3}&lt;0.62$ for the inverted mass hierarchy, at 95\% confidence level. Considering the influence of the dynamical dark energy, we find that these upper limits remain to be robust. This work may provide helpful implications for model buildings of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study coupling selection rules of chiral matter fields in heterotic string theory with standard embedding. These selection rules are determined by topological properties of Calabi-Yau threefolds. We classify coupling selection rules on complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefolds for $h^{1,1}\leq 5$. It is found that all of these selection rules for $h^{1,1}\leq 5$ are understood by combinations of only five types of fusion rules.</description>

      <title>Axion Mixing in the String Axiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The string axiverse presents a fascinating and complex landscape for axion physics. In this work, we study axion mass mixing within the type IIB string axiverse, focusing specifically on the LARGE volume scenario (LVS) axiverse. The LVS axiverse necessitates at least two axions to ensure the presence of both a QCD axion candidate and at least one additional axion-like particle (ALP). This study presents the first systematic exploration of axion mass mixing in scenarios involving more than two axions. The maximal mixing occurs when the masses of all ALPs are smaller than the zero-temperature mass of the QCD axion, with no two ALP masses being equal, and when the decay constants of all ALPs are simultaneously either smaller or larger than the decay constant of the QCD axion. Additionally, the transfer of axion energy density ultimately takes place only between the two axions with the closest masses. These findings provide critical insights into axion dynamics not only within type IIB string axiverse models but also in broader multi-axion mixing frameworks. The potential cosmological implications of axion mass mixing are also addressed at the end. Our work contributes to the understanding of axion physics in string theory.</description>

      <title>Essay: A path for the construction of a Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muons are elementary particles and provide cleaner collision events that can explore higher energies compared to composite particles like protons. Muons are also far heavier than their electron cousins, meaning that they emit less synchrotron radiation that effectively limits the energies of circular electron-positron colliders. These characteristics open up the possibility for a Muon Collider to surpass the direct energy reach of the Large Hadron Collider while achieving unprecedented precision measurements of Standard Model processes. In this Essay, after briefly summarizing the progress achieved so far, I identify important missing R&amp;D steps and envision a compelling plan to bring a Muon Collider to reality in the next two decades. A Muon Collider could allow for the exploration of physics that is not available with current technologies. For example, it may provide a way to study the Higgs boson directly or probe new particles, including those related to dark matter or other phenomena beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems approach to Cold and Warm Inflation within slow-roll and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically present a new dynamical systems approach to standard inflationary processes and their variants as constant-roll inflation. Using the techniques presented in our work one can in general investigate the attractor nature of the inflationary models in the phase space. We have compactified the phase space coordinates, wherever necessary, and regulated the nonlinear differential equations, constituting the autonomous system of equations defining the dynamical system, at the cost of a new redefined time variable which is a monotonic increasing function of the standard time coordinate. We have shown that in most of the relevant cases the program is executable although the two time coordinates may show different durations of cosmological events. If one wishes one can revert back to the cosmological time via an inverse transformation. The present work establishes a standard norm for studying dynamical as well as stability issues in any new inflationary system.</description>

      <title>False and genuine decoherence in the early universe: a local observer and time-averaged observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10472v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum decoherence of curvature perturbations at superhorizon scales caused by the gravitational nonlinearities. We show that cubic gravitational couplings, constrained by the spatial diffeomorphism invariance, lead to infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) divergences in the decoherence rate at one loop. These divergences arise from fluctuations of deep IR modes which look like a background mode for a local observer and violent zero-point fluctuations in the deep UV, respectively. We argue that these divergences are unobservable, as they vanish when considering proper observables. We consider correlators defined using the geodesic distance for IR divergences and time-averaged correlators for UV divergences. To account for these observer's perspectives, we propose to consider an effective quantum state, defined in terms of actual observables, as a more appropriate probe of the quantum coherence of the system measured by an observer. We then evaluate the finite decoherence rate induced by superhorizon environment during inflation and at late universe.</description>

      <title>Vector induced Gravitational Waves sourced by Primordial Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a generic formalism for the study of tensor perturbations induced at second order by first-order vector metric perturbations, dubbing these induced tensor modes $\textit{vector-induced gravitational waves}$ (VIGWs). Notably, considering an inflation-inspired power-law type magnetic field power spectrum of the form $P_B(k)\propto k^{n_\mathrm{B}}$ (where $n_{\rm B}$ is the magnetic spectral index), we show that the VIGW signal is enhanced for stiff post-inflationary EoS, with the maximum enhancement happening for $w=1$. We explicitly demonstrate this contribution is dominant over the first-order magnetically-sourced GWs. The VIGW spectrum exhibits a maximum at around the scale crossing the cosmological horizon at the end of reheating, $k_\mathrm{reh}$, with its present day peak amplitude scaling as $\Omega_{\rm GW}(k_{\rm reh},\eta_0)\propto \Delta N_{\rm reh}\times(H_{\rm inf}/M_{\rm Pl})^{8}$, where $H_{\rm inf}$ is the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation and $\Delta N_{\rm reh}$ the duration of the post-inflationary era in $e$-folds. For $w=1$ (kination) and $n_{\rm B}&gt;-3/2$, one further obtains a nearly $n_{\rm B}$-independent frequency scaling of the GW spectrum of the form $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f,\eta_0)\propto \left(\frac{f}{f_{\rm reh}}\right)^{-2.8}$ for $f&gt;f_\mathrm{reh}\equiv k_\mathrm{reh}/(2\pi)$. Finally, we need to highlight that the VIGW signal can be well within the detection bands of several next-generation interferometric GW missions at small scales. Indicatively, for $H_{\rm inf} \sim O(10^{7})\:\mathrm{GeV}$ and $O(10^{14})\:\mathrm{GeV}$, and $\Delta N_{\rm reh} \sim 15$ and $10$, the VIGW signal is found to be detectable by LISA and ET respectively.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic EW corrections at one-loop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fully automated implementation of next-to-leading order electroweak (NLO EW) corrections in the logarithmic approximation in OpenLoops. For energies above the electroweak scale NLO EW corrections are logarithmically enhanced and in tails of kinematic distributions of crucial LHC processes yield correction factors of several tens of percent. The implementation of the logarithmic Sudakov EW approximation in the amplitude generator OpenLoops is fully general, largely model independent, it supports the computation of EW corrections to resonant processes, and it is suitable for extensions to the two-loop NNLO EW level. The implementation is based on an efficient representation of the logarithmic approximation in terms of an effective vertex approach. Investigating a set of representative LHC processes we find excellent agreement between the logarithmic approximation and full one-loop results in observables where the assumptions of the EW Sudakov approximation are fulfilled.</description>

      <title>Flavor phenomenology of an extended 2HDM with inverse seesaw mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a detailed and comprehensive study of several flavor physics observables in both lepton and quark sectors within the framework of an extended 2HDM theory where the inverse seesaw mechanism is implemented to generate the SM fermion mass hierarchy. In that theory, the SM gauge symmetry is supplemented by the local $U(1)_X$ and discrete $Z_4\times Z_2$ groups. In particular, we find that the leptonic flavor observables specifically, the branching ratios of LFV decays $\mu\to e\gamma, \tau\to e(\mu)\gamma$ and the anomalous magnetic moments $\Delta a_{e(\mu)}$ strongly depend on the couplings of the neutral CP even(odd) Higgses with exotic charged lepton $E_1$, whereas other observables involving BR($l\to 3l'$), Mu-$\overline{\text{Mu}}$ transition and coherent conversion $\mu \to e $ in a muonic atom are predicted to be less than several orders of magnitude compared to the corresponding experimental limits. Regarding the quark sector, the most stringent limits arising from the FCNC process involving the down-type quark $d_a\to d_b$ ($a=1,2,3$) transitions such as BR($\bar{B}\to X_s \gamma$), BR$(B_s\to \mu^+\mu^-)$, and meson mixing $ \Delta m_{K,B_s, B_d}$. Considering the obtained constraints from these observables, the new physics contributions to other observables namely BR$(B_s\to \tau^+\mu^-)$, BR$(B^+\to K^+\tau^+\tau^-)$, BR$(B^+\to K^+\tau^+\mu^-)$, and FCCC $b\to c$ transition LFUV ratios $R_{D^{(*)}}$ are shown to be remarkably small. Regarding the observables in the up-type quark transitions, the FCNC top quark processes $t\to u(c)\gamma$ and $t\to u(c)h$ have branching ratios consistent with the experimental limits. Additionally, observables related to SM-like Higgs boson decays BR$(h\to \bar{l}'l)$ and modified couplings $a_{h\bar{f}f}$ are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Quark mass dependence of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ pole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15141v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, several LQCD simulations have proven that the interaction in the isoscalar channel in $DD^*$ scattering is attractive. This channel is naturally connected to the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ which is observed in the $D^0D^0\pi^+$ invariant mass distribution. However, it remains an open question whether the virtual bound state found in the several LQCD simulations is actually linked to the LHCb experimental observation. In this article we perform an EFT-based analysis of the LQCD data and demostrate that a proper chiral extrapolation leads to a $T_{cc}$ pole compatible with experiment. At the physical pion mass, we find a virtual bound state with a binding energy $\Delta E=-0.06 \left(^{+1.30}_{-2.20}\right) \left(^{+0.50}_{-1.11}\right)$. Moreover, we extract from a global analysis both, the light and heavy quark mass dependence of the $T_{cc}$ pole, and study the role of the $\rho$ and $\pi$ meson exchanges.</description>

      <title>A try for dark energy in quantum field theory: The vacuum energy of neutrino field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06604v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quartic-divergent vacuum energy poses an ultraviolet (UV) challenge (the cosmological constant problem) in probing the nature of dark energy. Here we try to evaluate the contribution of the vacuum energy to dark energy with a method of the UV-free scheme. The result indicates that it is not a problem in the UV region but a question of the contributions of heavy fields being suppressed. Then, we propose an effective description via scale decoupling. The parameter spaces suggest that the active vacuum energy of neutrino fields can naturally meet the observation of dark energy density, and a neutrino with a typical mass $\sim$ 10 meV is expected. The normal ordering neutrinos are preferred by naturalness, and the neutrino mass window set by dark energy is 6.3 meV $\lesssim m_1 \lesssim$ 16.3 meV, 10.7 meV $\lesssim m_2 \lesssim$ 18.4 meV, 50.5 meV $\lesssim m_3 \lesssim$ 52.7 meV.</description>

Abstract: This work primarily focusses on determining the magnetic moments of $\frac{1}{2}^-$ baryon resonances in the presence of hot and dense hadronic matter. In the chiral $SU(3)$ quark mean field model approach, we have essentially accounted for the effects on in-medium scalar meson fields to investigate the impact of high densities on the in-medium baryon masses and their constituent quarks. In light of chiral constituent quark model $\chi$CQM, we have calculated the magnetic moments of $\frac{1}{2}^-$ baryon resonances and scrutinized the effects due to its internal constituents: the valence quarks, sea quarks and the orbital moment of sea quarks. Furthermore, we have investigated the effective baryonic magnetic moments for the finite magnitudes of isospin asymmetry and strangeness fraction.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis from a Majorana Fermion Coupled to Quarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the theory with a Majorana fermion ($X$) coupled to quark-like fermions ($Q$) via a dimension-six four-fermion vector-vector interaction, we have computed in an earlier work the baryon asymmetry generated in the decay and scattering processes of the $X$ with $Q$. In this work we consider such processes in the expanding early Universe, set up the Boltzmann equations governing the $X$ and net baryon number densities, and numerically solve them in example benchmark points, taking the thermally averaged decay and scattering rates and their temperature dependence from the earlier study. We find that starting from a baryon symmetric Universe at early time, the presently observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) can be explained in this theory over a wide range of mass scales, $M_\chi\in (10^4,10^{16})$ GeV for appropriately chosen couplings. We find that scattering processes play a crucial role in generating the baryon asymmetry in this theory. We present our results in a general manner that should be useful not just in our theory, but also in other related theories that share the essential ingredients. Our results should help guide promising ways to probe such new physics in terrestrial experiments. For instance, in regions of parameter space that yield the observed BAU, we present the rate for neutron-antineutron oscillation and discuss the prospects for observing this in upcoming experiments.</description>

Interesting phenomenology includes a possible narrow near threshold resonance in $\eta'$ photoproduction and whether the parity doublets observed in the higher mass nucleon resonance spectrum might be hinting at a possible second minimum in the confinement potential corresponding to supercritical confinement.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the electromagnetic polarizabilities of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ singly heavy baryons in the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory up to $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$. We estimate the low-energy constants using the magnetic moments of singly charmed baryons from lattice QCD simulations and the experimental decay widths of $\Sigma_c$ and $\Sigma_c^*$. Our results indicate that the long-range chiral corrections make significant contributions to the polarizabilities. Additionally, the magnetic dipole transitions $\mathcal{B}_6^* \to \mathcal{B}_6 +\gamma $ also provide large contribution to the magnetic polarizabilities.</description>

Abstract: Knowledge of the pressure of cold and dense quark matter (QM) is known to significantly constrain the equation of state of neutron-star matter, a quantity playing a key role in deciphering the stars' internal structure. In this work, we make important progress towards determining the last unknown contribution to the pressure at Next-to-Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (N3LO) in the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$, available through the sum of all four-loop vacuum diagrams of dense Quantum Chromodynamics. We demonstrate the cancellation of both the covariant gauge parameter and all infrared (IR) divergences in the sum, showcasing the effective-field-theory paradigm in action. For the remaining IR-finite four-loop integrals, we demonstrate the efficacy of the dense Loop Tree Duality method -- a novel numerical framework for multiloop calculations in thermal field theory. Together, our results show that completing the N3LO pressure of cold QM is no longer merely possible but for the first time concretely within reach.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the constraints on superluminal neutrino Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) parameters from the observation of the ultra-high-energy event KM3-230213A by KM3NeT collaboration in cases of linear $n=1$ and quadratic $n=2$ LIV scenarios. Assuming extragalactic origin of the event, we obtain the constraints on LIV mass scale $\Lambda_{n=1} = 1.1 \times 10^{30}\, \mbox{GeV}$ and $\Lambda_{n=2} = 1.1 \times 10^{19}\, \mbox{GeV}$ from the absence of neutrino splitting.</description>

      <title>$B \rightarrow TT$ decays in the QCD factorization approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, the nonleptonic two-body $B$ decays into two tensor mesons (including $a_2(1320)$, $K^*_2(1430)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f^\prime_2(1525)$, denoted generically as $T$) are investigated in the QCD factorization approach. The branching ratios, longitudinal polarization fractions, and CP asymmetries are predicted systematically. It is found that, from the perspective of central values, the branching ratios for the decays $B \rightarrow \{a_2 f^\prime_2, f_2 f^\prime_2\}$, $\{a_2f_2, f_2 f_2\}$ and $\{f_2 K^*_2, K^*_2f^\prime_2\}$ are at the order of $10^{-8}$, $10^{-7}$ and $10^{-6}$, respectively. The branching ratios for the decays into $\{a_2 a_2, K^*_2 K^*_2\}$ and $a_2 K^*_2$ are at the order of $10^{-8} - 10^{-7}$ and $10^{-7} - 10^{-6}$, respectively. The longitudinal polarization fractions are approximately $0.7-1$. Especially, for the $\bar{B}^0/B^0 \rightarrow \{K^{*-}_2 K^{*+}_2, f^\prime_2 f^\prime_2\}$ decays, the longitudinal polarization fractions are equal to $1$. The CP asymmetry for the $B^\pm \rightarrow a^\pm_2 f_2$ modes is most significant, roughly $-22\%$. The CP asymmetries for the decays $B \rightarrow \{a_2 f^\prime_2, f_2 f^\prime_2, f^\prime_2 f^\prime_2\}$ and $\bar{B}^0/B^0 \rightarrow K^{*-}_2 K^{*+}_2$ are equal to zero. Our results may be tested by more precise experiments in the future.</description>

      <title>Constraints on $\Delta L=2$ Vector Bosons with Tree Couplings to SM Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate phenomenological implications of vector bosons $V$ transforming as (1, 2, -3/2) under the standard model (SM) product gauge group $SU(3)_C$, $SU(2)_L$ and $U(1)_Y$. These vector bosons can couple to two SM leptons at tree-level forming dimension-4 operators. These operators dictate $V$ to have two units of global lepton number, $\Delta L = 2$. The operators generated conserve the global lepton number but can violate generational lepton numbers. We study constraints on the couplings $Y$ of $V$ to SM particles using tree-level processes such as $l_\alpha^{-} \to l_\beta^{+} l_\rho^{-} l_\sigma^{-}$, muonium and antimuonium oscillation, neutrino trident scattering, inverse muon decay, $e^- e^+ \to l^- l^+$, and also one-loop level processes such as the magnetic dipole moment of a charged lepton and $l_i \to l_j \gamma$. Strong constraints are obtained from $l_\alpha^{-} \to l_\beta^{+} l_\rho^{-} l_\sigma^{-}$ with $\left|Y_{e e} Y^{*}_{\mu e}\right| &lt; 3.29 \times 10^{-11}\left(m_{V}/ \mathrm{GeV}\right)^{2},\left|Y_{e e} Y^{*}_{e \mu}\right| &lt; 3.29 \times 10^{-11}\left(m_{V}/ \mathrm{GeV}\right)^{2}$ and from $l_i \to l_j \gamma$ with $ \left|Y_{\tau e}Y_{\mu\tau}^{*}\right|&lt;3.46\times10^{-12}(m_{V}/ \mathrm{GeV})^2, \left|Y_{e \tau}Y_{\tau \mu}^{*}\right|&lt;3.46\times10^{-12}\left(m_{V}/ \mathrm{GeV}\right)^2$, respectively. Interestingly, the imaginary part of the coupling constant in our model induces CP violation, which is constrained by experimental limits on the electric dipole moment.</description>

      <title>Natural Top Quark Condensation (a Redux)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model involves a pointlike 4-fermion interaction. While it gives a useful description of chiral dynamics (mainly in QCD), it nonetheless omits the crucially important internal wave-function of a two-body bound state, $\phi(r)$. This becomes significant near critical coupling where $\phi(r)$ extends to large distance, leading to dilution and suppression of induced couplings $\propto \phi(0)$, such as the Yukawa and quartic couplings, as well as reduced fine-tuning of a hierarchy. In top quark condensation, where the BEH boson is a $\bar{t}t$ bound state and we have a UV completion such as topcolor, we must go beyond the NJL model and include effects of $\phi(r)$. We provide a formulation of this for the Brout-Englert-Higgs boson, and find that it leads to an extended $\phi(r)$, a significantly reduced and natural composite scale of $M_0 \sim 6$ TeV, a successful prediction for the quartic coupling, $\lambda$, and fine tuning that is reduced to a few percent, providing a compelling candidate solution to the naturalness problem of the BEH boson. The theory is testable and new physics should begin to emerge on the multi-TeV mass scales and possibly accessible to the LHC.</description>

      <title>Scalar-assisted magnetogenesis during the radiation-dominated epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism to generate primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) strong enough to explain the observed cosmic magnetic fields. We employ a scalar field charged under U(1) gauge symmetry with a non-trivial VEV to provide an effective mass term to the EM field and thus break its conformal invariance. The primordial magneto-genesis takes place in the radiation dominated (RD) epoch, after the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) phase. As a result, our mechanism is naturally free from the over-production of electric fields due to high conductivity in the RD epoch, and the baryon isocurvature problem which takes place only if magneto-genesis happens before the ESWB phase. In addition, we find that a significant amount of PMFs can be generated when the scalar field experiences a tachyonic phase. In this case, the scalar field is light and weakly coupled and has negligible energy density compared to the cold dark matter, hence the strong coupling problem and the back-reaction problem are also absent. Therefore, our model is free from the above-mentioned problems that frequently appear in other primordial magneto-genesis scenarios.</description>

      <title>Choose Your Diffusion: Efficient and flexible ways to accelerate the diffusion model in fast high energy physics simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diffusion model has demonstrated promising results in image generation, recently becoming mainstream and representing a notable advancement for many generative modeling tasks. Prior applications of the diffusion model for both fast event and detector simulation in high energy physics have shown exceptional performance, providing a viable solution to generate sufficient statistics within a constrained computational budget in preparation for the High Luminosity LHC. However, many of these applications suffer from slow generation with large sampling steps and face challenges in finding the optimal balance between sample quality and speed. The study focuses on the latest benchmark developments in efficient ODE/SDE-based samplers, schedulers, and fast convergence training techniques. We test on the public CaloChallenge and JetNet datasets with the designs implemented on the existing architecture, the performance of the generated classes surpass previous models, achieving significant speedup via various evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Enhancing dark siren cosmology through multi-band gravitational wave synergetic observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-band gravitational-wave (GW) standard siren observations are poised to herald a new era in the study of cosmic evolution. These observations offer higher signal-to-noise ratios and improved localizations compared to those achieved with single-band GW detection, which are crucial for the cosmological applications of dark sirens. In this work, we explore the role multi-band GW synergetic observations will play in measuring cosmological parameters, particularly in comparison with single GW observatory data. We used mock multi-band dark siren data from third-generation GW detectors and the baseline Decihertz Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory to infer cosmological parameters. Our analysis shows that multi-band GW observations significantly improve sky localization accuracy by two to three orders of magnitude over single-band observations, although their impact on luminosity distance error remains limited. This results in a substantial improvement in the constraints on matter density and the Hubble constant, enhancing their constraint precision by $60\%$-$90\%$ and $52\%$-$85\%$, respectively. We conclude that the significant potential of multi-band GW synergistic observations for detecting GW signals and resolving the Hubble tension is highly promising and warrants anticipation.</description>

      <title>ATLAS searches for additional scalars and exotic Higgs boson decays with the LHC Run 2 dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report reviews the published results of searches for possible additional scalar particles and exotic decays of the Higgs boson performed by the ATLAS Collaboration using up to 140 fb$^{-1}$ of 13 TeV proton-proton collision data collected during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider. Key results are examined, and observed excesses, while never statistically compelling, are noted. Constraints are placed on parameters of several models which extend the Standard Model, for example by adding one or more singlet or doublet fields, or offering exotic Higgs boson decay channels. Summaries of new searches as well as extensions of previous searches are discussed. These new results have a wider reach or attain stronger exclusion limits. New experimental techniques that were developed for these searches are highlighted. Search channels which have not yet been examined are also listed, as these provide insight into possible future areas of exploration.</description>

      <title>The nuclear matter effect on parton distribution functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) are important quantities in describing nucleon structures. They are universal and process-independent. As a matter of fact, nucleon PDFs are inevitably affected by nuclear matter during nuclear scattering process. In order to study the nuclear PDFs (nPDFs), in this paper, we introduce the nucleon pair PDFs (dPDFs) to describe parton distributions in the nucleon pair which is confined to a nucleus. We first of all construct the nuclear state in terms of the nucleonic states and calculate the operator definition of nPDFs. Neglecting the higher order corrections or multi-nucleon correlations, we find that nPDFs can be written as a sum of two terms which respectively correspond to PDFs and dPDFs. Nucleon pair PDFs which stem from nucleon-nucleon correlation are proportional to common nucleon PDFs but suppressed by a factor. Compared with the experimental data, we find that dPDFs can explain the behaviour of the EMC effect. We further calculate the Paschos-Wolfenstein ratio to study the nuclear matter effect on the extraction of weak mixing angle or $\sin^2\theta_W$ by using dPDFs.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Fragmentation at the Future Electron-Ion Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of conducting low-energy nuclear physics studies, including nuclear structure and decay, at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at Brookhaven. By comparing the standard theory of electron-nucleus scattering with the equivalent photon method applied to Ultraperipheral Collisions (UPC) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. In the limit of extremely high beam energies and small energy transfers, very transparent equations emerge. We apply these equations to analyze nuclear fragmentation in UPCs at the LHC and $eA$ scattering at the EIC, demonstrating that the EIC could facilitate unique photonuclear physics studies. However, we have also shown that the fragmentation cross-sections at the EIC are about 1,000 times smaller than those at the LHC. At the LHC, the fragmentation of uranium nuclei displays characteristic double-hump mass distributions from fission events, while at the EIC, fragmentation is dominated by neutron emission and fewer few fission products, about 10,000 smaller number of events.</description>

      <title>Negative non-Gaussianity as a salvager for PBHs with PTAs in bounce</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Gaussianity in the primordial curvature perturbation is a crucial element of the early universe due to its significant impact on the primordial black hole (PBH) production. In this work, we focus on the effects of negative non-Gaussianity on PBH abundance through the lens of the compaction function criterion for PBH formation. Our setup utilizes an effective field theory of non-singular bounce, including the standard slow-roll inflation with an ultra-slow roll phase for amplifying the curvature perturbations to form PBHs. We investigate with two separate values of the non-Gaussianity parameter, $f_{\rm NL}=(-39.95,-35/8)$, found within the ekpyrotic contraction and the matter bounce scenarios, respectively, and show that a negatively large amount of $f_{\rm NL}$ can provide sizeable abundance, $10^{-3}\leq f_{\rm PBH}\leq 1$, and completely mitigates the PBH overproduction issue. We also highlight that the case with the effective sound speed $c_{s}=1$, coupled with $f_{\rm NL}=-39.95$, provides an agreement under $1\sigma$ for the scalar-induced gravitational wave explanation of the latest PTA (NANOGrav15 and EPTA) signal. Lastly, we extract an upper bound on the most negative value of, $f_{\rm NL}\sim -60$, below which we show breaching of the underlying perturbativity constraints on the power spectrum amplitude.</description>

Abstract: We compute the non-Gaussian corrections to the energy density and anisotropies of gravitational waves induced during the radiation era after an ultra-slow-roll phase of inflation by using a diagrammatic approach, and present the corresponding Feynman rules. Our two-loop calculation includes both the intrinsic non-Gaussianity of the inflaton perturbation $\delta\phi$ and the non-Gaussianity arising from the nonlinear relation between the latter and the curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}$, which we find to be subdominant with respect to the former. We apply our formalism to an analytical model in which the ultra-slow-roll phase is followed by a constant-roll stage with a nonvanishing second slow-roll parameter $\eta$, and address the renormalization of the one-loop scalar power spectrum in this scenario.</description>

Abstract: DWs represent two-dimensional topological defects that emerge from the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries in various new physics models. In this study, we undertake the first calculation of GWs produced by scalar perturbations generated from the DW network. Our findings indicate that the GW spectrum is notably distinct from that of other sources. This opens up a promising avenue for future GW experiments aimed at exploring the role of DWs in the early universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a strongly coupled finite-density anisotropic fluid in $2+1$ dimensions dual to an asymptotically AdS black brane that is a solution of Einstein-Maxwell-Axion theory in $3+1$ dimensions. Despite the anisotropy, the fluid thermodynamic properties align with those of a conformal fluid. Moreover, we show that the fluid is stable under the increase of the anisotropy parameter. Additionally, we analyse the DC conductivity of the anisotropic fluid, showing its compatibility with momentum dissipation due to translational symmetry breaking. In the limit of very large anisotropy we find that the DC conductivity vanishes as a consequence of dimensionality reduction. We also find that a metal-insulator transition arises driven by the anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Double Exponents in $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently proposed $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The slope of the potential in the inflaton direction is exponentially suppressed at large values of the inflaton field, but the slope of the potential in the axion direction is double-exponentially suppressed. Therefore, the axion field remains nearly massless and practically does not change during inflation. The inflationary trajectory in such models is stable with respect to quantum fluctuations of the axion field. We show that isocurvature perturbations do not feed into the curvature perturbations during inflation, and discuss the possibility of such transfer at the post-inflationary stage.</description>

      <title>QCD Axion Dark Matter in the Dark Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed dark dimension scenario reveals that axions can be localized on the Standard Model brane, thereby predicting the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) axion decay constant from the Weak Gravity Conjecture: $f_a\lesssim M_5 \sim 10^{9}-10^{10}\, \rm GeV$, where $M_5$ is the five-dimensional Planck mass. When combined with observational lower bounds, this implies that $f_a$ falls within a narrow range $f_a\sim 10^{9}-10^{10}\, \rm GeV$, corresponding to the axion mass $m_a\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}\, \rm eV$. At this scale, the QCD axion constitutes a minor fraction of the total cold dark matter (DM) density $\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$. In this work, we investigate the issue of QCD axion DM within the context of the dark dimension and demonstrate that the QCD axion in this scenario can account for the entire DM abundance through a simple two-axion mixing mechanism. Specifically, we consider the resonant conversion of an axion-like particle (ALP) into the QCD axion. We find that, in a scenario where the ALP possesses a mass of approximately $m_A \sim 10^{-5} \, \rm eV$ and a decay constant of $f_A \sim 10^{11} \, \rm GeV$, the QCD axion in the dark dimension can account for the overall DM. The ALP required within this specific range may originate from the grand unification of gauge forces in the dark dimension.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analysis of hybrid neutron star EOS constraints within an instantaneous nonlocal chiral quark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a physics-informed Bayesian analysis of equation of state constraints using observational data for masses, radii and tidal deformability of pulsars and a generic class of hybrid neutron star equation of state with color superconducting quark matter on the basis of a recently developed nonlocal chiral quark model. The nuclear matter phase is described within a relativistic density functional model of the DD2 class and the phase transition is obtained by a Maxwell construction. We find the region in the two-dimensional parameter space spanned by the vector meson coupling and the scalar diquark coupling, where three conditions are fulfilled: (1) the Maxwell construction can be performed, \mbox{(2) the maximum} mass of the hybrid neutron star is not smaller than \mbox{2.0 M$_\odot$} and (3) the onset density of the phase transition is not below the nuclear saturation density $n_0=0.15$ fm$^{-3}$. The result of this study shows that the favorable neutron star equation of state has low onset masses for the occurrence of a color superconducting quark matter core between 0.5-0.7 $M_\odot$ and maximum masses in the range 2.15-2.22 $M_\odot$. In the typical mass range of 1.2-2.0 $M_\odot$, the radii of these stars are between 11.9 and 12.4 km, almost independent of the mass. In principle, hybrid stars would allow for larger maximum masses than provided by the hadronic reference equation of state.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory on curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09919v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses how particle production from the vacuum can be explained by local analysis when the field theory is defined by differential geometry on curved manifolds. We have performed the local analysis in a mathematically rigorous way, respecting the Markov property. The exact WKB is used as a tool for extracting non-perturbative effect from the local system. After a serious application of the differential geometry and the exact WKB to particle production, we show that entanglement does not appear in the Unruh effect as far as the standard formulation by the differential geometry is valid. This result should not be attributed to a consistency problem between the ``entanglement state'' and the ``standard field theory by differential geometry'', but to the fact that the conventional calculation of the Unruh effect is done by extrapolation which is not consistent with the differential geometry. The situation is similar to that of the Dirac monopole, but topology is not relevant and the basis for building field theories in differential geometry is strongly involved.</description>

      <title>Fully viable DHOST bounce with extra scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a class of Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-Tensor (DHOST) theories with an extra scalar field, which admits viable solutions of bouncing universe satisfying the following requirements: (i) absence of Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) instability, ghost and gradient instability, (ii) absence of superluminality, (iii) generation of nearly scale-invariant curvature perturbations and very small tensor-to-scalar ratio, and (iv) conventional asymptotics in the distant past and future, where gravity sector is described by General Relativity and the DHOST scalar has a canonical form of Lagrangian. We also expect our models to have sufficiently small non-Gaussianities of primordial curvature perturbations to be compatible with observations. As such, this work exemplifies for the first time the fully viable two-field DHOST bouncing cosmology, which is free of instability and superluminality problems as well as compatible with observations.</description>

      <title>Maximal Magic for Two-qubit States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\log (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\log(5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identity 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Decoherence in kappa-Minkowski Quantum Spacetime: An Open Quantum Systems Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate neutrino decoherence within the framework of quantum spacetime, focusing on the $\kappa$-Minkowski model. We show that stochastic fluctuations in quantum spacetime induce an energy-dependent decoherence effect, where the decoherence rate scales as $E^{-4}$. This result aligns with recent IceCube observations, indicating that quantum gravity does not induce significant decoherence for high-energy neutrinos. Additionally, we establish conditions under which quantum spacetime effects could influence relic neutrinos, such as those in the cosmic neutrino background ($C\nu B$). Our results shed light on how quantum spacetime fluctuations impact neutrino oscillation physics.</description>

      <title>Novel Polarimetric Analysis of Near Horizon Flaring Episodes in M87* in Millimeter Wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent multi-wavelength observations of M87* \citep{2024A&amp;A...692A.140A} revealed a high-energy $\gamma$-ray flare without a corresponding millimeter counterpart. We present a theoretical polarimetric study to evaluate the presence and nature of a potential millimeter flare in M87*, using a suite of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations with varying black hole (BH) spins and magnetic field configurations. We find that the emergence of a millimeter flare is strongly influenced by both spin and magnetic structure, with limited sensitivity to the electron distribution (thermal vs. non-thermal). We model the intensity light curve with a damped random walk (DRW) and compare the characteristic timescale ($\tau$) with recent SMA observations, finding that the simulated $\tau$ exceeds observed values by over an order of magnitude. In a flaring case with BH spin a=+0.5, we identify a distinct millimeter flare followed by an order-of-magnitude flux drop. All Stokes parameters show variability near the flare, including a sign reversal in the electric vector position angle. While most $\beta_m$ modes remain stable, the $EB$-correlation phase is highly sensitive to both the flare peak and decay. We examine polarimetric signatures in photon sub-rings, focusing on modes ns=0 and ns=1. The ns=0 signal closely matches the full image, while ns=1 reveals distinct behaviors, highlighting the potential of space VLBI to isolate sub-ring features. Finally, we analyze the magnetic and velocity field evolution during the flare, finding that magnetic reconnection weakens during the flux decay, and the clockwise velocity flow transitions into an outflow-dominated regime. These results suggest that transient radio variability near flares encodes key information about black hole spin and magnetic field structure, offering a novel probe into the physics of active galactic nuclei.</description>
