      <title>Low-genus primitive monodromy groups with a nonunique minimal normal subgroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f:X\to\mathbb P^1_\mathbb C$ be an indecomposable covering of genus $g$ whose monodromy group has more than one minimal normal subgroup. Closing a gap in the literature, we show that there is only one such covering when $g\leq 1$. Moreover, for arbitrary $g$, there are no such coverings with $n\gg_g 0$ sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Random unipotent Sylow subgroups of groups of Lie type of bounded rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2001 Liebeck and Pyber showed that a finite simple group of Lie type is a product of $ 25 $ carefully chosen unipotent Sylow subgroups. Later, in a series of works it was shown that $ 4 $ unipotent Sylow subgroups suffice. We prove that if the rank of a finite simple group of Lie type $ G $ is bounded, then $ G $ is a product of $ 11 $ random unipotent Sylow subgroups with probability tending to $ 1 $ as $ |G| $ tends to infinity. An application of the result to finite linear groups is given. The proofs do not depend on the classification of finite simple groups.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Minimal Faithful Permutation Degree for Fitting-free Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the complexity of computing the minimal faithful permutation degree for groups without abelian normal subgroups. When our groups are given as quotients of permutation groups, we establish that this problem is in $\textsf{P}$. Furthermore, in the setting of permutation groups, we obtain an upper bound of $\textsf{NC}$ for this problem. This improves upon the work of Das and Thakkar (STOC 2024), who established a Las Vegas polynomial-time algorithm for this class in the setting of permutation groups.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of affine cactus groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article deals with the study of affine cactus groups from a combinatorial point of view. Those groups are extensions of cactus groups, which are related to braid and diagram groups and have gained an important place in many mathematics topics. We first show that affine cactus groups may be described as cactus groups on Coxeter groups of type eAn. Then, we prove that these groups embed into a semi-direct product of Coxeter groups, which allows us to obtain a number of combinatorial properties of affine cactus groups, such as the solubility of the world problem or the fact that their centre is trivial.</description>

      <title>Free dilations of families of $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Commuting families of contractions or contractive $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups on Hilbert spaces often fail to admit power dilations resp. simultaneous unitary dilations which are themselves commutative (see [32, 11, 13]). There is however much room for non-commutative results. Sz.-Nagy [43] and Bo\.{z}ejko [4] provided means to dilate families of contractions to (in general non-commuting) families of unitaries. To complement this, the present work extends this discrete-time result to families of contractive $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups. We refer to these dilations as continuous-time \emph{free unitary dilations} and present three distinct approaches to obtain them: 1) an explicit derivation applicable to semigroups that arise as interpolations; 2) a full proof with an explicit construction which utilises the theory of co-generators \`{a} la S{\l}oci\'{n}ski [39, 40]; and 3) a second full proof based on the abstract structure of semigroups. We then reformulate such non-commuting systems naturally as semigroups defined over topological free products of $\mathbb{R}$, deriving weak approximation and residuality results in the process. Under this setup we discuss applications to Chernoff approximations, random evolutions, and evolution families.</description>

      <title>$\ell^p$ metrics on cell complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation that groups can be effectively studied using metric spaces modelled on $\ell^1$, $\ell^2$, and $\ell^\infty$ geometry, we consider cell complexes equipped with an $\ell^p$ metric for arbitrary $p$. Under weak conditions that can be checked locally, we establish nonpositive curvature properties of these complexes, such as Busemann-convexity and strong bolicity. We also provide detailed information on the geodesics of these metrics in the special case of CAT(0) cube complexes.</description>

      <title>The geometry of conjugation in affine Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop new and precise geometric descriptions of the conjugacy class $[x]$ and coconjugation set $\operatorname{C}(x,x') = \{ y \in \overline{W} \mid yxy^{-1} = x' \}$ for all elements $x,x'$ of any affine Coxeter group $\overline{W}$. The centralizer of $x$ in $\overline{W}$ is the special case $\operatorname{C}(x,x)$. The key structure in our description of the conjugacy class $[x]$ is the mod-set ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w) = (w-\operatorname{I})R^\vee$, where~$w$ is the finite part of $x$ and $R^\vee$ is the coroot lattice. The coconjugation set $\operatorname{C}(x,x')$ is then described by ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w')$ together with the fix-set of $w'$, where $w'$ is the finite part of $x'$. For any element $w$ of the associated finite Weyl group $W$, the mod-set of $w$ is contained in the classical move-set ${Mov}(w) = \operatorname{Im}(w - \operatorname{I})$. We prove that the rank of ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w)$ equals the dimension of ${Mov}(w)$, and then further investigate type-by-type the surprisingly subtle structure of the $\mathbb{Z}$-module ${Mod}_\overline{W}(w)$. As corollaries, we determine exactly when ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w) = {Mov}(w) \cap R^\vee$, in which case our closed-form descriptions of conjugacy classes and coconjugation sets are as simple as possible.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Preservations of Ulam Stability-type Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show some preservation results of amenably extending strongly Ulam stable groups under mild decay assumptions, including quantitative preservation of asymptotic bounds under the assumption that the modulus of stability is H\"older continuous of exponent $s&gt;\frac 1 2$ at 0, utilizing some simplistic integral estimates. Additionally, we show some partial results around inductive preservation of modulus bounds in infinite dimensions using these integral estimates, as well as strong quantitative preservation in the finite dimensional case. This implies the existence of $\mathfrak{U}$ uniformly stable existential closures among groups with sufficiently large Lipschitz estimates of any countable group. Finally, we show quantitative control preserving difficulty of approximation of maps over stable groups on diagonally embedding into higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Elements of Prime Power Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conjugacy classes and the vanishing elements of a finite group (i.e. elements where some irreducible character of the group vanishes) are among many basic invariants associated to a finite group. These invariants have shown their influence on the structure of groups. In recent years, the effect of combination of both the invariants has been widely studied. In this paper, we study the effect of vanishing elements of prime power order and their conjugacy classes on the structure of a group. We obtain a generalization of some recent results by Dolfi, Pacifici and Sanus (2010), and by Robati (2020).</description>

      <title>Common divisor graphs for skew braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12415v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two common divisor graphs associated with a finite skew brace, based on its $\lambda$- and $\theta$-orbits. We prove that the number of connected components is at most two and the diameter of a connected component is at most four. Furthermore, we investigate their relationship with isoclinism. Similarly to its group theoretic inspiration, the skew braces with a graph with two disconnected vertices are very restricted and are determined. Finally, we classify all finite skew braces with a graph with one vertex, where four infinite families arise.</description>
