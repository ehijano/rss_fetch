      <title>Provable Speech Attributes Conversion via Latent Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While signal conversion and disentangled representation learning have shown promise for manipulating data attributes across domains such as audio, image, and multimodal generation, existing approaches, especially for speech style conversion, are largely empirical and lack rigorous theoretical foundations to guarantee reliable and interpretable control. In this work, we propose a general framework for speech attribute conversion, accompanied by theoretical analysis and guarantees under reasonable assumptions. Our framework builds on a non-probabilistic autoencoder architecture with an independence constraint between the predicted latent variable and the target controllable variable. This design ensures a consistent signal transformation, conditioned on an observed style variable, while preserving the original content and modifying the desired attribute. We further demonstrate the versatility of our method by evaluating it on speech styles, including speaker identity and emotion. Quantitative evaluations confirm the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>AUREXA-SE: Audio-Visual Unified Representation Exchange Architecture with Cross-Attention and Squeezeformer for Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose AUREXA-SE (Audio-Visual Unified Representation Exchange Architecture with Cross-Attention and Squeezeformer for Speech Enhancement), a progressive bimodal framework tailored for audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE). AUREXA-SE jointly leverages raw audio waveforms and visual cues by employing a U-Net-based 1D convolutional encoder for audio and a Swin Transformer V2 for efficient and expressive visual feature extraction. Central to the architecture is a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism, which facilitates deep contextual fusion between modalities, enabling rich and complementary representation learning. To capture temporal dependencies within the fused embeddings, a stack of lightweight Squeezeformer blocks combining convolutional and attention modules is introduced. The enhanced embeddings are then decoded via a U-Net-style decoder for direct waveform reconstruction, ensuring perceptually consistent and intelligible speech output. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of AUREXA-SE, achieving significant performance improvements over noisy baselines, with STOI of 0.516, PESQ of 1.323, and SI-SDR of -4.322 dB. The source code of AUREXA-SE is available at https://github.com/mtanveer1/AVSEC-4-Challenge-2025.</description>

      <title>Sci-Phi: A Large Language Model Spatial Audio Descriptor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic scene perception involves describing the type of sounds, their timing, their direction and distance, as well as their loudness and reverberation. While audio language models excel in sound recognition, single-channel input fundamentally limits spatial understanding. This work presents Sci-Phi, a spatial audio large language model with dual spatial and spectral encoders that estimates a complete parameter set for all sound sources and the surrounding environment. Learning from over 4,000 hours of synthetic first-order Ambisonics recordings including metadata, Sci-Phi enumerates and describes up to four directional sound sources in one pass, alongside non-directional background sounds and room characteristics. We evaluate the model with a permutation-invariant protocol and 15 metrics covering content, location, timing, loudness, and reverberation, and analyze its robustness across source counts, signal-to-noise ratios, reverberation levels, and challenging mixtures of acoustically, spatially, or temporally similar sources. Notably, Sci-Phi generalizes to real room impulse responses with only minor performance degradation. Overall, this work establishes the first audio LLM capable of full spatial-scene description, with strong potential for real-world deployment. Demo: https://sci-phi-audio.github.io/demo</description>

      <title>Sparse deepfake detection promotes better disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the rapid progress of speech synthesis, deepfake detection has become a major concern in the speech processing community. Because it is a critical task, systems must not only be efficient and robust, but also provide interpretable explanations. Among the different approaches for explainability, we focus on the interpretation of latent representations. In such paper, we focus on the last layer of embeddings of AASIST, a deepfake detection architecture. We use a TopK activation inspired by SAEs on this layer to obtain sparse representations which are used in the decision process. We demonstrate that sparse deepfake detection can improve detection performance, with an EER of 23.36% on ASVSpoof5 test set, with 95% of sparsity. We then show that these representations provide better disentanglement, using completeness and modularity metrics based on mutual information. Notably, some attacks are directly encoded in the latent space.</description>

      <title>MSF-SER: Enriching Acoustic Modeling with Multi-Granularity Semantics for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous dimensional speech emotion recognition captures affective variation along valence, arousal, and dominance, providing finer-grained representations than categorical approaches. Yet most multimodal methods rely solely on global transcripts, leading to two limitations: (1) all words are treated equally, overlooking that emphasis on different parts of a sentence can shift emotional meaning; (2) only surface lexical content is represented, lacking higher-level interpretive cues. To overcome these issues, we propose MSF-SER (Multi-granularity Semantic Fusion for Speech Emotion Recognition), which augments acoustic features with three complementary levels of textual semantics--Local Emphasized Semantics (LES), Global Semantics (GS), and Extended Semantics (ES). These are integrated via an intra-modal gated fusion and a cross-modal FiLM-modulated lightweight Mixture-of-Experts (FM-MOE). Experiments on MSP-Podcast and IEMOCAP show that MSF-SER consistently improves dimensional prediction, demonstrating the effectiveness of enriched semantic fusion for SER.</description>

      <title>Transcribing Rhythmic Patterns of the Guitar Track in Polyphonic Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whereas chord transcription has received considerable attention during the past couple of decades, far less work has been devoted to transcribing and encoding the rhythmic patterns that occur in a song. The topic is especially relevant for instruments such as the rhythm guitar, which is typically played by strumming rhythmic patterns that repeat and vary over time. However, in many cases one cannot objectively define a single "right" rhythmic pattern for a given song section. To create a dataset with well-defined ground-truth labels, we asked expert musicians to transcribe the rhythmic patterns in 410 popular songs and record cover versions where the guitar tracks followed those transcriptions. To transcribe the strums and their corresponding rhythmic patterns, we propose a three-step framework. Firstly, we perform approximate stem separation to extract the guitar part from the polyphonic mixture. Secondly, we detect individual strums within the separated guitar audio, using a pre-trained foundation model (MERT) as a backbone. Finally, we carry out a pattern-decoding process in which the transcribed sequence of guitar strums is represented by patterns drawn from an expert-curated vocabulary. We show that it is possible to transcribe the rhythmic patterns of the guitar track in polyphonic music with quite high accuracy, producing a representation that is human-readable and includes automatically detected bar lines and time signature markers. We perform ablation studies and error analysis and propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess the accuracy and readability of the predicted rhythmic pattern sequence.</description>

      <title>EMORL-TTS: Reinforcement Learning for Fine-Grained Emotion Control in LLM-based TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent LLM-based TTS systems achieve strong quality and zero-shot ability, but lack fine-grained emotional control due to their reliance on discrete speech tokens. Existing approaches either limit emotions to categorical labels or cannot generalize to LLM-based architectures. We propose EMORL-TTS (Fine-grained Emotion-controllable TTS with Reinforcement Learning), a framework that unifies global intensity control in the VAD space with local emphasis regulation. Our method combines supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning guided by task-specific rewards for emotion category, intensity, and emphasis. Moreover, we further investigate how emphasis placement modulates fine-grained emotion intensity. Experiments show that EMORL-TTS improves emotion accuracy, intensity differentiation, and emphasis clarity, while preserving synthesis quality comparable to strong LLM-based baselines.</description>

      <title>StereoSync: Spatially-Aware Stereo Audio Generation from Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although audio generation has been widely studied over recent years, video-aligned audio generation still remains a relatively unexplored frontier. To address this gap, we introduce StereoSync, a novel and efficient model designed to generate audio that is both temporally synchronized with a reference video and spatially aligned with its visual context. Moreover, StereoSync also achieves efficiency by leveraging pretrained foundation models, reducing the need for extensive training while maintaining high-quality synthesis. Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on temporal synchronization, StereoSync introduces a significant advancement by incorporating spatial awareness into video-aligned audio generation. Indeed, given an input video, our approach extracts spatial cues from depth maps and bounding boxes, using them as cross-attention conditioning in a diffusion-based audio generation model. Such an approach allows StereoSync to go beyond simple synchronization, producing stereo audio that dynamically adapts to the spatial structure and movement of a video scene. We evaluate StereoSync on Walking The Maps, a curated dataset comprising videos from video games that feature animated characters walking through diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of StereoSync to achieve both temporal and spatial alignment, advancing the state of the art in video-to-audio generation and resulting in a significantly more immersive and realistic audio experience.</description>

      <title>FoleyGRAM: Video-to-Audio Generation with GRAM-Aligned Multimodal Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present FoleyGRAM, a novel approach to video-to-audio generation that emphasizes semantic conditioning through the use of aligned multimodal encoders. Building on prior advancements in video-to-audio generation, FoleyGRAM leverages the Gramian Representation Alignment Measure (GRAM) to align embeddings across video, text, and audio modalities, enabling precise semantic control over the audio generation process. The core of FoleyGRAM is a diffusion-based audio synthesis model conditioned on GRAM-aligned embeddings and waveform envelopes, ensuring both semantic richness and temporal alignment with the corresponding input video. We evaluate FoleyGRAM on the Greatest Hits dataset, a standard benchmark for video-to-audio models. Our experiments demonstrate that aligning multimodal encoders using GRAM enhances the system's ability to semantically align generated audio with video content, advancing the state of the art in video-to-audio synthesis.</description>

      <title>LARA-Gen: Enabling Continuous Emotion Control for Music Generation Models via Latent Affective Representation Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music models have enabled coherent music generation from text prompts, yet fine-grained emotional control remains unresolved. We introduce LARA-Gen, a framework for continuous emotion control that aligns the internal hidden states with an external music understanding model through Latent Affective Representation Alignment (LARA), enabling effective training. In addition, we design an emotion control module based on a continuous valence-arousal space, disentangling emotional attributes from textual content and bypassing the bottlenecks of text-based prompting. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark with a curated test set and a robust Emotion Predictor, facilitating objective evaluation of emotional controllability in music generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LARA-Gen achieves continuous, fine-grained control of emotion and significantly outperforms baselines in both emotion adherence and music quality. Generated samples are available at https://nieeim.github.io/LARA-Gen/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the Segmented Full-Song Model (SFS) for symbolic full-song generation. The model accepts a user-provided song structure and an optional short seed segment that anchors the main idea around which the song is developed. By factorizing a song into segments and generating each one through selective attention to related segments, the model achieves higher quality and efficiency compared to prior work. To demonstrate its suitability for human-AI interaction, we further wrap SFS into a web application that enables users to iteratively co-create music on a piano roll with customizable structures and flexible ordering.</description>

      <title>ECTSpeech: Enhancing Efficient Speech Synthesis via Easy Consistency Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in speech synthesis, but typically require multi-step sampling, resulting in low inference efficiency. Recent studies address this issue by distilling diffusion models into consistency models, enabling efficient one-step generation. However, these approaches introduce additional training costs and rely heavily on the performance of pre-trained teacher models. In this paper, we propose ECTSpeech, a simple and effective one-step speech synthesis framework that, for the first time, incorporates the Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT) strategy into speech synthesis. By progressively tightening consistency constraints on a pre-trained diffusion model, ECTSpeech achieves high-quality one-step generation while significantly reducing training complexity. In addition, we design a multi-scale gate module (MSGate) to enhance the denoiser's ability to fuse features at different scales. Experimental results on the LJSpeech dataset demonstrate that ECTSpeech achieves audio quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods under single-step sampling, while substantially reducing the model's training cost and complexity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) is pivotal for enhancing human-machine interactions. This paper introduces "EmoHRNet", a novel adaptation of High-Resolution Networks (HRNet) tailored for SER. The HRNet structure is designed to maintain high-resolution representations from the initial to the final layers. By transforming audio samples into spectrograms, EmoHRNet leverages the HRNet architecture to extract high-level features. EmoHRNet's unique architecture maintains high-resolution representations throughout, capturing both granular and overarching emotional cues from speech signals. The model outperforms leading models, achieving accuracies of 92.45% on RAVDESS, 80.06% on IEMOCAP, and 92.77% on EMOVO. Thus, we show that EmoHRNet sets a new benchmark in the SER domain.</description>

      <title>Modulation Discovery with Differentiable Digital Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulations are a critical part of sound design and music production, enabling the creation of complex and evolving audio. Modern synthesizers provide envelopes, low frequency oscillators (LFOs), and more parameter automation tools that allow users to modulate the output with ease. However, determining the modulation signals used to create a sound is difficult, and existing sound-matching / parameter estimation systems are often uninterpretable black boxes or predict high-dimensional framewise parameter values without considering the shape, structure, and routing of the underlying modulation curves. We propose a neural sound-matching approach that leverages modulation extraction, constrained control signal parameterizations, and differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) to discover the modulations present in a sound. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on highly modulated synthetic and real audio samples, its applicability to different DDSP synth architectures, and investigate the trade-off it incurs between interpretability and sound-matching accuracy. We make our code and audio samples available and provide the trained DDSP synths in a VST plugin.</description>

Abstract: Aligning text-to-speech (TTS) system outputs with human feedback through preference optimization has been shown to effectively improve the robustness and naturalness of language model-based TTS models. Current approaches primarily require paired desirable and undesirable samples at the utterance level. However, such pairs are often limited in TTS output data, and utterance-level formulation prevents fine-grained token-level optimization needed for accurate pronunciation alignment. In this study, we propose TKTO that eliminates the need for paired data, enabling a more data-efficient training paradigm, and directly targets token-level units, automatically providing fine-grained alignment signals without token-level annotations. TKTO improves the challenging Japanese TTS accuracy by 39% and reduces CER by 54%, automatically assigning 12.8 times stronger reward to targeted tokens.</description>

      <title>TokenChain: A Discrete Speech Chain via Semantic Token Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Speech Chain, simulating the human perception-production loop, proves effective in jointly improving ASR and TTS. We propose TokenChain, a fully discrete speech chain coupling semantic-token ASR with a two-stage TTS: an autoregressive text-to-semantic model co-trained with ASR and a masked-generative semantic-to-acoustic model for synthesis only. End-to-end feedback across the text interface is enabled with straight-through argmax/Gumbel-Softmax and balanced with supervised ASR via dynamic weight averaging. Ablations examine optimal temperature schedules for in- and cross-domain transfer. Evaluation reveals TokenChain surpasses baseline accuracy 2-6 epochs earlier and yields 5-13% lower equal-epoch error with stable T2S on LibriSpeech, and reduces relative ASR WER by 56% and T2S WER by 31% on TED-LIUM with minimal forgetting, showing that chain learning remains effective with token interfaces and models.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Incorporating Mamba for Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims to investigate the use of a recently proposed, attention-free, scalable state-space model (SSM), Mamba, for the speech enhancement (SE) task. In particular, we employ Mamba to deploy different regression-based SE models (SEMamba) with different configurations, namely basic, advanced, causal, and non-causal. Furthermore, loss functions either based on signal-level distances or metric-oriented are considered. Experimental evidence shows that SEMamba attains a competitive PESQ of 3.55 on the VoiceBank-DEMAND dataset with the advanced, non-causal configuration. A new state-of-the-art PESQ of 3.69 is also reported when SEMamba is combined with Perceptual Contrast Stretching (PCS). Compared against Transformed-based equivalent SE solutions, a noticeable FLOPs reduction up to ~12% is observed with the advanced non-causal configurations. Finally, SEMamba can be used as a pre-processing step before automatic speech recognition (ASR), showing competitive performance against recent SE solutions.</description>

      <title>Combining Deterministic Enhanced Conditions with Dual-Streaming Encoding for Diffusion-Based Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion-based speech enhancement (SE) models need to incorporate correct prior knowledge as reliable conditions to generate accurate predictions. However, providing reliable conditions using noisy features is challenging. One solution is to use features enhanced by deterministic methods as conditions. However, the information distortion and loss caused by deterministic methods might affect the diffusion process. In this paper, we first investigate the effects of using different deterministic SE models as conditions for diffusion. We validate two conditions depending on whether the noisy feature was used as part of the condition: one using only the deterministic feature (deterministic-only), and the other using both deterministic and noisy features (deterministic-noisy). Preliminary investigation found that using deterministic enhanced conditions improves hearing experiences on real data, while the choice between using deterministic-only or deterministic-noisy conditions depends on the deterministic models. Based on these findings, we propose a dual-streaming encoding Repair-Diffusion Model for SE (DERDM-SE) to more effectively utilize both conditions. Moreover, we found that fine-grained deterministic models have greater potential in objective evaluation metrics, while UNet-based deterministic models provide more stable diffusion performance. Therefore, in the DERDM-SE, we propose a deterministic model that combines coarse- and fine-grained processing. Experimental results on CHiME4 show that the proposed models effectively leverage deterministic models to achieve better SE evaluation scores, along with more stable performance compared to other diffusion-based SE models.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Training Data Attribution for Music Generative Models via Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of unlearning methods for training data attribution (TDA) in music generative models trained on large-scale datasets. TDA aims to identify which specific training data points contributed the most to the generation of a particular output from a specific model. This is crucial in the context of AI-generated music, where proper recognition and credit for original artists are generally overlooked. By enabling white-box attribution, our work supports a fairer system for acknowledging artistic contributions and addresses pressing concerns related to AI ethics and copyright. We apply unlearning-based attribution to a text-to-music diffusion model trained on a large-scale dataset and investigate its feasibility and behavior in this setting. To validate the method, we perform a grid search over different hyperparameter configurations and quantitatively evaluate the consistency of the unlearning approach. We then compare attribution patterns from unlearning with non-counterfactual approaches. Our findings suggest that unlearning-based approaches can be effectively adapted to music generative models, introducing large-scale TDA to this domain and paving the way for more ethical and accountable AI systems for music creation.</description>

      <title>Scattering Transformer: A Training-Free Transformer Architecture for Heart Murmur Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an attempt to address the need for skilled clinicians in heart sound interpretation, recent research efforts on automating cardiac auscultation have explored deep learning approaches. The majority of these approaches have been based on supervised learning that is always challenged in occasions where training data is limited. More recently, there has been a growing interest in potentials of pre-trained self-supervised audio foundation models for biomedical end tasks. Despite exhibiting promising results, these foundational models are typically computationally intensive. Within the context of automatic cardiac auscultation, this study explores a lightweight alternative to these general-purpose audio foundation models by introducing the Scattering Transformer, a novel, training-free transformer architecture for heart murmur detection. The proposed method leverages standard wavelet scattering networks by introducing contextual dependencies in a transformer-like architecture without any backpropagation. We evaluate our approach on the public CirCor DigiScope dataset, directly comparing it against leading general-purpose foundational models. The Scattering Transformer achieves a Weighted Accuracy(WAR) of 0.786 and an Unweighted Average Recall(UAR) of 0.697, demonstrating performance highly competitive with contemporary state of the art methods. This study establishes the Scattering Transformer as a viable and promising alternative in resource-constrained setups.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Audio Forensics Evaluation (SAFE) Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic speech generated by advanced text-to-speech (TTS) models, coupled with post-processing and laundering techniques, presents a significant challenge for audio forensic detection. In this paper, we introduce the SAFE (Synthetic Audio Forensics Evaluation) Challenge, a fully blind evaluation framework designed to benchmark detection models across progressively harder scenarios: raw synthetic speech, processed audio (e.g., compression, resampling), and laundered audio intended to evade forensic analysis. The SAFE challenge consisted of a total of 90 hours of audio and 21,000 audio samples split across 21 different real sources and 17 different TTS models and 3 tasks. We present the challenge, evaluation design and tasks, dataset details, and initial insights into the strengths and limitations of current approaches, offering a foundation for advancing synthetic audio detection research.

      <title>Step-by-Step Video-to-Audio Synthesis via Negative Audio Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a step-by-step video-to-audio (V2A) generation method for finer controllability over the generation process and more realistic audio synthesis. Inspired by traditional Foley workflows, our approach aims to comprehensively capture all sound events induced by a video through the incremental generation of missing sound events. To avoid the need for costly multi-reference video-audio datasets, each generation step is formulated as a negatively guided V2A process that discourages duplication of existing sounds. The guidance model is trained by finetuning a pre-trained V2A model on audio pairs from adjacent segments of the same video, allowing training with standard single-reference audiovisual datasets that are easily accessible. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our method enhances the separability of generated sounds at each step and improves the overall quality of the final composite audio, outperforming existing baselines.</description>

      <title>CL-UZH submission to the NIST SRE 2024 Speaker Recognition Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CL-UZH team submitted one system each for the fixed and open conditions of the NIST SRE 2024 challenge. For the closed-set condition, results for the audio-only trials were achieved using the X-vector system developed with Kaldi. For the audio-visual results we used only models developed for the visual modality. Two sets of results were submitted for the open-set and closed-set conditions, one based on a pretrained model using the VoxBlink2 and VoxCeleb2 datasets. An Xvector-based model was trained from scratch using the CTS superset dataset for the closed set. In addition to the submission of the results of the SRE24 evaluation to the competition website, we talked about the performance of the proposed systems on the SRE24 evaluation in this report.</description>
