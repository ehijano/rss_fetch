      <title>On a Restriction Problem of Hickman and Wright for the Parabola in $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ for Squarefree $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hickman and Wright proved an $L^2$ restriction estimate for the parabola $\Sigma$ in $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ of the form
  $$\left(\frac{1}{|\Sigma|}\sum\limits_{m\in\Sigma}|\widehat{f}(m)|^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\leq C_\epsilon N^\epsilon\cdot N^{-1}\left(\sum\limits_{x\in (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2}|f(x)|^\frac{6}{5}\right)^\frac{5}{6}$$
  for all functions $f:(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ and any $\epsilon&gt;0$, and that this bound is sharp when $N$ has a large square factor, and especially for $N = p^2$ for $p$ a prime. In contrast, Mockenhaupt and Tao proved in the special case $N = p$ the stronger estimate
  $$\left(\frac{1}{|\Sigma|}\sum\limits_{m\in\Sigma}|\widehat{f}(m)|^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\leq C N^{-1}\left(\sum\limits_{x\in (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2}|f(x)|^\frac{4}{3}\right)^\frac{3}{4}.$$
  We extend the Mockenhaupt-Tao bound to the case of squarefree $N$, proving
  $$\left(\frac{1}{|\Sigma|}\sum\limits_{m\in\Sigma}|\widehat{f}(m)|^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\leq C_\epsilon N^\epsilon\cdot N^{-1}\left(\sum\limits_{x\in (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2}|f(x)|^\frac{4}{3}\right)^\frac{3}{4},$$
  and discuss applications of this result to uncertainty principles and signal recovery.</description>

      <title>Approximation and orthogonality on fully symmetric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study orthogonal polynomials on a fully symmetric planar domain $\Omega$ that is generated by a certain triangle in the first quadrant. For a family of weight functions on $\Omega$, we show that orthogonal polynomials that are even in the second variable on $\Omega$ can be identified with orthogonal polynomials on the unit disk composed with a quadratic map, and the same phenomenon can be extended to the domain generated by the rotation of $\Omega$ in higher dimensions. The connection allows an immediate deduction of results for approximation and Fourier orthogonal expansions on these fully symmetric domains. It applies, for example, to analysis on a double cone or a double hyperboloid.</description>

      <title>Index theory for non-compact quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an index theory for variational problems on noncompact quantum graphs. The main results are a spectral flow formula, relating the net change of eigenvalues to the Maslov index of boundary data, and a Morse index theorem, equating the negative directions of the Lagrangian action with the total multiplicity of conjugate instants along the edges.
  These results extend classical tools in global analysis and symplectic geometry to graph based models, with applications to nonlinear wave equations such as the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. The spectral flow formula is proved by constructing a Lagrangian intersection theory in the Gelfand-Robbin quotients of the second variation of the action. This approach also recovers, in a unified way, the known formulas for heteroclinic, halfclinic, homoclinic, and bounded orbits of (non)autonomous Lagrangian systems.</description>

      <title>Even Cone Spherical Metrics: Blow-Up at a Cone Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study families of spherical metrics on the flat torus $E_{\tau}$ $=$ $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda_{\tau}$ with blow-up behavior at prescribed conical singularities at $0$ and $\pm p$, where the cone angle at $0$ is $6\pi$, and at $\pm p$ is $4\pi$. We prove that the existence of such a necessarily unique, even family of spherical metrics is completely determined by the geometry of the torus: such a family exists if and only if\textbf{ }the Green function $G(z;\tau)$ admits a pair of nontrivial critical points $\pm a$. In this case, the cone point $p$ must equal $a$, and the corresponding monodromy data is $\left( 2r,2s\right) $, where $a=r+s\tau.$
  An explicit transformation relating this family to the one with a single conical singularity of angle $6\pi$ at the origin is established in Theorem 1.4. A rigidity result for rhombic tori is proved in Theorem 1.5.</description>

      <title>Perfectly transparent boundary conditions and wave propagation in lattice Boltzmann schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems of N = 1, 2, . . . first-order hyperbolic conservation laws feature N undamped waves propagating at finite speeds. On their own hand, multi-step Finite Difference and lattice Boltzmann schemes with q = N + 1, N + 2, . . . unknowns involve N ''physical'' waves, which are aimed at being as closely-looking as possible to the ones of the PDEs, and q-N ''numerical-spurious-parasitic'' waves, which are subject to their own speed of propagation, and either damped or undamped. The whole picture is even more complicated in the discrete setting-as numerical schemes act as dispersive media, thus propagate different harmonics at different phase (and group) velocities. For compelling practical reasons, simulations must always be conducted on bounded domains, even when the target problem is unbounded in space. The importance of transparent boundary conditions, preventing artificial boundaries from acting as mirrors producing polluting ricochets, naturally follows. This work presents, building on Besse, Coulombel, and Noble [ESAIM: M2AN, 55 (2021)], a systematic way of developing perfectly transparent boundary conditions for lattice Boltzmann schemes tackling linear problems in one and two space dimensions. Our boundary conditions are ''perfectly'' transparent, at least for 1D problems, as they absorb both physical and spurious waves regardless of their frequency. After presenting, in a simple framework, several approaches to handle the fact that q &gt; N , we elect the so-called ''scalar'' approach (which despite its name, also works when N &gt; 1) as method of choice for more involved problems. This method solely relies on computing the coefficients of the Laurent series at infinity of the roots of the dispersion relation of the bulk scheme. We insist on asymptotics for these coefficients in the spirit of analytic combinatorics. The reason is two-fold: asymptotics guide truncation of boundary conditions to make them depending on a fixed number of past time-steps, and make it clearduring the process of computing coefficients-whether intermediate quantities can be safely stored using floating-point arithmetic or not. Numerous numerical investigations in 1D and 2D with N = 1 and 2 are carried out, and show the effectiveness of the proposed boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Global Hopf bifurcation and connected components in a delayed predator-prey model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a delayed predator-prey system with Holling type II functional response, focusing on the interplay between time delay and carrying capacity. Using local and global Hopf bifurcation theory, we establish the existence of sequences of bifurcations as the delay parameter varies, and prove that the connected components of global Hopf branches are nested under suitable conditions. A novel contribution is to show that the classical limit cycle of the non-delayed system belongs to a connected component of the global Hopf bifurcation in Fuller's space. Our analysis combines rigorous functional differential equation theory with continuation methods to characterize the structure and boundedness of bifurcation branches. We further demonstrate that delays can induce oscillatory coexistence at lower carrying capacities than in the corresponding ODE model, yielding counterintuitive biological insights. The results contribute to the broader theory of global bifurcations in delay differential equations while providing new perspectives on nonlinear population dynamics.</description>

      <title>The reverse H\"older inequality for $\mathcal{A}_{p(\cdot)}$ weights with applications to matrix weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a reverse H\"{o}lder inequality for the variable exponent Muckenhoupt weights $\mathcal{A}_{p(\cdot)}$, introduced by the first author, Fiorenza, and Neugeabauer. All of our estimates are quantitative, showing the dependence of the exponent function on the $\mathcal{A}_{p(\cdot)}$ characteristic. As an application, we use the reverse H\"{o}lder inequality to prove that the matrix $\mathcal{A}_{p(\cdot)}$ weights, introduced in our previous paper, have both a right and left-openness property. This result is new even in the scalar case.</description>

      <title>Descriptions of Cantor Sets: A Set-Theoretic Survey and Open Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This survey synthesizes the principal descriptive set-theoretic perspectives on deterministic Cantor sets on the real line and charts directions for future study. After recounting their historical genesis and compiling an up-to-date taxonomy, we review the Borel hierarchy and four hierarchically ordered representations-general, nested, iterated-function-system (IFS), and q-ary expansion-presented from the most general to the most specific set-theoretic description of deterministic Cantor sets. We then present explicit and recursive descriptions for two thin families of measure-zero Cantor sets and an augmented "tick" family of positive measure, respectively, showing that the classical middle-third set lies in the intersection of all three families of after-mentioned Cantor sets. The survey closes by isolating several open problems in four directions, aiming to provide mathematicians with a coherent platform for further descriptive set-theoretic investigations into Cantor-type sets on the real line.</description>

      <title>Bounds for spectral projectors on the three-dimensional torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $L^2$ to $L^p$ operator norms of spectral projectors for the Euclidean Laplacian on the torus in the case where the spectral window is narrow. With a window of constant size this is a classical result of Sogge; in the small-window limit we are left with $L^p$ norms of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, as considered for instance by Bourgain. For the three-dimensional torus we prove new cases of a previous conjecture of the first two authors concerning the size of these norms; we also refine certain prior results to remove $\epsilon$-losses in all dimensions. We use methods from number theory: the geometry of numbers, the circle method and exponential sum bounds due to Guo. We complement these techniques with height splitting and a bilinear argument to prove sharp results.
  We exposit on the various techniques used and their limitations.</description>
