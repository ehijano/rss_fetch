      <title>Pinched Multi Affine Geometry and Confinement: Describing the Yang-Mills Mass Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a multi affine geometric framework in which spacetime curvature relaxes non-instantaneously, subject to a fundamental Planck-scale limit on volumetric contraction. This pinched geometry is shown to localize high-energy distributions, leading to effective constraints on curvature that manifest as a discrete energy gap. Our analysis explores how this limiting curvature dispersion rate not only yields an intuitive explanation of the Yang-Mills mass gap by enforcing a finite tension between non-Abelian color sources. In parallel, we connect these results to an information-geometric viewpoint, demonstrating how the Fisher-Rao curvature quantifies localization pinning in both classical and quantum settings. The resulting picture suggests that quantized excitations and confinement emerge naturally once one accounts for a maximum relaxation speed of curved manifolds. We conclude by outlining how these ideas could be tested through lattice gauge theory comparisons and by examining low-energy glueball spectra, shedding light on a potential geometric unification of gravitational and quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Fractionally charged Weyl spinors as the bases for elementary particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new model of elementary particles with a substructure that the Gell-Mann-Nishijima formula seems to suggest. This set of fractionally-charged Weyl spinors produces all the known elementary fermions out of their conjugate pairs and the elementary bosons as their composites. The model naturally yields the left-handedness of neutrinos, three generations of fermions, SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) symmetry as its low energy approximation, and a new type of massive neutral particles that could be a dark matter candidate. In this model, the strong and the electromagnetic interactions are integrated at the fundamental level, while the weak interaction works as the next-level mechanism responsible for changing flavors.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing due to charged galactic wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the back reaction to the charged galactic wormhole spacetime based on Yoshiaki Sofue's exponential dark matter density profile to find exact solutions. The charges act as an additional component to the static wormhole, which is primarily formed by the galactic dark matter density. Unlike traditional mass-based models, this solution incorporates charge effects within a realistic dark matter distribution, revealing unique interactions between dark matter, electromagnetic fields, and spacetime curvature. This study confirms the criteria for wormhole formation, designating it the "Charged Galactic Wormhole," and offers a new framework for investigating galactic structures, with potential observational signatures that deepen our understanding of dark matter and spacetime. Later, the proper radial distance and the embedding surface were also analyzed. Furthermore, the deflection of light around a charged galactic wormhole was investigated, along with a comprehensive review of the resulting image. The deflection of massive objects (charge less) near charged galactic wormholes is studied using the Gauss-Bonnet and Rindler-Ishak methods, with a detailed comparison of the results from both approaches. Additionally, in both the Rindler-Ishak (RI) and Gauss-Bonnet (GB) methods, when v tends to 1 i.e. when particle's velocity comparable to the speed of light , the results from these approaches converge, producing the same outcome as strong gravitational lensing.</description>

      <title>A general theory of the standard model and the revelation of the dark side of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general theory of the Standard Model (GSM) is presented in a spin-related gravigauge spacetime, grounded on conformal inhomogeneous spin gauge symmetry WS$_c$(1,3)=SP(1,3)$\rtimes$W$^{1,3}$$\rtimes$SP$_c$(1,1) and scaling gauge symmetry SG(1), along with symmetry U$_Y$(1)$\times$SU$_L$(2)$\times$SU(3)$_c$ in the standard model. It introduces new interactions: spin, chirality boost-spin, chiral conformal-spin, and scaling gauge forces. A gravitization equation is obtained to describe the gravitational effects emerging from the non-commutative derivative operator in gravigauge spacetime. In the framework of gravitational quantum field theory(GQFT), the gravitational force is mediated by the gravigauge field, identified as the massless graviton. Both gauge-type and geometric-type gravitational equations are derived to describe gravidynamics beyond general relativity. A massive chirality boost-spin gauge boson, termed the dark graviton, acts as a dark matter candidate, interacting with leptons and quarks via a spin gauge boson. A fundamental scalar field serves as a source of primordial energy and dark energy, driving the early inflation and current accelerated expansion of the universe.</description>
