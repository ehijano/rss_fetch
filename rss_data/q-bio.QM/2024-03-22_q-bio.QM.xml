      <title>Control of Medical Digital Twins with Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of personalized medicine is to tailor interventions to an individual patient's unique characteristics. A key technology for this purpose involves medical digital twins, computational models of human biology that can be personalized and dynamically updated to incorporate patient-specific data collected over time. Certain aspects of human biology, such as the immune system, are not easily captured with physics-based models, such as differential equations. Instead, they are often multi-scale, stochastic, and hybrid. This poses a challenge to existing model-based control and optimization approaches that cannot be readily applied to such models. Recent advances in automatic differentiation and neural-network control methods hold promise in addressing complex control problems. However, the application of these approaches to biomedical systems is still in its early stages. This work introduces dynamics-informed neural-network controllers as an alternative approach to control of medical digital twins. As a first use case for this method, the focus is on agent-based models, a versatile and increasingly common modeling platform in biomedicine. The effectiveness of the proposed neural-network control method is illustrated and benchmarked against other methods with two widely-used agent-based model types. The relevance of the method introduced here extends beyond medical digital twins to other complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>covSTATIS: a multi-table technique for network neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similarity analyses between multiple correlation or covariance tables constitute the cornerstone of network neuroscience. Here, we introduce covSTATIS, a versatile, linear, unsupervised multi-table method designed to identify structured patterns in multi-table data, and allow for the simultaneous extraction and interpretation of both individual and group-level features. With covSTATIS, multiple similarity tables can now be easily integrated, without requiring a priori data simplification, complex black-box implementations, user-dependent specifications, or supervised frameworks. Applications of covSTATIS and source code are provided. covSTATIS offers a promising avenue for advancing the theoretical and analytic landscape of network neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Predicting the electroporated tissue area trajectory in Electroporation-based protocol optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroporation (EP), the temporary or permanent permeabilization of the cell membrane induced by an electric field, is the basis of various applications in medicine and food processing. In EP-based protocol optimization in terms of pulse number, such as in electrochemotherapy (ECT), irreversible electroporation (IRE), and gene electrotransfer (GET), it is essential to reach an optimal dose-response, that is, the pulse dose that maximizes the electroporated tissue area while minimizing damage. Predicting the electroporated tissue area variation in time, i.e., its trajectory, requires measuring the EP threshold trajectory and understanding the interaction between both trajectories and the damaged tissue area trajectory. Here we introduce a new methodology, based on the analysis of the nonlinear dynamic interaction of the EP threshold and damaged tissue area trajectories, that shows that the EP threshold trajectory is the time gradient of the electric field. This allows predicting the electroporated area trajectory with a single electroporated area measurement at the last pulse, thus avoiding the need to measure the EP threshold trajectory, a rather cumbersome task. Also, it makes it possible to explain at the macroscopic level why the EP threshold trajectory has an approximate exponential time decrease while the EP threshold isoline trajectory, aka the electroporated tissue area trajectory, has an approximate logarithmic time increase. Further, it permits predicting an optimal dose response in terms of pulse number in an EP-based protocol, with a single electroporated tissue area measurement. Examples of its application to an in vitro vegetal model, and to an in vivo skinfold chamber shed new light on the nonlinear dynamic behavior of electroporated tissue area, EP threshold, and damaged tissue area trajectories, paving the way for optimal treatment planning in EP-based protocols.</description>

      <title>An Agnostic Biosignature Based on Modeling Panspermia and Terraformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental goal of astrobiology is to detect life outside of Earth. This proves to be an exceptional challenge outside of our solar system, where strong assumptions must be made about how life would manifest and interact with its planet. Such assumptions are required because of the lack of a consensus theory of living systems, or an understanding of the possible extent of planetary dynamics. Here we explore a model of life spreading between planetary systems via panspermia and terraformation. Our model shows that as life propagates across the galaxy, correlations emerge between planetary characteristics and location, and can function as a population-scale agnostic biosignature. This biosignature is agnostic because it is independent of strong assumptions about any particular instantiation of life or planetary characteristic--by focusing on a specific hypothesis of what life may do, rather than what life may be. By clustering planets based on their observed characteristics, and examining the spatial extent of these clusters, we demonstrate (and evaluate) a way to prioritize specific planets for further observation--based on their potential for containing life. We consider obstacles that must be overcome to practically implement our approach, including identifying specific ways in which better understanding astrophysical and planetary processes would improve our ability to detect life. Finally, we consider how this model leads us to think in novel ways about hierarchies of life and planetary scale replication.</description>

      <title>Two fitness inference schemes compared using allele frequencies from 1,068,391 sequences sampled in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14202</link>

Abstract: Throughout the course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, genetic variation has contributed to the spread and persistence of the virus. For example, various mutations have allowed SARS-CoV-2 to escape antibody neutralization or to bind more strongly to the receptors that it uses to enter human cells. Here, we compared two methods that estimate the fitness effects of viral mutations using the abundant sequence data gathered over the course of the pandemic. Both approaches are grounded in population genetics theory but with different assumptions. One approach, tQLE, features an epistatic fitness landscape and assumes that alleles are nearly in linkage equilibrium. Another approach, MPL, assumes a simple, additive fitness landscape, but allows for any level of correlation between alleles. We characterized differences in the distributions of fitness values inferred by each approach and in the ranks of fitness values that they assign to sequences across time. We find that in a large fraction of weeks the two methods are in good agreement as to their top-ranked sequences, i.e., as to which sequences observed that week are most fit. We also find that agreement between ranking of sequences varies with genetic unimodality in the population in a given week.</description>

      <title>Phenology curve estimation via a mixed model representation of functional principal components: Characterizing time series of satellite-derived vegetation indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vegetation phenology consists of studying synchronous stationary events, such as the vegetation green up and leaves senescence, that can be construed as adaptive responses to climatic constraints. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the annual phenology curve from multi-annual observations of time series of vegetation indices derived from satellite images. We fitted the classical harmonic regression model to annual-based time series in order to construe the original data set as realizations of a functional process. Hierarchical clustering was applied to define a nearly homogeneous group of annual (smoothed) time series from which a representative and idealized phenology curve was estimated at the pixel level. This curve resulted from fitting a mixed model, based on functional principal components, to the homogeneous group of time series. Leveraging the idealized phenology curve, we employed standard calculus criteria to estimate the following phenological parameters (stationary events): green up, start of season, maturity, senescence, end of season and dormancy. By applying the proposed methodology to four different data cubes (time series from 2000 to 2023 of a popular satellite-derived vegetation index) recorded across grasslands, forests, and annual rainfed agricultural zones of a Flora and Fauna Protected Area in northern Mexico, we verified that our approach characterizes properly the phenological cycle in vegetation with nearly periodic dynamics, such as grasslands and agricultural areas. The R package sephora was used for all computations in this paper.</description>

      <title>Towards AI-Based Precision Oncology: A Machine Learning Framework for Personalized Counterfactual Treatment Suggestions based on Multi-Omics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-driven precision oncology has the transformative potential to reshape cancer treatment by leveraging the power of AI models to analyze the interaction between complex patient characteristics and their corresponding treatment outcomes. New technological platforms have facilitated the timely acquisition of multimodal data on tumor biology at an unprecedented resolution, such as single-cell multi-omics data, making this quality and quantity of data available for data-driven improved clinical decision-making. In this work, we propose a modular machine learning framework designed for personalized counterfactual cancer treatment suggestions based on an ensemble of machine learning experts trained on diverse multi-omics technologies. These specialized counterfactual experts per technology are consistently aggregated into a more powerful expert with superior performance and can provide both confidence and an explanation of its decision. The framework is tailored to address critical challenges inherent in data-driven cancer research, including the high-dimensional nature of the data, and the presence of treatment assignment bias in the retrospective observational data. The framework is showcased through comprehensive demonstrations using data from in-vitro and in-vivo treatment responses from a cohort of patients with ovarian cancer. Our method aims to empower clinicians with a reality-centric decision-support tool including probabilistic treatment suggestions with calibrated confidence and personalized explanations for tailoring treatment strategies to multi-omics characteristics of individual cancer patients.</description>
