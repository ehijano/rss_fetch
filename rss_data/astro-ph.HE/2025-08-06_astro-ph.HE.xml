      <title>Measuring the Astrophysical $\bar{\nu}:\nu$ Ratio with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of astrophysical neutrinos have expanded our understanding of their nature and origin. However, very little is still known about the astrophysical $\bar{\nu}:\nu$
  ratio. The only prior measurement is the recent, single Glashow event seen by IceCube. Understanding the astrophysical $\bar{\nu}:\nu$
  ratio has a bearing on multiple questions, including the astrophysical spectral shape and neutrino production mechanisms. This analysis uses a new approach to measuring the astrophysical muon $\bar{\nu}:\nu$ ratio at various energies. It uses inelasticity, the fraction of the initial neutrino energy carried away by the hadronic shower. Inelasticity probes the $\bar{\nu}:\nu$
  ratio due to the fact that at energies below roughly 100 TeV, valence quarks dominate in deep inelastic scattering interactions, leading to different neutrino and antineutrino inelasticities and cross-sections. We use 10.3 years of IceCube data consisting of starting tracks at energies between 1 TeV and 1 PeV with a self-veto selection that enhances astrophysical event purity in the down-going direction. Based on this sample and analysis method, we present the first measurement of the astrophysical $\bar{\nu}:\nu$
  ratio at sub-PeV energies.</description>

      <title>The X-ray Variability and Luminosity Function of High Mass X-ray Binaries in the Dwarf Starburst Galaxy IC 10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of $\sim$235 ks of Chandra observations obtained over $\sim$19 years of the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy IC 10 in order to study the X-ray variability and X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of its X-ray binary (XRB) population. We identify 23 likely XRBs within the 2MASS $K_S$ isophotal radius and find the distributions of their dynamic ranges and duty cycles are consistent with a young, high-mass XRB population dominated by supergiant (sg)-fed systems, consistent with previous work. In general, we find that brighter HMXBs (those with $L_X\gtrsim$several$\times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$) have higher duty cycles (i.e., are more persistent X-ray sources) than fainter objects, and the dynamic ranges of the sgHMXBs in the lower metallicity environment of IC 10 are higher than what is observed for comparable systems in the Milky Way. After filtering out foreground stars on the basis of Gaia parallaxes we construct, for the first time, the XLF of IC 10. We then use the XLF to model the star formation history of the galaxy, finding that a very recent (3-8 Myr) burst of star formation with rate of $\sim$0.5 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ is needed to adequately explain the observed bright-end ($L_X\sim10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$) of the HMXB XLF.</description>

      <title>Bounding anisotropic Lorentz Invariance Violation from measurements of the effective energy scale of quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of energy-dependent photon time delays from distant flaring sources provide significant constraints on Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV). Such effects originate from modified vacuum dispersion relations, causing differences in propagation times for photons emitted simultaneously from gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei, or pulsars. These modifications are often parametrized within a general framework by an effective quantum gravity energy scale $E_{QG,n}$. While such general constraints are well established in the LIV literature, their translation into specific coefficients of alternative theoretical frameworks, such as the Standard-Model Extension (SME), is rarely carried out. In particular, existing bounds on the quadratic case ($n=2$) of $E_{QG,n}$ can be systematically converted into constraints on the non-birefringent, CPT-conserving SME coefficients $c^{(6)}_{(I)jm}$. This work provides a concise overview of the relevant SME formalism and introduces a transparent conversion method from $E_{QG,2}$ to SME parameters. We review the most stringent time-of-flight-based bounds on $E_{QG,n}$ and standardize them by accounting for systematics, applying missing prefactors, and transforming results into two-sided Gaussian uncertainties where needed. We then use these standardized constraints, along with additional bounds from the literature, to improve bounds on the individual SME coefficients of the photon sector by about an order of magnitude. A consistent methodology is developed to perform this conversion from the general LIV framework to the SME formalism.</description>

      <title>Influence of Density Distribution on Synchrotron Polarization Dispersion in Magnetized Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faraday rotation measure synthesis is a well-known approach originated in Burn (1966) and later developed by Sokoloff et al. (1998) and Brentjens \&amp; de Bruyn (2005) for studying magnetic fields. This work presents a complementary approach--the polarization frequency analysis (PFA)--allowing the properties of the turbulent magnetic field, which are difficult for Burn's original approach. Based on synthetic polarization observation of MHD turbulence simulation data, we study the influence of the coupling effect between density and magnetic field on synchrotron polarization dispersion. By applying the PFA to different simulated interstellar turbulence environments, we find that the PFA technique can reveal the scaling slope of the turbulent magnetic field in the case of a weak coupling effect and can also reflect the scaling slope of the rotation measure in the case of a strong coupling effect. Since avoiding the influence of Faraday depolarization, the PFA technique is a promising way to uncover turbulence properties using observational data from the Low-Frequency Array for Radio Astronomy and the Square Kilometer Array.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Jet Width Profile of CTA 102 with Very Long Baseline Interferometry at Parsec Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nucleus jets have long be thought to exhibit a conical jet shape, but recently, several jets were found to have a transition from parabolic to conical structure. As more sources are investigated, this collimation profile appears to represent a common paradigm. Previous works suggest that the Bondi radius may serve as an indicator of the transition location, although discrepancies have been observed in some sources. To explore this further, we selected CTA 102 for which existing literature presents mixed evidence regarding the presence of a jet geometry break. We investigated the jet width profile of CTA 102 to study the possible transition changes in the jet, thereby improving the understanding of connection between Bondi radius and jet transition. We used multi-frequency VLBA images of CTA 102 at 2, 5, and 8 (single epoch), and 15, 22 and 43 GHz (stacked). The jet width profile was modeled with a single power law $W_{jet}\propto r^{\epsilon}$ yielding a power-law index of $\epsilon=0.69\pm0.02$, indicative of a quasi-parabolic geometry with no clear transition to a conical regime. The absence of discernible structural break around the Bondi radius implies that the physical conditions associated with the radius alone are insufficient to explain the jet collimation behaviour. On the other hand, we observe oscillatory features in the jet width profile, suggesting the influence of additional physical processes beyond gravitational confinement. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of jet collimation in AGN and highlight the complexity of jet-environment interactions.</description>

      <title>The compact object and innermost ejecta of SN 1987A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first JWST observations of SN 1987A provided clear evidence that a compact object is ionizing the innermost ejecta. Here we analyze a second epoch of JWST NIRSpec and MIRI/MRS observations to better characterize the properties of this region, aided by a higher spectral resolving power for the new NIRSpec data. We confirm the presence of the previously identified narrow lines from the central region; [Ar VI] 4.5292 $\mu$m, [Ar II] 6.9853 $\mu$m, [S IV] 10.5105 $\mu$m, and [S III] 18.7130 $\mu$m, and also identify similar components in [Ca V] 4.1585 $\mu$m, [Cl II] 14.3678 $\mu$m, and possibly [Fe II] 1.6440 $\mu$m. These lines are blueshifted by $\sim$ -250 km/s, while the emission region is spatially unresolved and located southeast of the center. The offset and blueshift could imply a kick velocity of $510 \pm 55$ km/s for the neutron star. We also identify [Ca IV] 3.2068 $\mu$m near the center, but it is displaced to the north and has a redshift of $\sim 700$ km/s. We find that scattering by dust in the ejecta with a typical grain size $\sim 0.3\ \mu$m can explain the [Ca IV] properties and the absence of other narrow lines at shorter wavelengths, while dust absorption is important at $\lambda \gtrsim 8\ \mu$m. Photoionization models for a pulsar wind nebula and a cooling neutron star are both compatible with the observations, with the exception of the [Fe II] feature. The two models primarily differ at short wavelengths, where new lines are expected to emerge over time as the optical depth of dust in the expanding ejecta decreases.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruptions of close white dwarf binaries by intermediate mass black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a suite of numerical simulations of tidal disruption events, using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, for a close binary system consisting of two low-mass white dwarfs, and an intermediate mass non-spinning black hole. The binary components are considered to be detached and on the same plane with the black hole. Our results quantify how the outcomes of these events depend crucially on the positional configuration of the binary components at the orbital pericenter, and we also show how distinctive behaviour for non-identical mass binaries arise, as compared to identical ones. We highlight these differences on observables such as mass fallback rates, kick velocities and gravitational waves, and also compute clump formation time within the stellar debris. In our setup, prograde binary motion, where the angular momentum of the binary is in the same direction as that of the center of mass motion around the black hole, is qualitatively similar to multiple events of single star tidal disruptions. However, we argue that interactions between stellar debris in the corresponding retrograde scenarios result in different and distinct outcomes. Our results should serve as indicative benchmarks in the observational aspects of tidal interactions between close white dwarf binaries and intermediate mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Regular Rotating Black Hole: Probing the boundaries of the Radiative Signatures and Jet Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed observational analysis of several galactic X-ray binaries, focusing on the interplay between black hole spin, jet power, and radiative efficiency within the context of Blandford-Znajek-powered jets. Using updated measurements from continuum fitting and Fe-line methods, we constrain the spin parameter a and the deviation parameter $\beta$ for five key black hole systems: H1743-322, XTE J1550-564, GRS 1124-683, GRO J1655-40, and GRS 1915+105. For each system, we compare the allowed parameter spaces derived independently from observed radiative efficiencies and emitted jet powers under different assumptions for the jet Lorentz factor $\Gamma=2,5$. By overlapping these observational constraints with theoretical expectations for regular black holes, we assess the viability of various spin-deviation combinations in explaining the observed phenomena. Our results reveal significant restrictions on the allowed values of $\beta$, with typical upper bounds around 0.38 - 0.4, except for rapidly spinning sources where the constraint becomes notably tighter. We further present a modified method for generating rotating solutions from static regular black hole spacetimes and provide a robust theoretical framework for relating jet power to black hole angular frequency in curved geometries. We also find that the theoretical jet power is modified by regularization factor for regular black holes. These findings place stringent observational bounds on deviations from the Kerr geometry and provide important insight into the astrophysical mechanisms powering accreting stellar-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Detectability of compact intermediate-mass black hole binaries as low-frequency gravitational wave sources: the influence of dynamical friction of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03582v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black hole (BH) spin could significantly change the density of dark matter (DM) in its vicinity, creating a mini-spike of the density of DM. The dynamical friction (DF) between DM and the companion star of a BH can provide an efficient loss of angular momentum, driving the BH-main sequence (MS) star binary to evolve toward a compact orbit system. We investigate the influence of the DF of DM on the detectability of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH)-MS binaries as low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) sources. Taking into account the DF of DM, we employ the detailed binary evolution code MESA to model the evolution of a large number of IMBH-MS binaries. Our simulation shows that the DF of DM can drive those IMBH-MS binaries to evolve toward low-frequency GW sources for a low donor-star mass, a high spike index, or a short initial orbital period. When the spike index $\gamma=1.60$, those IMBH-MS binaries with donor-star masses of $1.0-3.4~ M_{\odot}$ and initial orbital periods of $0.65-16.82~ \rm days$ could potentially evolve into visible LISA sources within a distance of $10~\rm kpc$. The DF of DM can enlarge the initial parameter space and prolong the bifurcation periods. In the low-frequency GW source stage, the X-ray luminosities of those IMBH X-ray binaries are $\sim 10^{35}-10^{36}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$, hence they are ideal multimessenger objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new model for the origin of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), attributing these phenomena to sudden discharges of accumulated electric charge in the accretion disk of compact objects such as black holes. Our framework demonstrates how Compton scattering within the disk plasma generates charge separation, creating a capacitor-like system stabilized by the equilibrium between radiation pressure and electrostatic forces. We detail the discharge process through destabilizing mechanisms in this capacitor, resulting in radiative emission. We compare our model's prediction on radiation signatures with observational data, using FRB2018725A as an example to obtain key quantitative relationships. Additionally, we estimate the total charge buildup via Compton scattering for a stellar-mass black hole, constrained by the best-fit between our model and observations, and determine the corresponding electron density in the accretion disk for this mechanism to operate.</description>

      <title>The role of migration traps in the formation of binary black holes in AGN disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary black holes (BBHs) forming in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) represent a promising channel for gravitational-wave production. BBHs are typically expected to originate at migration traps, i.e. radial locations where the Type I migration of embedded stellar-mass black holes (BHs) transitions from outwards to inwards. In this work, we test this assumption by explicitly simulating the radial migration of BH pairs in AGN disks under different torque prescriptions, including thermal effects and the switch to Type II migration. We quantify where and when binaries form as a function of supermassive BH (SMBH) mass, disk viscosity, and migrating BH mass. We find that while the majority of pair-up events occur near migration traps, a substantial fraction takes place elsewhere in the disk, particularly for high-viscosity disks ($\alpha=0.1-0.4$) and SMBHs with mass above a threshold of $10^{7.5}$ solar masses, where differential migration is most efficient. The inclusion of thermal torques favors pair-up in outer locations of the disk and facilitates rapid pair-up. We also investigate hierarchical BBH formation, showing that higher-generation pair-ups are more tightly clustered around trap locations. Our results provide realistic prescriptions for BBH pair-up locations and timescales, highlighting the limitations of assuming fixed BBH formation sites.</description>

      <title>On the Efficiency of Producing Gamma-Ray Bursts from Isolated Population III Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rate of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from isolated Pop III stars is not well known, as it depends on our poor understanding of their initial mass function (IMF), rotation rates, stellar evolution, and mass loss. A sub-population of massive ($M_{\rm ZAMS}\gtrsim20M_\odot$) Pop III stars is expected to suffer core-collapse and launch a relativistic jet that would power a GRB. In the collapsar scenario, a key requirement is that the pre-supernova star imparts sufficient angular momentum to the remnant black hole to form an accretion disc and launch a relativistic jet, which demands rapid initial rotation of the progenitor star and suppression of line-driven mass loss during its chemically homogeneous evolution. Here we explore a grid of stellar evolution models of Pop III stars with masses $20\leq M_{\rm ZAMS}/M_\odot \leq 100$, which are initially rotating with surface angular velocities $0.6\leq \Omega_0/\Omega_{\rm crit}\leq 0.9$, where centrifugally-driven mass loss ensues for $\Omega&gt;\Omega_{\rm crit}$. Realistic accretion and jet propagation models are used to derive the initial black hole masses and spins, and jet breakout times for these stars. The GRB production efficiency is obtained over a phase space comprising progenitor initial mass, rotation, and wind efficiency. For modest wind efficiency of $\eta_{\rm wind}=0.45-0.35$, the Pop III GRB production efficiency is $\eta_{\rm GRB}\sim10^{-5}-3\times10^{-4}\,M_\odot^{-1}$, respectively, for a top-heavy IMF. This yields an observable all-sky equivalent rate of $\sim2-40\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ by \textit{Swift}, with 75\% of the GRBs located at $z\lesssim8$. If the actual observed rate is much lower, then this would imply $\eta_{\rm wind}&gt;0.45$, which leads to significant loss of mass and angular momentum that renders isolated Pop III stars incapable of producing GRBs and favours a binary scenario instead.</description>

Abstract: The particle origin of dark matter (DM) remains elusive despite decades of direct, indirect, and collider searches. Several groups have reported a $\gamma$-ray excess toward the Galactic Centre, commonly referred to as the Galactic Centre Excess (GCE). Its spectrum is consistent with annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) of mass $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ GeV and a thermal-relic cross section. Although many concrete WIMP models reproduce the GCE spectrum, most are now excluded by direct detection experiments that are approaching the neutrino floor. We investigate a class of anomaly-free extensions of the Standard Model featuring gauged differences of lepton number, $U(1)_{L_i-L_j}$, and gauged baryon minus lepton number, $U(1)_{B-L}$. We show that these models can reproduce the GCE while remaining compatible with the observed relic abundance. We then impose collider and direct detection constraints, accounting for both tree-level and loop-induced kinetic mixing. The $L_\mu-L_e$ model gives the best fit to the GCE: a DM mass of $m_\chi\sim 40-50$ GeV remains consistent with the muon and electron magnetic moment anomalies, $(g-2)_{\mu,e}$, as well as current collider and direct detection limits, for mediator masses in the range $m_{A'}\sim 70-86$ GeV and a DM-mediator coupling of $(1-5)\times10^{-2}$. By contrast, the $L_e-L_\tau$ and $L_\mu-L_\tau$ models yield poorer fits; satisfying both the relic density and experimental bounds forces the DM mass to lie very close to resonance (i.e., approximately half the mediator mass). Finally, while the $B-L$ model also matches the GCE well, its parameter space is almost entirely ruled out by strong direct detection limits, except for the narrow resonance region where $m_\chi$ should be equal to $m_{A'}/2$ requiring a fine-tuning at the few-percent level.</description>

      <title>Love beyond Einstein: Metric reconstruction and Love number in quadratic gravity using WEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study tidal Love numbers of static black holes in four-dimensional quadratic theory of gravity, extending the result of GR. We use worldline effective field theory (WEFT) methods to compute metric perturbations from one-point functions, treating the higher-derivative terms perturbatively. We show that insertions of scalar fields on the worldline induce non-zero tidal tails, and the corresponding Love number displays no RG running. The same conclusion holds for the insertions of tensor fields. Furthermore, for scalar dipole perturbations, we derive a Yukawa-deformed Frobenius solution and match the asymptotic behavior to fix the UV charge, finding agreement with EFT predictions of Wilson coefficients. Our work demonstrates that quadratic higher-curvature corrections induce non-zero but scale-independent tidal responses, offering a robust EFT framework to test deviations from GR in gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Attenuation of the ultra-high-energy neutrino flux by dark matter scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A flux of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos is generally expected to be produced by astrophysical sources at cosmological distances and to reach Earth. In this paper, we investigate the impact of neutrino scattering with dark matter (DM) particles in both the intergalactic medium and the Milky Way on the total flux, energy spectrum, and arrival directions of UHE neutrinos. We emphasize the complementarity of neutrino detectors at different latitudes to probe the anisotropy in the flux at Earth due to the attenuation of the neutrino flux in the Milky Way dark matter halo. We also discuss that, with mild astrophysical assumptions, limits on the DM-$\nu$ scattering cross section can be placed even if the neutrino sources are unknown. Finally, we explore all this phenomenology with the recent UHE neutrino event KM3230213A, and place the corresponding limits in the DM-$\nu$ scattering cross-section.</description>

      <title>X-ray Polarimetry of Accreting White Dwarfs: A Case Study of EX Hydrae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first first X-ray polarization measurements of a white dwarf, the intermediate polar EX Hya. We measured significant polarization only in the 2 -- 3 keV energy band with a polarization degree of 8 percent at a $3\sigma$ significance. No significant polarization was detected above 3 keV, which we attribute to the higher energy bands having lower signal-to-noise. We found that the scattering surface detected by the IXPE is nearly perpendicular to the optical scattering plane, showing that the X-ray scattering surface is the WD and close to the base of the accretion column. Finally, we show how the polarization can be used to estimate the height of the accretion shock above the white dwarf's surface.</description>

      <title>X-ray Halos of Early-Type Galaxies with AGN Feedback and Accretion from a Circumgalactic Medium: models and observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The knowledge of the X-ray properties of the hot gas halos of early-type galaxies has significantly advanced in the past years, for large and homogeneously investigated samples. We compare these results with the X-ray properties of an exploratory set of gas evolution models in realistic early-type galaxies, produced with our high-resolution 2D hydrodynamical code MACER that includes AGN feedback and accretion from a circumgalactic medium. The model X-ray emission and absorption are integrated along the line of sight, to obtain maps of the surface brightness Sigma_X and temperature Tx. The X-ray diagnostics considered are the luminosity and average temperature for the whole galaxy (Lx and &lt;Tx&gt;) and within 5 optical effective radii (Lx5 and &lt;Tx5&gt;), and the circularized profiles Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R). The values for Lx, Lx5, &lt;Tx&gt;, and &lt;Tx5&gt; compare very well with those observed. The Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R) also present qualitative similarities with those of the representative galaxy NGC5129, and of ETGs with the most commonly observed shape for Tx(R): Sigma_X(R) matches the observed profile over many optical effective radii Re, and Tx(R) reproduces the characteristic bump that peaks at R=(1 - 3)Re. Inside the peak position, Tx(R) declines towards the center, but the explored models are systematically hotter by ~30%; possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. Interestingly, Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R) as large as observed outside of R~Re are reproduced only with significant accretion from a circumgalactic medium, highlighting its importance.</description>

      <title>Interferometric signature of higher-order images in a parametrized framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates gravitational lensing in the strong deflection limit, focusing particularly on higher-order images produced near compact objects such as black holes and their observable impact through the visibility function. Employing a robust parametrization framework proposed by Rezzolla and Zhidenko, the study systematically explores deviations from the Schwarzschild metric. A detailed theoretical analysis of interferometric observables is provided, highlighting how higher-order images imprint distinctive, measurable patterns in the visibility function, notably characterized by a staircase-like structure. By parametrically varying metric coefficients, the analysis reveals clear dependencies between spacetime deviations and key observational signatures, specifically the step heights and periodicities in the interferometric visibility. The results enhance the theoretical groundwork for interpreting data from advanced interferometric observations, potentially enabling precise tests of general relativity and the discrimination among alternative gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Automated Algorithmic Discovery for Gravitational-Wave Detection Guided by LLM-Informed Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset. High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science domains.</description>

      <title>Particle Acceleration Time due to Turbulent-Induced Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate a crucial parameter for understanding particle acceleration theory via turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection: the particle acceleration time. We examine particles accelerated either during the jet's dynamic evolution or in a post-processing, nearly stationary regime. We derive the particle acceleration time and compare it with theoretical predictions for both the Fermi and drift regimes identified in the simulations. In the Fermi regime, the acceleration time is expected to be independent of the particles' energy, for constant reconnection velocity, as energy increases exponentially with time. Conversely, we expect the reconnection acceleration time to depend on the current sheet's thickness and the reconnection velocity, a dependence recently revisited by xu and lazarian 2023. They identified three conditions for \(t_{acc}\). We tested these relations using statistical distributions of the current sheets' thickness and reconnection velocities in the turbulent jet over time. The resulting average value of \(t_{acc}\) was found to be nearly constant with particle energy. We compared this acceleration time with the average acceleration time derived directly from 50,000 particles accelerated in situ in the same relativistic jet. When considering a longer time interval for particle acceleration in a nearly stationary snapshot of the turbulent jet, we find that the acceleration time during the Fermi regime remains nearly independent of particle energy and aligns with the acceleration time theoretical relations up to the threshold energy, attained when the particles Larmor radius becomes as large as the thickness of the largest current sheets. Beyond this threshold, the acceleration regime shifts to the slower drift regime, showing strong energy dependence, as predicted. The results also indicate a clear dominance of the Fermi regime of acceleration.</description>

      <title>Physics motivated models of pulsar X-ray hotspots: off-center dipole configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it was proposed that an off-center dipole magnetic configuration, together with a non-trivial temperature profile, may be the best model to explain the X-ray light curve of PSR J0030+0451 observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (\emph{NICER}). Using a theoretical model for the electric current density in a force-free pulsar magnetosphere, we compute from first principles the distribution of electric current over the polar cap associated with an off-center magnetic dipole. We then use a simple prescription to compute the resulting temperature distribution, which allows us to derive the observed X-ray light curve. We investigate the role of the volumetric return current region in the polar cap and find that although it does not make a big difference in an aligned dipole case, the difference can be bigger in the case of an off-center dipole. Finally, we apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting to the X-ray light curves of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0437--4715 with and without the volumetric return current, and find that our model can reasonably recover the observed X-ray light curves.</description>

Abstract: We describe a new method to incorporate thermonuclear heating in the envelope of accreting neutron star into long term simulations of their thermal evolution. We obtain boundary conditions for the heat exchange between the envelope and the crust based on stationary models which include nuclear burning and validate these values comparing to the results of the time-dependent code \texttt{MESA}. These simple boundary conditions allow us to explore a large parameter space. We quantify the amount of heat flowing from the envelope into the crust, or viceversa, depending on the mass accretion rate, outburst duration and duty cycle, and especially crust/core physical parameters such as impurities, crustal heating, and neutrino cooling rate.</description>

      <title>Shape and ionization of equatorial matter near compact objects from X-ray polarization reflection signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the success of the IXPE mission, we elucidate what can be inferred about 3D matter structures forming about the equatorial plane of accreting compact objects from 0.1-100 keV linear polarization induced by non-relativistic large-scale reflection. We construct a model of an optically thick elevated axially symmetric reflecting medium with arbitrary ionization profile, representing the known diverse scattering environments: from thick winds and super-Eddington funnel structures formed around black holes and neutron stars, to Compton-thick dusty tori of active galactic nuclei and their broad line regions. We assume a central X-ray power-law source with an isotropic, cosine, and slab-corona emission distribution, including intrinsic polarization. The reprocessing is based on constant-density local reflection tables produced with a Monte Carlo method combined with detailed non-LTE radiative transfer, although we also show examples with classical (semi-)analytical reflection prescriptions. We conclude that varying ionization has a similarly strong impact on observed polarization as the observer's inclination and the skew and opening angle of the reflector's inner walls, altogether producing up to tens of % of reflected polarization both parallelly or perpendicularly to the projected axis, depending on the parameter values combination. After testing 3 different ad-hoc shapes of the reflector: a cone, an elliptical torus, and a bowl, we conclude that while in some configurations, their altered curvature produces more than 30% absolute difference in observed total polarization, in others, the adopted shape has a marginal impact. Lastly, we discuss the change of the observed polarization due to relaxing the optically thick assumption on equatorial winds and accreted matter, providing a continuous range of energy-dependent examples between the optically thick and thin scenarios.</description>

      <title>Low-metallicity nova explosions: a site for weak rp-process nucleosynthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical novae are common cataclysmic events involving a binary system of a white dwarf and a main sequence or red giant companion star. In metal-poor environments, these explosions produce ejecta different from their solar counterparts due to the accretion of sub-solar metallicity material onto the white dwarf. In particular, it has been suggested that the nucleosynthesis flow in such low-metallicity nova explosions extends up to the Cu-Zn region, much beyond the expected endpoint, around Ca, predicted for solar-metallicity classical novae. This behavior resembles a weak rp-process, and such nuclear activity has never been observed in accreting white dwarf binaries with typical accretion flows. In this work, we study the characteristics of the weak rp-process for four nova models with metallicities $Z= 2\times 10^{-9}$, $10^{-7}$, $2\times 10^{-6}$, and $2\times 10^{-5}$, and explore the impact of the nuclear physics uncertainties via a Monte Carlo sensitivity study. We identify nuclear reactions whose uncertainties affect the production of intermediate-mass nuclei under these conditions. These reactions and relevant nuclear quantities are targets for measurements at stable or radioactive beam facilities to reduce their rate uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Polarisation as a probe of neutrino emission from blazars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The source of extragalactic neutrinos in the TeV-PeV range is a matter of very active research, with blazar jets having been postulated to be the origin of at least some of the detections. The blazar PKS 0735+178 is a prominent example; during its multi-band flare in late 2021 a neutrino event was reported by four observatories, with its origin consistent with the direction of that source. While no new jet component was observed to be ejected during that narrow time-frame, our analysis shows that a propagating shock front originating from the core region was the likely source of the multi-band flare, using very-long-baseline interferometry images of PKS 0735+178 in polarised light. Taken together, our findings are suggestive of a coherent scenario in which the shock may contribute to the acceleration of protons, with the target photons potentially originating either from the ambient medium surrounding the jet or from proton synchrotron radiation. The necessary conditions for neutrino emission via proton-photon interactions are, hence, present in this jet.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations provide a unique window into the fundamental nature of massive objects. In particular, neutron star equations of state have been constrained due to the success of gravitational wave observatories. Recently, the possibility of detecting dark matter-admixed Neutron stars via ground-based laser interferometry have been explored. Dark matter would impact the gravitational waveform of an inspiraling neutron star system through tidal parameters, namely the tidal deformability $\lambda$, incurring a phase shift to the frequency evolution of the signal. This phase shift would depend both on the percentage of dark matter within the star and its particle nature, e.g., bosonic or fermionic. Indirect detection of dark matter through admixture within neutron stars can provide insight into the neutron equation of state, as well as constraints on the density of dark matter in the universe. In this work, we introduce Darksuite, a proposed extension of the LALSuite software framework, designed to model the gravitational wave signatures of dark-matter-admixed neutron stars. This framework employs simulations from the two-fluid, generally relativistic Tolman- Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, wherein one fluid is ordinary nuclear matter and the other is dark matter. We demonstrate interpolation of values from a bank of simulations, enabling the study of binary systems where at least one component may be a dark-matter-admixed neutron star. By leveraging existing methodologies within LALSuite for tidal phase corrections and supplementing them with dark matter effects, Darksuite provides a means to generate and analyze gravitational waveforms for these exotic systems.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of the line-force-driven winds from active galactic nuclei: The special relativistic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) with mildly relativistic velocities are frequently observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The line-force-driving mechanism is often taken as a potential mechanism for driving UFOs. Due to the line-force-driven winds moving at mildly relativistic velocities, the special relativistic effects become important. There are two special relativistic effects: one is the influence of the disc rotation on the radiation field; the other is the radiation-drag effect. We wish to study the influence of the special relativistic effects on the line-force-driven winds, and we performed numerical simulations to investigate this. We find that the line-force-driven winds are significantly weakened when the special relativistic effects are considered. Compared with the case without special relativistic effects, when special relativistic effects are considered the winds are closer to the disc surface, the maximum speed of winds is reduced by $\sim$20 percent--70 percent, and the mass outflow rate and the kinetic power is significantly reduced.</description>

      <title>Taking control of compressible modes: bulk viscosity and the turbulent dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03984v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many polyatomic astrophysical plasmas are compressible and out of chemical and thermal equilibrium, introducing a bulk viscosity into the plasma via the internal degrees of freedom of the molecular composition, directly impacting the decay of compressible modes, $\mathbf{v}_{\parallel}(\mathbf{k})$. This is especially important for small-scale, turbulent dynamo processes in the interstellar medium, which are known to be sensitive to the effects of compression. To control the viscous properties of $\mathbf{v}_{\parallel}(\mathbf{k})$, we perform trans-sonic, visco-resistive dynamo simulations with additional bulk viscosity $\nu_{\rm bulk}$, deriving a new $\nu_{\rm bulk}$ Reynolds number $\rm{Re}_{\rm bulk}$, and viscous Prandtl number $\rm{P}\nu \equiv \rm{Re}_{\rm bulk} / \rm{Re}_{\rm shear}$, where $\rm{Re}_{\rm shear}$ is the shear viscosity Reynolds number. We derive a framework for decomposing $E_{\rm mag}$ growth rates into incompressible and compressible terms via orthogonal tensor decompositions of $\nabla\otimes\mathbf{v}$, where $\mathbf{v}$ is the fluid velocity. We find that $\mathbf{v}_{\parallel}(\mathbf{k})$ play a dual role, growing and decaying $E_{\rm mag}$, and that field-line stretching is the main driver of growth, even in compressible dynamos. In the absence of $\nu_{\rm bulk}$ ($\rm{P}\nu \to \infty$), $\mathbf{v}_{\parallel}(\mathbf{k})$ pile up on small-scales, creating a spectral bottleneck, which disappears for $\rm{P}\nu \approx 1$. (abridged). We emphasize the importance of further understanding the role of $\nu_{\rm bulk}$ in compressible astrophysical plasmas, which we estimate could be as strong as the shear viscosity in the cold ISM, and highlight that compressible direct numerical simulations without bulk viscosity have unresolved compressible mode dissipation scales.</description>

      <title>Eikonal gravitational-wave lensing in Einstein-aether theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein-aether theory provides a model to test the validity of local Lorentz invariance in gravitational interactions. The speed of gravitational waves as measured from the binary neutron star event GW170817 sets stringent limits on Einstein-aether theory, but only on a combination of the theory's free parameters. For this reason, a significant part of the theory's parameter space remains unconstrained by observations. Motivated by this, we explore the propagation of gravitational waves in Einstein-aether theory over an inhomogeneous background (i.e., gravitational wave lensing) as a potential mechanism to break the degeneracies between the theory's free parameters, and hence enable new constraints on the theory to be obtained. We reduce our analysis to gravitational waves that pass far from the lens' center and short wavelength signals, both compared to the lens' gravitational radius (eikonal limit). By applying these approximations and bringing the field equations into the form of the so-called kinetic matrix and applying a formalism known as the propagation eigenstate framework, we find that the speed of gravitational waves is modified by inhomogeneities in the aether field. However, the modification is common to both gravitational polarizations and vanishes in the limit in which gravitational waves propagate with luminal speed. This lens-dependent gravitational wave speed contrasts with the lens-induced birefringence observed in other theories beyond general relativity, like Horndeski's theory. While the potential to improve tests based on gravitational-wave speed is limited, our formalism sets the basis to fully describe signal propagation over inhomogeneous spacetimes in Einstein-aether theory and other extensions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Probing the cosmic baryon distribution and the impact of AGN feedback with FRBs in CROCODILE simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12741v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Missing Baryon problem using Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) to trace cosmic baryons. Our CROCODILE simulations, performed with the GADGET3/4-OSAKA smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, include star formation, supernova (SN) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. We generate light cones from large-scale structure simulations to compute gas density profiles and dispersion measures (DMs) measurable by FRBs. Our results show that AGN feedback reduces central gas densities in halos, reshaping the boundary between the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and intergalactic medium (IGM). Zoom-in simulations reveal that AGN feedback significantly modulates the DM contributions from foreground halos along different sightlines. Using the DM-redshift (DM-z) relation up to z=1, we constrain the diffuse baryon mass fraction at z = 1 to f_diff = 0.865 (+0.101, -0.165) (fiducial) and f_diff = 0.856 (+0.101, -0.162) (NoBH), which include contributions from both IGM (f_IGM) and halos (f_Halos), serving as upper limits. We further separate and quantify the redshift evolution of f_CGM, f_IGM, and f_diff using both phase-based and structure-based definitions. From an observational perspective, we also distinguish the line-of-sight averaged quantity &lt; f_{diff,obs} &gt; from the intrinsic redshift-evolving f_diff(z), reflecting the statistical nature of FRB-based measurements. Our study provides a framework for understanding baryon distribution across cosmic structures, FRB host galaxies, and the role of AGN in shaping foreground DM contributions.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Mixture of $t$-Factor Analyzers for Clustering High-dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel hybrid approach for estimating the mixture model of $t$-factor analyzers (MtFA) that employs multivariate $t$-distribution and factor model to cluster and characterize grouped data. The traditional estimation method for MtFA faces computational challenges, particularly in high-dimensional settings, where the eigendecomposition of large covariance matrices and the iterative nature of Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms lead to scalability issues. We propose a computational scheme that integrates a profile likelihood method into the EM framework to efficiently obtain the model parameter estimates. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through simulations showcasing its superior computational efficiency compared to the existing method, while preserving clustering accuracy and resilience against outliers. Our method is applied to cluster the Gamma-ray bursts, reinforcing several claims in the literature that Gamma-ray bursts have heterogeneous subpopulations and providing characterizations of the estimated groups.</description>

      <title>Sub-Parsec Acceleration and Collimation of NGC 4261's Twin Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first robust evidence for a co-spatial sub-parsec acceleration and collimation zone (ACZ) in the twin jets of the nearby low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN) NGC 4261. This result is derived from multifrequency Very Long Baseline Array imaging, combined with the frequency-dependent properties of the radio core (core shift and core size) and jet kinematics determined from the jet-to-counterjet brightness ratio. By applying multiple analysis methods and incorporating results from the literature, we identify a parabolic-to-conical structural transition in both the jet and counterjet, with the transition occurring at $(1.23\pm0.24)$ pc or $(8.1\pm1.6)\times10^3 R_{\rm s}$ (Schwarzschild radii) for the jet and $(0.97\pm0.29)$ pc or $(6.4\pm1.9)\times10^3 R_{\rm s}$ for the counterjet. We also derive the jet velocity field at distances of $\sim (10^3-2\times10^4) R_{\rm s}$. While local kinematic variations are present, the jet shows an overall acceleration to relativistic speeds from $\sim 10^3$ to $\sim8\times10^3 R_{\rm s}$, with a maximum Lorentz factor of $\Gamma_{\rm max} \approx 2.6$. Beyond this region, the jet gradually decelerates to sub-relativistic speeds. These findings support the existence of a sub-parsec-scale ($\lesssim 1.5$ pc) ACZ in NGC 4261, where the jet is accelerated via magnetic-to-kinetic energy conversion while being confined by external pressure. A brief comparison with M 87 suggests that the ACZ in NGC 4261 may represent a scaled-down analogue of that in M 87. These results point towards a potential diversity in jet ACZ properties, emphasizing the importance of extending such studies to a broader AGN population to elucidate the physical mechanisms at play.</description>

      <title>Searching for stars ejected from the Galactic Centre in DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical interactions between stars and the super massive black hole Sgr A* at the Galactic Centre (GC) may eject stars into the Galactic halo. While recent fast ejections by Sgr A* have been identified in the form of hypervelocity stars (hundreds to thousands km/s), it is also expected that the stellar halo contains slower stars, ejected over the last few billion years. In this study, we use the first data release of DESI to search for these slower GC ejecta, which are expected to stand out from the stellar halo population for their combined high metallicity (${\rm [Fe/H]}\gtrsim0$) and small values of their vertical angular momentum ($L_Z$), whose distribution should peak at zero. Our search does not yield a detection, but allows us to place an upper limit on the ejection rate of stars from the GC of $\sim2.8\times10^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ over the past ~5 Gyr, which is ejection model independent. This implies that our result can be used to put constraints on different ejection models, including that invoking mergers of Sgr A* with other massive black holes in the last last few billion years.</description>
