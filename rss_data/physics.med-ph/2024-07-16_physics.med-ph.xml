      <title>Stationary CT Imaging of Intracranial Hemorrhage with Diffusion Posterior Sampling Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) can be used in Computed Tomography (CT) reconstruction by leveraging diffusion-based generative models for unconditional image synthesis while matching the observations (data) of a CT scan. Of particular interest is its application in scenarios involving sparse or limited angular sampling, where conventional reconstruction algorithms are often insufficient. We developed a DPS algorithm for 3D reconstruction from a stationary CT (sCT) portable brain stroke imaging unit based on a multi-x-ray source array (MXA) of 31 x-ray tubes and a curved area detector. In this configuration, conventional reconstruction e.g., Penalized Weighted Least Squares (PWLS) with a Huber edge-preserving penalty, suffers from severe directional undersampling artifacts. The proposed DPS integrates a two-dimensional diffusion model, acting on image slices, coupled to sCT data consistency and volumetric regularization terms to enable 3D reconstruction robust to noise and incomplete sampling. To reduce the computational burden of DPS, stochastic contraction with PWLS initialization was used to decrease the number of diffusion steps. The validation studies involved simulations of anthropomorphic brain phantoms with synthetic bleeds and experimental data from an sCT bench. In simulations, DPS achieved ~130% reduction of directional artifacts compared to PWLS and 30% better recovery of lesion shape (DICE coefficient). Benchtop studies demonstrated enhanced visualization of brain features in a Kyoto Kagaku head phantom. The proposed DPS achieved improved visualization of intracranial hemorrhage and brain morphology compared to conventional model-based reconstruction for the highly undersampled sCT system.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing MRI Data Processing Using FSL: Preliminary Findings with the Fugaku Supercomputer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amount of Magnetic resonance imaging data has grown tremendously recently, creating an urgent need to accelerate data processing, which requires substantial computational resources and time. In this preliminary study, we applied FMRIB Software Library commands on T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted images of a single young adult using the Fugaku supercomputer. The tensor-based measurements and subcortical structure segmentations performed on Fugaku supercomputer were highly consistent with those from conventional systems, demonstrating its reliability and significantly reduced processing time.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics and optimization studies of horse prion protein wild type and its S167D mutant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.00365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prion diseases or called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are fatal neurodegenerative diseases characterised by the accumulation of an abnormal prion protein isoform (rich in beta-sheets - about 30% alpha-helix and 43% beta-sheet), which is converted from the normal prion protein (predominant in alpha-helix - about 42% alpha-helix and 3% beta-sheet). However, prion disease has not been reported in horses up to now; therefore, horses are known to be a species resistant to prion diseases. Residue S167 in horse has been cited as critical protective residue for encoding prion protein conformational stability in prion-resistance. According to the protein-only hypothesis, abnormal prion protein is responsible for both spongiform degeneration of the brain and disease transmissibility. Thus, understanding the conformational dynamics of abnormal prion protein from normal prion protein is a key to developing effective therapies. This article is to do molecular dynamics and optimization studies on the horse normal prion protein wild-type and its S167D mutant respectively to understand their conformational dynamics and optimized confirmation; interesting results will be discussed.</description>
