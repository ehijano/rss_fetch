      <title>From fair price to fair volatility: Towards an Efficiency-Consistent Definition of Financial Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volatility, as a primary indicator of financial risk, forms the foundation of classical frameworks such as Markowitz's Portfolio Theory and the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). However, its conventional use rests on assumptions-most notably, the Markovian nature of price dynamics-that often fail to reflect key empirical characteristics of financial markets. Fractional stochastic volatility models expose these limitations by demonstrating that volatility alone is insufficient to capture the full structure of return dispersion. In this context, we propose pointwise regularity, measured via the Hurst-Holder exponent, as a complementary metric of financial risk. This measure quantifies local deviations from martingale behavior, enabling a more nuanced assessment of market inefficiencies and the mechanisms by which equilibrium is restored. By accounting not only for the magnitude but also for the nature of randomness, this framework bridges the conceptual divide between efficient market theory and behavioral finance.</description>

      <title>Tokenize Everything, But Can You Sell It? RWA Liquidity Challenges and the Road Ahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) promises to transform financial markets by enabling fractional ownership, global accessibility, and programmable settlement of traditionally illiquid assets such as real estate, private credit, and government bonds. While technical progress has been rapid, with over \$25 billion in tokenized RWAs brought on-chain as of 2025, liquidity remains a critical bottleneck. This paper investigates the gap between tokenization and tradability, drawing on recent academic research and market data from platforms such as RWA.xyz. We document that most RWA tokens exhibit low trading volumes, long holding periods, and limited investor participation, despite their potential for 24/7 global markets. Through case studies of tokenized real estate, private credit, and tokenized treasury funds, we present empirical liquidity observations that reveal low transfer activity, limited active address counts, and minimal secondary trading for most tokenized asset classes. Next, we categorize the structural barriers to liquidity, including regulatory gating, custodial concentration, whitelisting, valuation opacity, and lack of decentralized trading venues. Finally, we propose actionable pathways to improve liquidity, ranging from hybrid market structures and collateral-based liquidity to transparency enhancements and compliance innovation. Our findings contribute to the growing discourse on digital asset market microstructure and highlight that realizing the liquidity potential of RWAs requires coordinated progress across legal, technical, and institutional domains.</description>

      <title>Mapping Microscopic and Systemic Risks in TradFi and DeFi: a literature review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the formation and propagation of systemic risks across traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), offering a comparative framework that bridges these two increasingly interconnected ecosystems. We propose a conceptual model for systemic risk formation in TradFi, grounded in well-established mechanisms such as leverage cycles, liquidity crises, and interconnected institutional exposures. Extending this analysis to DeFi, we identify unique structural and technological characteristics - such as composability, smart contract vulnerabilities, and algorithm-driven mechanisms - that shape the emergence and transmission of risks within decentralized systems. Through a conceptual mapping, we highlight risks with similar foundations (e.g., trading vulnerabilities, liquidity shocks), while emphasizing how these risks manifest and propagate differently due to the contrasting architectures of TradFi and DeFi. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of crosstagion, a bidirectional process where instability in DeFi can spill over into TradFi, and vice versa. We illustrate how disruptions such as liquidity crises, regulatory actions, or political developments can cascade across these systems, leveraging their growing interdependence. By analyzing this mutual dynamics, we highlight the importance of understanding systemic risks not only within TradFi and DeFi individually, but also at their intersection. Our findings contribute to the evolving discourse on risk management in a hybrid financial ecosystem, offering insights for policymakers, regulators, and financial stakeholders navigating this complex landscape.</description>
