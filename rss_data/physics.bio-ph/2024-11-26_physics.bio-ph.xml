      <title>Whispering-Gallery-Mode Resonators for Detection and Classification of Free-Flowing Nanoparticles and Cells through Photoacoustic Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro and nanoscale particles are crucial in various fields, from biomedical imaging to environmental processes. While conventional spectroscopy and microscopy methods for characterizing these particles often involve bulky equipment and complex sample preparation, optical micro-sensors have emerged as a promising alternative. However, their broad applicability is limited by the need for surface binding and difficulty in differentiating between sensing targets. This study introduces an optofluidic, high-throughput optical microresonator sensor that captures subtle acoustic signals generated by particles absorbing pulsed light energy. This novel approach enables real-time, label-free detection and interrogation of particles and cells in their native environments across an extended sensing volume. By leveraging unique optical absorption properties, our technique selectively detects and classifies flowing particles without surface binding, even in complex matrices like whole blood samples. We demonstrate the measurement of gold nanoparticles with diverse geometries and different species of red blood cells amidst other cellular elements and proteins. These particles are identified and classified based on their photoacoustic fingerprint, which captures shape, composition, and morphology features. This work opens new avenues for rapid, reliable, and high-throughput particle and cell identification in clinical and industrial applications, offering a valuable tool for understanding complex biological and environmental systems.</description>

      <title>In-situ biological ozone detection by measuring electrochemical impedances of plant tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates biological detection of a low concentration of O3 by measuring electrochemical impedances of tissues in tobacco and tomato plants located indoor and outdoor. The lower range of generated ozone in the O3-air mix is about 30 ug/m3 over the atmospheric level, which allows phytosensors to be considered as biodetectors of environmental pollutants. The ozone stress affects stomatal regulation that in turn influences the hydrodynamics of fluid transport system in plants. Sensors utilize electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to measure ionic fluid content at several positions on the plant stem and calculate a variation of fluid distribution in control and experimental cases indoors. Outdoor setup uses the same methodology and sensors but different analysis due to uncontrolled nature of ozone pollution and the overlap of various stressors. The measurement results indicate a qualitative and quantitative reaction of hydrodynamic system to changes in O3 concentration in the upper part of stem with a delay of 10-20 minutes between the onset of exposure and biological response. The probability of false-negative responses from a single plant is about 0.15 +/-0.06. Pooling data from at least three plants allows for 92% confidence in detecting excess O3. Measurements on days with low and high ozone levels of 80 ug/m3 to 130 ug/m3 result in a 2.33-fold difference in sensor values and thus demonstrate biological detection of high O3 also outdoors. Statistically significant data include 948 sensor-plant attempts during 51 days with 9 plants and about 10E7 samples collected in automated experiments. Long-term measurements have demonstrated the high reliability of electrochemical sensors, especially in harsh outdoor conditions with rain, heat and UV/IR radiations. The described approach has applications in environmental monitoring, biological pollution detection and biosensing.</description>

      <title>Devil's staircase inside shrimps reveals periodicity of plateau spikes and bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slow-fast dynamics are intrinsically related to complex phenomena, and are responsible for many of the homeostatic dynamics that keep biological systems healthfully functioning. We study a discrete-time membrane potential model that can generate a diverse set of spiking behavior depending on the choice of slow-fast time scales, from fast spiking to bursting, or plateau action potentials -- also known as cardiac spikes, since they are characteristic in heart myocytes. The plateau of cardiac spikes may lose stability, generating early or delayed afterdepolarizations (EAD and DAD, respectively), both of which are related to cardiac arrhythmia. We show the periodicity changes along the transition from the healthy action potentials to these impaired spikes. We show that while EADs are mainly periodic attractors, DAD usually comes with chaos. EADs are found inside shrimps -- isoperiodic structures of the parameter space. However, in our system, the shrimps have an internal structure made of multiple periodicities, revealing a complete devil's staircase. Understanding the periodicity of plateau attractors in slow-fast systems could come in handy to unveil the features of heart myocytes behavior that are linked to cardiac arrhythmias.</description>

      <title>Feedback between microscopic activity and macroscopic dynamics drives excitability and oscillations in mechanochemical matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic behaviour of active matter arises from nonequilibrium microscopic processes. In soft materials, active stresses typically drive macroscopic shape changes, which in turn alter the geometry constraining the microscopic dynamics, leading to complex feedback effects. Although such mechanochemical coupling is common in living matter and associated with biological functions such as cell migration, division, and differentiation, the underlying principles are not well understood due to a lack of minimal models that bridge the scales from the microscopic biochemical processes to the macroscopic shape dynamics. To address this gap, we derive tractable coarse-grained equations from microscopic dynamics for a class of mechanochemical systems, in which biochemical signal processing is coupled to shape dynamics. Specifically, we consider molecular interactions at the surface of biological cells that commonly drive cell-cell signaling and adhesion, and obtain a macroscopic description of cells as signal-processing droplets that adaptively change their interfacial tensions. We find a rich phenomenology, including multistability, symmetry-breaking, excitability, and self-sustained shape oscillations, with the underlying critical points revealing universal characteristics of such systems. Our tractable framework provides a paradigm for how soft active materials respond to shape-dependent signals, and suggests novel modes of self-organisation at the collective scale. These are explored further in our companion paper [arxiv 2402.08664v3].</description>

      <title>Self-diffusion anomalies of an odd tracer in soft-core media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Odd-diffusive systems, characterised by broken time-reversal and/or parity symmetry, have recently been shown to display counterintuitive features such as interaction-enhanced dynamics in the dilute limit. Here we we extend the investigation to the high-density limit of an odd tracer embedded in a soft-Gaussian core medium (GCM) using a field-theoretic approach based on the Dean-Kawasaki equation. Our theory reveals that interactions can enhance the dynamics of an odd tracer even in dense systems. We demonstrate that oddness results in a complete reversal of the well-known self-diffusion ($D_\mathrm{s}$) anomaly of the GCM. Ordinarily, $D_\mathrm{s}$ exhibits a non-monotonic trend with increasing density, approaching but remaining below the interaction-free diffusion, $D_0$, ($D_\mathrm{s} &lt; D_0$) so that $D_\mathrm{s} \uparrow D_0$ at high densities. In contrast, for an odd tracer, self-diffusion is enhanced ($D_\mathrm{s}&gt; D_0$) and the GCM anomaly is inverted, displaying $D_\mathrm{s} \downarrow D_0$ at high densities. The transition between the standard and reversed GCM anomaly is governed by the tracer's oddness, with a critical oddness value at which the tracer diffuses as a free particle ($D_\mathrm{s} \approx D_0$) across all densities. We validate our theoretical predictions with Brownian dynamics simulations, finding strong agreement between the two.</description>

      <title>Steerable dual-trap optical tweezers with confocal position detection using back-scattered light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezers has emerged as a powerful tool in manipulating microscopic particles and in measuring weak forces of the order of a pico-Newton. As a result, it has found wide applications ranging from material science to biology. Dual-trap optical tweezers (DTOT) are of particular importance as they allow for two point correlation measurements as in molecular force spectroscopy, two-point active micro-rheology, etc. Here we report a novel design for a steerable DTOT setup which uses back-scattered light from the two traps for position detection. This is performed using a confocal scheme where the two detectors are placed at the conjugate points to the respective traps. This offers several significant advantages over current designs, such as, zero cross-talk between signals, single module assembly and robustness to thermal drift. Moreover, our design can be very easily integrated with standard microscopy techniques like Phase contrast and Differential Interference Contrast, without modifying the microscope illumination unit.</description>

      <title>Impact of gas background on XFEL single-particle imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-particle imaging (SPI) using X-ray free-electron Lasers (XFELs) offers the potential to determine protein structures at high spatial and temporal resolutions without the need for crystallization or vitrification. However, the technique faces challenges due to weak diffraction signals from single proteins and significant background scattering from gases used for sample delivery. A recent observation of a diffraction pattern from an isolated GroEL protein complex had similar numbers of signal and background photons. Ongoing efforts aim to reduce the background created by sample delivery, with one approach replacing most of the used gas with helium. In this study, we investigate the effects of a potentially reduced background on the resolution limits for SPI of isolated proteins under different experiment conditions. As a test case, we used GroEL, and we used experimentally measured parameters for our simulations. We observe that background significantly impacts the achievable resolution, particularly when the signal strength is comparable to the background, and a background reduction would lead to a significant improvement in resolution.</description>

      <title>Optimal switching strategies in multi-drug therapies for chronic diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance is a threat to public health with millions of deaths linked to drug resistant infections every year. To mitigate resistance, common strategies that are used are combination therapies and therapy switching. However, the stochastic nature of pathogenic mutation makes the optimization of these strategies challenging. Here, we propose a two-scale stochastic model that considers the effective evolution of therapies in a multidimensional efficacy space, where each dimension represents the efficacy of a specific drug in the therapy. The diffusion of therapies within this space is subject to stochastic resets, representing therapy switches. The boundaries of the space, inferred from coarser pathogen-host dynamics, can be either reflecting or absorbing. Reflecting boundaries impede full recovery of the host, while absorbing boundaries represent the development of antimicrobial resistance, leading to therapy failure. We derive analytical expressions for the average absorption times, accounting for both continuous and discrete genomic changes using the frameworks of Langevin and Master equations, respectively. These expressions allow us to evaluate the relevance of times between drug-switches and the number of simultaneous drugs in relation to typical timescales for drug resistance development. We also explore realistic scenarios where therapy constraints are imposed to the number of administered therapies and/or their costs, finding non-trivial optimal drug-switching protocols that maximize the time before antimicrobial resistance develops while reducing therapy costs.</description>

      <title>Mixing small proteins with lipids and cholesterol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many ternary mixtures composed of saturated and unsaturated lipids with cholesterol (Chol) exhibit a region of coexistence between liquid-disordered $(L_d)$ and liquid-ordered $(L_o)$ domains, bearing some similarities to lipid rafts in biological membranes. However, biological rafts also contain many proteins that interact with the lipids and modify the distribution of lipids. Here, we extend a previously published lattice model of ternary DPPC/DOPC/Chol mixtures by introducing a small amount of small proteins (peptides). We use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the mixing phase behavior of the components as a function of the interaction parameter representing the affinity between the proteins and the saturated DPPC chains, and for different mixture compositions. At moderate fractions of DPPC, the system is in a two-phase $L_d+L_o$ coexistence, and the proteins exhibit a simple partition behavior between the phases that depends on the protein-lipid affinity parameter. At low DPPC compositions, the mixture is in $L_d$ phase with local nanoscopic ordered domains. Addition of proteins with sufficiently strong attraction to the saturated lipids can induce the separation of a distinct $L_o$ large domain with tightly-packed gel-like clusters of proteins and saturated lipids. Consistent with the theory of phase transitions, we observe that the domain sizes grow when the mixture composition is in the vicinity of the critical point. Our simulations show that the addition of a small amount of proteins to such mixtures can cause their size to grow even further, and lead to the formation of metastable dynamic $L_o$ domains with sizes comparable to biological rafts.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Causal Models of Time-Varying Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for modelling time-varying connectivity in neuroimaging data, focusing on the slow fluctuations in synaptic efficacy that mediate neuronal dynamics. Building on the framework of Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM), we propose a method that incorporates temporal basis functions into neural models, allowing for the explicit representation of slow parameter changes. This approach balances expressivity and computational efficiency by modelling these fluctuations as a Gaussian process, offering a middle ground between existing methods that either strongly constrain or excessively relax parameter fluctuations. We validate the ensuing model through simulations and real data from an auditory roving oddball paradigm, demonstrating its potential to explain key aspects of brain dynamics. This work aims to equip researchers with a robust tool for investigating time-varying connectivity, particularly in the context of synaptic modulation and its role in both healthy and pathological brain function.</description>

      <title>Full Identification of a Growing and Branching Network's Spatio-Temporal Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimentally monitoring the kinematics of branching network growth is a tricky task, given the complexity of the structures generated in three dimensions. One option is to drive the network in such a way as to obtain two-dimensional growth, enabling a collection of independent images to be obtained. The density of the network generates ambiguous structures, such as overlaps and meetings, which hinder the reconstruction of the chronology of connections. In this paper, we propose a general method for global network reconstruction. Each network connection is defined by a unique label, enabling it to be tracked in time and space. In this work, we distinguish between lateral and apical branches on the one hand, and extremities on the other. Finally, we reconstruct the network after identifying and eliminating overlaps. This method is then applied to the model filamentous fungus Podospora anserina to reconstruct its growing thallus. We derive criteria for differentiating between apical and lateral branches. We find that the outer ring is favorably composed of apical branches, while densification within the network comes from lateral branches. From this, we derive the specific dynamics of each of the two types. Finally, in the absence of any latency phase during growth initiation, we can reconstruct a time based on the equality of apical and lateral branching collections. This makes it possible to directly compare the growth dynamics of different thalli.</description>

      <title>Error Thresholds in Presence of Epistatic Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models for viral populations with high replication error rates (such as RNA viruses) rely on the quasispecies concept, in which mutational pressure beyond the so-called "Error Threshold" leads to a loss of essential genetic information and population collapse, an effect known as the "Error Catastrophe". We explain how crossing this threshold, as a result of increasing mutation rates, can be understood as a second order phase transition, even in the presence of lethal mutations. In particular, we show that, in fitness landscapes with a single peak, this collapse is equivalent to a ferro-paramagnetic transition, where the back-mutation rate plays the role of the external magnetic field. We then generalize this framework to rugged fitness landscapes, like the ones that arise from epistatic interactions, and provide numerical evidence that there is a transition from a high average fitness regime to a low average fitness one, similarly to single-peaked landscapes. The onset of the transition is heralded by a sudden change in the susceptibility to variations in the mutation rate. We use insight from Replica Symmetry Breaking mechanisms in spin glasses, in particular by considering the fluctuations of the genotype similarity distribution as the order parameter.</description>

Abstract: We present an implementation of the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method for periodic systems using GPU accelerated QM methods, a distributed multipole formulation of the electrostatics, and a pseudo-bond treatment of the QM/MM boundary. We demonstrate that our method has well-controlled errors, stable self-consistent QM convergence, and energy-conserving dynamics. We further describe an application to the catalytic kinetics of chorismate mutase. Using an accurate hybrid functional reparametrized to coupled cluster energetics, our QM/MM simulations highlight the sensitivity in the calculated rate to the choice of quantum method, quantum region selection, and local protein conformation. Our work is provided through the open-source \textsc{PySCF} package using acceleration from the \textsc{GPU4PySCF} module.</description>

Abstract: The ability to quantify the directional flow of information is vital to understanding natural systems and designing engineered information-processing systems. A widely used measure to quantify this information flow is the transfer entropy. However, until now, this quantity could only be obtained in dynamical models using approximations that are typically uncontrolled. Here we introduce a computational algorithm called Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), which makes it possible, for the first time, to quantify the transfer entropy and its variants exactly for any stochastic model, including those with multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. By leveraging techniques from polymer and path sampling, TE-PWS efficiently computes the transfer entropy as a Monte-Carlo average over signal trajectory space. We apply TE-PWS to linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of the data processing inequality in the presence of feedback.</description>

Abstract: Purpose: To identify the predominant source of the $T_1$ variability described in the literature, which ranges from 0.6-1.1 s for brain white matter at 3 T.
  Methods: 25 $T_1$-mapping methods from the literature were simulated with a mono-exponential and various magnetization-transfer (MT) models, each followed by mono-exponential fitting. A single set of model parameters was assumed for the simulation of all methods, and these parameters were estimated by fitting the simulation based to the corresponding literature $T_1$ values of white matter at 3 T. In vivo MT parameter maps were further used to synthesize MR images for 3 $T_1$-mapping methods. A mono-exponential model was fitted to the synthesized and corresponding experimental MR images.
  Results: Mono-exponential simulations suggest good inter-method reproducibility and fail to explain the highly variable $T_1$ estimates in the literature. In contrast, MT simulations suggest that a mono-exponential fit results in a variable $T_1$ and explain up to 62% of the literature's variability. In our own in vivo experiments, MT explains 70% of the observed variability.
  Conclusion: The results suggest that a mono-exponential model does not adequately describe longitudinal relaxation in biological tissue. Therefore, $T_1$ in biological tissue should be considered only a semi-quantitative metric that is inherently contingent upon the imaging methodology; and comparisons between different $T_1$-mapping methods and the use of simplistic spin systems - such as doped-water phantoms - for validation should be viewed with caution.</description>
