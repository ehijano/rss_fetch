      <title>Bayesian Learning for Pilot Decontamination in Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pilot contamination (PC) arises when the pilot sequences assigned to user equipments (UEs) are not mutually orthogonal, eventually due to their reuse. In this work, we propose a novel expectation propagation (EP)-based joint channel estimation and data detection (JCD) algorithm specifically designed to mitigate the effects of PC in the uplink of cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-MaMIMO) systems. This modified bilinear-EP algorithm is distributed, scalable, demonstrates strong robustness to PC, and outperforms state-of-the-art Bayesian learning algorithms. Through a comprehensive performance evaluation, we assess the performance of Bayesian learning algorithms for different pilot sequences and observe that the use of non-orthogonal pilots can lead to better performance compared to shared orthogonal sequences. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce a new metric to quantify PC at the UE level. We show that the performance of the considered algorithms degrades monotonically with respect to this metric, providing a valuable theoretical and practical tool for understanding and managing PC via iterative JCD algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Law of Emergence: Maximum Causal Power at the Mesoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems universally exhibit emergence, where macroscopic dynamics arise from local interactions, but a predictive law governing this process has been absent. We establish and verify such a law. We define a system's causal power at a spatial scale, $\ell$, as its Effective Information (EI$_\ell$), measured by the mutual information between a targeted, maximum-entropy intervention and its outcome. From this, we derive and prove a Middle-Scale Peak Theorem: for a broad class of systems with local interactions, EI$_\ell$ is not monotonic but exhibits a strict maximum at a mesoscopic scale $\ell^*$. This peak is a necessary consequence of a fundamental trade-off between noise-averaging at small scales and locality-limited response at large scales. We provide quantitative, reproducible evidence for this law in two distinct domains: a 2D Ising model near criticality and a model of agent-based collective behavior. In both systems, the predicted unimodal peak is decisively confirmed by statistical model selection. Our work establishes a falsifiable, first-principles law that identifies the natural scale of emergence, providing a quantitative foundation for the discovery of effective theories.</description>

      <title>Cylindrical RIS-Assisted Low-Complexity Transmission with Differentiated Visible Regions Exploiting Statistical CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), recognized as a critical enabler for 6G networks, exhibit unprecedented capabilities in electromagnetic wave manipulation and wireless channel reconfiguration. By leveraging existing network infrastructure, RIS can cost-effectively create signal hotspots in low-altitude environments, ensuring robust connectivity to support the sustainable development of the low-altitude economy. However, achieving optimal phase shift design in multi-user scenarios faces two major challenges: the high-dimensional optimization introduced by massive RIS elements, and the persistent coupling of multi-user signals caused by shared RIS reflections. This paper utilize the visible region of an RIS arranged as the uniform cylindrical array (UCA) to reduce the complexity of phase shift design. Under the UCA architecture, RIS elements are categorized into two types: user-specific units and multi-user shared units. We then determine the optimal phase shifts by iteratively optimizing the phase shifts of multi-user shared units while directly configuring those of user-specific units based on a derived closed-form solution. The proposed approach significantly reduces optimization complexity, which is further corroborated by numerical simulation results demonstrating its substantial impact on both system performance and computational efficiency compared to the conventional RIS with uniform planar array.</description>

      <title>Age of Semantic Information-Aware Wireless Transmission for Remote Monitoring Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication is emerging as an effective means of facilitating intelligent and context-aware communication for next-generation communication systems. In this paper, we propose a novel metric called Age of Incorrect Semantics (AoIS) for the transmission of video frames over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels in a monitoring system. Different from the conventional age-based approaches, we jointly consider the information freshness and the semantic importance, and then formulate a time-averaged AoIS minimization problem by jointly optimizing the semantic actuation indicator, transceiver beamformer, and the semantic symbol design. We first transform the original problem into a low-complexity problem via the Lyapunov optimization. Then, we decompose the transformed problem into multiple subproblems and adopt the alternative optimization (AO) method to solve each subproblem. Specifically, we propose two efficient algorithms, i.e., the successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm and the low-complexity zero-forcing (ZF) algorithm for optimizing transceiver beamformer. We adopt exhaustive search methods to solve the semantic actuation policy indicator optimization problem and the transmitted semantic symbol design problem. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can preserve more than 50\% of the original information under the same AoIS compared to the constrained baselines.</description>

      <title>The extended code for a class of generalized Roth-Lempel codes and their properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we all know, many interesting and important codes are obtained by modifying or combining existing codes. In this paper, we focus on generalized Roth-Lempel (in short, GRL) codes and define a class of extended codes, i.e., the extended generalized Roth-Lempel (in short, EGRL) code. And then for a special class of EGRL codes, we give a parity-check matrix and establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the EGRL code or its dual code to be MDS or AMDS, respectively. Finally, we construct a class of NMDS EGRL codes which is the generalization of the constructions given by Han et al. in 2023, and then completely determine its weight distribution.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Improvements to List Decoding of Folded Reed-Solomon Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Folded Reed-Solomon (FRS) codes are a well-studied family of codes, known for achieving list decoding capacity. In this work, we give improved deterministic and randomized algorithms for list decoding FRS codes of rate $R$ up to radius $1-R-\varepsilon$.
  We present a deterministic decoder that runs in near-linear time $\widetilde{O}_{\varepsilon}(n)$, improving upon the best-known runtime $n^{\Omega(1/\varepsilon)}$ for decoding FRS codes. Prior to our work, no capacity achieving code was known whose deterministic decoding could be done in time $\widetilde{O}_{\varepsilon}(n)$.
  We also present a randomized decoder that runs in fully polynomial time $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon) \cdot \widetilde{O}(n)$, improving the best-known runtime $\mathrm{exp}(1/\varepsilon)\cdot \widetilde{O}(n)$ for decoding FRS codes. Again, prior to our work, no capacity achieving code was known whose decoding time depended polynomially on $1/\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Deep Semantic Inference over the Air: An Efficient Task-Oriented Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empowered by deep learning, semantic communication marks a paradigm shift from transmitting raw data to conveying task-relevant meaning, enabling more efficient and intelligent wireless systems. In this study, we explore a deep learning-based task-oriented communication framework that jointly considers classification performance, computational latency, and communication cost. We adopt ResNets-based models and evaluate them on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets to simulate real-world classification tasks in wireless environments. We partition the model at various points to simulate split inference across a wireless channel. By varying the split location and the size of the transmitted semantic feature vector, we systematically analyze the trade-offs between task accuracy and resource efficiency. Experimental results show that, with appropriate model partitioning and semantic feature compression, the system can retain over 85\% of baseline accuracy while significantly reducing both computational load and communication overhead.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Fairness with A Bounded Statistical Parity Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an information-theoretic problem of designing a fair representation that attains bounded statistical (demographic) parity. More specifically, an agent uses some useful data $X$ to solve a task $T$. Since both $X$ and $T$ are correlated with some sensitive attribute or secret $S$, the agent designs a representation $Y$ that satisfies a bounded statistical parity and/or privacy leakage constraint, that is, such that $I(Y;S) \leq \epsilon$. Here, we relax the perfect demographic (statistical) parity and consider a bounded-parity constraint. In this work, we design the representation $Y$ that maximizes the mutual information $I(Y;T)$ about the task while satisfying a bounded compression (or encoding rate) constraint, that is, ensuring that $I(Y;X) \leq r$. Simultaneously, $Y$ satisfies the bounded statistical parity constraint $I(Y;S) \leq \epsilon$. To design $Y$, we use extended versions of the Functional Representation Lemma and the Strong Functional Representation Lemma which are based on randomization techniques and study the tightness of the obtained bounds in special cases. The main idea to derive the lower bounds is to use randomization over useful data $X$ or sensitive data $S$. Considering perfect demographic parity, i.e., $\epsilon=0$, we improve the existing results (lower bounds) by using a tighter version of the Strong Functional Representation Lemma and propose new upper bounds. We then propose upper and lower bounds for the main problem and show that allowing non-zero leakage can improve the attained utility. Finally, we study the bounds and compare them in a numerical example. The problem studied in this paper can also be interpreted as one of code design with bounded leakage and bounded rate privacy considering the sensitive attribute as a secret.</description>

      <title>Research on GEO SA-Bi SAR Imaging based on Joint Radar-Communications Waveform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint radar-communications (JRC) technology has attracted massive attention for decades, since it can effectively utilize allocated spectral resources by sharing frequency bands in increasingly crowded environments. In addition, the growing demand for hardware platform sharing which benefits both functionalities motivates more cooperation between radar and communication systems. In order to achieve the coexistence of sensing and communicating operations, joint systems should be designed to perform both tasks simultaneously. Developing a joint radar-communications waveform which is suitable for both functions is extremely crucial for this type of co-design, as it not only decreases spectral impact, but also benefits performances of both systems mutually. In this paper, a joint radar-communications waveform is utilized to perform GEO SA-Bi SAR imaging and wireless communication simultaneously. We also design a joint radar-communications receiver in this context to demonstrate feasibility of achieving both sensing and signaling with GEO SA-Bi SAR system.</description>

      <title>On Balancing Sparsity with Reliable Connectivity in Distributed Network Design with Random K-out Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In several applications in distributed systems, an important design criterion is ensuring that the network is sparse, i.e., does not contain too many edges, while achieving reliable connectivity. Sparsity ensures communication overhead remains low, while reliable connectivity is tied to reliable communication and inference on decentralized data reservoirs and computational resources. A class of network models called random K-out graphs appear widely as a heuristic to balance connectivity and sparsity, especially in settings with limited trust, e.g., privacy-preserving aggregation of networked data in which networks are deployed. However, several questions remain regarding how to choose network parameters in response to different operational requirements, including the need to go beyond asymptotic results and the ability to model the stochastic and adversarial environments. To address this gap, we present theorems to inform the choice of network parameters that guarantee reliable connectivity in regimes where nodes can be finite or unreliable. We first derive upper and lower bounds for probability of connectivity in random K-out graphs when the number of nodes is finite. Next, we analyze the property of r-robustness, a stronger notion than connectivity that enables resilient consensus in the presence of malicious nodes. Finally, motivated by aggregation mechanisms based on pairwise masking, we model and analyze the impact of a subset of adversarial nodes, modeled as deletions, on connectivity and giant component size - metrics that are closely tied to privacy guarantees. Together, our results pave the way for end-to-end performance guarantees for a suite of algorithms for reliable inference on networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Jacobi polynomial generalizations of several classical invariants in coding theory over finite fields, specifically, the higher and extended weight enumerators, and we establish explicit correspondences between the resulting Jacobi polynomials. Moreover, we present the Jacobi analogue of MacWilliams identity for both higher and extended weight enumerators. We also present that the higher Jacobi polynomials for linear codes whose subcode supports form $t$-designs can be uniquely determined from the higher weight enumerators of the codes via polarization technique. Finally, we demonstrate how higher Jacobi polynomials can be computed from harmonic higher weight enumerators with the help of Hahn polynomials.</description>

      <title>The linear programming optimum for packings in classical association schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Association schemes are central objects in algebraic combinatorics, with the classical schemes lying at their core. These classical association schemes essentially consist of the Hamming and Johnson schemes, and their $q$-analogs: bilinear forms scheme, alternating bilinear forms scheme, Hermitian forms scheme, $q$-Johnson scheme, and polar space schemes. Each of them gives rise to a distance-regular graph on a vertex set $X$, naturally endowed with the path metric. We study $d$-codes in these schemes, that is, subsets $Y$ of $X$ in which every pair of distinct elements has path distance at least $d$. A powerful tool for deriving upper bounds on the size of $d$-codes is the linear programming method. In the case of the Hamming and Johnson schemes, the linear program has been studied since the 1970s, but its optimum is still unknown. We determine the optimum of the linear program for nearly all classical association schemes distinct from the Hamming and Johnson schemes. This is achieved by constructing feasible solutions to both the primal and dual linear programs whose objective values coincide. As a corollary, we obtain upper bounds on $t$-intersecting sets in classical association schemes, providing new proofs of several known results and, in particular, improving earlier bounds on $t$-intersecting sets of generators in polar spaces. These results can be viewed as analogs of the classical Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado Theorem in extremal set theory. Our proofs draw on techniques from algebraic combinatorics and the duality theory of linear programming.</description>

      <title>Generalized quantum Chernoff bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a generalized quantum Chernoff bound for the discrimination of multiple sets of quantum states, thereby extending the classical and quantum Chernoff bounds to the general setting of composite and correlated quantum hypotheses. Specifically, we consider the task of distinguishing whether a quantum system is prepared in a state from one of several convex, compact sets of quantum states, each of which may exhibit arbitrary correlations. Assuming their stability under tensor product, we prove that the optimal error exponent for discrimination is precisely given by the regularized quantum Chernoff divergence between the sets. Furthermore, leveraging minimax theorems, we show that discriminating between sets of quantum states is no harder than discriminating between their worst-case elements in terms of error probability. This implies the existence of a universal optimal test that achieves the minimum error probability for all states in the sets, matching the performance of the optimal test for the most challenging states. We provide explicit characterizations of the universal optimal test in the binary composite case. Finally, we show that the maximum overlap between a pure state and a set of free states, a quantity that frequently arises in quantum resource theories, is equal to the quantum Chernoff divergence between the sets, thereby providing an operational interpretation of this quantity in the context of symmetric hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Error exponents of quantum state discrimination with composite correlated hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the error exponents in quantum hypothesis testing between two sets of quantum states, extending the analysis beyond the independent and identically distributed case to encompass composite and correlated hypotheses. We introduce and compare two natural extensions of the quantum Hoeffding divergence and anti-divergence to sets of quantum states, establishing their equivalence or quantitative relationships. Our main results generalize the quantum Hoeffding bound to stable sequences of convex, compact sets of quantum states, demonstrating that the optimal type-I error exponent, under an exponential constraint on the type-II error, is precisely characterized by the regularized quantum Hoeffding divergence between the sets. In the strong converse regime, we provide a lower bound on the exponent in terms of the regularized quantum Hoeffding anti-divergence. These findings refine the generalized quantum Stein's lemma and yield a detailed understanding of the trade-off between type-I and type-II errors in discrimination with composite correlated hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Fed-DPRoC:Communication-Efficient Differentially Private and Robust Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Fed-DPRoC, a novel federated learning framework that simultaneously ensures differential privacy (DP), Byzantine robustness, and communication efficiency. We introduce the concept of robust-compatible compression, which enables users to compress DP-protected updates while maintaining the robustness of the aggregation rule. We instantiate our framework as RobAJoL, combining the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) transform for compression with robust averaging for robust aggregation. We theoretically prove the compatibility of JL transform with robust averaging and show that RobAJoL preserves robustness guarantees, ensures DP, and reduces communication cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion MNIST validate our theoretical claims and demonstrate that RobAJoL outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness and utility under different Byzantine attacks.</description>

      <title>Outlier Detection of Poisson-Distributed Targets Using a Seabed Sensor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for classifying and detecting spatial commission outliers in maritime environments using seabed acoustic sensor networks and log Gaussian Cox processes (LGCPs). By modeling target arrivals as a mixture of normal and outlier processes, we estimate the probability that a newly observed event is an outlier. We propose a second-order approximation of this probability that incorporates both the mean and variance of the normal intensity function, providing improved classification accuracy compared to mean-only approaches. We analytically show that our method yields a tighter bound to the true probability using Jensen's inequality. To enhance detection, we integrate a real-time, near-optimal sensor placement strategy that dynamically adjusts sensor locations based on the evolving outlier intensity. The proposed framework is validated using real ship traffic data near Norfolk, Virginia, where numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving both classification performance and outlier detection through sensor deployment.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Coding over General Noisy Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified one-shot coding framework designed for the communication and compression of messages among multiple nodes across a general acyclic noisy network. Our setting can be seen as a one-shot version of the acyclic discrete memoryless network studied by Lee and Chung, and noisy network coding studied by Lim, Kim, El Gamal and Chung. We design a proof technique, called the exponential process refinement lemma, that is rooted in the Poisson matching lemma by Li and Anantharam, and can significantly simplify the analyses of one-shot coding over multi-hop networks. Our one-shot coding theorem not only recovers a wide range of existing asymptotic results, but also yields novel one-shot achievability results in different multi-hop network information theory problems, such as compress-and-forward and partial-decode-and-forward bounds for a one-shot (primitive) relay channel, and a bound for one-shot cascade multiterminal source coding. In a broader context, our framework provides a unified one-shot bound applicable to any combination of source coding, channel coding and coding for computing problems.</description>

      <title>A transversality theorem for semi-algebraic sets with application to signal recovery from the second moment and cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-algebraic priors are ubiquitous in signal processing and machine learning. Prevalent examples include a) linear models where the signal lies in a low-dimensional subspace; b) sparse models where the signal can be represented by only a few coefficients under a suitable basis; and c) a large family of neural network generative models. In this paper, we prove a transversality theorem for semi-algebraic sets in orthogonal or unitary representations of groups: with a suitable dimension bound, a generic translate of any semi-algebraic set is transverse to the orbits of the group action. This, in turn, implies that if a signal lies in a low-dimensional semi-algebraic set, then it can be recovered uniquely from measurements that separate orbits.
  As an application, we consider the implications of the transversality theorem to the problem of recovering signals that are translated by random group actions from their second moment. As a special case, we discuss cryo-EM: a leading technology to constitute the spatial structure of biological molecules, which serves as our prime motivation. In particular, we derive explicit bounds for recovering a molecular structure from the second moment under a semi-algebraic prior and deduce information-theoretic implications. We also obtain information-theoretic bounds for three additional applications: factoring Gram matrices, multi-reference alignment, and phase retrieval. Finally, we deduce bounds for designing permutation invariant separators in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Region-Specific Coarse Quantization with Check Node Awareness in 5G LDPC Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14233v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents novel techniques for improving the error correction performance and reducing the complexity of coarsely quantized 5G-LDPC decoders. The proposed decoder design supports arbitrary message-passing schedules on a base-matrix level by modeling exchanged messages with entry-specific discrete random variables. Variable nodes (VNs) and check nodes (CNs) involve compression operations designed using the information bottleneck method to maximize preserved mutual information between code bits and quantized messages. We introduce alignment regions that assign the messages to groups with aligned reliability levels to decrease the number of individual design parameters. Group compositions with degree-specific separation of messages improve performance by up to 0.4 dB. Further, we generalize our recently proposed CN-aware quantizer design to irregular LDPC codes and layered schedules. The method optimizes the VN quantizer to maximize preserved mutual information at the output of the subsequent CN update, enhancing performance by up to 0.2 dB. A schedule optimization modifies the order of layer updates, reducing the average iteration count by up to 35%. We integrate all new techniques in a rate-compatible decoder design by extending the alignment regions along a rate-dimension. Our complexity analysis shows that 2-bit decoding can double the area efficiency over 4-bit decoding at comparable performance.</description>

      <title>Communicate Less, Synthesize the Rest: Latency-aware Intent-based Generative Semantic Multicasting with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have recently shown great success in synthesizing multimedia signals with high perceptual quality, enabling highly efficient semantic communications in future wireless networks. In this paper, we develop an intent-aware generative semantic multicasting framework utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. In the proposed framework, the transmitter decomposes the source signal into multiple semantic classes based on the multi-user intent, i.e. each user is assumed to be interested in details of only a subset of the semantic classes. To better utilize the wireless resources, the transmitter sends to each user only its intended classes, and multicasts a highly compressed semantic map to all users over shared wireless resources that allows them to locally synthesize the other classes, namely non-intended classes, utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. The signal retrieved at each user is thereby partially reconstructed and partially synthesized utilizing the received semantic map. We design a communication/computation-aware scheme for per-class adaptation of the communication parameters, such as the transmission power and compression rate, to minimize the total latency of retrieving signals at multiple receivers, tailored to the prevailing channel conditions as well as the users' reconstruction/synthesis distortion/perception requirements. The simulation results demonstrate significantly reduced per-user latency compared with non-generative and intent-unaware multicasting benchmarks while maintaining high perceptual quality of the signals retrieved at the users.</description>

      <title>On Noncoherent Multiple-Antenna Rayleigh Block-Fading Channels at Finite Blocklength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the maximum coding rate at which data can be transmitted over a noncoherent, multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) Rayleigh block-fading channel using an error-correcting code of a given blocklength with a block-error probability not exceeding a given value. A high-SNR normal approximation is derived that becomes accurate as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the number of coherence intervals over which we code tend to infinity. The obtained normal approximation complements the nonasymptotic bounds that have appeared in the literature, but whose evaluation is computationally demanding. It further lays the theoretical foundation for an analytical analysis of the fundamental tradeoff between diversity, multiplexing, and channel-estimation cost at finite blocklength and finite SNR.</description>

      <title>Rack-Aware MSR Codes with Linear Field Size and Smaller Sub-Packetization for Tolerating Multiple Erasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an $(n,k,d)$ rack-aware storage model, the system consists of $n$ nodes uniformly distributed across $\bar{n}$ successive racks, such that each rack contains $u$ nodes of equal capacity and the reconstructive degree satisfies $k=\bar{k}u+v$ where $0\leq v\leq u-1$. Suppose there are $h\geq1$ failed nodes in a rack (called the host rack). Then together with its surviving nodes, the host rack downloads recovery data from $\bar{d}$ helper racks and repairs its failed nodes. In this paper, we focus on studying the rack-aware minimum storage generating (MSR) codes for repairing $h$ failed nodes within the same rack. By using the coupled-layer construction with the alignment technique, we construct the first class of rack-aware MSR codes for all $\bar{k}+1\leq\bar{d}\leq\bar{n}-1$ which achieve the small sub-packetization $l=\bar{s}^{\lceil\bar{n}/\bar{s}\rceil}$ where the field size $q$ increases linearly with $n$ and $\bar{s}=\bar{d}-\bar{k}+1$. In addition, these codes achieve optimal repair bandwidth for $1\leq h\leq u-v$, and asymptotically optimal repair bandwidth for $u-v+1\leq h\leq u$. In particular, they achieve optimal access when $h=u-v$. It is worth noting that the existing rack-aware MSR codes which achieve the same sub-packetization $l=\bar{s}^{\lceil\bar{n}/\bar{s}\rceil}$ are only known for the special case of $\bar{d}=\bar{n}-1$, $h=1$, and the field size is much larger than ours. Then, based on our first construction we further develop another class of explicit rack-aware MSR codes with even smaller sub-packetization $l=\bar{s}^{\lceil\bar{n}/(\bar{s}+1)\rceil}$ for all admissible values of $\bar{d}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function $h_x(\alpha)$, which then allows using computable complexity proxies. We establish a mathematical analogy between information-theoretic constructs and statistical mechanics, introducing a suitable partition function and free energy functional. We explicitly prove the Legendre-Fenchel duality between the structure function and free energy, showing detailed balance of the Metropolis kernel, and interpret acceptance probabilities as information-theoretic scattering amplitudes. A susceptibility-like variance of model complexity is shown to peak precisely at loss-complexity trade-offs interpreted as phase transitions. Practical experiments with linear and tree-based regression models verify these theoretical predictions, explicitly demonstrating the interplay between the model complexity, generalization, and overfitting threshold.</description>

      <title>Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Z-Score Gradient Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02369v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve high performance across many domains but can still face challenges in generalization when optimization is influenced by small or noisy gradient components. Sharpness-Aware Minimization improves generalization by perturbing parameters toward directions of high curvature, but it uses the entire gradient vector, which means that small or noisy components may affect the ascent step and cause the optimizer to miss optimal solutions. We propose Z-Score Filtered Sharpness-Aware Minimization, which applies Z-score based filtering to gradients in each layer. Instead of using all gradient components, a mask is constructed to retain only the top percentile with the largest absolute Z-scores. The percentile threshold $Q_p$ determines how many components are kept, so that the ascent step focuses on directions that stand out most compared to the average of the layer. This selective perturbation refines the search toward flatter minima while reducing the influence of less significant gradients. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with architectures including ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that the proposed method consistently improves test accuracy compared to Sharpness-Aware Minimization and its variants.</description>

      <title>Estimating Reliability of Electric Vehicle Charging Ecosystem using the Principle of Maximum Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of estimating the reliability of an Electric Vehicle (EV) charging systems when facing risks such as overheating, unpredictable, weather, and cyberattacks. Traditional methods for predicting failures often rely on past data or limiting assumptions, making them ineffective for new or less common threats that results in failure. To solve this issue, we utilize the Principle of Maximum Entropy (PME), a statistical tool that estimates risks even with limited information. PME works by balancing known constraints to create an unbiased predictions without guessing missing details. Using the EV charging ecosystem as a case study, we show how PME models stress factors responsible for failure. Our findings reveal a critical insight: even minor, localized stress events can trigger disproportionately large drops in overall system reliability, similar to a domino effect. The our PME model demonstrates how high-impact components, such as the power grid, are more likely to fail as stress accumulates, creating network-wide tipping points. Beyond EVs, this approach applies to any complex system with incomplete data, such as smart grids, healthcare devices, or logistics networks. By mathematically establishing an inverse relationship between uncertainty (entropy) and reliability, our work quantifies how greater system unpredictability directly degrades robustness. This offers a universal tool to improve decision-making under unpredictable conditions. This work bridges advanced mathematics with real-world engineering, providing actionable insights for policymakers and industries to build safer, more efficient systems in our increasingly connected world.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Remote Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a remote inference system with multiple modalities, where a multimodal machine learning (ML) model performs real-time inference using features collected from remote sensors. When sensor observations evolve dynamically over time, fresh features are critical for inference tasks. However, timely delivery of features from all modalities is often infeasible because of limited network resources. Towards this end, in this paper, we study a two-modality scheduling problem that seeks to minimize the ML model's inference error, expressed as a penalty function of the Age of Information (AoI) vector of the two modalities. We develop an index-based threshold policy and prove its optimality. Specifically, the scheduler switches to the other modality once the current modality's index function exceeds a predetermined threshold. We show that both modalities share the same threshold and that the index functions and the threshold can be computed efficiently. Our optimality results hold for general AoI functions (which could be non-monotonic and non-separable) and heterogeneous transmission times across modalities. To demonstrate the importance of considering a task-oriented AoI function, we conduct numerical experiments based on robot state prediction and compare our policy with round-robin and uniform random policies (both are oblivious to the AoI and the inference error).n The results show that our policy reduces inference error by up to 55% compared with these baselines.</description>
