      <title>The combinatorial geometry of particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in the study of scattering amplitudes have uncovered profound and unexpected connections with combinatorial geometry. These connections range from classical structures -- such as polytopes, matroids, and Grassmannians -- to more modern developments including positroid varieties and the amplituhedron. Together they point toward the unifying framework of positive geometry, in which geometric domains canonically determine analytic functions governing scattering processes. This survey traces the emergence of positive geometry from the physics of amplitudes, building towards recent progress on amplitudes for matroids.</description>

      <title>Explicit construction of infinite families of strongly regular digraphs with parameters $((v+(2^{n+1}-4)t)2^{n-1}, k+(2^n-2)t, t, \lambda, t)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An explicit construction of infinite sequences of strongly regular digraphs with parameter sets $((v+(2^{n+1}-4)t)2^{n-1}, k+(2^n-2)t, t, \lambda, t)$ is described. A computer program was used to find the initial digraphs. The remaining terms of the sequence are obtained by the constructed recurrence. Using the described approach, 11 families of strongly regular digraphs were found. In particular, these families contain digraphs $\text{dsrg}(72, 18, 5, 3, 5)$, $\text{dsrg}(76, 19, 5, 4, 5)$, $\text{dsrg}(92, 23, 6, 5, 6)$ and $\text{dsrg}(104, 26, 7, 5, 7)$, the question of the existence of which was previously open.</description>

      <title>A degree sum condition for the existence of a quasi 5-contractible edge in a quasi 5-connected graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge of a quasi $k$-connected graph is said to be quasi $k$-contractible if the contraction of the edge results in a quasi $k$-connected graph. We show that every 5-connected graph contains a quasi 5-contractible edge. Furthermore, we prove that a quasi 5-connected graph possesses a quasi 5-contractible edge, if the degree sum of any two vertices with distance at most two is at least 9. This result strengthens a theorem proved by Kriesell when $k=4$ (M. Kriesell, A degree sum condition for the existence of a contractible edge in a $k$-connected graph, J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 82(2001)81-101).</description>

      <title>Signless Laplacian characterization of cones over disjoint unions of cycles, edges and isolated vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two graphs are said to be $Q$-cospectral if they share the same signless Laplacian spectrum. A simple graph is said to be determined by its signless Laplacian spectrum (abbreviated as DQS) if there exists no other non-isomorphic simple graph with the same signless Laplacian spectrum. In this paper, we establish the following results:
  (1) Let$G \cong K_{1} \vee \bigl(C_{k} \cup qK_{2} \cup sK_{1}\bigr),$ with $q,s \geq 1$, $k \geq 4$, and at least $21$ vertices. If $k$ is odd, then $G$ is DQS. Moreover, if $k$ is even and $F$ is $Q$-cospectral with $G$, then $$F \cong G \quad \text{or} \quad F \cong K_{1} \vee \bigl(C_{4} \cup P_{k-3} \cup P_{3} \cup (q-2)K_{2} \cup sK_{1}\bigr).$$
  (2) Let $G\cong K_1\vee (C_{k_1}\cup C_{k_2}\cup\cdots \cup C_{k_t}\cup qK_2\cup sK_1)$ with $t\ge 2$, $q,s\ge 1$, $k_i\ge 4$ and at least $33$ vertices. If each $k_i$ is odd, then $G$ is DQS.
  (3) The graph $K_{1} \vee \bigl(C_{3} \cup C_{k_{1}} \cup C_{k_{2}} \cup \cdots \cup C_{k_{t-1}} \cup qK_{2} \cup sK_{1}\bigr),$ with $t,q,s \geq 1$ and $k_{i} \geq 3$, is not DQS. Moreover, it is $Q$-cospectral with $K_{1} \vee \bigl(K_{1,3} \cup C_{k_{1}} \cup C_{k_{2}} \cup \cdots \cup C_{k_{t-1}} \cup qK_{2} \cup (s-1)K_{1}\bigr).$
  Here $P_{n}$, $C_{n}$, $K_{n}$ and $K_{n-r,r}$ denote the path, the cycle, the complete graph and the complete bipartite graph on $n$ vertices, while $\cup$ and $\vee$ represent the disjoint union and the join of two graphs, respectively. Furthermore, the signless Laplacian spectrum of the graphs under consideration is computed explicitly.</description>

      <title>On the Anti-Ramsey Number of Spanning Linear Forests with Paths of Lengths 2 and 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge-coloring of a graph $G$ assigns a color to each edge in the edge set $E(G)$. A graph $G$ is considered to be rainbow under an edge-coloring if all of its edges have different colors. For a positive integer $n$, the anti-Ramsey number of a graph $G$, denoted as $AR(n, G)$, represents the maximum number of colors that can be used in an edge-coloring of the complete graph $K_n$ without containing a rainbow copy of $G$. This concept was introduced by Erd\H{o}s et al. in 1975. The anti-Ramsey number for the linear forest $kP_3 \cup tP_2$ has been extensively studied for two positive integers $k$ and $t$. Formulations exist for specific values of $t$ and $k$, particularly when $k \geq 2$, $t \geq \frac{k^2 - k + 4}{2}$, and $n \geq 3k + 2t + 1$. In this work, we present the anti-Ramsey number of the linear forest $kP_3 \cup tP_2$ for the case where $k \geq 1$, $t \geq 2$, and $n = 3k + 2t$. Notably, our proof for this case does not require any specific relationship between $k$ and $t$.</description>

      <title>Sphere intersections and incidences over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We bound the number of incidences between points and spheres in finite vector spaces by bounding the sum of the number of points in the pairwise intersections of the spheres. We obtain new incidence bounds that are interesting when the number of spheres is not too large. Our approach also leads to an elementary proof of the Iosevich-Rudnev bound on the Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance problem in odd dimensions.</description>

      <title>Optimally building spanning graphs in semirandom graph processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semirandom graph process constructs a graph $G$ in a series of rounds, starting with the empty graph on $n$ vertices. In each round, a player is offered a vertex $v$ chosen uniformly at random, and chooses an edge on $v$ to add to $G$. The player's aim is to make $G$ satisfy some property as quickly as possible. Our interest is in the property that $G$ contain a given $n$-vertex graph $H$ with maximum degree $\Delta$. In 2021, Ben-Eliezer, Gishboliner, Hefetz and Krivelevich showed that there is a semirandom strategy that achieves this, with probability tending to 1 as $n$ tends to infinity, in $(1 + o_\Delta(1)) \frac{3 \Delta n}{2}$ rounds, where $o_\Delta(1)$ is a function that tends to $0$ as $\Delta$ tends to infinity. We improve this to $(1 + o_\Delta(1)) \frac{\Delta n}{2}$, which can be seen to be asymptotically optimal in $\Delta$. We show the same result for a variant of the semirandom graph process, namely the semirandom tree process introduced by Burova and Lichev, where in each round the player is offered the edge set of a uniformly chosen tree on $n$ vertices, and chooses one edge to keep.</description>

      <title>A $q$-analogue of distance matrix of bi-block graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $q$-analogue of the distance matrix, referred to as the \emph{$q$-distance matrix}, is obtained from the distance matrix by replacing each nonzero entry $\alpha$ with the sum $1+q+\cdots+q^{\alpha-1}$. This notion was introduced independently by Bapat, Lal, and Pati~\cite{Ba-Lal-Pati}, and by Yan and Yeh~\cite{Yan}. A connected graph is called a \emph{bi-block graph} if each of its blocks is a complete bipartite graph. In this paper, we derive explicit formulas for the determinant and the inverse of the $q$-distance matrix of bi-block graphs. These results both generalize the corresponding formulas for the distance matrix of bi-block graphs obtained in~\cite{Hou3} and extend the results for block graphs in~\cite{Xing} to the class of bi-block graphs.</description>

      <title>A note on the distribution of the sum of lengths of the initial longest increasing sequences in cycles of random permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S_n$ be the set of all permutations of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ and let $\sigma=(\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\ldots,\sigma_n)\in S_n$. The {\it initial longest increasing sequence} (ILIS) in $\sigma$ has length $m$ if, for $1\le m\le n-1$, $\sigma_1&lt;\sigma_2&lt;\ldots&lt;\sigma_m, \sigma_m&gt;\sigma_{m+1}$, and has length $n$ if $\sigma=(1,2,\ldots,n)$. Let $l(\sigma)$ be the length of the ILIS in $\sigma$. We assume that $\sigma$ is represented in cycle notation, so that the first number in each cycle is the minimum number of this cycle. We also assume that $\sigma$ is chosen uniformly at random from $S_n$, i.e., with probability $1/n!$. Let $C_n(\sigma)$ be the set of all cycles of $\sigma$. In [9], T. Mansour investigated enumerative properties related to lengths of the ILIS in random permutations represented by the cycle notation. In particular, he studied the sum of the ILIS' lengths defined by $s_n=\sum_{c\in C_n(\sigma)} l(c)$ and derived exact and asymptotic expressions for its expectation and variance. In this note, we supplement Mansour's results on $s_n$ with a limit theorem. We show that $s_n$, appropriately normalized, converges weakly to a standard normal random variable as $n\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>The existence of unexpected automorphisms in direct product graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pair of graphs $(\Gamma,\Sigma)$ is called unstable if their direct product $\Gamma\times\Sigma$ admits automorphisms not from $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)\times\mathrm{Aut}(\Sigma)$, and such automorphisms are said to be unexpected. The stability of a graph $\Gamma$ refers to that of $(\Gamma,K_2)$. While the stability of individual graphs has been relatively well studied, much less is known for graph pairs. In this paper, we propose a conjecture that provides the best possible reduction of the stability of a graph pair to the stability of a single graph. We prove one direction of this conjecture and establish partial results for the converse. This enables the determination of the stability of a broad class of graph pairs, with complete results when one factor is a cycle.</description>

      <title>Packing subgraphs in regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $H$-packing in a graph $G$ is a collection of pairwise vertex-disjoint copies of $H$ in $G$. We prove that for every $c &gt; 0$ and every bipartite graph $H$, any $\lfloor{cn}\rfloor$-regular graph $G$ admits an $H$-packing that covers all but a constant number of vertices. This resolves a problem posed by K\"uhn and Osthus in 2005. Moreover, our result is essentially tight: the conclusion fails if $G$ is not both regular and sufficiently dense; it is in general not possible to guarantee covering all vertices of $G$ by an $H$-packing, and if $H$ is not bipartite then $G$ need not contain any copies of $H$.
  We also prove that for all $c &gt; 0$, integers $t \geq 2$, and sufficiently large $n$, all the vertices of every $\lfloor cn \rfloor$-regular graph can be covered by vertex-disjoint subdivisions of $K_t$. This resolves another problem of K\"uhn and Osthus from 2005, which goes back to a conjecture of Verstra\"ete from 2002.
  Our proofs combine novel methods for balancing expanders and super-regular subgraphs with a number of powerful techniques including properties of robust expanders, the regularity lemma, and the blow-up lemma.</description>

      <title>Perron-Frobenius theorem for dual tensors and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Perron-Frobenius theorem of nonnegative matrices is a classical result on spectral theory of matrices, which has wide applications in many domains. In this paper, we give the Perron-Frobenius theorem for dual tensors, that is, a dual tensor with weakly irreducible nonnegative standard part has a positive dual eigenvalue with a positive dual eigenvector. We give an explicit formula for the dual part of the positive dual eigenvector by using generalized inverses of an $M$-matrix. By considering the natural correspondence between tensors (matrices) and hypergraphs (graphs), some basic properties on the positive dual eigenvalue and positive dual eigenvector of hypergraphs are obtained. As applications, we introduce dual centrality measures for vertices of graphs and hypergraphs. By introducing a dual perturbation, vertices that are tied under eigenvector centrality can be effectively distinguished. In our numerical experiments, by perturbing specific structures, we successfully differentiated vertices in regular graphs and hypergraphs that were previously indistinguishable.</description>

      <title>Ramsey numbers of long even cycles versus books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any positive integers $k$ and $n$, let $B_n^{(k)}$ be the book graph consisting of $n$ copies of the complete graph $K_{k+1}$ sharing a common $K_k$. Let $C_m$ be a cycle of length $m$. Prior work by Allen, \L uczak, Polcyn, and Zhang (2023) established the Ramsey number $R(C_{m},B_n^{(1)})$ for all sufficiently large even integer $m = \Omega(n^{9/10})$. Recently, Hu, Lin, {\L}uczak, Ning, and Peng (2025) obtained the exact value of $R(C_{m},B_n^{(2)})$ under the same asymptotic conditions. A natural problem is to determine the exact value of $R(C_{m},B_n^{(k)})$ for each fixed $k\ge3$ under similar conditions. This paper provides a complete solution to this problem. The lower bound is proved by an explicit construction, while the tight upper bound is established by analyzing the corresponding Ramsey graph using semi-random ideas.</description>

      <title>On Independent Spanning Trees in Random and Pseudorandom Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1989, Zehavi and Itai conjectured that every $k$-connected graph contains $k$ independent spanning trees rooted at any prescribed vertex $r$. That is, for each vertex $v$, the unique $r$-$v$ paths within these $k$ spanning trees are internally disjoint. This fundamental problem has received much attention, in part motivated by its applications to network reliability, but despite that has only been resolved for $k \le 4$ and certain restricted graph families.
  We establish the conjecture for almost all graphs of essentially any relevant density. Specifically, we prove that there exists a constant $C &gt; 1$ such that, with high probability, the random graph $G(n,p)$ contains $\delta(G)$ independent spanning trees rooted at any vertex whenever $C \log n/n \leq p &lt; 0.99$. Since the lower bound on $p$ coincides (up to the constant $C$) with the connectivity threshold of $G(n,p)$, this result is essentially optimal. In addition, we show that $(n,d,\lambda)$-graphs with fairly mild bounds on the spectral ratio $d/\lambda$ contain $(1-o(1))d$ independent spanning trees rooted at each vertex, thereby settling the conjecture asymptotically for random $d$-regular graphs as well.</description>

      <title>Flow polytopes for extensions of bipartite graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space of unit flows on a finite acyclic directed graph is a lattice polytope called the flow polytope of the graph. Given a bipartite graph $G$ with minimum degree at least two, we construct two associated acyclic directed graphs: the extension of $G$ and the almost-degree-whiskered graph of $G$. We prove that the normalized volume of the flow polytope for the extension of $G$ is equal to the number of matchings in the almost-degree-whiskered graph of $G$. Further, we refine this result by proving that the Ehrhart $h^*$-polynomial of the flow polytope for the extension of $G$ is equal to the unsigned matching polynomial of the almost-degree-whiskered graph of $G$.</description>

Abstract: We find the (unique) largest subset of $\{0, 1, 2\}^n$ such that it contains no two elements, one of which is coordinatewise greater than the other, but strictly greater on at most $k$ coordinates. To do so, we decompose the cube into weighted chains.

      <title>The typical algebraic shifting of a surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a statistical study of Kalai's exterior algebraic shifting, focusing on concentration phenomena for random triangulations of a fixed space. First, for a uniform $n$-vertex refinement of any given graph $G$, we show that asymptotically almost-surely (a.a.s.) its exterior algebraic shifting is an explicit shifted graph depending only on $n$ and the Betti numbers of $G$. Next, for any given compact connected Riemannian surface $S$, sample $n$ points independently at random according to the volume measure, and consider the resulted a.a.s. unique Delaunay triangulation. We prove that a.a.s. its exterior algebraic shifting is an explicit shifted complex depending only on $n$ and the genus of $S$. In both results the expected shifted complex is a homology lex-segment complex, a notion we define combinatorially and characterize numerically a l\'{a} Bj\"{o}rner-Kalai.
  As a tool to prove the result on surfaces, we prove a universality result on edge contractions: for every fixed surface triangulation $K$, every dense enough point set in the surface yields a Delaunay triangulation that edge contracts to $K$.</description>

      <title>Upper tails for homomorphism counts in sparse random hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "infamous upper tail problem" for $r$-uniform hypergraphs is to estimate the probability that the number of copies of a fixed hypergraph $H$ in a large binomial $r$-uniform hypergraph $\boldsymbol{G}$ exceeds its expectation by a constant factor. The problem was popularized by Janson and Ruci\'nski and, particularly in the case of graphs ($r=2$), has been a driving example in the development of nonlinear large deviations theory. Recent work of the first author with Dembo and Pham has accomplished the \emph{naive mean-field reduction step}, reducing the upper tail problem to an entropic variational problem on a space of weighted graphs. The latter was resolved for counts of $r$-uniform cliques and a certain linear 3-uniform hypergraph by Liu and Zhao, who also conjectured a general formula. We confirm their conjecture for other classes of hypergraphs, including complete $r$-partite $r$-graphs, tight cycles, and the Fano plane. We also prove a general large deviation upper bound for counts of $r$-graphs $H$ satisfying certain edge covering properties.</description>

      <title>Group Actions and Some Combinatorics on Words with $\mathbf{vtm}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce generalizations of powers and factor complexity via orbits of group actions. These generalizations include concepts like abelian powers and abelian complexity. It is shown that this notion of factor complexity cannot be used to recognize Sturmian words in general. Within our framework, we establish square avoidance results for the ternary squarefree Thue--Morse word $\mathbf{vtm}$. These results go beyond the usual squarefreeness of $\mathbf{vtm}$ and are proved using Walnut. Lastly, we establish a group action factor complexity formula for $\mathbf{vtm}$ that is expressed in terms of the abelian complexity of the period doubling word $\mathbf{pd}$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Embeddings of Posets in Hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite poset $\mathcal P$, the hypercube-height, denoted by $h^*(\mathcal P)$, is defined to be the largest $h$ such that, for any natural number $n$, the subsets of $[n]$ of size less than $h$ do not contain an induced copy of $\mathcal P$. The hypercube-width, denoted by $w^*(\mathcal P)$, is the smallest $w$ such that the subsets of $[w]$ of size at most $h^*(\mathcal P)$ contain an induced copy of $\mathcal P$. In other words, $h^*(\mathcal P)$ asks how `low' can a poset be embedded, and $w^*(\mathcal P)$ asks for the first hypercube in which such an `optimal' embedding occurs.
  These notions were introduced by Bastide, Groenland, Ivan and Johnston in connection to upper bounds for the poset saturation numbers. While it is not hard to see that $h^*(\mathcal P)\leq |\mathcal P|-1$ (and this bound can be tight), the hypercube-width has proved to be much more elusive. It was shown by the authors mentioned above that $w^*(\mathcal P)\leq|\mathcal P|^2/4$, but they conjectured that in fact $w^*(\mathcal P)\leq |\mathcal P|$ for any finite poset $\mathcal P$.
  In this paper we prove this conjecture. The proof uses Hall's theorem for bipartite graphs as a precision tool for modifing an existing copy of our poset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a combinatorial formula for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of nested GVZ $p$-groups, where $p$ is an odd prime. Using this formula, we derive an explicit combinatorial expression for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of all two-generator $p$-groups of class $2$. Additionally, we provide explicit combinatorial formulas for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of certain families of nested GVZ $p$-groups with arbitrarily large nilpotency class. We also classify all nested GVZ $p$-groups of order at most $p^5$ and compute the Wedderburn decomposition of their rational group algebras. Finally, we determine a complete set of primitive central idempotents for the rational group algebras of nested GVZ $p$-groups.</description>

      <title>Limit shapes for Domain-Wall (colored) vertex models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study partition functions with domain-wall like boundary conditions for path models issued from colored vertex models. These models display an arctic phenomenon, as attested by numerical simulations. We show that the colored vertex model is equivalent to a certain single-color ``colorblind" vertex model. In a special case of the weights for the colorblind touching paths, we derive the arctic curve using a bijective sliding map to non-intersecting paths, for which arctic curves were previously derived using the tangent method. The resulting arctic curves are only piecewise analytic, as in the known non-free fermion cases of Six vertex model with domain-wall boundaries and its relatives. We also prove a shear phenomenon, that some portions of the arctic curve are sheared versions of the analytic continuation of other portions, as already observed in the uniformly weighted Six and Twenty vertex models.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Bounds for Random Matrices via Zerofreeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new technique to prove bounds for the spectral radius of a random matrix, based on using Jensen's formula to establish the zerofreeness of the associated characteristic polynomial in a region of the complex plane. Our techniques are entirely non-asymptotic, and we instantiate it in three settings:
  (i) The spectral radius of non-asymptotic Girko matrices -- these are asymmetric matrices $\mathbf{M} \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$ whose entries are independent and satisfy $\mathbb{E} \mathbf{M}_{ij} = 0$ and $\mathbb{E} |\mathbf{M}_{ij}^2| \le \frac{1}{n}$.
  (ii) The spectral radius of non-asymptotic Wigner matrices -- these are symmetric matrices $\mathbf{M} \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$ whose entries above the diagonal are independent and satisfy $\mathbb{E} \mathbf{M}_{ij} = 0$, $\mathbb{E} |\mathbf{M}_{ij}^2| \le \frac{1}{n}$, and $\mathbb{E} |\mathbf{M}_{ij}^4| \le \frac{1}{n}$.
  (iii) The second eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a random $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, as drawn from the configuration model.
  In all three settings, we obtain constant-probability eigenvalue bounds that are tight up to a constant. Applied to specific random matrix ensembles, we recover classic bounds for Wigner matrices, as well as results of Bordenave--Chafa\"{i}--Garc\'{i}a-Zelada, Bordenave--Lelarge--Massouli\'{e}, and Friedman, up to constants.</description>

      <title>Metric Poincar\'e inequalities for graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article considers embeddings of bounded degree graphs into general metric spaces. Our first main result is a metric analogue of Matou\v{s}ek's extrapolation that relates the Poincar\'e constants $\gamma(G,\varrho^p)$ and $\gamma(G,\varrho^q)$ for any pair of exponents $0 &lt; p,q &lt; \infty$, any bounded degree expander graph $G$, and any metric space $\mathcal{M}=(M,\varrho)$. Our second main result provides a sharp estimate of the Poincar\'e constant $\gamma(G,\varrho)$ in terms of the cardinalities of the vertex set of $G$ and the target metric space $\mathcal{M}=(M,\varrho)$, in the setting of \textit{random} graphs. Both theorems utilize a novel structural dichotomy for metric embeddings of graphs.
  These results lead to the resolution of several problems within the theory of metric embeddings. Among the applications are estimates on the nonlinear spectral gap of metric snowflakes, optimal estimates on the minimum cardinality of (bi-Lipschitz) universal metric spaces for graphs, and sharp lower bounds on the bi-Lipschitz distortion of random regular graphs into arbitrary metric spaces of large cardinality.</description>

Abstract: The study of the structure of translational tilings has captivated mathematicians, scientists, and the general public for centuries and continues to thrive at the crossroads of analysis, combinatorics, dynamics, logic, number theory, and geometry. This vibrant field seeks to uncover the delicate divide between rigid structures and unpredictable, ``wild'' behaviors that arise when sets fill space by translations without gaps or overlaps. We provide an overview of this study and recent developments, highlighting its multidisciplinary nature and offering a glimpse into the process behind the results.</description>

      <title>Well-Quasi-Ordering Eulerian Digraphs Embeddable in Surfaces by Strong Immersion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every surface $\Sigma$, the class of Eulerian directed graphs that are Eulerian embeddable into $\Sigma$ (in particular they have degree at most $4$) is well-quasi-ordered by strong immersion. This result marks one of the most versatile directed graph classes (besides tournaments) for which we are aware of a positive well-quasi-ordering result regarding a well-studied graph relation.
  Our result implies that the class of bipartite circle graphs is well-quasi-ordered under the pivot-minor relation. Furthermore, this also yields two other interesting applications, namely, a polynomial-time algorithm for testing immersion closed properties of Eulerian-embeddable graphs into a fixed surface, and a characterisation of the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property for Eulerian digraphs of maximum degree four.
  Further, in order to prove the mentioned result, we prove that Eulerian digraphs of carving width bounded by some constant $k$ (which correspond to Eulerian digraphs with bounded treewidth and additionally bounded degree) are well-quasi-ordered by strong immersion. We actually prove a stronger result where we allow for vertices of the Eulerian digraphs to be labeled by elements of some well-quasi-order $\Omega$. We complement these results with a proof that the class of Eulerian planar digraphs of treewidth at most $3$ is not well-quasi-ordered by strong immersion, noting that any antichain of bounded treewidth cannot have bounded degree.</description>

Abstract: The problem of PIR in graph-based replication systems has received significant attention in recent years. A systematic study was conducted by Sadeh, Gu, and Tamo, where each file is replicated across two servers and the storage topology is modeled by a graph. The PIR capacity of a graph $G$, denoted by $\mathcal{C}(G)$, is defined as the supremum of retrieval rates achievable by schemes that preserve user privacy, with the rate measured as the ratio between the file size and the total number of bits downloaded. This paper makes the following key contributions.
  (1) The complete graph $K_N$ has emerged as a central benchmark in the study of PIR over graphs. The asymptotic gap between the upper and lower bounds for $\mathcal{C}(K_N)$ was previously 2 and was only recently reduced to $5/3$. We shrink this gap to $1.0444$, bringing it close to resolution. More precisely,
  (i) Sadeh, Gu, and Tamo proved that $\mathcal{C}(K_N)\le 2/(N+1)$ and conjectured this bound to be tight. We refute this conjecture by establishing the strictly stronger bound $\mathcal{C}(K_N) \le \frac{1.3922}{N}.$ We also improve the upper bound for the balanced complete bipartite graph $\mathcal{C}(K_{N/2,N/2})$. (ii) The first lower bound on $\mathcal{C}(K_N)$ was $(1+o(1))/N$, which was recently sharpened to $(6/5+o(1))/N$. We provide explicit, systematic constructions that further improve this bound, proving $\mathcal{C}(K_N)\ge(4/3-o(1))/N,$ which in particular implies $\mathcal{C}(G) \ge (4/3-o(1))/|G|$ for every graph $G$.
  (2) We establish a conceptual bridge between deterministic and probabilistic PIR schemes on graphs. This connection has significant implications for reducing the required subpacketization in practical implementations and is of independent interest. We also design a general probabilistic PIR scheme that performs particularly well on sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>Total orders realizable as the distances between two sets of points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05535v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we give a negative answer to a question proposed by Almendra-Hern\'andez and Mart\'inez-Sandoval. Let $n\le m$ be positive integers and let $X$ and $Y$ be sets of sizes $n$ and $m$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ such that every pair of points in $X\cup Y$ defines a unique distance. There is a natural order on $X\times Y$ induced by the distances between the corresponding points. The question is if all possible orders on $X\times Y$ can be obtained in this way. We show that the answer is negative when $n&lt;m$. The case $n=m$ remains open.</description>

      <title>Powers of Hamilton cycles in oriented and directed graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The P\'osa--Seymour conjecture determines the minimum degree threshold for forcing the $k$th power of a Hamilton cycle in a graph. After numerous partial results, Koml\'os, S\'ark\"ozy and Szemer\'edi proved the conjecture for sufficiently large graphs. In this paper we focus on the analogous problem for digraphs and for oriented graphs. We asymptotically determine the minimum total degree threshold for forcing the square of a Hamilton cycle in a digraph. We also give a conjecture on the corresponding threshold for $k$th powers of a Hamilton cycle more generally. For oriented graphs, we provide a minimum semi-degree condition that forces the $k$th power of a Hamilton cycle; although this minimum semi-degree condition is not tight, it does provide the correct order of magnitude of the threshold. Tur\'an-type problems for oriented graphs are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Kontsevich graphs act on Nambu--Poisson brackets, IV. When the invisible becomes crucial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kontsevich's graphs allow encoding multi-vectors whose coefficients are differential-polynomial in the coefficients of a given Poisson bracket on an affine real manifold. Encoding formulas by directed graphs adapts to the class of Nambu-determinant Poisson brackets, yet the graph topology becomes dimension-specific. To inspect whether a given Kontsevich graph cocycle $\gamma$ acts (non)trivially -- in the second Poisson cohomology -- on the space of Nambu brackets, taking a vector field solution $\smash{\vec{X}^\gamma_d}$ from dimension $d$ does not work in $d+1$. For $2 \leqslant d \leqslant 4$, the action of tetrahedron $\gamma_3$ on Nambu brackets is known to be a Poisson coboundary, $\dot{P} = [[ P,\smash{\vec{X}^{\gamma_3}_d} (P)]]$. We explore which minimal (sub)sets of graphs, encoding (non)vanishing objects over $\mathbb{R}^d_{\text{aff}}$, generate the topological data that suffice for a solution $\smash{\vec{X}^{\gamma_3}_{d+1}}$ to appear. We detect that there can be no solution in higher dimension without invisible graphs that vanish as formulas in $d=3$, but whose descendants do not all vanish over $d=4$.</description>

      <title>On Relative Ordered Tur\'an Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an ordered graph $F$, denote the Tur\'an density by $\vec{\pi}(F)$. The relative Tur\'an density, denoted by $\rho(F)$, is the supremum over $\alpha \in [0,1]$ such that every ordered graph $G$ contains an $F$-free subgraph $G'$ with $e(G') \geq \alpha e(G)$. Reiher, R\"odl, Sales and Schacht showed that $\rho(P) = \vec{\pi}(P)/2$ and $\rho(K) = \vec{\pi}(K)$ for any ascending path $P$ or clique $K$. They asked if there are any ordered graphs $F$ with $\vec{\pi}(F)/2 &lt; \rho(F) &lt; \vec{\pi}(F)$. We answer this question in the affirmative by describing a family of such $F$. We also show that the relative Tur\'an densities of a large family of ordered matchings (including $\{\{1,6\}, \{2,3\}, \{4,5\}\}$ and $\{\{1,3\}, \{2,5\}, \{4,6\}\}$) are $0$.</description>

      <title>Finite projective planes meet spectral gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for any connected graph $G$ with maximum degree $d\ge3$, the spectral gap from $0$ with respect to the adjacency matrix is at most $\sqrt{d-1}$, with equality if and only if $G$ is the incidence graph of a finite projective plane of order $d-1$; and for other cases, the bound $\sqrt{d-1}$ is improved to $\sqrt{d-2}$. This is a spectral gap version of a result by Mohar and Tayfeh-Rezaie. Moreover, for $d$-regular graphs with girth at least 7, the bound $\sqrt{d-2}$ is further improved to $\sqrt{d-c(d)}$ where $c(d)\ge 2$ and $\lim\limits_{d\to\infty}c(d)/d=(\sqrt{5}-1)/2$.
  A similar yet more subtle phenomenon involving the normalized Laplacian is also investigated, where we work on graphs of degrees $\ge d$ rather than $\le d$. We prove that for any graph $G$ with \emph{minimum} degree $d\ge 3$, the spectral gap from the value 1 with respect to the normalized Laplacian is at most $\sqrt{d-1}/d$, with equality if and only if $G$ is the incidence graph of a finite projective plane of order $d-1$. As an application, we provide a new sharp bound for the convergence rate of some eigenvalues of the Laplacian on the weighted neighborhood graphs introduced by Bauer and Jost.</description>

      <title>Discrepancy Beyond Additive Functions with Applications to Fair Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a setting where we have a ground set $M$ together with real-valued set functions $f_1, \dots, f_n$, and the goal is to partition $M$ into two sets $S_1,S_2$ such that $|f_i(S_1) - f_i(S_2)|$ is small for every $i$. Many results in discrepancy theory can be stated in this form with the functions $f_i$ being additive. In this work, we initiate the study of the unstructured case where $f_i$ is not assumed to be additive. We show that even without the additivity assumption, the upper bound remains at most $O(\sqrt{n \log n})$.
  Our result has implications on the fair allocation of indivisible goods. In particular, we show that a consensus halving up to $O(\sqrt{n \log n})$ goods always exists for $n$ agents with monotone utilities. Previously, only an $O(n)$ bound was known for this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that every graph with $m$ edges admits a 3-partition such that \[ \max_{1 \leq i \leq 3} e(V_i) \leq \frac{m}{9} + \frac{1}{9}h(m) \quad \text{and} \quad e(V_1, V_2, V_3) \geq \frac{2}{3}m + \frac{1}{3}h(m), \] where $h(m) = \sqrt{2m + 1/4} - 1/2$. This answers a problem of Bollob\'as and Scott affirmatively. We also solve several related problems of Bollob\'as and Scott. All of our results are tight.</description>

Abstract: Given a lattice polygon, we study the moduli space of all tropical plane curves with that Newton polygon. We determine a formula for the dimension of this space in terms of combinatorial properties of that polygon. We prove that if this polygon is nonhyperelliptic or maximal and hyperelliptic, then this formula matches the dimension of the moduli space of nondegenerate algebraic curves with that given Newton polygon.</description>

      <title>Sparsest cut and eigenvalue multiplicities on low degree Abelian Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether or not the Sparsest Cut problem admits an efficient $O(1)$-approximation algorithm is a fundamental algorithmic question with connections to geometry and the Unique Games Conjecture. Revisiting spectral algorithms for Sparsest Cut, we present a novel, simple algorithm that combines eigenspace enumeration with a new algorithm for the Cut Improvement problem. The runtime of our algorithm is parametrized by a quantity that we call the solution dimension $\text{SD}_\varepsilon(G)$: the smallest $k$ such that the subspace spanned by the first $k$ Laplacian eigenvectors contains all but $\varepsilon$ fraction of a sparsest cut. Our algorithm matches the guarantees of prior methods based on the threshold-rank paradigm, while also extending beyond them. To illustrate this, we study its performance on low degree Cayley graphs over Abelian groups -- canonical examples of graphs with poor expansion properties. We prove that low degree Abelian Cayley graphs have small solution dimension, yielding an algorithm that computes a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation to the uniform Sparsest Cut of a degree-$d$ Cayley graph over an Abelian group of size $n$ in time $n^{O(1)}\cdot\exp(d/\varepsilon)^{O(d)}$. Along the way to bounding the solution dimension of Abelian Cayley graphs, we analyze their sparse cuts and spectra, proving that the collection of $O(1)$-approximate sparsest cuts has an $\varepsilon$-net of size $\exp(d/\varepsilon)^{O(d)}$ and that the multiplicity of $\lambda_2$ is bounded by $2^{O(d)}$. The latter bound is tight and improves on a previous bound of $2^{O(d^2)}$ by Lee and Makarychev.</description>

      <title>Categorification of $k$-Schur functions and refined Macdonald positivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the $k$-Schur functions as the graded characters of simple objects in an additive module category. This confirms a set of conjectures formulated in the Ph.D. thesis of Chen, written under the direction of Mark Haiman, and thereby establishes the algebraic framework proposed therein. As a consequence, we deduce that the modified Macdonald polynomials are $k$-Schur positive, thus realizing the original motivation behind the definition of the $k$-Schur functions by Lapointe, Lascoux, and Morse. Our approach builds on our previous work on the algebraic and geometric realization of Catalan symmetric functions, which encompasses both the $k$-Schur functions and the Hall--Littlewood functions.</description>

Abstract: We prove that if a tile in $\mathbb Z^d$ has prime size $p$, then it must be spectral. The proof is by contradiction, it is simply shown that the tiling complement of such a tile can not annihilate all $p$-subgroups. In addition, with a simple transformation we prove that any $p$ points in general linear positions in $\mathbb Z^d$ must be both tiling and spectral if $d\ge p-1$.</description>
