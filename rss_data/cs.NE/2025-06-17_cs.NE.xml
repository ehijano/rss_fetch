      <title>NeuroCoreX: An Open-Source FPGA-Based Spiking Neural Network Emulator with On-Chip Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are computational models inspired by the structure and dynamics of biological neuronal networks. Their event-driven nature enables them to achieve high energy efficiency, particularly when deployed on neuromorphic hardware platforms. Unlike conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which primarily rely on layered architectures, SNNs naturally support a wide range of connectivity patterns, from traditional layered structures to small-world graphs characterized by locally dense and globally sparse connections. In this work, we introduce NeuroCoreX, an FPGA-based emulator designed for the flexible co-design and testing of SNNs. NeuroCoreX supports all-to-all connectivity, providing the capability to implement diverse network topologies without architectural restrictions. It features a biologically motivated local learning mechanism based on Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP). The neuron model implemented within NeuroCoreX is the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, with current-based synapses facilitating spike integration and transmission . A Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) interface is provided for programming and configuring the network parameters, including neuron, synapse, and learning rule settings. Users interact with the emulator through a simple Python-based interface, streamlining SNN deployment from model design to hardware execution. NeuroCoreX is released as an open-source framework, aiming to accelerate research and development in energy-efficient, biologically inspired computing.</description>

      <title>Is Selection All You Need in Differential Evolution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential Evolution (DE) is a widely used evolutionary algorithm for black-box optimization problems. However, in modern DE implementations, a major challenge lies in the limited population diversity caused by the fixed population size enforced by the generational replacement. Population size is a critical control parameter that significantly affects DE performance. Larger populations inherently contain a more diverse set of individuals, thereby facilitating broader exploration of the search space. Conversely, when the maximum evaluation budgets is constrained, smaller populations focusing on a limited number of promising candidates may be more suitable. Many state-of-the-art DE variants incorporate an archive mechanism, in which a subset of discarded individuals is preserved in an archive during generation replacement and reused in mutation operations. However, maintaining what is essentially a secondary population via an archive introduces additional design considerations, such as policies for insertion, deletion, and appropriate sizing. To address these limitations, we propose a novel DE framework called Unbounded Differential Evolution (UDE), which adds all generated candidates to the population without discarding any individual based on fitness. Unlike conventional DE, which removes inferior individuals during generational replacement, UDE eliminates replacement altogether, along with the associated complexities of archive management and dynamic population sizing. UDE represents a fundamentally new approach to DE, relying solely on selection mechanisms and enabling a more straightforward yet powerful search algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Hybrid Training Approach for Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) can be implemented very efficiently in neuromorphic systems. Nevertheless, training of these models with powerful gradient-based learning algorithms is mostly performed on standard digital hardware using Backpropagation through time (BPTT). However, BPTT has substantial limitations. It does not permit online training and its memory consumption scales linearly with the number of computation steps. In contrast, learning methods using forward propagation of gradients operate in an online manner with a memory consumption independent of the number of time steps. These methods enable SNNs to learn from continuous, infinite-length input sequences. Yet, slow execution speed on conventional hardware as well as inferior performance has hindered their widespread application. In this work, we introduce HYbrid PRopagation (HYPR) that combines the efficiency of parallelization with approximate online forward learning. Our algorithm yields high-throughput online learning through parallelization, paired with constant, i.e., sequence length independent, memory demands. HYPR enables parallelization of parameter update computation over the sub sequences for RSNNs consisting of almost arbitrary non-linear spiking neuron models. We apply HYPR to networks of spiking neurons with oscillatory subthreshold dynamics. We find that this type of neuron model is particularly well trainable by HYPR, resulting in an unprecedentedly low task performance gap between approximate forward gradient learning and BPTT.</description>

      <title>Connecting phases of matter to the flatness of the loss landscape in analog variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) promise near-term quantum advantage, yet parametrized quantum states commonly built from the digital gate-based approach often suffer from scalability issues such as barren plateaus, where the loss landscape becomes flat. We study an analog VQA ans\"atze composed of $M$ quenches of a disordered Ising chain, whose dynamics is native to several quantum simulation platforms. By tuning the disorder strength we place each quench in either a thermalized phase or a many-body-localized (MBL) phase and analyse (i) the ans\"atze's expressivity and (ii) the scaling of loss variance. Numerics shows that both phases reach maximal expressivity at large $M$, but barren plateaus emerge at far smaller $M$ in the thermalized phase than in the MBL phase. Exploiting this gap, we propose an MBL initialisation strategy: initialise the ans\"atze in the MBL regime at intermediate quench $M$, enabling an initial trainability while retaining sufficient expressivity for subsequent optimization. The results link quantum phases of matter and VQA trainability, and provide practical guidelines for scaling analog-hardware VQAs.</description>

      <title>Sharp Generalization Bounds for Foundation Models with Asymmetric Randomized Low-Rank Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique for foundation models. Recent work has highlighted an inherent asymmetry in the initialization of LoRA's low-rank factors, which has been present since its inception and was presumably derived experimentally. This paper focuses on providing a comprehensive theoretical characterization of asymmetric LoRA with frozen random factors. First, while existing research provides upper-bound generalization guarantees based on averages over multiple experiments, the behaviour of a single fine-tuning run with specific random factors remains an open question. We address this by investigating the concentration of the typical LoRA generalization gap around its mean. Our main upper bound reveals a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{\sqrt{r}}{\sqrt{N}}\right)$ with high probability for rank $r$ LoRAs trained on $N$ samples. Additionally, we also determine the fundamental limits in terms of sample efficiency, establishing a matching lower bound of $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\right)$. By more closely reflecting the practical scenario of a single fine-tuning run, our findings offer crucial insights into the reliability and practicality of asymmetric LoRA.</description>

      <title>LLMs Help Alleviate the Cross-Subject Variability in Brain Signal and Language Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoding human activity from EEG signals has long been a popular research topic. While recent studies have increasingly shifted focus from single-subject to cross-subject analysis, few have explored the model's ability to perform zero-shot predictions on EEG signals from previously unseen subjects. This research aims to investigate whether deep learning methods can capture subject-independent semantic information inherent in human EEG signals. Such insights are crucial for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) because, on one hand, they demonstrate the model's robustness against subject-specific temporal biases, and on the other, they significantly enhance the generalizability of downstream tasks. We employ Large Language Models (LLMs) as denoising agents to extract subject-independent semantic features from noisy EEG signals. Experimental results, including ablation studies, highlight the pivotal role of LLMs in decoding subject-independent semantic information from noisy EEG data. We hope our findings will contribute to advancing BCI research and assist both academia and industry in applying EEG signals to a broader range of applications.</description>

Abstract: Effective search methods are crucial for improving the performance of deep generative models at test time. In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time search method, Neural Genetic Search (NGS), which incorporates the evolutionary mechanism of genetic algorithms into the generation procedure of deep models. The core idea behind NGS is its crossover, which is defined as parent-conditioned generation using trained generative models. This approach offers a versatile and easy-to-implement search algorithm for deep generative models. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of NGS through experiments across three distinct domains: routing problems, adversarial prompt generation for language models, and molecular design.</description>

      <title>SDTrack: A Baseline for Event-based Tracking via Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event cameras provide superior temporal resolution, dynamic range, power efficiency, and pixel bandwidth. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) naturally complement event data through discrete spike signals, making them ideal for event-based tracking. However, current approaches that combine Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and SNNs, along with suboptimal architectures, compromise energy efficiency and limit tracking performance. To address these limitations, we propose the first Transformer-based spike-driven tracking pipeline. Our Global Trajectory Prompt (GTP) method effectively captures global trajectory information and aggregates it with event streams into event images to enhance spatiotemporal representation. We then introduce SDTrack, a Transformer-based spike-driven tracker comprising a Spiking MetaFormer backbone and a simple tracking head that directly predicts normalized coordinates using spike signals. The framework is end-to-end, does not require data augmentation or post-processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining the lowest parameter count and energy consumption across multiple event-based tracking benchmarks, establishing a solid baseline for future research in the field of neuromorphic vision.</description>

      <title>Learning Traffic Signal Control via Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control of traffic signals is crucial for improving transportation efficiency. Recently, learning-based methods, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), garnered substantial success in the quest for more efficient traffic signal control strategies. However, the design of rewards in DRL highly demands domain knowledge to converge to an effective policy, and the final policy also presents difficulties in terms of explainability. In this work, a new learning-based method for signal control in complex intersections is proposed. In our approach, we design a concept of phase urgency for each signal phase. During signal transitions, the traffic light control strategy selects the next phase to be activated based on the phase urgency. We then proposed to represent the urgency function as an explainable tree structure. The urgency function can calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. Genetic programming is adopted to perform gradient-free optimization of the urgency function. We test our algorithm on multiple public traffic signal control datasets. The experimental results indicate that the tree-shaped urgency function evolved by genetic programming outperforms the baselines, including a state-of-the-art method in the transportation field and a well-known DRL-based method. Our code is available online.</description>

      <title>CAPO: Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16005v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by solving a wide range of tasks simply guided by a prompt. Yet their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. While automatic prompt optimization addresses this challenge by finding optimal prompts, current methods require a substantial number of LLM calls and input tokens, making prompt optimization expensive. We introduce CAPO (Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization), an algorithm that enhances prompt optimization efficiency by integrating AutoML techniques. CAPO is an evolutionary approach with LLMs as operators, incorporating racing to save evaluations and multi-objective optimization to balance performance with prompt length. It jointly optimizes instructions and few-shot examples while leveraging task descriptions for improved robustness. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that CAPO outperforms state-of-the-art discrete prompt optimization methods in 11/15 cases with improvements up to 21%p in accuracy. Our algorithm achieves better performances already with smaller budgets, saves evaluations through racing, and decreases average prompt length via a length penalty, making it both cost-efficient and cost-aware. Even without few-shot examples, CAPO outperforms its competitors and generally remains robust to initial prompts. CAPO represents an important step toward making prompt optimization more powerful and accessible by improving cost-efficiency.</description>

      <title>Effective Stimulus Propagation in Neural Circuits: Driver Node Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise control of signal propagation in modular neural networks represents a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. We establish a framework for identifying optimal control nodes that maximize stimulus transmission between weakly coupled neural populations. Using spiking stochastic block model networks, we systematically compare driver node selection strategies - including random sampling and topology-based centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, harmonic, and percolation centrality) - to determine minimal control inputs for achieving inter-population synchronization. Targeted stimulation of just 10-20% of the most central neurons in the source population significantly enhances spiking propagation fidelity compared to random selection. This approach yields a 64-fold increase in signal transfer efficiency at critical inter-module connection densities. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for precision neuromodulation in biological neural systems and neurotechnology applications.</description>
