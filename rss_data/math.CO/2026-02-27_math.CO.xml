      <title>A kernel for the maximum agreement forest problem on multiple binary phylogenetic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximum agreement forest (MAF) problem in phylogenetics takes as input a set t &gt;=2 of binary phylogenetic trees T on the same set of taxa X. It asks for a partition X into the smallest number of blocks such that the subtrees induced by these blocks are disjoint and have common topology across all the trees in T. We produce a modified version of the well-known chain reduction rule in order to prove the existence of a kernel of size O( t * r * k ) where k is the natural parameter (the number of blocks) and r=min{max{k,3},t+1}}. We prove this bound for both the unrooted and rooted version of the problem, and demonstrate that the bound r, the length to which common chains are truncated, is tight. Our results constitute the first kernels for MAF in the t &gt; 2 regime.</description>

      <title>P\'olya enumeration, wreath product symmetric functions, and moduli spaces of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a calculus for $S_n$-equivariant Euler characteristics of moduli spaces of stable curves and stable maps. Our approach involves an enrichment of P\'olya's cycle index polynomial of a graph to a certain algebra $\Lambda^{[2]}$ of wreath product symmetric functions. Building on foundational work of Macdonald, we prove that $\Lambda^{[2]}$ may be viewed as the Grothendieck ring of the category of polynomial functors which map symmetric sequences of vector spaces to vector spaces. This interpretation gives rise to an action of $\Lambda^{[2]}$ on the ordinary ring of symmetric functions $\Lambda$, which is described concretely in terms of Adams operations and skewing by power sums. This action lets us deduce appealing formulas, involving only ordinary symmetric functions, for generating functions of $S_n$-equivariant Euler characteristics.</description>

      <title>On Arithmetic Cordial Labeling of Some Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\eta$ be a fixed positive integer. Let $S$ be a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$, $\star:S\times S\to \mathbb{Z}$ be a binary function, and $\zeta_{\eta}:\{\xi\in \mathbb{Z}:\gcd(\xi,\eta)=1\}\to \{0,1\}$ be a function. For a simple connected graph $G$ of order $n$, a bijective function $f:V(G)\to S$ (where $|S|=n$) is called an arithmetic cordial labeling modulo $\eta$ under $\langle S,\zeta_\eta,\star\rangle$ if the induced function $f_\eta^*:E(G)\to \{0,1\}$, defined by $f_\eta^*(uv)=0$ whenever $\zeta_\eta(f(a)\star f(b))=0$ or $\gcd(f(a)\star f(b),\eta)\neq 1$, and $f_\eta^*(uv)=1$ whenever $\zeta_\eta(f(a)\star f(b))=1$, satisfies the condition $|e_{f_\eta^*}(0)-e_{f_\eta^*}(1)|\leq 1$, where $e_{f_\eta^*}(i)$ is the number of edges with label $i$ ($i=0,1$). In this paper, we explore the arithmetic cordial labeling of some graphs under conditions imposed on the function $\zeta_\eta$. The graphs included are star graphs, ladder graphs, alternate cycle snake graphs, join graphs, corona graphs, and tensor product graphs.</description>

      <title>Are sparse graphs typically determined by their spectrum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether it is typical for a sparse graph to be uniquely characterized by its adjacency spectrum up to isomorphism. Our first result shows that the giant component of an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph is cospectral when the average degree is sufficiently small. The proof relies on the existence of a specific pendant tree, combined with a method by Schwenk that swaps trees to construct a cospectral mate.
  It seems possible that pendant trees are essentially the only obstruction, meaning that the giant should become characterized by spectrum with high probability if one prunes these by considering the 2-core. The majority of the paper is devoted to theoretical and numerical evidence supporting this concept. Our main theorem in this direction establishes that local switching methods can not cause the 2-core to be cospectral. We also discuss R-cospectrality and rational cospectrality at fixed level.</description>

      <title>Ordered trees with distinguished children</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new tree model is introduced based on ordered trees, by distinguishing exactly one child of each node that \emph{has} children. The basic enumeration leads to a cubic equation of the generating function. The extraction of its coefficients can be done using the Lagrange inversion formula. Various parameters that are commonly studied for ordered trees can also be addressed here, like degree of the root, number of leaves, number of old leaves, height, height of leftmost leaf, and pathlength. We go through these instances and leave further parameters to later research, by either the author or some readers. Dealing with cubic equations in a meaningful way requires some skills with Maple.
  In a last section, ordered trees are replaced by marked ordered trees; they are then combined with the concept of distinguished children. Only the basic enumeration is provided, leaving further analysis to the future.</description>

      <title>Most probably trangle-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Mantel's theorem states that any triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices contains at most $\left\lfloor n^2/4\right\rfloor$ edges. It is natural to ask how many triangles must exist in a graph with more than $\left\lfloor n^2/4\right\rfloor$ edges--a problem known as the Erd\H{o}s-Rademacher problem. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic variant of this classic problem. Specifically, given an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\left\lfloor n^2/4\right\rfloor+i$ ($i&gt;0$) edges, we choose the edges of $G$ independently with probability $p$, and the resulting new graph is triangle-free with a certain probability. Our goal is to maximize this probability by choosing $G$ appropriately. For the case where $G$ has $ \left\lfloor n^2/4\right\rfloor +1$ edges, we determine the exact maximum probability.</description>

      <title>Results on three problems on isolation of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graph isolation problem was introduced by Caro and Hansberg in 2015. It is a vast generalization of the classical graph domination problem and its study is expanding rapidly. In this paper, we address a number of questions that arise naturally. Let $F$ be a graph. We show that the $F$-isolating set problem is NP-complete if $F$ is connected. We investigate how the $F$-isolation number $\iota(G,F)$ of a graph $G$ is affected by the minimum degree $d$ of $G$, establishing a bounded range, in terms of $d$ and the orders of $F$ and $G$, for the largest possible value of $\iota(G,F)$ with $d$ sufficiently large. We also investigate how close $\iota(G,tF)$ is to $\iota(G,F)$, using domination and, in suitable cases, the Erdos-Posa property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the consistently oriented double ray is ubiquitous if and only if it is ubiquitous restricted to the class of one-ended digraphs. Additionally, we prove the same equivalence for the disjoint union of a consistently forward and a consistently backward oriented ray. Furthermore, we discuss the connection between these two ubiquity problems.</description>

      <title>Isolation critical graphs under multiple edge subdivision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the notion of $(\iota,q)$-critical graphs. The isolation number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\iota(G)$ and also known as the vertex-edge domination number, is the minimum number of vertices in a set $D$ such that the subgraph induced by the vertices not in the closed neighbourhood of $D$ has no edges.
  A graph $G$ is $(\iota,q)$-critical, $q \ge 1$, if the subdivision of any $q$ edges in $G$ gives a graph with isolation number greater than $\iota(G)$ and there exists a set of $q-1$ edges such that subdividing them gives a graph with isolation number equal to $\iota(G)$.
  We prove that for each integer $q \ge 1$ there exists a $(\iota,q)$-critical graph, while for a given graph $G$, the admissible values of $q$ satisfy $1 \le q \le |E(G)| - 1$. In addition, we provide a general characterisation of $(\iota,1)$-critical graphs as well as a constructive characterisation of $(\iota,1)$-critical trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the following uniform version of a theorem by Lindstr\"om:
  Let $\mbox{$\cal F$}:=\{F_i:~ i\in I\}$ be a $k$-uniform set family of $[n]$, where $k\geq 1$. If $|\mbox{$\cal F$}|\geq n+1$, then there exist two disjoint subsets $I_1$ and $I_2$ of $I$ for which $$ \bigcup\limits_{i\in I_1} M_i=\bigcup\limits_{i\in I_2} M_i $$ and $$ \bigcap\limits_{i\in I_1} M_i=\bigcap\limits_{i\in I_2} M_i. $$ Our proof uses basic linear algebra.</description>

      <title>Matroids from gain graphs over quotient groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new construction for matroids from gain graphs that simultaneously generalizes several existing constructions. The construction takes as input a gain graph over a Frobenius group $\Gamma$ with Frobenius kernel $\Gamma_1$ and outputs an elementary lift of the frame matroid of the underlying gain graph over the quotient group $\Gamma/\Gamma_1$.
  While the hypothesis that $\Gamma$ is a Frobenius group may seem unusual, we prove that it is in some sense necessary: if $\Gamma$ is any finite group with a nontrivial proper normal subgroup $\Gamma_1$ and there is a construction that takes in a complete $\Gamma$-gain graph and outputs an elementary lift $M$ of the frame matroid of the underlying $(\Gamma/\Gamma_1)$-gain graph so that a cycle of the graph is a circuit of $M$ if and only if it is $\Gamma$-balanced, then $\Gamma$ is a Frobenius group with Frobenius kernel $\Gamma_1$.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous separation in bounded degree trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It follows from a classical result of Jordan that every tree with maximum degree at most $r$ containing a vertex set labeled by $[n]$, has a single-edge cut which separates two subsets $A,B \subset [n]$ for which $\min\{|A|,|B|\} \ge (n-1)/r$. Motivated by the tree dissimilarity problem in phylogenetics, we consider the case of separating vertex sets of {\em several} trees: Given $k$ trees with maximum degree at most $r$, containing a common vertex set labeled by $[n]$, we ask for a single-edge cut in each tree which maximizes $min\{|A|,|B|\}$ where $A,B \subset [n]$ are separated by the corresponding cut at each tree. Denoting this maximum by $f(r,k,n)$ and considering the limit $f(r,k) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} f(r,k,n)/n$ (which is shown to always exist) we determine that $f(r,2)=\frac{1}{2r}$ and determine that $f(3,3)=\frac{2}{27}$, which is already quite intricate. The case $r=3$ is especially interesting in phylogenetics and our result implies that any two (three) binary phylogenetic trees over $n$ taxa have a split at each tree which separates two taxa sets of order at least $n/6$ (resp. $2n/27$), and these bounds are asymptotically tight.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing a giant component of a point set in $\mathbb{R}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $V \subset \mathbb{R}$ be a finite set with $|V| = n $ and suppose we are given each pairwise distance independently with probability $p$. We show that if $p = (1+\epsilon)/n$, for some fixed $\epsilon &gt;0$, then we can reconstruct a subset of size $\Omega_{\epsilon}(n)$, up to translation and reflection, with high probability. This confirms a conjecture posed by Gir\~ao, Illingworth, Michel, Powierski, and Scott.
  We also study a deterministic variant proposed by Benjamini and Tzalik. We show that if we are given $m$ distinct pairwise distances of a point set $V \subset \mathbb{R}$ with $|V|=n$, then we can reconstruct a subset of size $\Omega(m/ (n \log n)) $, up to translation and reflection. Moreover, we show that this is optimal, which also disproves a conjecture posed by Benjamini and Tzalik.</description>

      <title>On pseudo-arcs from normal rational curve and additive MDS codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{PG}(k-1,q)$ be the $(k-1)$-dimensional projective space over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. An arc in $\mathrm{PG}(k-1,q)$ is a set of points with the property that any $k$ of them span the entire space. The notion of pseudo-arc generalizes that of an arc by replacing points with higher-dimensional subspaces. Constructions of pseudo-arcs can be obtained from arcs defined over extension fields; such pseudo-arcs are necessarily Desarguesian, in the sense that all their elements belong to a Desarguesian spread. In contrast, genuinely non-Desarguesian pseudo-arcs are far less understood and have previously been known only in a few sporadic cases. In this paper, we introduce a new infinite family of non-Desarguesian pseudo-arcs consisting of $(h-1)$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathrm{PG}(k-1,q)$ based on the imaginary spaces of a normal rational curve. We determine the size of the constructed pseudo-arcs explicitly and show that, by adding suitable osculating spaces of a normal rational curve defined over a subgeometry, we obtain pseudo-arcs of size $O(q^h)$. As $q$ grows, these sizes asymptotically attain the classical upper bound for pseudo-arcs established in 1971 by J.~A.~Thas, thereby showing that this bound is essentially sharp also in the non-Desarguesian setting. We further investigate the interaction between these new pseudo-arcs and quadrics. While Desarguesian pseudo-arcs from normal rational curve are complete intersections of quadrics, we prove that the new pseudo-arcs are not contained in any quadric of the ambient projective space. Finally, we translate our geometric results into coding theory. We show that the new pseudo-arcs correspond precisely to recent families of additive MDS codes introduced via a polynomial framework. As a consequence of their non-Desarguesian nature, we prove that these codes are not equivalent to linear MDS codes.</description>

      <title>Proof of the strong conjecture about $F$-irregular graphs in the class of graphs $\{F\}$ of diameter $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ and $G$ be simple finite undirected graphs. A graph $G$ is called $F$-irregular if any two of its distinct vertices belong to different numbers of copies of $F$ in $G$. According to the strong conjecture about $F$-irregular graphs (Dovzhenok, Filuta, Chuhai), for any connected graph $F$ of order $|F|\geqslant 3$, there exist infinitely many $F$-irregular graphs. In the present paper, the strong conjecture about $F$-irregular graphs is confirmed in the class of graphs $\{F\}$ of diameter $2$. It is proved that for every graph $F$ of diameter $2$, there exists an infinite series of $F$-irregular graphs of diameter $3$.</description>

      <title>Largest Sidon subsets in weak Sidon sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite set $ S \subset \mathbb{R} $ is called a Sidon set if all sums $ x+y $ with $ x,y \in S $ and $ x \le y $ are distinct, and a weak Sidon set if all sums $ x+y $ with $ x,y \in S $ and $ x &lt; y $ are distinct. For a finite set $ A \subset \mathbb{R} $, let $ h(A) $ denote the maximum size of a Sidon subset of $ A $, and define $$ g(n) := \min\{\, h(A) : A \subset \mathbb{R},\ |A| = n,\ A \text{ is a weak Sidon set} \,\}. $$ S\'ark\"ozy and S\'os asked whether the limit $ \lim_{n\to\infty} g(n)/n $ exists and, if so, to determine its value. We resolve this problem completely by proving that $$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{g(n)}{n} = \frac{1}{2}. $$ We also investigate a related problem of Erd\H{o}s concerning a local difference condition. A finite set $ A \subset \mathbb{R} $ is called a $(4,5)$-set if every $4$-element subset of $A$ determines at least five distinct values among its six pairwise absolute differences. Erd\H{o}s asked for the optimal constant $ c_* &gt; 0 $ such that every $(4,5)$-set of size $ n $ contains a Sidon subset of size at least $ c_* n $. Gy\'arf\'as and Lehel reduced this to an extremal problem of $3$-uniform hypergraphs and proved $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{141 \cdot 76} \le c_* \le \frac{3}{5}$. We improve both bounds by establishing $$ \frac{9}{17} \le c_* \le \frac{4}{7}, $$ where the lower bound uses a reformulation of the extremal problem, and the upper bound follows from an explicit construction together with a convenient characterization of $c_*$.</description>

      <title>Building with Blocks: Enumerating Polyforms on Tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In areas as diverse as contemporary art, play structures, climbing equipment, and modular construction toys, we see the presence of building block-like polyhedral complexes, which are generalizations of the pieces in the game Tetris. We give an algorithm for counting the number of $n$-celled structures on polygonal and polyhedral cells of certain periodic two- and three-dimensional tilings; moreover, we count these structures up to translations, rotations, and reflections of the tiling. We describe this algorithm with respect to structures in the snub square tiling, provide numerical data related to existing three-dimensional art and structures, and suggest puzzles based on these constructions.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every $n$-vertex 4-uniform hypergraph with minimum codegree at least $\lfloor n/4 \rfloor$ has a spanning tight component. This is tight, and it settles the 4-uniform case of a conjecture of Illingworth, Lang, M\"uyesser, Parczyk, and Sgueglia.</description>

      <title>Cyclic sieving for a class of rectangular domino tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cyclic sieving phenomenon (CSP) provides valuable data about symmetry classes of cyclic actions, and has applications to representation theory. In this paper, we enumerate domino tableaux of shape 2-by-n, and use this result to prove a new CSP on these objects. We then enumerate the rectangular domino tableaux of any dimensions, and conjecture a more general CSP on rectangular domino tableaux. As a consequence of the enumerative results, we obtain several identities involving Fibonacci and Catalan numbers.</description>

      <title>Ramanujan subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A finite, connected, $(d+1)$-regular graph $G$ is called Ramanujan if every its eigenvalue $\lambda$ satisfies either $\lambda=\pm (d+1)$ or $|\lambda|\leq 2\sqrt{d}$. The Ramanujan condition corresponds to the optimal rate of decay of correlations for the associated non-backtracking edge subshift. We consider a higher-dimensional generalization of this observation. We introduce the notion of a $d$-regular $\mathbb{Z}^{\delta}$-subshift of finite type, and we define a Ramanujan subshift as a $d$-regular $\mathbb{Z}^{\delta}$-subshift with an optimal rate of decay of correlations. We show that for every odd prime power $q\geq 3$ and dimension $\delta&lt;q$, there exists a $q$-regular Ramanujan $\mathbb{Z}^{\delta}$-subshift. The construction is based on the quaternionic lattices over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ introduced by Rungtanapirom-Stix-Vdovina (2019). Each of our $q$-regular Ramanujan subshifts gives rise to a family of non-bipartite $(q+1)$-regular Ramanujan graphs. These graphs are very explicit and local in the strong sense: the neighbors of any vertex can be computed by an explicit Mealy automaton associated with the subshift. As a byproduct, for every odd prime power $q$, we get a single lifting rule that can be iterated to produce an infinite family of $(q+1)$-regular Ramanujan graphs.</description>

      <title>On the Computation Rate of All-Reduce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the All-Reduce problem, each one of the K nodes holds an input and wishes to compute the sum of all K inputs through a communication network where each pair of nodes is connected by a parallel link with arbitrary bandwidth. The computation rate of All-Reduce is defined as the number of sum instances that can be computed over each network use. For the computation rate, we provide a cut-set upper bound and a linear programming lower bound based on time (bandwidth) sharing over all schemes that first perform Reduce (aggregating all inputs at one node) and then perform Broadcast (sending the sum from that node to all other nodes). Specializing the two general bounds gives us the optimal computation rate for a class of communication networks and the best-known rate bounds (where the upper bound is no more than twice of the lower bound) for cyclic, complete, and hypercube networks.</description>

      <title>Flip Distance of Triangulations of Convex Polygons / Rotation Distance of Binary Trees is NP-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flips in triangulations of convex polygons arise in many different settings. They are isomorphic to rotations in binary trees, define edges in the 1-skeleton of the Associahedron and cover relations in the Tamari Lattice.
  The complexity of determining the minimum number of flips that transform one triangulation of a convex point set into another remained a tantalizing open question for many decades. We settle this question by proving that computing shortest flip sequences between triangulations of convex polygons, and therefore also computing the rotation distance of binary trees, is NP-hard.
  For our proof we develop techniques for flip sequences of triangulations whose counterparts were introduced for the study of flip sequences of non-crossing spanning trees by Bjerkevik, Kleist, Ueckerdt, and Vogtenhuber~[SODA25] and Bjerkevik, Dorfer, Kleist, Ueckerdt, and Vogtenhuber~[SoCG26].</description>

      <title>Factors in infinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group and $A\subseteq G$ a non-empty subset. A right $s$-factor associated with $A$ is a maximal subset $U\subseteq G$ such that the product $AU$ is direct. The lower and upper $s$-indices $|G:A|^-$ and $|G:A|^+$ are defined as the minimum and the supremum of the cardinalities of such maximal sets $U$. The subset $A$ is called stable if $|G:A|^- = |G:A|^+$, and $G$ is called stable if every subset of $G$ is stable.
  Using a graph-theoretic reformulation in terms of Cayley graphs, we prove that every infinite group is unstable. Equivalently, for every infinite group $G$ there exists a subset $A\subseteq G$ for which maximal subsets $U$ with direct product $AU$ do not all have the same cardinality. This gives a negative answer to Question 21.58 of the Kourovka Notebook.</description>

      <title>Repeated principal indefinite summation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under suitable asymptotic and convexity conditions on a function $g\colon\mathbb{R}_+\to\mathbb{R}$, the solution to $\Delta f=g$, where $\Delta$ is the forward difference operator, is unique up to an additive constant and is called the principal indefinite sum of $g$, generalizing the additive form of Bohr-Mollerup's theorem. We consider the map $\Sigma$, which assigns to each admissible function $g$ its principal indefinite sum that vanishes at $1$, and we naturally explore its iterates, which produce repeated principal indefinite sums, in analogy with the concept of repeated indefinite integrals. Explicit formulas and convergence results are established, highlighting connections with classical combinatorial and special functions, including the multiple gamma functions, for which we also provide integral representations.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Dichotomies for Triangle Detection in Subgraph, Induced, and Colored H-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent paper by the authors (ITCS'26) initiates the study of the Triangle Detection problem in graphs avoiding a fixed pattern $H$ as a subgraph and proposes a \emph{dichotomy hypothesis} characterizing which patterns $H$ make the Triangle Detection problem easier in $H$-free graphs than in general graphs.
  In this work, we demonstrate that this hypothesis is, in fact, equivalent to analogous hypotheses in two broader settings that a priori seem significantly more challenging: \emph{induced} $H$-free graphs and \emph{colored} $H$-free graphs.
  Our main contribution is a reduction from the induced $H$-free case to the non-induced $\H^+$-free case, where $\H^+$ preserves the structural properties of $H$ that are relevant for the dichotomy, namely $3$-colorability and triangle count. A similar reduction is given for the colored case.
  A key technical ingredient is a self-reduction to Unique Triangle Detection that preserves the induced $H$-freeness property, via a new color-coding-like reduction.</description>

Abstract: In topological dynamics, tame and null systems arise naturally in the study of low-complexity aperiodic behaviour, yet providing concrete and easily testable conditions to establish their existence in a canonical class of systems is often nontrivial. We give a complete characterisation of tameness and nullness for minimal automatic systems generated by primitive constant length substitutions in terms of amorphic complexity -- a numerical invariant recently introduced to study zero entropy systems. We derive an easily computable closed formula for this invariant in this setting and show that, for infinite automatic systems, tameness and nullness are equivalent to its value being one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an oriented graph $\overrightarrow{G}$, the inversion of a subset $X$ of vertices is the operation that reverses the orientation of all arcs with both end-vertices in $X$. The inversion graph of a graph $G$, denoted by $\mathcal{I}(G)$, is the graph whose vertices are orientations of $G$ in which two orientations $\overrightarrow{G_1}$ and $\overrightarrow{G_2}$ are adjacent if and only if there is an inversion transforming $\overrightarrow{G_1}$ into $\overrightarrow{G_2}$. The inversion diameter of a graph $G$ is the diameter of its inversion graph $\mathcal{I}(G)$, denoted by $\diam(\mathcal{I}(G))$. Havet, H\"orsch, and Rambaud~(2024) first proved that for $G$ of treewidth $k$, $\diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \le 2k$, and that there are graphs of treewidth $k$ with inversion diameter $k+2$. In this paper, we construct graphs of treewidth $k$ with inversion diameter $2k$, which implies that the previous upper bound $\diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \le 2k$ is tight. Moreover, for graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$, Havet, H\"orsch, and Rambaud~(2024) proved $\diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \le 2\Delta-1$ and conjectured that $\diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \le \Delta$. We prove the conjecture when $\Delta=3$ with the help of computer calculations.</description>

      <title>On strongly and robustly critical graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In extremal combinatorics, it is common to focus on structures that are minimal with respect to a certain property. In particular, critical and list-critical graphs occupy a prominent place in graph coloring theory. Stiebitz, Tuza, and Voigt introduced strongly critical graphs, i.e., graphs that are $k$-critical yet $L$-colorable with respect to every non-constant assignment $L$ of lists of size $k-1$. Here we strengthen this notion and extend it to the framework of DP-coloring (or correspondence coloring) by defining robustly $k$-critical graphs as those that are not $(k-1)$-DP-colorable, but only due to the fact that $\chi(G) = k$. We then seek general methods for constructing robustly critical graphs. Our main result is that if $G$ is a critical graph (with respect to ordinary coloring), then the join of $G$ with a sufficiently large clique is robustly critical; this is new even for strong criticality.</description>

      <title>Towards Graham's rearrangement conjecture via rainbow paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an old question in combinatorial group theory which can be traced back to a conjecture of Graham from 1971. Given a group $\Gamma$, and some subset $S\subseteq \Gamma$, is it possible to permute $S$ as $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_d$ so that the partial products $\prod_{1 \leq i \leq t} s_i$, $t\in [d]$ are all distinct? Most of the progress towards this problem has been in the case when $\Gamma$ is a cyclic group. We show that for any group $\Gamma$ and any $S \subseteq \Gamma$, there is a permutation of $S$ where all but a vanishing proportion of the partial products are distinct, thereby establishing the first asymptotic version of Graham's conjecture under no restrictions on $\Gamma$ or $S$.
  To do so, we explore a natural connection between Graham's problem and the following very natural question attributed to Schrijver. Given a $d$-regular graph $G$ properly edge-coloured with $d$ colours, is it always possible to find a rainbow path with $d-1$ edges? We settle this question asymptotically by showing one can find a rainbow path of length $d - o(d)$. While this has immediate applications to Graham's question for example when $\Gamma = \mathbb{F}_2^k$, our general result above requires a more involved result we obtain for the natural directed analogue of Schrijver's question.</description>

      <title>A polynomial bound on the pathwidth of graphs edge-coverable by $k$ shortest paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dumas, Foucaud, Perez and Todinca (2024) recently proved that every graph whose edges can be covered by $k$ shortest paths has pathwidth at most $O(3^k)$. In this paper, we improve this upper bound on the pathwidth to a polynomial one; namely, we show that every graph whose edge set can be covered by $k$ shortest paths has pathwidth $O(k^4)$, answering a question from the same paper. Moreover, we prove that when $k\leq 3$, every such graph has pathwidth at most $k$ (and this bound is tight). Finally, we show that even though there exist graphs with arbitrarily large treewidth whose vertex set can be covered by $2$ isometric trees, every graph whose set of edges can be covered by $2$ isometric trees has treewidth at most $2$.</description>

      <title>On the number of permutation-twisted dot products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a field of characteristic $0$. For each choice of distinct $a_1, \ldots, a_n\in \mathbb{K}$ and distinct $b_1, \ldots, b_n\in \mathbb{K}$, consider the sum $S=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_{\pi(i)}$ as $\pi$ ranges over the permutations of $[n]$. We show that this sum always assumes at least $\Omega(n^3)$ distinct values. This ``support'' bound, which is optimal up to the value of the implicit constant, complements recent work of Do, Nguyen, Phan, Tran, and Vu, and of Hunter, Pohoata, and Zhu on the anticoncentration properties of $S$ when $a_1,\ldots,a_n,b_1,\ldots,b_n$ are real and $\pi$ is chosen uniformly at random.</description>

      <title>The Total Chromatic Quasisymmetric Functions of a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study two variants of the chromatic quasisymmetric function of a graph: the total chromatic quasisymmetric function via vertex labeling and via acyclic orientations. The original definition of the chromatic quasisymmetric function of a graph by Shareshian and Wachs depends on a labeling of the vertices of the graph, which directly affects the properties of the coefficients appearing in the decomposition of the chromatic quasisymmetric function of a graph into different bases. Motivated by this, we construct the first variant of the chromatic quasisymmetric function of a graph by normalizing it with respect to all the labelings of the vertices. The second variant is motivated by the \emph{tree isomorphism conjecture} and is constructed in terms of acyclic orientations.
  We investigate the properties of the coefficients in the expansion in the monomial quasisymmetric basis for both variants and provide a comparative analysis. Furthermore, we derive explicit formulas for the coefficients in the monomial decomposition of the two variants for the star graph. For the labeling-based variant, these coefficients arise from a binomial identity for which we provide a combinatorial proof.</description>

      <title>Matrices of nonnegative integer rank two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonnegative integer rank of a matrix is a variant of the classical nonnegative rank, introduced in the 1980s, where factorizations are required to have integer entries. While computing nonnegative integer rank is generally very hard, we focus on a fundamental special case: determining when a rank 2 nonnegative integer matrix has nonnegative integer rank equal to 2 (the "rank2 problem"). Although this problem is trivial in the continuous case, in this context it is surprisingly rich.
  We provide a geometric reformulation in terms of affine semigroups and rational cones in the plane, which yields new structural insights. We show that any rank 2 integer matrix can be reduced to a $3\times 3$ matrix which has nonnegative integer rank $2$ if and only if the original one also has nonnegative integer rank $2$, with the reduction computable in polynomial time. This reduction reveals that the difficulty of the rank2 problem is already captured by small matrices. Building on this geometric framework, we also develop an algorithm that solves the rank2 problem by strategically searching for integer generators within bounded regions of the associated cone. Although the theoretical worst-case complexity remains high, numerical experiments demonstrate that the algorithm performs efficiently in practice.</description>

      <title>Edge-ends versus topological ends of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diestel and K\"uhn proved that the topological ends of an infinite graph are precisely its undominated graph ends, yielding a canonical embedding of the space of topological ends into the space of graph ends. For edge-ends, introduced by Hahn, Laviolette and \v{S}ir\'a\v{n}, such an embedding does not exist in general.
  In this note, we characterize the class of infinite graphs for which the topological ends admit a natural injective map into the space of edge-ends that is compatible with the canonical maps between end spaces. Our characterization is purely combinatorial and is expressed in terms of edge-equivalence classes of vertices.
  Moreover, when such an embedding exists, we identify precisely which edge-ends arise from topological ends, showing that they are exactly the edge-ends containing a non-dominated ray. This establishes a parallel result to the theorem of Diestel and K\"uhn for edge-end spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $k$-regular spanning subgraph of $G$ is called a $k$-factor. In this paper, we provide spectral radius and edge conditions to ensure that a graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\ge k$ admits a $k$-factor. Fan, Lin and Lu [European J. Combin. 110 (2023) 103701] presented a tight sufficient condition in terms of the spectral radius for a connected 1-tough graph to contain a connected 2-factor (Hamilton cycle). Then it is interesting to consider the following problem: What is the spectral radius condition to guarantee the existence of a $k$-factor with $k\ge3$ in a connected 1-tough graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\ge k$? We completely solve this problem, and we further obtain a sufficient spectral radius condition for the existence of a $k$-factor in a connected 1-binding graph, which solves an important problem posed by Fan and Lin [Electron. J. Combin. 31 (2024) 1--30].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06339v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A general position map $f:K\to M$ of a $k$-dimensional simplicial complex to a $2k$-dimensional manifold (for $k=1$, of a graph to a surface) is a $\mathbb Z_2$-embedding if $|f\sigma \cap f\tau|$ is even for any non-adjacent $k$-faces $\sigma,\tau$. We present criteria for $\mathbb Z_2$-embeddability of certain $k$-dimensional complex (for $k=1$, of any graph) to $2k$-dimensional manifolds. These criteria are
  $\bullet$ a `Kuratowski-type' version of the Fulek-Kyn\v{c}l-Bikeev criteria (for $k=1$), and
  $\bullet$ a converse to the Dzhenzher-Skopenkov necessary condition (for $k&gt;1$).
  Our higher-dimensional criterion allows us to reduce the modulo 2 K\"uhnel problem on embeddings to a purely algebraic problem.
  Our proof is interplay between geometric topology, combinatorics and linear algebra. It is based on calculation of generators in the homology of certain configuration space (the deleted product) of certain complex (joinpower).</description>

Abstract: We express cluster variables of type $B_n$ and $C_n$ in terms of cluster variables of type $A_n$. Then we associate a cluster tilted bound symmetric quiver $Q$ of type $A_{2n-1}$ to any seed of a cluster algebra of type $B_n$ and $C_n$. Under this correspondence, cluster variables of type $B_n$ (resp. $C_n$) correspond to orthogonal (resp. symplectic) indecomposable representations of $Q$. We find a Caldero-Chapoton map in this setting. We also give a categorical interpretation of the cluster expansion formula in the case of acyclic quivers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Toric topology assigns to each simple convex $n$-polytope $P$ with $m$ facets an $n$-dimensional real moment angle manifold $\mathbb RZ_P$ with a canonical action of $\mathbb Z_2^m=(\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z)^m$. We consider (non-necessarily free) actions of subgroups $H\subset \mathbb Z_2^m$ on $\mathbb RZ_P$. The orbit space $N(P,H)=\mathbb RZ_P/H$ has an action of $\mathbb Z_2^m/H$. For general $n$ we introduce the notion of a Hamiltonian $C(n,k)$-subcomplex in the boundary of an $n$-polytope $P$ generalizing the notions of a Hamiltonian cycle ($k=2$), Hamiltonian theta-subgraph ($k=3$) and Hamiltonian $K_4$-subgraph ($k=4)$ in the $1$-skeleton of a $3$-polytope. Each $C(n,k)$-subcomplex $C\subset \partial P$ corresponds to a subgroup $H_C\subset\mathbb Z_2^m$ such that $N(P,H_C)\simeq S^n$. We prove that in dimensions $n\leqslant 4$ this correspondence is a bijection. Any subgroup $H\subset \mathbb Z_2^m$ defines a complex $C(P,H)\subset \partial P$. We prove that each Hamiltonian $C(n,k)$-subcomplex $C\subset C(P,H)$ inducing $H$ corresponds to a hyperelliptic involution $\tau_C\in\mathbb Z_2^m/H$ on the manifold $N(P,H)$ (that is, an involution with the orbit space homeomorphic to $S^n$) and in dimensions $n\leqslant 4$ this correspondence is a bijection. We prove that for the geometries $\mathbb X= \mathbb S^4$, $\mathbb S^3\times\mathbb R$, $\mathbb S^2\times \mathbb S^2$, $\mathbb S^2\times \mathbb R^2$, $\mathbb S^2\times \mathbb L^2$, and $\mathbb L^2\times \mathbb L^2$ there exists a compact right-angled $4$-polytope $P$ with a free action of $H$ such that the geometric manifold $N(P,H)$ has a hyperelliptic involution in $\mathbb Z_2^m/H$, and for $\mathbb X=\mathbb R^4$, $\mathbb L^4$, $\mathbb L^3\times \mathbb R$ and $\mathbb L^2\times \mathbb R^2$ there are no such polytopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cover by left ideals of an associative (not necessarily commutative or unital) ring $R$ is a collection of proper left ideals whose set-theoretic union equals $R$. If such a cover exists, then $\eta_\ell(R)$ is the cardinality of a minimal cover, and $R$ is $\eta_\ell$-elementary if $\eta_\ell(R)&lt;\eta_\ell(R/I)$ for every nonzero two-sided ideal $I$ of $R$. We classify all $\eta_\ell$-elementary rings, and determine their covering numbers. Covers by right or two-sided ideals are also studied. This completely characterizes rings admitting finite covers by ideals. Our results generalize to finite covers of modules by submodules, and we determine all possible covering numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a circle and square of the same area in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are equidecomposable by translations using $\mathbf{\Delta}^0_2$ pieces. That is, pieces which are simultaneously $F_\sigma$ and $G_\delta$ sets. This improves a result of M\'ath\'e-Noel-Pikhurko and is the best possible complexity in terms of the Borel hierarchy. More generally we show that bounded sets $A,B \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ with small enough boundaries and the same nonzero Lebesgue measure are equidecomposable with pieces that are countable unions of finite Boolean combinations of translates of $A,B$, and open sets. The improvement comes from constructions of low complexity toasts and related objects which should be independently useful within Borel combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We answer a recent question of Cs\'oka and Vidny\'anszky [arXiv:2407.10006] and give an alternate proof of one of their results. The subject of both is which finite graphs admit factor of i.i.d. homomorphisms from the 3-regular tree. We then give yet another proof of the result in the Borel setting which leads to the following: For each $d &gt; 2$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$, there is a Borel hyperfinite $d$-regular forest $G$ and a finite graph with chromatic number $k$, $H$, so that $G$ does not admit a Borel homomorphism to $H$. All of this is tied together by a focus on the case when the target graph $H$ is a (subgraph of a) Kneser graph.</description>

Abstract: We investigate combinatorial bounds for the total Tjurina numbers of plane curve arrangements. Focusing on arrangements of lines and conics in $\mathbb{P}^2$ that admit only ordinary quasi-homogeneous singularities, we derive new structural inequalities governing the distribution of multiple intersection points. As a consequence, we establish sharp lower bounds for the total Tjurina numbers of free line arrangements with bounded maximal multiplicity and, more generally, for free conic-line arrangements. In particular, we show that for a free arrangement of $d$ lines and $k$ conics, the total Tjurina number grows at least quadratically in $d$ and $k$, and we demonstrate that this bound is sharp. As an application of these planar results, we construct a family of surfaces in $\mathbb{P}^{3}$ with only isolated singularities and arbitrarily large total Tjurina numbers.This provides new lower bounds for the total Tjurina numbers of certain hypersurfaces that are independent of detailed homological data.</description>
