      <title>Reducing Popularity Influence by Addressing Position Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Position bias poses a persistent challenge in recommender systems, with much of the existing research focusing on refining ranking relevance and driving user engagement. However, in practical applications, the mitigation of position bias does not always result in detectable short-term improvements in ranking relevance. This paper provides an alternative, practically useful view of what position bias reduction methods can achieve. It demonstrates that position debiasing can spread visibility and interactions more evenly across the assortment, effectively reducing a skew in the popularity of items induced by the position bias through a feedback loop. We offer an explanation of how position bias affects item popularity. This includes an illustrative model of the item popularity histogram and the effect of the position bias on its skewness. Through offline and online experiments on our large-scale e-commerce platform, we show that position debiasing can significantly improve assortment utilization, without any degradation in user engagement or financial metrics. This makes the ranking fairer and helps attract more partners or content providers, benefiting the customers and the business in the long term.</description>

      <title>MOPI-HFRS: A Multi-objective Personalized Health-aware Food Recommendation System with LLM-enhanced Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevalence of unhealthy eating habits has become an increasingly concerning issue in the United States. However, major food recommendation platforms (e.g., Yelp) continue to prioritize users' dietary preferences over the healthiness of their choices. Although efforts have been made to develop health-aware food recommendation systems, the personalization of such systems based on users' specific health conditions remains under-explored. In addition, few research focus on the interpretability of these systems, which hinders users from assessing the reliability of recommendations and impedes the practical deployment of these systems. In response to this gap, we first establish two large-scale personalized health-aware food recommendation benchmarks at the first attempt. We then develop a novel framework, Multi-Objective Personalized Interpretable Health-aware Food Recommendation System (MOPI-HFRS), which provides food recommendations by jointly optimizing the three objectives: user preference, personalized healthiness and nutritional diversity, along with an large language model (LLM)-enhanced reasoning module to promote healthy dietary knowledge through the interpretation of recommended results. Specifically, this holistic graph learning framework first utilizes two structure learning and a structure pooling modules to leverage both descriptive features and health data. Then it employs Pareto optimization to achieve designed multi-facet objectives. Finally, to further promote the healthy dietary knowledge and awareness, we exploit an LLM by utilizing knowledge-infusion, prompting the LLMs with knowledge obtained from the recommendation model for interpretation.</description>

      <title>SPRec: Leveraging Self-Play to Debias Preference Alignment for Large Language Model-based Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention in recommendation systems. Current LLM-based recommender systems primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train the model for recommendation tasks. However, relying solely on positive samples limits the model's ability to align with user satisfaction and expectations. To address this, researchers have introduced Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which explicitly aligns recommendations with user preferences using offline preference ranking data. Despite its advantages, our theoretical analysis reveals that DPO inherently biases the model towards a few items, exacerbating the filter bubble issue and ultimately degrading user experience. In this paper, we propose SPRec, a novel self-play recommendation framework designed to mitigate over-recommendation and improve fairness without requiring additional data or manual intervention. In each self-play iteration, the model undergoes an SFT step followed by a DPO step, treating offline interaction data as positive samples and the predicted outputs from the previous iteration as negative samples. This effectively re-weights the DPO loss function using the model's logits, adaptively suppressing biased items. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate SPRec's effectiveness in enhancing recommendation accuracy and addressing fairness concerns.</description>

      <title>jina-clip-v2: Multilingual Multimodal Embeddings for Text and Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a highly effective method for aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space. These models are widely used for tasks such as cross-modal information retrieval and multi-modal understanding. However, CLIP models often struggle with text-only tasks, underperforming compared to specialized text models. This performance disparity forces retrieval systems to rely on separate models for text-only and multi-modal tasks. In this work, we build upon our previous model, jina-clip-v1, by introducing a refined framework that utilizes multi-task, multi-stage contrastive learning across multiple languages, coupled with an improved training recipe to enhance text-only retrieval. The resulting model, jina-clip-v2, outperforms its predecessor on text-only and multimodal tasks, while adding multilingual support, better understanding of complex visual documents and efficiency gains thanks to Matryoshka Representation Learning and vector truncation. The model performs comparably to the state-of-the-art in both multilingual-multimodal and multilingual text retrieval benchmarks, addressing the challenge of unifying text-only and multi-modal retrieval systems.</description>

      <title>Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning for Multi-Objective Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective learning endeavors to concurrently optimize multiple objectives using a single model, aiming to achieve high and balanced performance across these diverse objectives. However, it often involves a more complex optimization problem, particularly when navigating potential conflicts between objectives, leading to solutions with higher memory requirements and computational complexity. This paper introduces a Multi-Objective Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning (MOGCSL) framework for automatically learning to achieve multiple objectives from offline sequential data. MOGCSL extends the conventional Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning (GCSL) method to multi-objective scenarios by redefining goals from one-dimensional scalars to multi-dimensional vectors. The need for complex architectures and optimization constraints can be naturally eliminated. MOGCSL benefits from filtering out uninformative or noisy instances that do not achieve desirable long-term rewards. It also incorporates a novel goal-choosing algorithm to model and select "high" achievable goals for inference.
  While MOGCSL is quite general, we focus on its application to the next action prediction problem in commercial-grade recommender systems. In this context, any viable solution needs to be reasonably scalable and also be robust to large amounts of noisy data that is characteristic of this application space. We show that MOGCSL performs admirably on both counts. Specifically, extensive experiments conducted on real-world recommendation datasets validate its efficacy and efficiency. Also, analysis and experiments are included to explain its strength in discounting the noisier portions of training data in recommender systems.</description>

      <title>A Flexible Plug-and-Play Module for Generating Variable-Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep supervised hashing has become a pivotal technique in large-scale image retrieval, offering significant benefits in terms of storage and search efficiency. However, existing deep supervised hashing models predominantly focus on generating fixed-length hash codes. This approach fails to address the inherent trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness when using hash codes of varying lengths. To determine the optimal hash code length for a specific task, multiple models must be trained for different lengths, leading to increased training time and computational overhead. Furthermore, the current paradigm overlooks the potential relationships between hash codes of different lengths, limiting the overall effectiveness of the models. To address these challenges, we propose the Nested Hash Layer (NHL), a plug-and-play module designed for existing deep supervised hashing models. The NHL framework introduces a novel mechanism to simultaneously generate hash codes of varying lengths in a nested manner. To tackle the optimization conflicts arising from the multiple learning objectives associated with different code lengths, we further propose an adaptive weights strategy that dynamically monitors and adjusts gradients during training. Additionally, recognizing that the structural information in longer hash codes can provide valuable guidance for shorter hash codes, we develop a long-short cascade self-distillation method within the NHL to enhance the overall quality of the generated hash codes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NHL not only accelerates the training process but also achieves superior retrieval performance across various deep hashing models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/hly1998/NHL.</description>

      <title>Predicting Quality of Video Gaming Experience Using Global-Scale Telemetry Data and Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frames Per Second (FPS) significantly affects the gaming experience. Providing players with accurate FPS estimates prior to purchase benefits both players and game developers. However, we have a limited understanding of how to predict a game's FPS performance on a specific device. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of a wide range of factors that may affect game FPS on a global-scale dataset to identify the determinants of FPS. This includes player-side and game-side characteristics, as well as country-level socio-economic statistics. Furthermore, recognizing that accurate FPS predictions require extensive user data, which raises privacy concerns, we propose a federated learning-based model to ensure user privacy. Each player and game is assigned a unique learnable knowledge kernel that gradually extracts latent features for improved accuracy. We also introduce a novel training and prediction scheme that allows these kernels to be dynamically plug-and-play, effectively addressing cold start issues. To train this model with minimal bias, we collected a large telemetry dataset from 224 countries and regions, 100,000 users, and 835 games. Our model achieved a mean Wasserstein distance of 0.469 between predicted and ground truth FPS distributions, outperforming all baseline methods.</description>

      <title>When Text Embedding Meets Large Language Model: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text embedding has become a foundational technology in natural language processing (NLP) during the deep learning era, driving advancements across a wide array of downstream tasks. While many natural language understanding challenges can now be modeled using generative paradigms and leverage the robust generative and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs), numerous practical applications, such as semantic matching, clustering, and information retrieval, continue to rely on text embeddings for their efficiency and effectiveness. In this survey, we categorize the interplay between LLMs and text embeddings into three overarching themes: (1) LLM-augmented text embedding, enhancing traditional embedding methods with LLMs; (2) LLMs as text embedders, utilizing their innate capabilities for embedding generation; and (3) Text embedding understanding with LLMs, leveraging LLMs to analyze and interpret embeddings. By organizing these efforts based on interaction patterns rather than specific downstream applications, we offer a novel and systematic overview of contributions from various research and application domains in the era of LLMs. Furthermore, we highlight the unresolved challenges that persisted in the pre-LLM era with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and explore the emerging obstacles brought forth by LLMs. Building on this analysis, we outline prospective directions for the evolution of text embedding, addressing both theoretical and practical opportunities in the rapidly advancing landscape of NLP.</description>

      <title>Foundational Large Language Models for Materials Research</title>

Abstract: Materials discovery and development are critical for addressing global challenges. Yet, the exponential growth in materials science literature comprising vast amounts of textual data has created significant bottlenecks in knowledge extraction, synthesis, and scientific reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate materials research through automated analysis and prediction. Still, their effective deployment requires domain-specific adaptation for understanding and solving domain-relevant tasks. Here, we present LLaMat, a family of foundational models for materials science developed through continued pretraining of LLaMA models on an extensive corpus of materials literature and crystallographic data. Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that LLaMat excels in materials-specific NLP and structured information extraction while maintaining general linguistic capabilities. The specialized LLaMat-CIF variant demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in crystal structure generation, predicting stable crystals with high coverage across the periodic table. Intriguingly, despite LLaMA-3's superior performance in comparison to LLaMA-2, we observe that LLaMat-2 demonstrates unexpectedly enhanced domain-specific performance across diverse materials science tasks, including structured information extraction from text and tables, more particularly in crystal structure generation, a potential adaptation rigidity in overtrained LLMs. Altogether, the present work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain adaptation towards developing practically deployable LLM copilots for materials research. Beyond materials science, our findings reveal important considerations for domain adaptation of LLMs, such as model selection, training methodology, and domain-specific performance, which may influence the development of specialized scientific AI systems.</description>

      <title>HGCH: A Hyperbolic Graph Convolution Network Model for Heterogeneous Collaborative Graph Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: User-item interaction data in collaborative filtering and graph modeling tasks often exhibit power-law characteristics, which suggest the suitability of hyperbolic space modeling. Hyperbolic Graph Convolution Neural Networks (HGCNs) are a novel technique that leverages the advantages of GCN and hyperbolic space, and then achieves remarkable results. However, existing HGCN methods have several drawbacks: they fail to fully leverage hyperbolic space properties due to arbitrary embedding initialization and imprecise tangent space aggregation; they overlook auxiliary information that could enrich the collaborative graph; and their training convergence is slow due to margin ranking loss and random negative sampling. To overcome these challenges, we propose Hyperbolic Graph Collaborative for Heterogeneous Recommendation (HGCH), an enhanced HGCN-based model for collaborative filtering that integrates diverse side information into a heterogeneous collaborative graph and improves training convergence speed. HGCH first preserves the long-tailed nature of the graph by initializing node embeddings with power law prior; then it aggregates neighbors in hyperbolic space using the gyromidpoint method for accurate computation; finally, it fuses multiple embeddings from different hyperbolic spaces by the gate fusion with prior. Moreover, HGCH employs a hyperbolic user-specific negative sampling to speed up convergence. We evaluate HGCH on four real datasets, and the results show that HGCH achieves competitive results and outperforms leading baselines, including HGCNs. Extensive ablation studies further confirm its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>GANPrompt: Enhancing Robustness in LLM-Based Recommendations with GAN-Enhanced Diversity Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in comprehending and generating natural language, with a growing prevalence in the domain of recommendation systems. However, LLMs still face a significant challenge called prompt sensitivity, which refers to that it is highly susceptible to the influence of prompt words. This inconsistency in response to minor alterations in prompt input may compromise the accuracy and resilience of recommendation models. To address this issue, this paper proposes GANPrompt, a multi-dimensional LLMs prompt diversity framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The framework enhances the model's adaptability and stability to diverse prompts by integrating GANs generation techniques with the deep semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs. GANPrompt first trains a generator capable of producing diverse prompts by analysing multidimensional user behavioural data. These diverse prompts are then used to train the LLMs to improve its performance in the face of unseen prompts. Furthermore, to ensure a high degree of diversity and relevance of the prompts, this study introduces a mathematical theory-based diversity constraint mechanism that optimises the generated prompts to ensure that they are not only superficially distinct, but also semantically cover a wide range of user intentions. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, especially in improving the adaptability and robustness of recommendation systems in complex and dynamic environments. The experimental results demonstrate that GANPrompt yields substantial enhancements in accuracy and robustness relative to existing state-of-the-art methodologies.</description>

      <title>Task-level Distributionally Robust Optimization for Large Language Model-based Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Model-based Dense Retrieval (LLM-DR) optimizes over numerous heterogeneous fine-tuning collections from different domains. However, the discussion about its training data distribution is still minimal. Previous studies rely on empirically assigned dataset choices or sampling ratios, which inevitably lead to sub-optimal retrieval performances. In this paper, we propose a new task-level Distributionally Robust Optimization (tDRO) algorithm for LLM-DR fine-tuning, targeted at improving the universal domain generalization ability by end-to-end reweighting the data distribution of each task. The tDRO parameterizes the domain weights and updates them with scaled domain gradients. The optimized weights are then transferred to the LLM-DR fine-tuning to train more robust retrievers. Experiments show optimal improvements in large-scale retrieval benchmarks and reduce up to 30% dataset usage after applying our optimization algorithm with a series of different-sized LLM-DR models.</description>

      <title>Writing Style Matters: An Examination of Bias and Fairness in Information Retrieval Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Language Model technologies has opened new opportunities, but also introduced new challenges related to bias and fairness. This paper explores the uncharted territory of potential biases in state-of-the-art universal text embedding models towards specific document and query writing styles within Information Retrieval (IR) systems. Our investigation reveals that different embedding models exhibit different preferences of document writing style, while more informal and emotive styles are less favored by most embedding models. In terms of query writing styles, many embedding models tend to match the style of the query with the style of the retrieved documents, but some show a consistent preference for specific styles. Text embedding models fine-tuned on synthetic data generated by LLMs display a consistent preference for certain style of generated data. These biases in text embedding based IR systems can inadvertently silence or marginalize certain communication styles, thereby posing a significant threat to fairness in information retrieval. Finally, we also compare the answer styles of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on different LLMs and find out that most text embedding models are biased towards LLM's answer styles when used as evaluation metrics for answer correctness. This study sheds light on the critical issue of writing style based bias in IR systems, offering valuable insights for the development of more fair and robust models.</description>

      <title>The Informational Role of Online Recommendations: Evidence from a Field Experiment</title>

Abstract: We conduct a field experiment on a movie-recommendation platform to investigate whether and how online recommendations influence consumption choices. Using a within-subjects design, our experiment measures the causal effect of recommendations on consumption and decomposes the relative importance of two economic mechanisms: expanding consumers' consideration sets and providing information about their idiosyncratic match value. We find that the informational component exerts a stronger influence - recommendations shape consumer beliefs, which in turn drive consumption, particularly among less experienced consumers. Our findings and experimental design provide valuable insights for the economic evaluation and optimisation of online recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Large language models as oracles for instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background. Endowing intelligent systems with semantic data commonly requires designing and instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge. Especially in the early phases, those activities are typically performed manually by human experts possibly leveraging on their own experience. The resulting process is therefore time-consuming, error-prone, and often biased by the personal background of the ontology designer. Objective. To mitigate that issue, we propose a novel domain-independent approach to automatically instantiate ontologies with domain-specific knowledge, by leveraging on large language models (LLMs) as oracles. Method. Starting from (i) an initial schema composed by inter-related classes and properties and (ii) a set of query templates, our method queries the LLM multiple times, and generates instances for both classes and properties from its replies. Thus, the ontology is automatically filled with domain-specific knowledge, compliant to the initial schema. As a result, the ontology is quickly and automatically enriched with manifold instances, which experts may consider to keep, adjust, discard, or complement according to their own needs and expertise. Contribution. We formalise our method in general way and instantiate it over various LLMs, as well as on a concrete case study. We report experiments rooted in the nutritional domain where an ontology of food meals and their ingredients is automatically instantiated from scratch, starting from a categorisation of meals and their relationships. There, we analyse the quality of the generated ontologies and compare ontologies attained by exploiting different LLMs. Experimentally, our approach achieves a quality metric that is up to five times higher than the state-of-the-art, while reducing erroneous entities and relations by up to ten times. Finally, we provide a SWOT analysis of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Toward Reliable Ad-hoc Scientific Information Extraction: A Case Study on Two Materials Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the ability of GPT-4 to perform ad-hoc schema based information extraction from scientific literature. We assess specifically whether it can, with a basic prompting approach, replicate two existing material science datasets, given the manuscripts from which they were originally manually extracted. We employ materials scientists to perform a detailed manual error analysis to assess where the model struggles to faithfully extract the desired information, and draw on their insights to suggest research directions to address this broadly important task.</description>
