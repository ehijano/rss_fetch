      <title>A fresh look at Bivariate Binomial Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binomial distributions capture the probabilities of `heads' outcomes when a (biased) coin is tossed multiple times. The coin may be identified with a distribution on the two-element set {0,1}, where the 1 outcome corresponds to `head'. One can also toss two separate coins, with different biases, in parallel and record the outcomes. This paper investigates a slightly different `bivariate' binomial distribution, where the two coins are dependent (also called: entangled, or entwined): the two-coin is a distribution on the product {0,1} x {0,1}. This bivariate binomial exists in the literature, with complicated formulations. Here we use the language of category theory to give a new succint formulation. This paper investigates, also in categorically inspired form, basic properties of these bivariate distributions, including their mean, variance and covariance, and their behaviour under convolution and under updating, in Laplace's rule of succession. Furthermore, it is shown how Expectation Maximisation works for these bivariate binomials, so that mixtures of bivariate binomials can be recognised in data. This paper concentrates on the bivariate case, but the binomial distributions may be generalised to the multivariate case, with multiple dimensions, in a straightforward manner.</description>

      <title>Time of appearance of a large gap in a dynamic Poisson point process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distribution of the 'gap time', the first time that a large gap appears, in the spatial birth and death point process on $[0,1]$ in which particles are added uniformly in space at rate $\lambda$ and are removed independently at rate $1$, as a function of the parameter $\lambda$ and the specified gap size function $w_\lambda$ as $\lambda\to\infty$. If $w_\lambda$ is a large enough multiple of the typical largest gap $(\log(\lambda)+O(1))/\lambda$ and the initial distribution has a high enough local density of particles and not too many particles in total, then the gap time, scaled by its expected value, converges in distribution to exponential with mean $1$. If in addition $\limsup_\lambda w_\lambda &lt; 1$ then the expected time scales like $e^{\lambda w_\lambda}/(\lambda^2 w_\lambda(1-w_\lambda))$.</description>

      <title>Mixing at the Batchelor Scale for White-In-Time Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the mixing properties of solutions to the advection-diffusion equation of a white-in-time velocity field on the 2-dimensional torus with four forced modes. As the diffusivity parameter goes to zero, we show that the almost-sure exponential dissipation rate stays bounded from below. Together with the corresponding upper bound established by Gess and Yaroslavtsev, this constitutes an example of a velocity field for which the Batchelor scale conjecture can be verified. In addition, we characterize the exponential mixing rate without diffusion of this system. Our results are not restricted to two dimensions, and we construct a three-dimensional white-in-time velocity field with the same properties.</description>

      <title>Constructive Approximation under Carleman's Condition, with Applications to Smoothed Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result of Carleman, based on the theory of quasianalytic functions, shows that polynomials are dense in $L^2(\mu)$ for any $\mu$ such that the moments $\int x^k d\mu$ do not grow too rapidly as $k \to \infty$. In this work, we develop a fairly tight quantitative analogue of the underlying Denjoy-Carleman theorem via complex analysis, and show that this allows for nonasymptotic control of the rate of approximation by polynomials for any smooth function with polynomial growth at infinity. In many cases, this allows us to establish $L^2$ approximation-theoretic results for functions over general classes of distributions (e.g., multivariate sub-Gaussian or sub-exponential distributions) which were previously known only in special cases. As one application, we show that the Paley--Wiener class of functions bandlimited to $[-\Omega,\Omega]$ admits superexponential rates of approximation over all strictly sub-exponential distributions, which leads to a new characterization of the class. As another application, we solve an open problem recently posed by Chandrasekaran, Klivans, Kontonis, Meka and Stavropoulos on the smoothed analysis of learning, and also obtain quantitative improvements to their main results and applications.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers for continuous $N$-particle ensembles at fixed temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the Law of Large Numbers of averaged empirical measures of $N$-particle ensembles, in terms of the asymptotics of their Bessel generating functions, in the fixed temperature regime. This settles an open problem posed by Benaych-Georges, Cuenca and Gorin. For one direction, we use the moment method through Dunkl operators, and for the other we employ a special case of the formula of Chapuy--Dolega for the generating function of infinite constellations. As applications, we prove that the LLN for $\theta$-sums and $\theta$-corners of random matrices are given by the free convolution and free projection, respectively, regardless of the value of inverse temperature parameter $\theta$. We also prove the LLN for a time-slice of the $\theta$-Dyson Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Homogenizationof non-divergence form operators in i.i.d. random environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study random walks in a balanced, i.i.d. random environment in $\mathbb Z^d$ for $d\geq 3$. We establish improved convergence rates for the homogenization of the Dirichlet problem associated with the corresponding non-divergence form difference operators, surpassing the $O(R^{-1})$ rate, which is expected to be optimal for environments with a finite range of dependence. In particular, the improved rates are $O(R^{-3/2})$ when $d=3$, and $O(R^{-2}\log R)$ when $d\geq 4$.</description>

      <title>Limiting Speed and Fluctuations for the Boundary Modified Contact Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The boundary modified contact process models an epidemic spreading in one dimension with two infection parameters, $\lambda_i$ and $\lambda_e$. Starting from a finite infected set, each edge of $\mathbb{Z}$ transmits the infection at rate $\lambda_i$ except for the rightmost and leftmost edges incident to infected vertices, which transmit the infection at rate $\lambda_e$. We show a strong law of large numbers and central limit theorem for the location of the rightmost infected vertex when $\lambda_i = \lambda_c$ and $\lambda_e = \lambda_c + \varepsilon$. We also show stretched exponential tail bounds in the fluctuations of the rightmost infected vertex, the extinction time of the process on the event of non-survival, and the probability of survival given the size of the initial infected region. Our results extend to the boundary modified contact process whenever $\lambda_c \leq \lambda_i &lt; \lambda_e$, and solves an open problem first proposed by Andjel and Rolla in [1].</description>

      <title>A Note on Restricted Selection Set from Random Interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study restricted selection sets of random intervals in $\R^1$ defined on a non-atomic probability space. Given a random interval $Y=[y_L,y_U]$ and scalar constraints on the expectation or the median of admissible selections, we define the restricted selection set and establish its existence, basic structure and influence on bounding moments and quantiles. In particular, we give conditions under which any mean (or quantile) in the Aumann expectation range can be attained by a measurable selection. We characterize the induced ranges of means, medians, and event probabilities. The analysis is carried out in a minimal one-dimensional random-set framework inspired by the classical theory of Aumann integrals. We also outline extensions to higher-order moment and general quantile restrictions.</description>

      <title>On the diameter of random uniform hypergraphs in dense regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed natural number $t\geq 2$, we consider $t$-uniform random hypergraphs $\mathscr{H} (n,t,p)$ on $n$ vertices $[n]=\{1,\ldots, n\}$, where each $t$-subset of $[n]$ is included as a hyperedge with probability $p$ and independently. We show that the diameter of $\mathscr{H} (n,t,p)$ is concentrated only at two points in the dense regime. More precisely, suppose $diam(\mathcal H)$ denotes the diameter of a hypergraph $\mathcal H$ on $n$ vertices. We show that, for fixed $t,c,d$ constants, if $n$ and $p$ (depends on $t,c,d,n$) satisfy
  $$
  \frac{ (t-1)^ {d} N^{d} p^{d}} {n}= \log \left( \frac{n^2}{c} \right), \mbox{ where } N={n-1\choose t-1},
  $$ $c$ is a positive constant and $d\geq2$ is a natural number, then
  $$
  \lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{P} \left( diam( \mathcal{H}) = d \right) = e^{- \frac{c}{2}} \text{ and } \lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{P} \left( diam(\mathcal{H}) = d+1 \right) = 1- e^{- \frac{c}{2}}.
  $$
  In particular, the case where $t = 2$ corresponds to the diameter of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph, as established by Bollob\'as in \cite[Theorem~6]{bollobas1981diameter}. Bollob\' as's result was proven using the moments method, which is challenging to apply in our context due to the complexity of the model. In this paper, we utilize the Stein-Chen method along with coupling techniques to prove our result. This approach can potentially be used to solve various problems, in particular diameter problems, in more complex networks.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Fluctuations for the Stochastic Landau-Lifshitz Navier-Stokes Equation in Dimension $D\geq2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the large-scale Gaussian fluctuations for the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz Navier-Stokes equation (LLNS) at and above criticality, using the method in \cite{CGT24}. With the classical diffusive scaling in $d\geq 3$ and weak coupling scaling in $d=2$, we obtain the convergence of the regularised LLNS to a stochastic heat equation with a non-trivially renormalized coefficient. Moreover, we obtain an asymptotic expansion of the effective coefficient when $d\geq3$, and show that the one in \cite[Conjecture 6.5]{JP24} is incorrect. The new ingredient in our proof is a case-by-case analysis to track the evolution of the vector under the action of the Leray projection, combined with the use of the anti-symmetric part of the generator and a rotational change of coordinates to derive the desired decoupled stochastic heat equation from the original coupled system.</description>

      <title>Convergence of patterned matrices with random walk entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the Brownian motion on the real line can be obtained as a weak limit of a suitably scaled continuous-time random walk (CTRW). We investigate the convergence of certain patterned random matrices whose entries are independent CTRWs of various types. In a non-commutative probability framework, we use these high dimensional matrices to derive approximations of the free Brownian motion. Furthermore, we introduce and analyze a random time-changed version of the free Brownian motion driven by an inverse stable subordinator. An approximation of this process is obtained using a random matrix whose entries consist of continuous-time randomly stopped random walks. Moreover, it is shown that the empirical spectral distributions of such matrices have longer tails. Additionally, in a specific case, we use the explicit eigenvalue expressions of these matrices to obtain weak approximations of the standard Brownian motion and a time-changed variant of it.</description>

      <title>Canonical Rough Path over Tempered Fractional Brownian Motion: Existence, Construction, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a canonical geometric rough path over $d$-dimensional tempered fractional Brownian motion (tfBm) for any Hurst parameter $H &gt; 1/4$ and tempering parameter $\lambda &gt; 0$. The main challenge stems from the non-homogeneous nature of the tfBm covariance, which exhibits a power-law structure at small scales and exponential decay at large scales. Our primary contribution is a detailed analysis of this covariance, proving it has finite 2D $\rho$-variation for $\rho = 1/(2H)$. This verifies the criterion of Friz and Victoir, guaranteeing the existence of a rough path lift. We then provide an explicit construction of the rough path $\mathbf{B}_{H,\lambda} = (B_{H,\lambda}, \mathbb{B}_{H,\lambda})$ via $L^2$-limits, establishing its basic properties with explicit constants $C(H,\lambda,T)$. As direct consequences, we obtain: (i) a complete characterization of integration regimes, with Young integration applicable for $H &gt; 1/2$ and rough path theory necessary and sufficient for $H \in (1/4, 1/2]$; (ii) the well-posedness of rough differential equations driven by tfBm; and (iii) the foundation for signature calculus for tfBm, including the existence and factorial decay of the signature. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical convergence rates $\mathcal{O}(N^{-2H})$ for the L\'evy area approximation and $\mathcal{O}(n^{-H})$ for the associated Milstein scheme. This work provides the first comprehensive pathwise framework for stochastic calculus with tfBm.</description>

      <title>Random walks on rank one symmetric spaces of noncompact type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a central limit theorem, a local limit theorem, and a law of large numbers for a natural random walk on a symmetric space $M$ of non-compact type and rank one. This class of spaces, which includes the complex and quaternionic hyperbolic spaces and the Cayley hyperbolic plane, generalizes the real hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n}$. Our approach introduces a unified algebraic framework that generalizes the M\"obius addition, previously used for the constant curvature case, to define the random walk via a non-Euclidean summation of variables. We demonstrate that the renormalized walk converges to the heat kernel associated with the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $M$, which plays the role of the limiting normal law. The proofs leverage the harmonic analysis of spherical functions on symmetric spaces. To the best of our knowledge, these results are new in the context of rank one symmetric spaces.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of the canonical Brownian motion in non-simple conformal loop ensemble gaskets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the canonical Brownian motion on the gasket of conformal loop ensembles (CLE$_\kappa$) for $\kappa \in (4,8)$ (which is the range of parameter values in which loops of the CLE$_\kappa$ can intersect themselves, each other, and the domain boundary). More precisely, we show that there is a unique diffusion process on the CLE$_\kappa$ gasket whose law depends locally on the CLE$_\kappa$ and satisfies certain natural properties such as translation-invariance and scale-invariance (modulo time change). We characterize the diffusion process by its resistance form and show in particular that there is a unique resistance form on the CLE$_\kappa$ gasket that is locally determined by the CLE$_\kappa$ and satisfies certain natural properties such as translation-invariance and scale-covariance. We conjecture that the CLE$_\kappa$ Brownian motion describes the scaling limit of simple random walk on statistical mechanics models in two dimensions that converge to CLE$_\kappa$. In future work the results of this paper will be used to show that this is the case with $\kappa=6$ for critical percolation on the triangular lattice.</description>

      <title>Distributional properties of first jump times of CBI processes with jump sizes in given Borel sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an expression for the joint distribution function of the first jump times of a continuous state and continuous time branching process with immigration (CBI process) with jump sizes in given Borel sets having finite total L\'evy measures, which is defined as the sum of the measures appearing in the branching and immigration mechanisms of the CBI process in question. Our result generalizes a corresponding result of He and Li (2016), who considered this problem in case of a single Borel set having finite total L\'evy measure.</description>

      <title>The separating systole and the genus ratio of high genus triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the separating systole of high genus triangulations is of logarithmic order (in the size of the triangulation). Our methods also allow us to show an enumerative result, i.e. the convergence of the "genus ratio" for high genus triangulations. This complements the convergence of the "size ratio" that was proven in previous work with Budzinski.</description>

      <title>Singularity of the loops within a cable-graph loop-soup conditioned by its occupation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show the following feature of the relation between Brownian loop-soups on cable-graphs and their total occupation time-field $\Lambda$: When conditioned on $\Lambda$, the conditional law of individual loops becomes singular with respect to that of unconditioned loops. The idea of the proof is to see that some type of fast points on the curve $\Lambda$ impose an exceptional behaviour of all the loops when they go through these points.</description>

      <title>Sharp thresholds, hitting times and the power of choice for random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a random geometric graph process where random points $(X_i)_{i \ge 1}$ are embedded consecutively in the $d$-dimensional unit torus $\mathbb{T}^d$, and every two points at distance at most $r$ form an edge. As $r\to 0$, we confirm that well-known hitting time results for $k$-connectivity (with $k\ge 1$ fixed) and Hamiltonicity in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph process also hold for the considered geometric analogue. Moreover, we exhibit a sort of probabilistic monotonicity for each of these properties.
  We also study a geometric analogue of the power of choice where, at each step, an agent is given two random points sampled independently and uniformly from $\mathbb{T}^d$ and must add exactly one of them to the already constructed point set. When the agent is allowed to make their choice with the knowledge of the entire sequence of random points (offline 2-choice), we show that they can construct a connected graph at the first time $t$ when none of the first $t$ pairs of proposed points contains two isolated vertices in the graph induced by $(X_i)_{i=1}^{2t}$, and maintain connectivity thereafter. We also derive analogous results for $k$-connectivity and Hamiltonicity. This shows that each of the said properties can be attained two times faster (time-wise) and with four times fewer points in the offline 2-choice process compared to the 1-choice process.
  In the online version where the agent only knows the process until the current time step, we show that $k$-connectivity and Hamiltonicity cannot be significantly accelerated (time-wise) but may be realised on two times fewer points compared to the 1-choice analogue.</description>

      <title>Diffusive geodesics wandering in networks of rigid chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an ensemble of spatial networks built from the junctions of hindered-rotation chains, incorporating directional correlations between bonds, an aspect ignored in the standard network modeling paradigm. The emergent random networks support geodesics with a wandering exponent $\xi = 1/2$, and a travel-time fluctuation exponent $\chi = 0$, consistent with the KPZ relation, yet violating the bound~$\chi\geq1/8$ predicted in the Poissonian framework. Transverse deviations follow the Kolmogorov distribution, indicating similarities between Brownian bridge excursions and geodesics in a random medium with correlated edges orientations. These results reveal a new universality class of Euclidean first-passage percolation, where local orientational memory reshapes transport properties and challenges existing bounds for random spatial networks.</description>

      <title>Towards Continuous-Time Approximations for Stochastic Gradient Descent without Replacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient optimization algorithms using epochs, that is those based on stochastic gradient descent without replacement (SGDo), are predominantly used to train machine learning models in practice. However, the mathematical theory of SGDo and related algorithms remain underexplored compared to their "with replacement" and "one-pass" counterparts. In this article, we propose a stochastic, continuous-time approximation to SGDo with additive noise based on a Young differential equation driven by a stochastic process we call an "epoched Brownian motion". We show its usefulness by proving the almost sure convergence of the continuous-time approximation for strongly convex objectives and learning rate schedules of the form $u_t = \frac{1}{(1+t)^\beta}, \beta \in (0,1)$. Moreover, we compute an upper bound on the asymptotic rate of almost sure convergence, which is as good or better than previous results for SGDo.</description>

      <title>Spectral Theory of Krein-Feller Type Operators and Applications in Stochastic Fractional Elliptic and Parabolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that the space $C^{\infty}_{W,V}(\mathbb{T})$, introduced in Simas and Sousa (Potential Analysis, 2025), is the natural regularity space for solutions of the eigenvalue problem $\Delta_{W,V} u = \lambda u$ on the torus $\mathbb{T}$, where $\Delta_{W,V} = \frac{d^{+}}{dV}\frac{d^{-}}{dW}$ is the Krein Feller operator in the case where $W$ and $V$ are strictly increasing and right continuous (respectively left continuous), possibly with dense sets of discontinuities. In this work we provide conditions ensuring that every function in $C^{\infty}_{W,V}(\mathbb{T})$, which may be highly discontinuous, admits a series expansion that generalizes the classical Taylor expansion. A central feature of our approach is that all proofs are nonstandard, since classical analytical and spectral arguments cannot be adapted to this singular setting. Using these methods we characterize the eigenvectors of $\Delta_{W,V}$ in terms of generalized trigonometric functions and obtain an asymptotic lower bound for the associated eigenvalues. We also derive a sharp upper bound for the convergence exponent of these eigenvalues, and as a consequence we prove that $C^{\infty}_{W,V}(\mathbb{T})$ is a nuclear space. Further consequences include results on the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of compact operators and improvements in traceability. As a final application we establish existence results for generalized fractional stochastic and deterministic differential equations, as well as for parabolic stochastic partial differential equations acting on nuclear spaces.</description>

      <title>Exact 3-D Channel Impulse Response for Spherical Receivers with Arbitrary Drift Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate channel modeling for spherical absorbing receivers is fundamental to the design of realistic molecular multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. While advanced modulation schemes have been proposed to mitigate interference, determining the channel impulse response (CIR) under arbitrary flow directions remains a challenge; existing exact solutions are restricted to either 1-D/no-drift scenarios or planar receiver geometries. Addressing this gap, we derive the first exact analytical CIR for a spherical receiver in a 3-D molecular communication system with uniform drift in an arbitrary direction. Unlike prior approximations that ignore the angle between the drift and the transmission axis, our approach utilizes the Girsanov theorem to analytically transform the hitting-time distribution from a stationary medium to a drifted one. The proposed closed-form expression not only eliminates modeling errors inherent in previous approximations for off-axis receivers but also enables efficient parameter-space exploration of critical system metrics (e.g., peak time and amplitude), a task that would be computationally costly with pure simulation-based approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate the contraction properties of $p$-Wasserstein distances with respect to convolution in Euclidean spaces both qualitatively and quantitatively. We connect this question to the question of uniform convexity of the Kantorovich functional on which there was substantial recent progress (mostly for $p=2$ and partially for $p&gt;1$). Motivated by this connection we extend these uniform convexity results to the case $p=1$, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Next-order asymptotics for the volume of Schatten balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The volume of the unit balls of self-adjoint finite-dimensional Schatten $p$-classes of $n\times n$-matrices, $1\le p\le \infty$, is only known exactly for $p=2$ and $p=\infty$. We give an asymptotic expansion of the logarithmic volume to order $o(n)$ for general $p\ge\frac{3}{2}$. The proof rests on asymptotics for the partition function of $\beta$-ensembles due to Lebl\'e and Serfaty [Invent. Math. 210(3):645--757, 2017]. Independently, the case $p\ge 2$ was obtained by Dworaczek Guera, Memin and Pain [arXiv:2511.05386]. In the complex case the asymptotic expansion is continued to order $O(1)$ for all $p\ge 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The monotonicity of the Mittag-Leffler function $E_{\alpha}$ with respect to the parameter $\alpha$ is investigated, via some convex ordering properties for related random variables. In particular, it is shown that the mapping $\alpha\mapsto E_\alpha(x^\alpha)$ decreases on $(0,2)$ for all $x&gt; 0$, that the mapping $\alpha\mapsto E_\alpha(-x^\alpha)$ decreases on $(0,1)$ for all $x\ge 1$ and that the mapping $\alpha\mapsto E_\alpha(\Gamma(1+\alpha)x)$ decreases on $(0,1)$ for all $x\in{\mathbb R}^\ast.$ Analogous results are presented for the two parameter Mittag-Leffler functions $E_{\alpha, \beta}$ with $\beta\ge \alpha,$ with an emphasis on the extremal case $\beta =\alpha.$ Several applications of these results are discussed for Abelian integral equations and subdiffusions.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Maximal Leakage over Bayesian Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximal leakage quantifies the leakage of information from data $X \in \mathcal{X}$ due to an observation $Y$. While fundamental properties of maximal leakage, such as data processing, sub-additivity, and its connection to mutual information, are well-established, its behavior over Bayesian networks is not well-understood and existing bounds are primarily limited to binary $\mathcal{X}$. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of maximal leakage over Bayesian networks with finite alphabets. Our bounds on maximal leakage are established by utilizing coupling-based characterizations which exist for channels satisfying certain conditions. Furthermore, we provide more general conditions under which such coupling characterizations hold for $|\mathcal{X}| = 4$. In the course of our analysis, we also present a new simultaneous coupling result on maximal leakage exponents. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed bounds with some examples.</description>

We establish the local analyticity of the Lyapunov moment function and the unique stationary measure on the projective space with respect to $\mu$ in the total variation topology. As a consequence, we obtain the analyticity of the asymptotic variance and all higher-order Lyapunov moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a complete Riemannian manifold $M$ with a lower Ricci curvature bound, we consider barycenters in the Wasserstein space $\mathcal{W}_2(M)$ of probability measures on $M$. We refer to them as Wasserstein barycenters, which by definition are probability measures on $M$. The goal of this article is to present a novel approach to proving their absolute continuity. We introduce a new class of displacement functionals exploiting the Hessian equality for Wasserstein barycenters. To provide suitable instances of such functionals, we revisit Souslin space theory, Dunford-Pettis theorem and the de la Vall\'ee Poussin criterion for uniform integrability. Our method shows that if a probability measure $\mathbb{P}$ on $\mathcal{W}_2(M)$ gives mass to absolutely continuous measures on $M$, then its unique barycenter is also absolutely continuous. This generalizes the previous results on compact manifolds by Kim and Pass arXiv:1412.7726 [math.AP] .</description>

Abstract: Random processes with stationary increments and intrinsic random processes are two concepts commonly used to deal with non-stationary random processes. They are broader classes than stationary random processes and conceptually closely related to each other. This paper illustrates the relationship between these two concepts of stochastic processes and shows that, under certain conditions, they are equivalent on the real line.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the ergodic behavior of a system of particules, subject to collisions, before it exits a fixed subdomain of its state space. This system is composed of several one-dimensional ordered Brownian particules in interaction with electrostatic repulsions, which is usually referred as the (generalized) Dyson Brownian motion. The starting points of our analysis are the work [E. C{\'e}pa and D. L{\'e}pingle, 1997 Probab. Theory Relat. Fields] which provides existence and uniqueness of such a system subject to collisions via the theory of multivalued SDEs and a Krein-Rutman type theorem derived in [A. Guillin, B. Nectoux, L.

      <title>Extension of a theorem of Wschebor to free and matrix Brownian motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1992, M. Wschebor proved a theorem on the convergence of small increments of the Brownian motion. Since then, it has been extended to various processes. We prove a version of this theorem for the Hermitian Brownian motion and the free Brownian motion. Since these theorems deal with a convergence to a deterministic limit, we prove also the convergence in distribution of the corresponding fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a non-exchangeable system of interacting quantum particles with mean-field type interactions, subject to continuous measurement on dense graphs. In the mean-field limit, we derive a graphon-based quantum filtering system, establish its well-posedness, and prove propagation of chaos for multi-class bosonic systems with blockwise interactions. We then discuss applications to quantum state preparation and quantum graphon games.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Rates of Convergence for Hermitian Unitary Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides mesoscopic rates of convergence (ROC) with respect to the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance for the eigenvalue determinantal point processes (DPPs) from the three major Hermitian unitary ensembles, the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), the Laguerre Unitary Ensemble (LUE), and the Jacobi Unitary Ensemble (JUE) to their limiting point processes. We prove ROCs for the bulk of the GUE spectrum, the hard edge of the LUE spectrum, and the soft edges of the GUE, LUE, and JUE spectrums. These results are called mesoscopic because we are able to directly compare the point counts between the converging and limit DPPs in a range of scales. We are able to achieve these results by controlling the trace class norm of the integral operators determined by the DPP kernels.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of the conformally covariant geodesic metric on non-simple conformal loop ensemble gaskets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the canonical geodesic metric on the gasket of conformal loop ensembles (CLE$_\kappa$) in the regime $\kappa \in (4,8)$ where the loops intersect themselves, each other, and the domain boundary. Previous work of the authors and V. Ambrosio showed that the subsequential limits associated with certain approximation procedures for such a metric exist and are non-trivial. In this work, we show that the limit exists by proving that there is at most one geodesic metric on the CLE$_\kappa$ gasket which satisfies certain properties. Further, we obtain that the limit is conformally covariant. This paper is the foundation of future work which show that the metric for $\kappa=6$ is the continuum scaling limit of the chemical distance metric for critical percolation in two dimensions. We further conjecture that for $\kappa \in (4,8)$, the geodesic CLE$_\kappa$ metric is the scaling limit of the chemical distance metric associated with discrete models that converge to CLE$_\kappa$.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of Markov shifts: part II-LLT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove Local Central Limit Theorems (LLT) for partial sums of the form $S_n=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}f_j(...,X_{j-1},X_j,X_{j+1},...)$, where $(X_j)$ is a Markov chains with equicontinuous conditional probabilities satisfying contraction conditions close in spirit to Dobrushin's, and some ``physicality" assumptions and $f_j$ are equicontinuous functions. Our conditions will always be in force when the chain takes values on a metric space and have uniformly bounded away from $0$ backward transition densities with respect to a measure which assigns uniform positive mass to certain ``balls".
  This paper complements \cite{MarShif1} where Berry-Esseen theorems, were proven for (not necessarily continuous) functions satisfying certain approximation conditions. Our results address a question posed by D. Dolgopyat and O. Sarig in \cite[Section 1.5]{DS}.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic formalism for continuous-time quantum Markov semigroups: the detailed balance condition, entropy, pressure and equilibrium quantum processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $M_n(\mathbb{C})$ denotes the set of $n$ by $n$ complex matrices. Consider continuous time quantum semigroups $\mathcal{P}_t= e^{t\, \mathcal{L}}$, $t \geq 0$, where $\mathcal{L}:M_n(\mathbb{C}) \to M_n(\mathbb{C})$ is the infinitesimal generator. If we assume that $\mathcal{L}(I)=0$, we will call $e^{t\, \mathcal{L}}$, $t \geq 0$ a quantum Markov semigroup. Given a stationary density matrix $\rho= \rho_{\mathcal{L}}$, for the quantum Markov semigroup $\mathcal{P}_t$, $t \geq 0$, we can define a continuous time stationary quantum Markov process, denoted by $X_t$, $t \geq 0.$ Given an {\it a priori} Laplacian operator $\mathcal{L}_0:M_n(\mathbb{C}) \to M_n(\mathbb{C})$, we will present a natural concept of entropy for a class of density matrices on $M_n(\mathbb{C})$. Given an Hermitian operator $A:\mathbb{C}^n\to \mathbb{C}^n$ (which plays the role of an Hamiltonian), we will study a version of the variational principle of pressure for $A$. A density matrix $\rho_A$ maximizing pressure will be called an equilibrium density matrix. From $\rho_A$ we will derive a new infinitesimal generator $\mathcal{L}_A$. Finally, the continuous time quantum Markov process defined by the semigroup $\mathcal{P}_t= e^{t\, \mathcal{L}_A}$, $t \geq 0$, and an initial stationary density matrix, will be called the continuous time equilibrium quantum Markov process for the Hamiltonian $A$. It corresponds to the quantum thermodynamical equilibrium for the action of the Hamiltonian $A$.</description>

      <title>Muller's ratchet in a near-critical regime: tournament versus fitness proportional selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Muller's ratchet, in its prototype version, models a haploid, asexual population whose size~$N$ is constant over the generations. Slightly deleterious mutations are acquired along the lineages at a constant rate, and individuals carrying less mutations have a selective advantage. The classical variant considers {\it fitness proportional} selection, but other fitness schemes are conceivable as well. Inspired by the work of Etheridge et al. ([EPW09]) we propose a parameter scaling which fits well to the ``near-critical'' regime that was in the focus of [EPW09] (and in which the mutation-selection ratio diverges logarithmically as $N\to \infty$). Using a Moran model, we investigate the``rule of thumb'' given in [EPW09] for the click rate of the ``classical ratchet'' by putting it into the context of new results on the long-time evolution of the size of the best class of the ratchet with (binary) tournament selection, which (other than that of the classical ratchet) follows an autonomous dynamics up to the time of its extinction.
  In [GSW23] it was discovered that the tournament ratchet has a hierarchy of dual processes which can be constructed on top of an Ancestral Selection graph with a Poisson decoration. For a regime in which the mutation/selection-ratio remains bounded away from 1, this was used in [GSW23] to reveal the asymptotics of the click rates as well as that of the type frequency profile between clicks. We will describe how these ideas can be extended to the near-critical regime in which the mutation-selection ratio of the tournament ratchet converges to 1 as $N\to \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\gamma_{n}= O (\log^{-c}n)$ and let $\nu$ be the infinite product measure whose $n$-th marginal is Bernoulli$(1/2+\gamma_{n})$. We show that $c=1/2$ is the threshold, above which $\nu$-almost every point is simply Poisson generic in the sense of Peres-Weiss, and below which this can fail. This provides a range in which $\nu$ is singular with respect to the uniform product measure, but $\nu$-almost every point is simply Poisson generic.</description>

      <title>Consistent spectral clustering in sparse tensor block models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-order clustering aims to classify objects in multiway datasets that are prevalent in various fields such as bioinformatics, recommendation systems, and social network analysis. Such data are often sparse and high-dimensional, posing significant statistical and computational challenges. This paper introduces a tensor block model specifically designed for sparse integer-valued data tensors. We propose a simple spectral clustering algorithm augmented with a trimming step to mitigate noise fluctuations, and identify a density threshold that ensures the algorithm's consistency. Our approach models sparsity using a sub-Poisson noise concentration framework, accommodating heavier than sub-Gaussian tails. Remarkably, this natural class of tensor block models is closed under aggregation across arbitrary modes. Consequently, we obtain a comprehensive framework for evaluating the tradeoff between signal loss and noise reduction incurred by aggregating data. The analysis is based on a novel concentration bound for sparse random Gram matrices. The theoretical findings are illustrated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Characteristic polynomial of generalized Ewens random permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the convergence of the characteristic polynomial for random permutation matrices sampled from the generalized Ewens distribution. Under this distribution, the measure of a given permutation depends only on its cycle structure, according to certain weights assigned to each cycle length. The proof is based on uniform control of the characteristic polynomial using results from the singularity analysis of generating functions, together with the convergence of traces to explicit random variables expressed via a Poisson family. The limit function is the exponential of a Poisson series which has already appeared in the case of uniform permutation matrices. It is the Poisson analog of the Gaussian Holomorphic Chaos, related to the limit of characteristic polynomials for other matrix models such as Circular Ensembles, i.i.d. matrices, and Gaussian elliptic matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work in dynamic causal inference introduced a class of discrete-time stochastic processes that generalize martingale difference sequences and arrays as follows: the random variates in each sequence have expectation zero given certain lagged filtrations but not given the natural filtration. We formalize this class of stochastic processes and prove a stable central limit theorem (CLT) via a Bernstein blocking scheme and an application of the classical martingale CLT. We generalize our limit theorem to vector-valued processes via the Cram\'er-Wold device and develop a simple form for the limiting variance. We demonstrate the application of these results to a problem in dynamic causal inference and present a simulation study supporting their validity.</description>

      <title>Mean-square exponential stability of exact and numerical solutions for neutral stochastic delay differential equations with Markovian switching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the mean-square exponential stability of neutral stochastic differential delay equations (NSDDEs) with Markovian switching. The analysis addresses the complexities arising from the interaction between the neutral term, time-varying delays, and structural changes governed by a continuous-time Markov chain. We establish novel and practical criteria for the mean-square exponential stability of both the underlying system and its numerical approximations via the Euler-Maruyama method. Furthermore, we prove that the numerical scheme can reproduce the exponential decay rate of the true solution with arbitrary accuracy, provided the step size is sufficiently small. The theoretical results are supported by a numerical example that illustrates their effectiveness.</description>
