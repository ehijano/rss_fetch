      <title>Robust Identification in Randomized Experiments with Noncompliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a robust identification of causal parameters in a randomized experiment setting with noncompliance where the standard local average treatment effect assumptions could be violated. Following Li, K\'edagni, and Mourifi\'e (2024), we propose a misspecification robust bound for a real-valued vector of various causal parameters. We discuss identification under two sets of weaker assumptions: random assignment and exclusion restriction (without monotonicity), and random assignment and monotonicity (without exclusion restriction). We introduce two causal parameters: the local average treatment-controlled direct effect (LATCDE), and the local average instrument-controlled direct effect (LAICDE). Under the random assignment and monotonicity assumptions, we derive sharp bounds on the local average treatment-controlled direct effects for the always-takers and never-takers, respectively, and the total average controlled direct effect for the compliers. Additionally, we show that the intent-to-treat effect can be expressed as a convex weighted average of these three effects. Finally, we apply our method on the proximity to college instrument and find that growing up near a four-year college increases the wage of never-takers (who represent more than 70% of the population) by a range of 4.15% to 27.07%.</description>

      <title>Robust Estimation of Regression Models with Potentially Endogenous Outliers via a Modern Optimization Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the robust estimation of linear regression models in the presence of potentially endogenous outliers. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that existing $L_1$-regularized estimation methods, including the Huber estimator and the least absolute deviation (LAD) estimator, exhibit significant bias when outliers are endogenous. Motivated by this finding, we investigate $L_0$-regularized estimation methods. We propose systematic heuristic algorithms, notably an iterative hard-thresholding algorithm and a local combinatorial search refinement, to solve the combinatorial optimization problem of the \(L_0\)-regularized estimation efficiently. Our Monte Carlo simulations yield two key results: (i) The local combinatorial search algorithm substantially improves solution quality compared to the initial projection-based hard-thresholding algorithm while offering greater computational efficiency than directly solving the mixed integer optimization problem. (ii) The $L_0$-regularized estimator demonstrates superior performance in terms of bias reduction, estimation accuracy, and out-of-sample prediction errors compared to $L_1$-regularized alternatives. We illustrate the practical value of our method through an empirical application to stock return forecasting.</description>

      <title>Prewhitened Long-Run Variance Estimation Robust to Nonstationarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.02235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a nonparametric nonlinear VAR prewhitened long-run variance (LRV) estimator for the construction of standard errors robust to autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity that can be used for hypothesis testing in a variety of contexts including the linear regression model. Existing methods either are theoretically valid only under stationarity and have poor finite-sample properties under nonstationarity (i.e., fixed-b methods), or are theoretically valid under the null hypothesis but lead to tests that are not consistent under nonstationary alternative hypothesis (i.e., both fixed-b and traditional HAC estimators). The proposed estimator accounts explicitly for nonstationarity, unlike previous prewhitened procedures which are known to be unreliable, and leads to tests with accurate null rejection rates and good monotonic power. We also establish MSE bounds for LRV estimation that are sharper than previously established and use them to determine the data-dependent bandwidths.</description>

      <title>Theory of Evolutionary Spectra for Heteroskedasticity and Autocorrelation Robust Inference in Possibly Misspecified and Nonstationary Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.02981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of evolutionary spectra for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation robust (HAR) inference when the data may not satisfy second-order stationarity. Nonstationarity is a common feature of economic time series which may arise either from parameter variation or model misspecification. In such a context, the theories that support HAR inference are either not applicable or do not provide accurate approximations. HAR tests standardized by existing long-run variance estimators then may display size distortions and little or no power. This issue can be more severe for methods that use long bandwidths (i.e., fixed-b HAR tests). We introduce a class of nonstationary processes that have a time-varying spectral representation which evolves continuously except at a finite number of time points. We present an extension of the classical heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimators that applies two smoothing procedures. One is over the lagged autocovariances, akin to classical HAC estimators, and the other is over time. The latter element is important to flexibly account for nonstationarity. We name them double kernel HAC (DK-HAC) estimators. We show the consistency of the estimators and obtain an optimal DK-HAC estimator under the mean squared error (MSE) criterion. Overall, HAR tests standardized by the proposed DK-HAC estimators are competitive with fixed-b HAR tests, when the latter work well, with regards to size control even when there is strong dependence. Notably, in those empirically relevant situations in which previous HAR tests are undersized and have little or no power, the DK-HAC estimator leads to tests that have good size and power.</description>

      <title>The Fixed-b Limiting Distribution and the ERP of HAR Tests Under Nonstationarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the nonstandard limiting distribution of HAR test statistics under fixed-b asymptotics is not pivotal (even after studentization) when the data are nonstationarity. It takes the form of a complicated function of Gaussian processes and depends on the integrated local long-run variance and on on the second moments of the relevant series (e.g., of the regressors and errors for the case of the linear regression model). Hence, existing fixed-b inference methods based on stationarity are not theoretically valid in general. The nuisance parameters entering the fixed-b limiting distribution can be consistently estimated under small-b asymptotics but only with nonparametric rate of convergence. Hence, We show that the error in rejection probability (ERP) is an order of magnitude larger than that under stationarity and is also larger than that of HAR tests based on HAC estimators under conventional asymptotics. These theoretical results reconcile with recent finite-sample evidence in Casini (2021) and Casini, Deng and Perron (2021) who showing that fixed-b HAR tests can perform poorly when the data are nonstationary. They can be conservative under the null hypothesis and have non-monotonic power under the alternative hypothesis irrespective of how large the sample size is.</description>

      <title>Estimating Discrete Games of Complete Information: Bringing Logit Back in the Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05002v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating discrete games of complete information is often computationally difficult due to partial identification and the absence of closed-form moment characterizations. This paper proposes computationally tractable approaches to estimation and inference that remove the computational burden associated with equilibria enumeration, numerical simulation, and grid search. Separately for unordered and ordered-actions games, I construct an identified set characterized by a finite set of generalized likelihood-based conditional moment inequalities that are convex in (a subvector of) structural model parameters under the standard logit assumption on unobservables. I use simulation and empirical examples to show that the proposed approaches generate informative identified sets and can be several orders of magnitude faster than existing estimation methods.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Multivariate Quantile Regression with alternative Time-varying Volatility Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes a novel Bayesian multivariate quantile regression to forecast the tail behavior of energy commodities, where the homoskedasticity assumption is relaxed to allow for time-varying volatility. In particular, we exploit the mixture representation of the multivariate asymmetric Laplace likelihood and the Cholesky-type decomposition of the scale matrix to introduce stochastic volatility and GARCH processes and then provide an efficient MCMC to estimate them. The proposed models outperform the homoskedastic benchmark mainly when predicting the distribution's tails. We provide a model combination using a quantile score-based weighting scheme, which leads to improved performances, notably when no single model uniformly outperforms the other across quantiles, time, or variables.</description>

      <title>Decision Theory for Treatment Choice Problems with Partial Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply classical statistical decision theory to a large class of treatment choice problems with partial identification, revealing important theoretical and practical challenges but also interesting research opportunities. The challenges are: In a general class of problems with Gaussian likelihood, all decision rules are admissible; it is maximin-welfare optimal to ignore all data; and, for severe enough partial identification, there are infinitely many minimax-regret optimal decision rules, all of which sometimes randomize the policy recommendation. The opportunities are: We introduce a profiled regret criterion that can reveal important differences between rules and render some of them inadmissible; and we uniquely characterize the minimax-regret optimal rule that least frequently randomizes. We apply our results to aggregation of experimental estimates for policy adoption, to extrapolation of Local Average Treatment Effects, and to policy making in the presence of omitted variable bias.</description>

      <title>Efficient Asymmetric Causality Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymmetric causality tests are increasingly gaining popularity in different scientific fields. This approach corresponds better to reality since logical reasons behind asymmetric behavior exist and need to be considered in empirical investigations. Hatemi-J (2012) introduced the asymmetric causality tests via partial cumulative sums for positive and negative components of the variables operating within the vector autoregressive (VAR) model. However, since the n residuals across the equations in the VAR model are not independent, the ordinary least squares method for estimating the parameters is not efficient. Additionally, asymmetric causality tests mean having different causal parameters (i.e., for positive or negative components), thus, it is crucial to assess not only if these causal parameters are individually statistically significant, but also if their difference is statistically significant. Consequently, tests of difference between estimated causal parameters should explicitly be conducted, which are neglected in the existing literature. The purpose of the current paper is to deal with these issues explicitly. An application is provided, and ten different hypotheses pertinent to the asymmetric causal interaction between two largest financial markets worldwide are efficiently tested within a multivariate setting.</description>

      <title>Change-Point Analysis of Time Series with Evolutionary Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.02031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops change-point methods for the spectrum of a locally stationary time series. We focus on series with a bounded spectral density that change smoothly under the null hypothesis but exhibits change-points or becomes less smooth under the alternative. We address two local problems. The first is the detection of discontinuities (or breaks) in the spectrum at unknown dates and frequencies. The second involves abrupt yet continuous changes in the spectrum over a short time period at an unknown frequency without signifying a break. Both problems can be cast into changes in the degree of smoothness of the spectral density over time. We consider estimation and minimax-optimal testing. We determine the optimal rate for the minimax distinguishable boundary, i.e., the minimum break magnitude such that we are able to uniformly control type I and type II errors. We propose a novel procedure for the estimation of the change-points based on a wild sequential top-down algorithm and show its consistency under shrinking shifts and possibly growing number of change-points. Our method can be used across many fields and a companion program is made available in popular software packages.</description>
