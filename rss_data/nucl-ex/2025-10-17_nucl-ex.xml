      <title>Measurement of the p$-\Sigma^+$ correlation function in pp collisions at $\sqrt{\textit{s}}=13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, the first measurement of the femtoscopic correlation of protons and $\Sigma^+$ hyperons is presented and used to study the p$-\Sigma^+$ interaction. The measurement is performed with the ALICE detector in high-multiplicity triggered pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. The $\Sigma^+$ hyperons are reconstructed using a missing-mass approach in the decay channel to $\textrm{p} + \pi^0$ with $\pi^0\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$, while both $\Sigma^+$ and protons are identified using a machine learning approach. These techniques result in a high reconstruction efficiency and purity, which allows the measurement of the p$-\Sigma^+$ correlation function for the first time. Thanks to the high significance achieved in the p$-\Sigma^+$ correlation signal, it is possible to discriminate between the predictions of different models of the N$-\Sigma$ interaction and to accomplish a first determination of the p$-\Sigma^+$ scattering parameters.</description>

      <title>Efficiency correction of particle-averaged quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive analytic formulas to reconstruct particle-averaged quantities from experimental results that suffer from the efficiency loss of particle measurements. These formulas are derived under the assumption that the probabilities of observing individual particles are independent. The formulas do not agree with the conventionally used intuitive formulas.</description>

      <title>Beam Energy Measurement using a Bayesian Approach with the Stacked Foil Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a practical method to measure the energy of proton beams at a medical cyclotron using the stacked foil technique in combination with a Bayesian inference method. By measuring the $^{48}$V activity induced in a stack of irradiated titanium foils, the proton energy can be inferred without relying on direct current or charge measurements, making the method suitable even for low-vacuum environments or air-exposed setups. This technique is further extended to configurations where the beam energy is degraded to levels around 8 MeV. A Bayesian fit of the measured activity profile allows not only for a robust energy estimation but also for a consistent treatment of uncertainties and nuisance parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to validate the underlying assumptions, including the impact of energy dispersion or cross-section uncertainties. Our results demonstrate that this method provides accurate beam energy measurements across several typical experimental setups used at the Bern Medical Cyclotron. Additionally, we evaluate the sensitivity of the method to the choice of nuclear cross-section data and assess how the number of foils in the stack affects the uncertainty in the inferred beam energy.</description>

      <title>Probing the sensitivity of anisotropic flow coefficients to the initial nuclear structure in pO and OO collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: RHIC and LHC have injected $^{16}\rm O$ nuclei in their accelerator complexes with a focus on investigating collectivity and the origin of quark-gluon plasma signatures in small collision systems. The $^{16}\rm O$ nuclei are known to possess clusters of $\alpha$-particles ($^{4}\rm He$) inside the nucleus. This paper attempts to study the clustered-nuclear-geometry dependence of anisotropic flow coefficients such as elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$), which are sensitive to the nuclear geometry of colliding nuclei. The study is performed in pO and OO collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=9.61$~TeV and 7~TeV respectively, employing a hybrid model encompassing IP-Glasma + MUSIC + iSS + UrQMD. The results of the clustered nuclear geometry are compared with those of the Woods\,--\,Saxon nuclear profile. Both initial and final state anisotropies are estimated. This study is thus one of its first kind, where the study of anisotropic flow coefficients for pO and OO collisions is presented using a hybrid hydrodynamics model. While the effect of $\alpha$-clustering in pO is found to be small, it is significant for each observable studied in OO collisions. It is also observed that the magnitude of this effect has a noteworthy dependence on the size of the \textsuperscript{4}He.</description>
