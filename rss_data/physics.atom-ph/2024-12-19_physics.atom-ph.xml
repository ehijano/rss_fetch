      <title>Characterization of near-infrared to telecom frequency conversion in a rubidium-filled hollow-core photonic-crystal fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate near-infrared to telecommunications frequency conversion via a diamond four-wave mixing scheme in rubidium vapor contained within a hollow-core photonic-crystal fiber. The strong light-atom interaction in the fiber results in lower pump power requirements and higher conversion efficiency than can be achieved under equivalent conditions in a rubidium vapor cell. We also observe non-intuitive pump and signal frequency dependence of the four-wave mixing efficiency in the fiber due to the large nonlinearities present in the system. These results indicate the potential for hollow-core fibers to provide a scalable solution to quantum information network infrastructure, with additional modelling required for a full understanding of the extreme atom-light interaction effects present.</description>

      <title>A Quantum-Science-Ready Triel Atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold gases of atoms from Main Group III (Group 13) of the Periodic Table, also known as "triel elements," have great potential for a new generation of quantum matter experiments. The first magneto-optical trap of a triel element (indium) was recently realized, but more progress is needed before a triel is ready for modern quantum science experiments. Cutting edge quantum science can be performed with atoms that are cooled to the 10 uK level or below, prepared in pure quantum states, and optically trapped. Here we report the achievement of all three of these milestones in atomic indium. First, we perform polarization gradient cooling of an indium gas to 15 uK. Second, we spin polarize the gas into a single hyperfine sublevel of either the $5P_{1/2}$ indium ground state or the $5P_{3/2}$ metastable state. Third, we confine indium in a 1064 nm optical lattice, achieving a 3 s trap lifetime. With these results, indium is now a candidate for a next generation quantum research platform.</description>

      <title>Cold source of atomic hydrogen for loading large magnetic traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13981v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a design and performance tests of an intense source of cold hydrogen atoms for loading large magnetic traps. Our source is based on a cryogenic dissociator of molecular hydrogen at 0.6 K followed by a series of thermal accommodators at 0.5, 0.2 and 0.13 K with inner surfaces covered by a superfluid helium film. All components are thermally anchored to corresponding stages of a dilution refrigerator. The source provides a continuous flux of 7$\cdot$$10^{13}$ H atoms/s in a temperature range of 130-200 mK. We have successfully used the source for loading a large Ioffe-Pritchard magnetic trap recently built in our laboratory [arXiv:2108.09123 or Rev. Sci. Instr. 93 (2), 023201 (2022)]. Calorimetric measurements of the atomic recombination heat allow reliable determination of the atomic flux and H gas density in the trap. We have tested the performance of the source and loading of H atoms into the trap at various configurations of the trapping field, reducing the magnetic barrier height to 75% and 50% of the nominal value of 0.8 T (0.54 K) as well as at the open configuration of the trap at its lower end, when the atoms are in contact with the trapping cell walls covered by a superfluid helium film. In the latter case, raising the trapping cell temperature to 200-250 mK, the low-field seeking atoms at densities exceeding 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ can be stored for the time over 1000 s, sufficiently long for experiments on precision spectroscopy of cold H gas.</description>

      <title>On Compton ionization of a hydrogen atom by twisted photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The differential probability of the process of Compton ionization of a hydrogen atom by a cylindrical electromagnetic wave is calculated taking into account the finite size of the target, which resulted in the appearance of a dependence of this value on the angular momentum of the cylindrical wave. It is shown that the use of a cylindrical wave instead of a plane wave does not lead to new angular distributions of the reaction products.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of Magnetic Field Sensing with Optically Pumped Magnetometers for Magnetic Detection Electrical Impedance Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Detection Electrical Impedance Tomography is a novel technique that could enable non-invasive imaging of fast neural activity in the brain. However, commercial magnetometers are not suited to its technical requirements. Computational modelling was used to determine the optimal number, size and orientation of magnetometers, to inform the future development of MDEIT-specific magnetometers. Images were reconstructed using three sensing axes, arrays of 16 to 160 magnetometers, and cell sizes ranging from 1 to 18 mm. Image quality was evaluated visually and with the weighted spatial variance. Single-axis measurements normal to the surface provided the best image quality, and image quality increased with an increase in sensor number and size. This study can inform future OPM design, showing the size of the vapour cell need not be constrained to that of commercially available OPMs, and that a small array of single-axis, highly sensitive sensors is optimal for MDEIT.</description>

      <title>Two-qubit gate protocols with microwave-dressed Rydberg ions in a linear Paul trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold trapped atomic ions excited into highly energetic Rydberg states constitute a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing. Elementary building blocks for such tasks are high-fidelity and sufficiently fast entangling two-qubit gates, which can be achieved via strong dipole-dipole interactions between microwave-dressed Rydberg ions, as recently demonstrated in a breakthrough experiment $[\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2152-9}{1}]$. We theoretically investigate the performance of three protocols leading to controlled-phase gate operations. Starting from a microscopic description of Rydberg ions in a linear Paul trap, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that faithfully captures the essential dynamics underlying the gate protocols. We then use an optimization scheme to fine-tune experimentally controllable parameters like laser detuning and Rabi frequency to yield maximal gate fidelity under each studied protocol. We show how non-adiabatic transitions resulting from fast laser driving relative to the characteristic time scales of the system detrimentally affect the fidelity. Despite this, we demonstrate that in the realistic scenario of Rydberg ions with finite radiative lifetimes, optimizing the best found gate protocol enables achievement of fidelities as high as $99.25\,\%$ for a gate time of $0.2\,\mu\mathrm{s}$. This considerably undercuts entangling gate durations between ground-state ions, for which gate times are typically limited by the comparably slower time scales of vibrational modes. Overall, this places trapped Rydberg ions into the regime where fast high-accuracy quantum computing and eventually quantum error correction become possible.</description>

      <title>Determining the $^3$P$_0$ excited-state tune-out wavelength of $^{174}$Yb in a triple-magic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise state-dependent control of optical potentials is of great importance for various applications utilizing cold neutral atoms. In particular, tune-out wavelengths for the clock state pair in alkaline-earth(-like) atoms provide maximally state-selective trap conditions that hold promise for the realization of novel approaches in quantum computation and simulation. While several ground-state tune-out wavelengths have been determined, similar experimental studies for metastable excited states are challenged by inelastic collisions and Raman losses, so far prohibiting precise measurements of excited-state tune-out conditions. In this work we report on the measurement of a tune-out wavelength for the metastable $^3$P$_0$ clock state in $^{174}$Yb at $519.920(9)\,$THz. In order to circumvent collisional losses, we isolate individual $^3$P$_0$ atoms in a clock-magic-wavelength lattice at $759\,$nm. To minimize the limitation imposed by Raman scattering, we further implement resolved sideband cooling on the clock transition, which allows us to reduce the lattice depth and surpass lifetimes of $5\,$s. The precision of the tune-out measurement is further enhanced by fluorescence imaging in a triple-magic configuration, where we implement molasses cooling on the $^3$P$_1$ intercombination line and identify a magic angle of $38.5(9)^\circ$ in the clock-magic lattice.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional imaging of electromagnetic fields via light sheet fluorescence imaging with Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to image electromagnetic fields holds key scientific and industrial applications, including electromagnetic compatibility, diagnostics of high-frequency devices, and experimental scientific work involving field interactions. Generally electric and magnetic field measurements require conductive elements which significantly distort the field. However, electromagnetic fields can be measured without altering the field via the shift they induce on Rydberg states of alkali atoms in atomic vapor, which are highly sensitive to electric fields. Previous field measurements using Rydberg atoms utilized electromagnetically induced transparency to read out the shift on the states induced by the fields, but did not provide spatial resolution. In this work, we demonstrate that electromagnetically induced transparency can be spatially resolved by imaging the fluorescence of the atoms. We demonstrate that this can be used to image $\sim$ V/cm scale electric fields in the DC-GHz range and $\sim$ mT scale static magnetic fields, with minimal distortion to the fields. We also demonstrate the ability to image $\sim$ 5 mV/cm scale fields for resonant microwave radiation and measure standing waves generated by the partial reflection of the vapor cell walls in this regime. With additional processing techniques like lock-in detection, we predict that our sensitivities could reach down to nV/cm levels. We perform this field imaging with a spatial resolution of 160 $\mu$m, limited by our imaging system, and estimate the fundamental resolution limitation to be 5 $\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Multi-zone trapped-ion qubit control in an integrated photonics QCCD device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18056v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiplexed operations and extended coherent control over multiple trapping sites are fundamental requirements for a trapped-ion processor in a large scale architecture. Here we demonstrate these building blocks using a surface-electrode trap with integrated photonic components which are scalable to larger numbers of zones. We implement a Ramsey sequence using the integrated light in two zones, separated by 375 $\mu$m, performing transport of the ion from one zone to the other in 200 $\mu$s between pulses. In order to achieve low motional excitation during transport, we developed techniques to measure and mitigate the effect of the exposed dielectric surfaces used to deliver the integrated light to the ion. We also demonstrate simultaneous control of two ions in separate zones with low optical crosstalk, and use this to perform simultaneous spectroscopy to correlate field noise between the two sites. Our work demonstrates the first transport and coherent multi-zone operations in integrated photonic ion trap systems, forming the basis for further scaling in the trapped-ion QCCD architecture.</description>
