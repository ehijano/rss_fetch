      <title>Thermoelectric Effect in Altermagnet-Superconductor Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose altermagnet-superconductor junctions as a way to achieve a thermoelectric response in metals free of external or stray magnetic fields. We combine qualitative analysis in a simplified model with a more rigorous approach based on the inverse proximity effect in the functional-integral formulation. We show that coupling an altermagnet to a superconductor in a bilayer induces a momentum-dependent spin-splitting in the superconductor. When tunneling occurs between this bilayer and a different altermagnet, a spin-dependent particle-hole symmetry breakdown arises in the transport, which leads to a thermoelectric response. Our results show that the altermagnet-superconductor junctions may achieve comparable thermoelectric performance to ferromagnet-superconductor junctions, featuring a nonmonotonic dependence of the figure of merit on the strength of the altermagnetic splitting. We also point out an often overlooked fact regarding the inverse proximity effect in superconductors, namely that even in a normal metal-superconductor junction there is a minigap in the superconductor, which gives rise to a four-peak structure in the DOS reminiscent of spin-split superconductors. Our results show that altermagnetic metals, unlike conventional antiferromagnets, can be used for efficient cryogenic thermoelectricity.</description>

      <title>Observation of Cooper-pair density modulation state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting states that break space-group symmetries of the underlying crystal can exhibit nontrivial spatial modulation of the order parameter. Previously, such remarkable states were intimately associated with the breaking of translational symmetry, giving rise to the density-wave orders, with wavelengths spanning several unit cells. However, a related basic concept has been long overlooked: when only intra-unit-cell symmetries of the space group are broken, the superconducting states can display a distinct type of nontrivial modulation preserving long-range lattice translation. Here, we refer to this new concept as the pair density modulation (PDM), and report the first observation of a PDM state in exfoliated thin flakes of iron-based superconductor FeTe$_{\text{0.55}}$Se$_{\text{0.45}}$. Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we discover robust superconducting gap modulation with the wavelength corresponding to the lattice periodicity and the amplitude exceeding 30% of the gap average. Importantly, we find that the observed modulation originates from the large difference in superconducting gaps on the two nominally equivalent iron sublattices. The experimental findings, backed up by model calculations, suggest that in contrast to the density-wave orders, the PDM state is driven by the interplay of sublattice symmetry breaking and a peculiar nematic distortion specific to the thin flakes. Our results establish new frontiers for exploring the intertwined orders in strong-correlated electronic systems and open a new chapter for iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous splitting of d-wave surface states: Circulating currents or edge magnetization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pair-breaking edges of $d$-wave superconductors feature Andreev bound states at the Fermi energy. Since these states are energetically highly unfavorable they are susceptible to effects that shift them to finite energy. We investigate the free energy of two different mechanisms: spontaneous phase gradients in the superconducting order parameter and surface ferromagnetism caused by Fermi liquid interaction effects. We find that the surface magnetization appears at lower temperatures than the spontaneous current flow of the phase-crystal state. The magnetic state can, however, be energetically favorable at lower temperatures for sufficiently strong Fermi liquid effects. As a result, first-order transitions between the two states are possible, suggesting a rich low-temperature phase diagram in $d$-wave superconductors.</description>

      <title>Optical absorption in tilted geometries as an indirect measure of longitudinal plasma waves in layered cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves propagating in a layered superconductor with arbitrary momentum with respect to the main crystallographic directions display an unavoidable mixing between longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom. Here we show that this basic physical mechanism explains the emergence of a well-defined absorption peak in the in-plane optical conductivity for light propagating at small tilting angles with respect to the stacking direction in layered cuprates. More specifically, we show that this peak, often interpreted as a spurious leakage of the $c$-axis Josephson plasmon, is instead a signature of the true longitudinal plasma mode occurring at larger momenta. By combining a classical approach based on Maxwell's equations with a full quantum derivation of the plasma modes based on the modelling of the superconducting phase degrees of freedom, we provide an analytical expression for the absorption peak as a function of the tilting angle and light polarization. We suggest that an all-optical measurement in tilted geometry can be used as an alternative way to access plasma-wave dispersion, usually measured by means of large-momenta scattering techniques like RIXS or EELS.</description>

      <title>Observation of thermal microwave photons with a Josephson junction detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When measuring electromagnetic radiation of frequency $f$, the most sensitive detector is the one that counts the single quanta of energy $h f$. Single photon detectors (SPDs) were demonstrated from $\gamma$-rays to infrared wavelengths, and extending this range down to the microwaves is the focus of intense research. The energy of $10\,\mathrm{GHz}$ microwave photon, about $40\,\mathrm{\mu eV}$ or $7\, \mathrm{yJ},$ is enough to force a superconducting Josephson junction into its resistive state, making it suitable to be used as a sensor. In this work, we use an underdamped Josephson junction to detect single thermal photons stochastically emitted by a microwave copper cavity at millikelvin temperatures. After characterizing the source and detector, we vary the temperature of the resonant cavity and measure the increased photon rate. The device shows an efficiency up to 40% and a dark count rate of $0.1\,\mathrm{Hz}$ in a bandwidth of several gigahertz. To confirm the thermal nature of the emitted photons we verify their super-Poissonian statistics, which is also a signature of quantum chaos. We discuss detector application in the scope of Dark Matter Axion searches, and note its importance for quantum information, metrology and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized Specular Andreev Reflections in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a multi-terminal device consisting of an $s$-wave superconductor coupled to an altermagnet, to generate highly correlated spin currents via Cooper pair splitting. Remarkably, we find that the correlated spin currents are induced by specular Andreev reflections in the altermagnet, an effect that has up to now been predicted to occur only in a very limited number of systems, e.g., Dirac/Weyl materials coupled to superconductors. We demonstrate that positive non-local charge currents and positive noise cross-correlations are unambiguous fingerprints of the specular Andreev reflections in our proposed device.</description>
