      <title>Single-cell spatial (scs) omics: Recent developments in data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few years, technological advances have allowed for measurement of omics data at the cell level, creating a new type of data generally referred to as single-cell (sc) omics. On the other hand, the so-called spatial omics are a family of techniques that generate biological information in a spatial domain, for instance, in the volume of a tissue. In this survey, we are mostly interested in the intersection between sc and spatial (scs) omics and in the challenges and opportunities that this new type of data pose for downstream data analysis methodologies. Our goal is to cover all major omics modalities, including transcriptomics, genomics, epigenomics, proteomics and metabolomics.</description>

      <title>Sequential Rank and Preference Learning with the Bayesian Mallows Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bayesian Mallows model is a flexible tool for analyzing data in the form of complete or partial rankings, and transitive or intransitive pairwise preferences. In many potential applications of preference learning, data arrive sequentially and it is of practical interest to update posterior beliefs and predictions efficiently, based on the currently available data. Despite this, most algorithms proposed so far have focused on batch inference. In this paper we present an algorithm for sequentially estimating the posterior distributions of the Bayesian Mallows model using nested sequential Monte Carlo. As it requires minimum user input in form of tuning parameters, is straightforward to parallelize, and returns the marginal likelihood as a direct byproduct of estimation, the algorithm is an alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques also in batch estimation settings.</description>

      <title>Reliability analysis for non-deterministic limit-states using stochastic emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliability analysis is a sub-field of uncertainty quantification that assesses the probability of a system performing as intended under various uncertainties. Traditionally, this analysis relies on deterministic models, where experiments are repeatable, i.e., they produce consistent outputs for a given set of inputs. However, real-world systems often exhibit stochastic behavior, leading to non-repeatable outcomes. These so-called stochastic simulators produce different outputs each time the model is run, even with fixed inputs. This paper formally introduces reliability analysis for stochastic models and addresses it by using suitable surrogate models to lower its typically high computational cost. Specifically, we focus on the recently introduced generalized lambda models and stochastic polynomial chaos expansions. These emulators are designed to learn the inherent randomness of the simulator's response and enable efficient uncertainty quantification at a much lower cost than traditional Monte Carlo simulation. We validate our methodology through three case studies. First, using an analytical function with a closed-form solution, we demonstrate that the emulators converge to the correct solution. Second, we present results obtained from the surrogates using a toy example of a simply supported beam. Finally, we apply the emulators to perform reliability analysis on a realistic wind turbine case study, where only a dataset of simulation results is available.</description>

      <title>Diffusion map particle systems for generative modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00200v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion map particle system (DMPS) for generative modeling, based on diffusion maps and Laplacian-adjusted Wasserstein gradient descent (LAWGD). Diffusion maps are used to approximate the generator of the corresponding Langevin diffusion process from samples, and hence to learn the underlying data-generating manifold. On the other hand, LAWGD enables efficient sampling from the target distribution given a suitable choice of kernel, which we construct here via a spectral approximation of the generator, computed with diffusion maps. Our method requires no offline training and minimal tuning, and can outperform other approaches on data sets of moderate dimension.</description>
