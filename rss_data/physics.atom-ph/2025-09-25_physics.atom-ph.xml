      <title>Sub-Doppler spectroscopy of the strontium intercombination line in a microfabricated vapor cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a 100 kHz linewidth for the 1S0 to 3P1 intercombination line of 88Sr atoms at 689nm in a microfabricated 9x14 x4.4 mm3 vapor cell. This puts an upper bound on the residual gas pressure in the vapor cell of 10 mTorr. The microfabricatd Sr vapor cell offers an inexpensive and scalable way to lock lasers in state-of-the-art cold-atom based atomic clocks and quantum computing experiments. It also paves the way for a compact and precise optical frequency references based on alkaline earth vapor cells.</description>

      <title>Probing Bandwidth and Sensitivity in Rydberg Atom Sensing via Optical Homodyne and RF Heterodyne Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom based sensors allow for SI traceable measurements and show promise for applications in the field of communication and radar technologies. In this article, we investigate the bandwidth and sensitivity of a Rydberg atom-based sensor in a rubidium vapor cell using Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectroscopy. We employ a radio-frequency (RF) heterodyne measurement technique in combination with an optical homodyne setup to extend the achievable range between sensitivity and bandwidth in a Rydberg sensor. While the bandwidth of Rydberg sensors are limited by the transit time of atoms and the Rabi frequency of the coupling field, achieving higher bandwidth through smaller beam sizes is thought to compromise sensitivity due to reduced EIT signal strength. Using optical homodyne detection, we demonstrate that sensitivity is preserved while achieving a response bandwidth of 8 MHz. In addition, using the Rydberg sensor, we receive digital communication signals and present error vector magnitude (EVM) measurements as a function of varying symbol rates and bandwidth of the Rydberg sensor. Furthermore, the sensor's performance is compared with a conventional RF mixer. We establish that the bandwidth of a Rydberg sensor when receiving a pure tone is not the same as the bandwidth of the sensor when receiving a modulated signal. This difference results from the spreading of symbols in the frequency domain, leading to a reduction of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and an accumulation of noise over the total span of the modulated signal.</description>

      <title>Observation of Discrete Time Quasicrystal in Rydberg Atomic Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete time quasicrystals (DTQC) constitute a class of non-equilibrium matter characterized by temporal order without strict periodicity, in contrast to conventional time crystals. Investigating these phenomena is essential for expanding our fundamental understanding of far-from-equilibrium quantum matter and spontaneous symmetry breaking beyond periodic regimes. Here, we experimentally observe a DTQC in a driven-dissipative ensemble of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms, displaying non-equilibrium dynamical response with a different finite Abelian group symmetry $\mathbb{Z}{_m} \times \mathbb{Z}{_n}$. By applying a quasi-periodic drive using a dual-frequency drive with incommensurate frequencies, we demonstrate that the system exhibits a robust subharmonic response at multiple incommensurate frequencies, signifying the emergence of a DTQC phase. We map the full phase diagram of the system, which includes the DTQC phase, and demonstrated its rigidity against perturbations in both RF field intensity and laser detuning. Moreover, we observe a cyclic group symmetry effect that constrains the construction of $\mathbb{Z}{_2} \times \mathbb{Z}{_3}$-symmetric DTQC. This work establishes a versatile platform for studying non-equilibrium phases of matter and provides insights into the dynamics of time-translation symmetry breaking in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Lifetimes of the Metastable $6\mathrm{d}\, ^{2}\mathrm{D}_{5/2}$ and $6\mathrm{d}\, ^{2}\mathrm{D}_{3/2}$ States of Ra$^+$</title>

Abstract: We report lifetime measurements of the metastable $6\mathrm{d}\, ^{2}\mathrm{D}_{5/2}$ and $6\mathrm{d}\, ^{2}\mathrm{D}_{3/2}$ states of Ra$^+$. The measured lifetimes, $\tau_{5} = $ 303.8(1.5) ms and $\tau_{3} = $ 642(9) ms, are important for optical frequency standards and for benchmarking high-precision relativistic atomic theory. Independent of the reported measurements, the D state lifetimes were calculated using the coupled-cluster single double triple method, in which the coupled-cluster equations for both core and valence triple excitations were solved iteratively. The method was designed for precise prediction of atomic properties, especially for heavy elements, where relativistic and correlation corrections become large, making their treatment more challenging. This Letter presents the first tests of the method for transition properties. Our prediction agrees with experimental values within the uncertainties. The ability to accurately predict the atomic properties of heavy elements is important for many applications, from tests of fundamental symmetries to the development of optical clocks.</description>

      <title>Series of molecular-like doubly excited states of a quasi-three-body Coulomb system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated resonant multiphoton excitation of high-angular-momentum planetary states of the strontium atom, a quasi-three-body Coulomb system, both experimentally and theoretically. A series of highly doubly excited electronic states converging to the double ionization threshold was identified and reproduced by first-principles calculations, which provided access to the two-electron wavefunctions of the resonances. In these states, the outer electron is dynamically localized at large distances by pendulum-like oscillations of the inner electron across the nucleus. A complementary simple molecular-like adiabatic model offers a clear interpretation of the correlated two-electron motion and suggests that the series is a general feature of highly doubly excited states of atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Microwave Spectroscopy of the Muonium $2S_{1/2}-2P_{3/2}$ Fine Structure Interval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a microwave spectroscopy measurement of the muonium $2S_{1/2}-2P_{3/2}$ fine structure transition, yielding a transition frequency of $9871.0 \pm 7.0~\mathrm{MHz}$, in agreement with state-of-the-art QED predictions within one standard deviation. In combination with the recent Lamb shift result, the $2P_{1/2}-2P_{3/2}$ splitting is determined, improving the spectroscopic characterization of the $n=2$ manifold in muonium. These results provide a stringent test of bound-state QED in a purely leptonic system and establish a path toward future searches for Lorentz violation and muon-specific new physics.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Time Delays at Cooper Minima in Valence-Shell Photoionization of Alkali and Alkaline-Earth Metal Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ji \etal [New J. Phys. {\bf 26}, 093014 (2024)] established a direct link between the photoionization cross section and the attosecond time delay near Cooper minima (CM) in the valence shells of noble-gas atoms. This link is based on the analytic properties of the ionization amplitude in the complex plane of the photoelectron energy, and is particularly sensitive to the winding number of the amplitude around the origin of the complex energy plane. %
Here, we demonstrate an analogous relation for photoionization of the valence $ns$ shells of alkali-metal atoms (AMA), from Na ($n=3$) to Cs ($n=6$), as well as alkaline-earth-metal atoms (AEMA), from Mg ($n=3$) to Ba ($n=6$). To this end, we employ a fully relativistic formalism that separates the two complementary $ns_{1/2} \to Ep_{1/2}$ and $Ep_{3/2}$ ionization channels. Each of these channels exhibits a phase variation close to $\pi$, but in opposite directions, near their respective Cooper minima. This phase variation vanishes in a nonrelativistic formulation, where the two channels become degenerate %
For AMA, due to the threshold proximity of the CM, the universal Coulomb contribution to the time delay must be subtracted. The remaining component of the time delay is target-specific, angular-dependent, and accessible through comparative measurements.</description>

      <title>Constraints on axion-like dark matter from a SERF comagnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight axion-like particles are well-motivated relics that might compose the cosmological dark matter and source anomalous time-dependent magnetic fields. We report on terrestrial bounds from the Noble And Alkali Spin Detectors for Ultralight Coherent darK matter (NASDUCK) collaboration on the coupling of axion-like particles to neutrons and protons. The detector uses nuclei of noble-gas and alkali-metal atoms and operates in the Spin-Exchange Relaxation-Free~(SERF) regime, achieving high sensitivity to axion-like dark matter fields. Conducting a month-long search, we cover the mass range of $1.4\times 10^{-12}$~eV/$c^2$ to $2\times 10^{-10}$~eV/$c^2$ and provide limits which supersede robust astrophysical bounds, and improve upon previous terrestrial constraints by over two orders of magnitude for many masses within this range for protons, and up to two orders of magnitude for neutrons. These are the first reliable terrestrial bounds reported on the coupling of protons with axion-like dark matter, covering an unexplored terrain in its parameter space.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of photonic spin Hall effect in a Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper theoretically investigates the manipulation of the Photonic Spin Hall Effect (photonic SHE) using a four-level closed coherent control coupling scheme in a cavity. The atomic system is configured to function as a combined Tripod and Lambda (CTL), Lambda $\Lambda$, and $N$ level model by properly adjusting the control field strengths and their relative phases. The system demonstrates multiple transparency windows in the CTL configuration, allowing the tunable photonic SHE to be used over a wider range of probe field detuning. At probe field resonance under the condition of electromagnetic induced transparency (EIT), the $\Lambda$-type system exhibits photonic SHE similar to the CTL system, showing a maximum upper limit of photonic SHE equal to half of the incident beam waist. This upper limit arises due to zero absorption and dispersion. Control field strengths and atomic density do not influence photonic SHE at resonance for both atomic configurations. Our findings reveal that atomic density and strength of control fields significantly influence photonic SHE in the $N$-type model at resonance, offering additional control parameters for tuning photonic SHE. Finally, the results are equally valid and applicable to conventional $\Lambda$-type and N-type atomic systems, making the findings broadly relevant in cavity atomic systems. The results of angular photonic SHE are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Effective anisotropic interaction potentials for pairs of ultracold molecules shielded by a static electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum gases of ultracold polar molecules have novel properties because of the strong dipolar forces between molecules. Current experiments shield the molecules from destructive collisions by engineering long-range repulsive interactions using microwave or static electric fields. These shielding methods produce interaction potentials with large repulsive cores that are not well described with contact potentials. In this paper we explore the anisotropic interaction potentials that arise for pairs of polar molecules shielded with static electric fields. We derive computationally inexpensive approximations for the potentials that are suitable for use in calculations of many-body properties. The interaction potentials for molecules shielded with static fields are substantially different from those that arise from microwave shielding and will produce quite different many-body physics.</description>
