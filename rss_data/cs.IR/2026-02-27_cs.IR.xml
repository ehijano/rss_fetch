      <title>Enriching Taxonomies Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taxonomies play a vital role in structuring and categorizing information across domains. However, many existing taxonomies suffer from limited coverage and outdated or ambiguous nodes, reducing their effectiveness in knowledge retrieval. To address this, we present Taxoria, a novel taxonomy enrichment pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance a given taxonomy. Unlike approaches that extract internal LLM taxonomies, Taxoria uses an existing taxonomy as a seed and prompts an LLM to propose candidate nodes for enrichment. These candidates are then validated to mitigate hallucinations and ensure semantic relevance before integration. The final output includes an enriched taxonomy with provenance tracking and visualization of the final merged taxonomy for analysis.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Prefiltering for High-Dimensional Similarity Search: A Frequency-Aware Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional similarity search underpins modern retrieval systems, yet uniform search strategies fail to exploit the heterogeneous nature of real-world query distributions. We present an adaptive prefiltering framework that leverages query frequency patterns and cluster coherence metrics to dynamically allocate computational budgets. Our approach partitions the query space into frequency tiers following Zipfian distributions and assigns differentiated search policies based on historical access patterns and local density characteristics. Experiments on ImageNet-1k using CLIP embeddings demonstrate that frequency-aware budget allocation achieves equivalent recall with 20.4% fewer distance computations compared to static nprobe selection, while maintaining sub-millisecond latency on GPU-accelerated FAISS indices. The framework introduces minimal overhead through lightweight frequency tracking and provides graceful degradation for unseen queries through coherence-based fallback policies.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assistant for Anatomical Pathology Laboratories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient access to laboratory protocols is essential in Anatomical Pathology (AP), where up to 70% of medical decisions depend on laboratory diagnoses. However, static documentation such as printed manuals or PDFs is often outdated, fragmented, and difficult to search, creating risks of workflow errors and diagnostic delays. This study proposes and evaluates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant tailored to AP laboratories, designed to provide technicians with context-grounded answers to protocol-related queries. We curated a novel corpus of 99 AP protocols from a Portuguese healthcare institution and constructed 323 question-answer pairs for systematic evaluation. Ten experiments were conducted, varying chunking strategies, retrieval methods, and embedding models. Performance was assessed using the RAGAS framework (faithfulness, answer relevance, context recall) alongside top-k retrieval metrics. Results show that recursive chunking and hybrid retrieval delivered the strongest baseline performance. Incorporating a biomedical-specific embedding model (MedEmbed) further improved answer relevance (0.74), faithfulness (0.70), and context recall (0.77), showing the importance of domain-specialised embeddings. Top-k analysis revealed that retrieving a single top-ranked chunk (k=1) maximized efficiency and accuracy, reflecting the modular structure of AP protocols. These findings highlight critical design considerations for deploying RAG systems in healthcare and demonstrate their potential to transform static documentation into dynamic, reliable knowledge assistants, thus improving laboratory workflow efficiency and supporting patient safety.</description>

      <title>RAGdb: A Zero-Dependency, Embeddable Architecture for Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation on the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has established itself as the standard paradigm for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in domain-specific, up-to-date data. However, the prevailing architecture for RAG has evolved into a complex, distributed stack requiring cloud-hosted vector databases, heavy deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, CUDA), and high-latency embedding inference servers. This ``infrastructure bloat'' creates a significant barrier to entry for edge computing, air-gapped environments, and privacy-constrained applications where data sovereignty is paramount.
  This paper introduces RAGdb, a novel monolithic architecture that consolidates automated multimodal ingestion, ONNX-based extraction, and hybrid vector retrieval into a single, portable SQLite container. We propose a deterministic Hybrid Scoring Function (HSF) that combines sublinear TF-IDF vectorization with exact substring boosting, eliminating the need for GPU inference at query time. Experimental evaluation on an Intel i7-1165G7 consumer laptop demonstrates that RAGdb achieves 100\% Recall@1 for entity retrieval and an ingestion efficiency gain of 31.6x during incremental updates compared to cold starts. Furthermore, the system reduces disk footprint by approximately 99.5\% compared to standard Docker-based RAG stacks, establishing the ``Single-File Knowledge Container'' as a viable primitive for decentralized, local-first AI.

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Neural Retriever-Reranker Pipelines for Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Knowledge Graphs in E-commerce Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed Natural Language Processing (NLP), enabling complex information retrieval and generation tasks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a key innovation, enhancing factual accuracy and contextual grounding by integrating external knowledge sources with generative models. Although RAG demonstrates strong performance on unstructured text, its application to structured knowledge graphs presents challenges: scaling retrieval across connected graphs and preserving contextual relationships during response generation. Cross-encoders refine retrieval precision, yet their integration with structured data remains underexplored. Addressing these challenges is crucial for developing domain-specific assistants that operate in production environments. This study presents the design and comparative evaluation of multiple Retriever-Reranker pipelines for knowledge graph natural language queries in e-Commerce contexts. Using the STaRK Semi-structured Knowledge Base (SKB), a production-scale e-Commerce dataset, we evaluate multiple RAG pipeline configurations optimized for language queries. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over published benchmarks, achieving 20.4% higher Hit@1 and 14.5% higher Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). These findings establish a practical framework for integrating domain-specific SKBs into generative systems. Our contributions provide actionable insights for the deployment of production-ready RAG systems, with implications that extend beyond e-Commerce to other domains that require information retrieval from structured knowledge bases.</description>

      <title>What Makes an Ideal Quote? Recommending "Unexpected yet Rational" Quotations via Novelty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quotation recommendation aims to enrich writing by suggesting quotes that complement a given context, yet existing systems mostly optimize surface-level topical relevance and ignore the deeper semantic and aesthetic properties that make quotations memorable. We start from two empirical observations. First, a systematic user study shows that people consistently prefer quotations that are ``unexpected yet rational'' in context, identifying novelty as a key desideratum. Second, we find that strong existing models struggle to fully understand the deep meanings of quotations. Inspired by defamiliarization theory, we therefore formalize quote recommendation as choosing contextually novel but semantically coherent quotations. We operationalize this objective with NovelQR, a novelty-driven quotation recommendation framework. A generative label agent first interprets each quotation and its surrounding context into multi-dimensional deep-meaning labels, enabling label-enhanced retrieval. A token-level novelty estimator then reranks candidates while mitigating auto-regressive continuation bias. Experiments on bilingual datasets spanning diverse real-world domains show that our system recommends quotations that human judges rate as more appropriate, more novel, and more engaging than other baselines, while matching or surpassing existing methods in novelty estimation.</description>

      <title>Misinformation Exposure in the Chinese Web: A Cross-System Evaluation of Search Engines, LLMs, and AI Overviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into search services, providing direct answers that can reduce users' reliance on traditional result pages. Yet their factual reliability in non-English web ecosystems remains poorly understood, particularly when answering real user queries. We introduce a fact-checking dataset of 12~161 Chinese Yes/No questions derived from real-world online search logs and develop a unified evaluation pipeline to compare three information-access paradigms: traditional search engines, standalone LLMs, and AI-generated overview modules. Our analysis reveals substantial differences in factual accuracy and topic-level variability across systems. By combining this performance with real-world Baidu Index statistics, we further estimate potential exposure to incorrect factual information of Chinese users across regions. These findings highlight structural risks in AI-mediated search and underscore the need for more reliable and transparent information-access tools for the digital world.</description>

      <title>TWICE: An LLM Agent Framework for Simulating Personalized User Tweeting Behavior with Long-term Temporal Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User simulators are often used to generate large amounts of data for various tasks such as generation, training, and evaluation. However, existing approaches concentrate on collective behaviors or interactive systems, struggling with tasks that require modeling temporal characteristics. To address this limitation, we propose TWICE, an LLM-based framework that leverages the long-term temporal and personalized features of social media data. This framework integrates personalized user profiling, an event-driven memory module, and a workflow for personalized style rewriting, enabling simulation of personalized user tweeting behavior while capturing long-term temporal characteristics. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation with a focus on analyzing tweeting style and event-based changes in behavior. Experiment results demonstrate that our framework improves personalized user simulation by effectively incorporating temporal dynamics, providing a robust solution for long-term behavior tracking.</description>

      <title>SQaLe: A Large Text-to-SQL Corpus Grounded in Real Schemas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in large language models have accelerated progress in text-to-SQL, methods for converting natural language queries into valid SQL queries. A key bottleneck for developing generalizable text-to-SQL models is the lack of large-scale datasets with sufficient schema and query complexity, domain coverage, and task diversity. We introduce SQaLe: a large-scale semi-synthetic text-to-SQL dataset built on 135,875 relational database schemas expanded from a collection of real-world schemas, SchemaPile. We establish a principled generation pipeline which combines schema sampling, question synthesis, and SQL construction, and produce 517,676 high-quality (question, schema, query) triples. The SQaLe dataset captures realistic schema size variability, diverse query patterns, and natural language ambiguity while maintaining execution validity. We provide an analysis of its contents and characteristics, and find that SQaLe introduces the most realistic large-scale text-to-SQL dataset to date in comparison with existing benchmarks and datasets. We discuss how SQaLe enables our vision for data scaling and model generalization in text-to-SQL research. The dataset is accessible at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/trl-lab/SQaLe-text-to-SQL-dataset.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DS-Serve, a framework that transforms large-scale text datasets, comprising half a trillion tokens, into a high-performance neural retrieval system. DS-Serve offers both a web interface and API endpoints, achieving low latency with modest memory overhead on a single node. The framework also supports inference-time trade-offs between latency, accuracy, and result diversity. We anticipate that DS-Serve will be broadly useful for a range of applications, including large-scale retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), training data attribution, training search agents, and beyond.</description>

      <title>SmartChunk Retrieval: Query-Aware Chunk Compression with Planning for Efficient Document RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has strong potential for producing accurate and factual outputs by combining language models (LMs) with evidence retrieved from large text corpora. However, current pipelines are limited by static chunking and flat retrieval: documents are split into short, predetermined, fixed-size chunks, embeddings are retrieved uniformly, and generation relies on whatever chunks are returned. This design brings challenges, as retrieval quality is highly sensitive to chunk size, often introduces noise from irrelevant or misleading chunks, and scales poorly to large corpora. We present SmartChunk retrieval, a query-adaptive framework for efficient and robust long-document question answering (QA). SmartChunk uses (i) a planner that predicts the optimal chunk abstraction level for each query, and (ii) a lightweight compression module that produces high-level chunk embeddings without repeated summarization. By adapting retrieval granularity on the fly, SmartChunk balances accuracy with efficiency and avoids the drawbacks of fixed strategies. Notably, our planner can reason about chunk abstractions through a novel reinforcement learning scheme, STITCH, which boosts accuracy and generalization. To reflect real-world applications, where users face diverse document types and query styles, we evaluate SmartChunk on five QA benchmarks plus one out-of-domain dataset. Across these evaluations, SmartChunk outperforms state-of-the-art RAG baselines, while reducing cost. Further analysis demonstrates strong scalability with larger corpora and consistent gains on out-of-domain datasets, highlighting its effectiveness as a general framework for adaptive retrieval.</description>

      <title>SEGB: Self-Evolved Generative Bidding with Local Autoregressive Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of online advertising, automated bidding has become a pivotal tool, enabling advertisers to efficiently capture impression opportunities in real-time. Recently, generative auto-bidding has shown significant promise, offering innovative solutions for effective ad optimization. However, existing offline-trained generative policies lack the near-term foresight required for dynamic markets and usually depend on simulators or external experts for post-training improvement. To overcome these critical limitations, we propose Self-Evolved Generative Bidding (SEGB), a framework that plans proactively and refines itself entirely offline. SEGB first synthesizes plausible short-horizon future states to guide each bid, providing the agent with crucial, dynamic foresight. Crucially, it then performs value-guided policy refinement to iteratively discover superior strategies without any external intervention. This self-contained approach uniquely enables robust policy improvement from static data alone. Experiments on the AuctionNet benchmark and a large-scale A/B test validate our approach, demonstrating that SEGB significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In a large-scale online deployment, it delivered substantial business value, achieving a +10.19% increase in target cost, proving the effectiveness of our advanced planning and evolution paradigm.</description>

      <title>RETLLM: Training and Data-Free MLLMs for Multimodal Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal information retrieval (MMIR) has gained attention for its flexibility in handling text, images, or mixed queries and candidates. Recent breakthroughs in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) boost MMIR performance by incorporating MLLM knowledge under the contrastive finetuning framework. However, they suffer from pre-training inconsistency and require large datasets. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, RetLLM, designed to query MLLMs for MMIR in a training- and data-free manner. Specifically, we formulate MMIR as a similarity score generation task and prompt MLLMs to directly predict retrieval scores in a coarse-then-fine pipeline. At the coarse stage, a top-k filtering strategy builds a small yet high-quality candidate pool for each query, enabling MLLMs to focus on semantically relevant candidates. Subsequently, the retrieval score is predicted by feeding both the query and candidate into MLLMs at the fine stage. Importantly, we propose a visual enhancement module during reasoning to help MLLMs re-pick forgotten visuals, improving retrieval. Extensive experiments on MMIR benchmarks show that RetLLM outperforms fine-tuned models. Ablation studies further verify each component. Our work demonstrates that MLLMs can achieve strong MMIR performance without any training, highlighting their inherent multimodal reasoning ability in a simple, scalable framework. We release our code at: https://github.com/alivecat05/RETLLM</description>

      <title>TFPS: A Temporal Filtration-enhanced Positive Sample Set Construction Method for Implicit Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negative sampling strategy can effectively train collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation models based on implicit feedback by constructing positive and negative samples. However, existing methods primarily optimize the negative sampling process while neglecting the exploration of positive samples. Some denoising recommendation methods can be applied to denoise positive samples within negative sampling strategies, but they ignore temporal information. Existing work integrates sequential information during model aggregation but neglects time interval information, hindering accurate capture of users' current preferences. To address this problem, from a data perspective, we propose a novel temporal filtration-enhanced approach to construct a high-quality positive sample set. First, we design a time decay model based on interaction time intervals, transforming the original graph into a weighted user-item bipartite graph. Then, based on predefined filtering operations, the weighted user-item bipartite graph is layered. Finally, we design a layer-enhancement strategy to construct a high-quality positive sample set for the layered subgraphs. We provide theoretical insights into why TFPS can improve Recall@k and NDCG@k, and extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Additionally, TFPS can be integrated with various implicit CF recommenders or negative sampling methods to enhance its performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of digital libraries, the development of large language models (LLMs) has opened up new possibilities for simulating user behavior. This innovation addresses the longstanding challenge in digital library research: the scarcity of publicly available datasets on user search patterns due to privacy concerns. In this context, we introduce Agent4DL, a user search behavior simulator specifically designed for digital library environments. Agent4DL generates realistic user profiles and dynamic search sessions that closely mimic actual search strategies, including querying, clicking, and stopping behaviors tailored to specific user profiles. Our simulator's accuracy in replicating real user interactions has been validated through comparisons with real user data. Notably, Agent4DL demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing user search simulators such as SimIIR 2.0, particularly in its ability to generate more diverse and context-aware user behaviors.</description>

      <title>Towards Dynamic Dense Retrieval with Routing Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \textit{de facto} paradigm for applying dense retrieval (DR) to new tasks involves fine-tuning a pre-trained model for a specific task. However, this paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) It is difficult adapt the DR to a new domain if the training dataset is limited.
  (2) Old DR models are simply replaced by newer models that are trained from scratch when the former are no longer up to date. Especially for scenarios where the model needs to be updated frequently, this paradigm is prohibitively expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dense retrieval approach, termed \textit{dynamic dense retrieval} (DDR). DDR uses \textit{prefix tuning} as a \textit{module} specialized for a specific domain. These modules can then be compositional combined with a dynamic routing strategy, enabling highly flexible domain adaptation in the retrieval part. Extensive evaluation on six zero-shot downstream tasks demonstrates that this approach can surpass DR while utilizing only 2\% of the training parameters, paving the way to achieve more flexible dense retrieval in IR. We see it as a promising future direction for applying dense retrieval to various tasks.</description>

      <title>Where Relevance Emerges: A Layer-Wise Study of Internal Attention for Zero-Shot Re-Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot document re-ranking with Large Language Models (LLMs) has evolved from Pointwise methods to Listwise and Setwise approaches that optimize computational efficiency. Despite their success, these methods predominantly rely on generative scoring or output logits, which face bottlenecks in inference latency and result consistency. In-Context Re-ranking (ICR) has recently been proposed as an $O(1)$ alternative method. ICR extracts internal attention signals directly, avoiding the overhead of text generation. However, existing ICR methods simply aggregate signals across all layers; layer-wise contributions and their consistency across architectures have been left unexplored. Furthermore, no unified study has compared internal attention with traditional generative and likelihood-based mechanisms across diverse ranking frameworks under consistent conditions.
  In this paper, we conduct an orthogonal evaluation of generation, likelihood, and internal attention mechanisms across multiple ranking frameworks. We further identify a universal "bell-curve" distribution of relevance signals across transformer layers, which motivates the proposed Selective-ICR strategy that reduces inference latency by 30%-50% without compromising effectiveness. Finally, evaluation on the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark shows that precisely capturing high-quality in-context attention signals fundamentally reduces the need for model scaling and reinforcement learning: a zero-shot 8B model matches the performance of 14B reinforcement-learned re-rankers, while even a 0.6B model outperforms state-of-the-art generation-based approaches. These findings redefine the efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based re-ranking and highlight the latent potential of internal signals for complex reasoning ranking tasks. Our code and results are publicly available at https://github.com/ielab/Selective-ICR.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Semantics Integration for Large Language Model-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shifted in recommendation systems from the discriminative paradigm to the LLM-based generative paradigm, where the recommender autoregressively generates sequences of semantic identifiers (SIDs) for target items conditioned on historical interaction. While prevalent LLM-based recommenders have demonstrated performance gains by aligning pretrained LLMs between the language space and the SID space, modeling the SID space still faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Semantically Meaningless Initialization: SID tokens are randomly initialized, severing the semantic linkage between the SID space and the pretrained language space at start point, and (2) Coarse-grained Alignment: existing SFT-based alignment tasks primarily focus on item-level optimization, while overlooking the semantics of individual tokens within SID sequences.To address these challenges, we propose TS-Rec, which can integrate Token-level Semantics into LLM-based Recommenders. Specifically, TS-Rec comprises two key components: (1) Semantic-Aware embedding Initialization (SA-Init), which initializes SID token embeddings by applying mean pooling to the pretrained embeddings of keywords extracted by a teacher model; and (2) Token-level Semantic Alignment (TS-Align), which aligns individual tokens within the SID sequence with the shared semantics of the corresponding item clusters. Extensive experiments on two real-world benchmarks demonstrate that TS-Rec consistently outperforms traditional and generative baselines across all standard metrics. The results demonstrate that integrating fine-grained semantic information significantly enhances the performance of LLM-based generative recommenders.</description>

      <title>Vectorizing the Trie: Efficient Constrained Decoding for LLM-based Generative Retrieval on Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative retrieval has emerged as a powerful paradigm for LLM-based recommendation. However, industrial recommender systems often benefit from restricting the output space to a constrained subset of items based on business logic (e.g. enforcing content freshness or product category), which standard autoregressive decoding cannot natively support. Moreover, existing constrained decoding methods that make use of prefix trees (Tries) incur severe latency penalties on hardware accelerators (TPUs/GPUs). In this work, we introduce STATIC (Sparse Transition Matrix-Accelerated Trie Index for Constrained Decoding), an efficient and scalable constrained decoding technique designed specifically for high-throughput LLM-based generative retrieval on TPUs/GPUs. By flattening the prefix tree into a static Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) matrix, we transform irregular tree traversals into fully vectorized sparse matrix operations, unlocking massive efficiency gains on hardware accelerators. We deploy STATIC on a large-scale industrial video recommendation platform serving billions of users. STATIC produces significant product metric impact with minimal latency overhead (0.033 ms per step and 0.25% of inference time), achieving a 948x speedup over a CPU trie implementation and a 47-1033x speedup over a hardware-accelerated binary-search baseline. Furthermore, the runtime overhead of STATIC remains extremely low across a wide range of practical configurations. To the best of our knowledge, STATIC enables the first production-scale deployment of strictly constrained generative retrieval. In addition, evaluation on academic benchmarks demonstrates that STATIC can considerably improve cold-start performance for generative retrieval. Our code is available at https://github.com/youtube/static-constraint-decoding.</description>

      <title>Generative Recommendation for Large-Scale Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative recommendation has recently attracted widespread attention in industry due to its potential for scaling and stronger model capacity. However, deploying real-time generative recommendation in large-scale advertising requires designs beyond large-language-model (LLM)-style training and serving recipes. We present a production-oriented generative recommender co-designed across architecture, learning, and serving, named GR4AD (Generative Recommendation for ADdvertising). As for tokenization, GR4AD proposes UA-SID (Unified Advertisement Semantic ID) to capture complicated business information. Furthermore, GR4AD introduces LazyAR, a lazy autoregressive decoder that relaxes layer-wise dependencies for short, multi-candidate generation, preserving effectiveness while reducing inference cost, which facilitates scaling under fixed serving budgets. To align optimization with business value, GR4AD employs VSL (Value-Aware Supervised Learning) and proposes RSPO (Ranking-Guided Softmax Preference Optimization), a ranking-aware, list-wise reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes value-based rewards under list-level metrics for continual online updates. For online inference, we further propose dynamic beam serving, which adapts beam width across generation levels and online load to control compute. Large-scale online A/B tests show up to 4.2% ad revenue improvement over an existing DLRM-based stack, with consistent gains from both model scaling and inference-time scaling. GR4AD has been fully deployed in Kuaishou advertising system with over 400 million users and achieves high-throughput real-time serving.</description>

      <title>PSQE: A Theoretical-Practical Approach to Pseudo Seed Quality Enhancement for Unsupervised MMEA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Entity Alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities across different data modalities, enabling structural data integration that in turn improves the performance of various large language model applications. To lift the requirement of labeled seed pairs that are difficult to obtain, recent methods shifted to an unsupervised paradigm using pseudo-alignment seeds. However, unsupervised entity alignment in multimodal settings remains underexplored, mainly because the incorporation of multimodal information often results in imbalanced coverage of pseudo-seeds within the knowledge graph. To overcome this, we propose PSQE (Pseudo-Seed Quality Enhancement) to improve the precision and graph coverage balance of pseudo seeds via multimodal information and clustering-resampling. Theoretical analysis reveals the impact of pseudo seeds on existing contrastive learning-based MMEA models. In particular, pseudo seeds can influence the attraction and the repulsion terms in contrastive learning at once, whereas imbalanced graph coverage causes models to prioritize high-density regions, thereby weakening their learning capability for entities in sparse regions. Experimental results validate our theoretical findings and show that PSQE as a plug-and-play module can improve the performance of baselines by considerable margins.</description>

      <title>SIGMA: A Semantic-Grounded Instruction-Driven Generative Multi-Task Recommender at AliExpress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid evolution of Large Language Models, generative recommendation is gradually reshaping the paradigm of recommender systems. However, most existing methods are still confined to the interaction-driven next-item prediction paradigm, failing to rapidly adapt to evolving trends or address diverse recommendation tasks along with business-specific requirements in real-world scenarios. To this end, we present SIGMA, a Semantic-Grounded Instruction-Driven Generative Multi-Task Recommender at AliExpress. Specifically, we first ground item entities in general semantics via a unified latent space capturing both semantic and collaborative relations. Building upon this, we develop a hybrid item tokenization method for precise modeling and efficient generation. Moreover, we construct a large-scale multi-task SFT dataset to empower SIGMA to fulfill various recommendation demands via instruction-following. Finally, we design a three-step item generation procedure integrated with an adaptive probabilistic fusion mechanism to calibrate the output distributions based on task-specific requirements for recommendation accuracy and diversity. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of SIGMA.</description>

      <title>Sequential Regression for Continuous Value Prediction using Residual Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous value prediction plays a crucial role in industrial-scale recommendation systems, including tasks such as predicting users' watch-time and estimating the gross merchandise value (GMV) in e-commerce transactions. However, it remains challenging due to the highly complex and long-tailed nature of the data distributions. Existing generative approaches rely on rigid parametric distribution assumptions, which fundamentally limits their performance when such assumptions misalign with real-world data. Overly simplified forms cannot adequately model real-world complexities, while more intricate assumptions often suffer from poor scalability and generalization.
  To address these challenges, we propose a residual quantization (RQ)-based sequence learning framework that represents target continuous values as a sum of ordered quantization codes, predicted recursively from coarse to fine granularity with diminishing quantization errors. We introduce a representation learning objective that aligns RQ code embedding space with the ordinal structure of target values, allowing the model to capture continuous representations for quantization codes and further improving prediction accuracy. We perform extensive evaluations on public benchmarks for lifetime value (LTV) and watch-time prediction, alongside a large-scale online experiment for GMV prediction on an industrial short-video recommendation platform. The results consistently show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while demonstrating strong generalization across diverse continuous value prediction tasks in recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>MoDora: Tree-Based Semi-Structured Document Analysis System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-structured documents integrate diverse interleaved data elements (e.g., tables, charts, hierarchical paragraphs) arranged in various and often irregular layouts. These documents are widely observed across domains and account for a large portion of real-world data. However, existing methods struggle to support natural language question answering over these documents due to three main technical challenges: (1) The elements extracted by techniques like OCR are often fragmented and stripped of their original semantic context, making them inadequate for analysis. (2) Existing approaches lack effective representations to capture hierarchical structures within documents (e.g., associating tables with nested chapter titles) and to preserve layout-specific distinctions (e.g., differentiating sidebars from main content). (3) Answering questions often requires retrieving and aligning relevant information scattered across multiple regions or pages, such as linking a descriptive paragraph to table cells located elsewhere in the document.
  To address these issues, we propose MoDora, an LLM-powered system for semi-structured document analysis. First, we adopt a local-alignment aggregation strategy to convert OCR-parsed elements into layout-aware components, and conduct type-specific information extraction for components with hierarchical titles or non-text elements. Second, we design the Component-Correlation Tree (CCTree) to hierarchically organize components, explicitly modeling inter-component relations and layout distinctions through a bottom-up cascade summarization process. Finally, we propose a question-type-aware retrieval strategy that supports (1) layout-based grid partitioning for location-based retrieval and (2) LLM-guided pruning for semantic-based retrieval. Experiments show MoDora outperforms baselines by 5.97%-61.07% in accuracy. The code is at https://github.com/weAIDB/MoDora.</description>

      <title>MaRI: Accelerating Ranking Model Inference via Structural Re-parameterization in Large Scale Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ranking models, i.e., coarse-ranking and fine-ranking models, serve as core components in large-scale recommendation systems, responsible for scoring massive item candidates based on user preferences. To meet the stringent latency requirements of online serving, structural lightweighting or knowledge distillation techniques are commonly employed for ranking model acceleration. However, these approaches typically lead to a non-negligible drop in accuracy. Notably, the angle of lossless acceleration by optimizing feature fusion matrix multiplication, particularly through structural reparameterization, remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MaRI, a novel Matrix Re-parameterized Inference framework, which serves as a complementary approach to existing techniques while accelerating ranking model inference without any accuracy loss. MaRI is motivated by the observation that user-side computation is redundant in feature fusion matrix multiplication, and we therefore adopt the philosophy of structural reparameterization to alleviate such redundancy.</description>

      <title>From Agnostic to Specific: Latent Preference Diffusion for Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-behavior sequential recommendation (MBSR) aims to learn the dynamic and heterogeneous interactions of users' multi-behavior sequences, so as to capture user preferences under target behavior for the next interacted item prediction. Unlike previous methods that adopt unidirectional modeling by mapping auxiliary behaviors to target behavior, recent concerns are shifting from behavior-fixed to behavior-specific recommendation. However, these methods still ignore the user's latent preference that underlying decision-making, leading to suboptimal solutions. Meanwhile, due to the asymmetric deterministic between items and behaviors, discriminative paradigm based on preference scoring is unsuitable to capture the uncertainty from low-entropy behaviors to high-entropy items, failing to provide efficient and diverse recommendation. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{FatsMB}, a framework based diffusion model that guides preference generation \textit{\textbf{F}rom Behavior-\textbf{A}gnostic \textbf{T}o Behavior-\textbf{S}pecific} in latent spaces, enabling diverse and accurate \textit{\textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{B}ehavior Sequential Recommendation}. Specifically, we design a Multi-Behavior AutoEncoder (MBAE) to construct a unified user latent preference space, facilitating interaction and collaboration across Behaviors, within Behavior-aware RoPE (BaRoPE) employed for multiple information fusion. Subsequently, we conduct target behavior-specific preference transfer in the latent space, enriching with informative priors. A Multi-Condition Guided Layer Normalization (MCGLN) is introduced for the denoising. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.</description>

      <title>Scaling Search Relevance: Augmenting App Store Ranking with LLM-Generated Judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale commercial search systems optimize for relevance to drive successful sessions that help users find what they are looking for. To maximize relevance, we leverage two complementary objectives: behavioral relevance (results users tend to click or download) and textual relevance (a result's semantic fit to the query). A persistent challenge is the scarcity of expert-provided textual relevance labels relative to abundant behavioral relevance labels. We first address this by systematically evaluating LLM configurations, finding that a specialized, fine-tuned model significantly outperforms a much larger pre-trained one in providing highly relevant labels. Using this optimal model as a force multiplier, we generate millions of textual relevance labels to overcome the data scarcity. We show that augmenting our production ranker with these textual relevance labels leads to a significant outward shift of the Pareto frontier: offline NDCG improves for behavioral relevance while simultaneously increasing for textual relevance. These offline gains were validated by a worldwide A/B test on the App Store ranker, which demonstrated a statistically significant +0.24% increase in conversion rate, with the most substantial performance gains occurring in tail queries, where the new textual relevance labels provide a robust signal in the absence of reliable behavioral relevance labels.</description>

      <title>Graph Your Way to Inspiration: Integrating Co-Author Graphs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Model Based Scientific Idea Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22215</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in the field of scientific idea generation. However, the generated results often lack controllable academic context and traceable inspiration pathways. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a scientific idea generation system called GYWI, which combines author knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to form an external knowledge base to provide controllable context and trace of inspiration path for LLMs to generate new scientific ideas. We first propose an author-centered knowledge graph construction method and inspiration source sampling algorithms to construct external knowledge base. Then, we propose a hybrid retrieval mechanism that is composed of both RAG and GraphRAG to retrieve content with both depth and breadth knowledge. It forms a hybrid context. Thirdly, we propose a Prompt optimization strategy incorporating reinforcement learning principles to automatically guide LLMs optimizing the results based on the hybrid context. To evaluate the proposed approaches, we constructed an evaluation dataset based on arXiv (2018-2023). This paper also develops a comprehensive evaluation method including empirical automatic assessment in multiple-choice question task, LLM-based scoring, human evaluation, and semantic space visualization analysis. The generated ideas are evaluated from the following five dimensions: novelty, feasibility, clarity, relevance, and significance. We conducted experiments on different LLMs including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-8B, and Gemini 2.5. Experimental results show that GYWI significantly outperforms mainstream LLMs in multiple metrics such as novelty, reliability, and relevance.</description>

      <title>MammoWise: Multi-Model Local RAG Pipeline for Mammography Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Screening mammography is high volume, time sensitive, and documentation heavy. Radiologists must translate subtle visual findings into consistent BI-RADS assessments, breast density categories, and structured narrative reports. While recent Vision Language Models (VLMs) enable image-to-text reporting, many rely on closed cloud systems or tightly coupled architectures that limit privacy, reproducibility, and adaptability. We present MammoWise, a local multi-model pipeline that transforms open source VLMs into mammogram report generators and multi-task classifiers. MammoWise supports any Ollama-hosted VLM and mammography dataset, and enables zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompting, with optional multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using a vector database for case-specific context. We evaluate MedGemma, LLaVA-Med, and Qwen2.5-VL on VinDr-Mammo and DMID datasets, assessing report quality (BERTScore, ROUGE-L), BI-RADS classification, breast density, and key findings. Report generation is consistently strong and improves with few-shot prompting and RAG. Classification is feasible but sensitive to model and dataset choice. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (QLoRA) of MedGemma improves reliability, achieving BI-RADS accuracy of 0.7545, density accuracy of 0.8840, and calcification accuracy of 0.9341 while preserving report quality. MammoWise provides a practical and extensible framework for deploying local VLMs for mammography reporting within a unified and reproducible workflow.</description>

      <title>Search-P1: Path-Centric Reward Shaping for Stable and Efficient Agentic RAG Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge, yet traditional single-round retrieval struggles with complex multi-step reasoning. Agentic RAG addresses this by enabling LLMs to dynamically decide when and what to retrieve, but current RL-based training methods suffer from sparse outcome rewards that discard intermediate signals and low sample efficiency where failed samples contribute nothing. We propose Search-P1, a framework that introduces path-centric reward shaping for agentic RAG training, comprising two key components: (1) Path-Centric Reward, which evaluates the structural quality of reasoning trajectories through order-agnostic step coverage and soft scoring that extracts learning signals even from failed samples, and (2) Dual-Track Path Scoring with offline-generated reference planners that assesses paths from both self-consistency and reference-alignment perspectives. Experiments on multiple QA benchmarks demonstrate that Search-P1 achieves significant improvements over Search-R1 and other strong baselines, with an average accuracy gain of 7.7 points.</description>

      <title>CiteLLM: An Agentic Platform for Trustworthy Scientific Reference Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to enhance the efficiency of scholarly activities; however, challenges persist in the ethical deployment of AI assistance, including (1) the trustworthiness of AI-generated content, (2) preservation of academic integrity and intellectual property, and (3) protection of information privacy. In this work, we present CiteLLM, a specialized agentic platform designed to enable trustworthy reference discovery for grounding author-drafted claims and statements. The system introduces a novel interaction paradigm by embedding LLM utilities directly within the LaTeX editor environment, ensuring a seamless user experience and no data transmission outside the local system. To guarantee hallucination-free references, we employ dynamic discipline-aware routing to retrieve candidates exclusively from trusted web-based academic repositories, while leveraging LLMs solely for generating context-aware search queries, ranking candidates by relevance, and validating and explaining support through paragraph-level semantic matching and an integrated chatbot. Evaluation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed system in returning valid and highly usable references.</description>

      <title>SPARTA: Scalable and Principled Benchmark of Tree-Structured Multi-hop QA over Text and Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world Table-Text question answering (QA) tasks require models that can reason across long text and source tables, traversing multiple hops and executing complex operations such as aggregation. Yet existing benchmarks are small, manually curated - and therefore error-prone - and contain shallow questions that seldom demand more than two hops or invoke aggregations, grouping, or other advanced analytical operations expressible in natural-language queries. We present SPARTA, an end-to-end construction framework that automatically generates large-scale Table-Text QA benchmarks with lightweight human validation, requiring only one quarter of the annotation time of HybridQA. The framework first constructs a reference fact database by enriching each source table with grounding tables whose tuples are atomic facts automatically extracted from the accompanying unstructured passages, then synthesizes nested queries whose number of nested predicates matches the desired hop count. To ensure that every SQL statement is executable and that its verbalization yields a fluent, human-sounding question, we propose two novel techniques: provenance-based refinement, which rewrites any syntactically valid query that returns a non-empty result, and realistic-structure enforcement, which confines generation to post-order traversals of the query graph. The resulting pipeline produces thousands of high-fidelity question-answer pairs covering aggregations, grouping, and deep multi-hop reasoning across text and tables. On SPARTA, state-of-the-art models that reach over 70 F1 on HybridQA or over 50 F1 on OTT-QA drop by more than 30 F1 points, exposing fundamental weaknesses in current cross-modal reasoning. Our benchmark, construction code, and baseline models are available at https://github.com/pshlego/SPARTA/tree/main.</description>

      <title>Understanding Usage and Engagement in AI-Powered Scientific Research Tools: The Asta Interaction Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-powered scientific research tools are rapidly being integrated into research workflows, yet the field lacks a clear lens into how researchers use these systems in real-world settings. We present and analyze the Asta Interaction Dataset, a large-scale resource comprising over 200,000 user queries and interaction logs from two deployed tools (a literature discovery interface and a scientific question-answering interface) within an LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation platform. Using this dataset, we characterize query patterns, engagement behaviors, and how usage evolves with experience. We find that users submit longer and more complex queries than in traditional search, and treat the system as a collaborative research partner, delegating tasks such as drafting content and identifying research gaps. Users treat generated responses as persistent artifacts, revisiting and navigating among outputs and cited evidence in non-linear ways. With experience, users issue more targeted queries and engage more deeply with supporting citations, although keyword-style queries persist even among experienced users. We release the anonymized dataset and analysis with a new query intent taxonomy to inform future designs of real-world AI research assistants and to support realistic evaluation.</description>

      <title>AlayaLaser: Efficient Index Layout and Search Strategy for Large-scale High-dimensional Vector Similarity Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-disk graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is essential for large-scale, high-dimensional vector retrieval, yet its performance is widely recognized to be limited by the prohibitive I/O costs. Interestingly, we observed that the performance of on-disk graph-based index systems is compute-bound, not I/O-bound, with the rising of the vector data dimensionality (e.g., hundreds or thousands). This insight uncovers a significant optimization opportunity: existing on-disk graph-based index systems universally target I/O reduction and largely overlook computational overhead, which leaves a substantial performance improvement space.
  In this work, we propose AlayaLaser, an efficient on-disk graph-based index system for large-scale high-dimensional vector similarity search. In particular, we first conduct performance analysis on existing on-disk graph-based index systems via the adapted roofline model, then we devise a novel on-disk data layout in AlayaLaser to effectively alleviate the compute-bound, which is revealed by the above roofline model analysis, by exploiting SIMD instructions on modern CPUs. We next design a suite of optimization techniques (e.g., degree-based node cache, cluster-based entry point selection, and early dispatch strategy) to further improve the performance of AlayaLaser. We last conduct extensive experimental studies on a wide range of large-scale high-dimensional vector datasets to verify the superiority of AlayaLaser. Specifically, AlayaLaser not only surpasses existing on-disk graph-based index systems but also matches or even exceeds the performance of in-memory index systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, bundle recommendation systems have gained significant attention in both academia and industry due to their ability to enhance user experience and increase sales by recommending a set of items as a bundle rather than individual items. This survey provides a comprehensive review on bundle recommendation, beginning by a taxonomy for exploring product bundling. We classify it into two categories based on bundling strategy from various application domains, i.e., discriminative and generative bundle recommendation. Then we formulate the corresponding tasks of the two categories and systematically review their methods: 1) representation learning from bundle and item levels and interaction modeling for discriminative bundle recommendation; 2) representation learning from item level and bundle generation for generative bundle recommendation. Subsequently, we survey the resources of bundle recommendation including datasets and evaluation metrics, and conduct reproducibility experiments on mainstream models. Lastly, we discuss the main challenges and highlight the promising future directions in the field of bundle recommendation, aiming to serve as a useful resource for researchers and practitioners. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/WUT-IDEA/bundle-recommendation-survey.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Event Extraction from Short Stories through Contextualized Prompts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event extraction is an important natural language processing (NLP) task of identifying events in an unstructured text. Although a plethora of works deal with event extraction from new articles, clinical text etc., only a few works focus on event extraction from literary content. Detecting events in short stories presents several challenges to current systems, encompassing a different distribution of events as compared to other domains and the portrayal of diverse emotional conditions. This paper presents \texttt{Vrittanta-EN}, a collection of 1000 English short stories annotated for real events. Exploring this field could result in the creation of techniques and resources that support literary scholars in improving their effectiveness. This could simultaneously influence the field of Natural Language Processing. Our objective is to clarify the intricate idea of events in the context of short stories. Towards the objective, we collected 1,000 short stories written mostly for children in the Indian context. Further, we present fresh guidelines for annotating event mentions and their categories, organized into \textit{seven distinct classes}. The classes are {\tt{COGNITIVE-MENTAL-STATE(CMS), COMMUNICATION(COM), CONFLICT(CON), GENERAL-ACTIVITY(GA), LIFE-EVENT(LE), MOVEMENT(MOV), and OTHERS(OTH)}}. Subsequently, we apply these guidelines to annotate the short story dataset. Later, we apply the baseline methods for automatically detecting and categorizing events. We also propose a prompt-based method for event detection and classification. The proposed method outperforms the baselines, while having significant improvement of more than 4\% for the class \texttt{CONFLICT} in event classification task.</description>

      <title>C$^3$: Capturing Consensus with Contrastive Learning in Group Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13703v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group recommendation aims to recommend tailored items to groups of users, where the key challenge is modeling a consensus that reflects member preferences. Although several existing deep learning models have achieved performance improvements, they still fail to capture consensus in various aspects: (1) Capturing consensus in small-group (2~5 members) recommendation systems, which align more closely with real-world scenarios, remains a significant challenge; (2) Most existing models significantly enhance the overall group performance but struggle with balancing individual and group performance. To address these issues, we propose Capturing Consensus with Contrastive Learning in Group Recommendation (C$^3$), which focuses on exploring the consensus behind group decision-making. A Transformer encoder is used to learn both group and user representations, and contrastive learning mitigates overfitting for users with many interactions, yielding more robust group representations. Experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that C$^3$ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both user and group recommendation tasks.</description>

      <title>Interact-RAG: Reason and Interact with the Corpus, Beyond Black-Box Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced LLMs by incorporating external information. However, prevailing agentic RAG approaches are constrained by a critical limitation: they treat the retrieval process as a black-box querying operation. This confines agents' actions to query issuing, hindering its ability to tackle complex information-seeking tasks. To address this, we introduce Interact-RAG, a new paradigm that elevates the LLM agent from a passive query issuer into an active manipulator of the retrieval process. We dismantle the black-box with a Corpus Interaction Engine, equipping the agent with a set of action primitives for fine-grained control over information retrieval. To further empower the agent on the entire RAG pipeline, we first develop a reasoning-enhanced workflow, which enables both zero-shot execution and the synthesis of interaction trajectories. We then leverage this synthetic data to train a fully autonomous end-to-end agent via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by refinement with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that Interact-RAG significantly outperforms other advanced methods, validating the efficacy of our reasoning-interaction strategy.</description>

      <title>The Wisdom of Many Queries: Complexity-Diversity Principle for Dense Retriever Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prior synthetic query generation for dense retrieval produces one query per document, focusing on quality. We systematically study multi-query synthesis, discovering a quality-diversity trade-off: quality benefits in-domain, diversity benefits out-of-domain (OOD). Experiments on 31 datasets show diversity especially benefits multi-hop retrieval. Analysis reveals diversity benefit correlates with query complexity (r&gt;=0.95), measured by content words (CW). We formalize this as the Complexity-Diversity Principle (CDP): query complexity determines optimal diversity. CDP provides thresholds (CW&gt;10: use diversity; CW&lt;7: avoid it) and enables CW-weighted training that improves OOD even with single-query data.</description>

      <title>ULTRA:Urdu Language Transformer-based Recommendation Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urdu, as a low-resource language, lacks effective semantic content recommendation systems, particularly in the domain of personalized news retrieval. Existing approaches largely rely on lexical matching or language-agnostic techniques, which struggle to capture semantic intent and perform poorly under varying query lengths and information needs. This limitation results in reduced relevance and adaptability in Urdu content recommendation. We propose ULTRA (Urdu Language Transformer-based Recommendation Architecture),an adaptive semantic recommendation framework designed to address these challenges. ULTRA introduces a dual-embedding architecture with a query-length aware routing mechanism that dynamically distinguishes between short, intent-focused queries and longer, context-rich queries. Based on a threshold-driven decision process, user queries are routed to specialized semantic pipelines optimized for either title/headline-level or full-content/document level representations, ensuring appropriate semantic granularity during retrieval. The proposed system leverages transformer-based embeddings and optimized pooling strategies to move beyond surface-level keyword matching and enable context-aware similarity search. Extensive experiments conducted on a large-scale Urdu news corpus demonstrate that the proposed architecture consistently improves recommendation relevance across diverse query types. Results show gains in precision above 90% compared to single-pipeline baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of query-adaptive semantic alignment for low-resource languages. The findings establish ULTRA as a robust and generalizable content recommendation architecture, offering practical design insights for semantic retrieval systems in low-resource language settings.</description>

      <title>From Latent to Observable Position-Based Click Models in Carousel Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Click models are a central component of learning and evaluation in recommender systems, yet most existing models are designed for single ranked-list interfaces. In contrast, modern recommender platforms increasingly use complex interfaces such as carousels, which consist of multiple swipeable lists that enable complex user browsing behaviors.
  In this paper, we study position-based click models in carousel interfaces and examine optimization methods, model structure, and alignment with user behavior. We propose three novel position-based models tailored to carousels, including the first position-based model without latent variables that incorporates observed examination signals derived from eye tracking data, called the Observed Examination Position-Based Model (OEPBM). We develop a general implementation of these carousel click models, supporting multiple optimization techniques and conduct experiments comparing gradient-based methods with classical approaches, namely expectation-maximization and maximum likelihood estimation.
  Our results show that gradient-based optimization consistently achieve better click likelihoods. Among the evaluated models, the OEPBM achieves the strongest performance in click prediction and produces examination patterns that most closely align to user behavior. However, we also demonstrate that strong click fit does not imply realistic modeling of user examination and browsing patterns. This reveals a fundamental limitation of click-only models in complex interfaces and the need for incorporating additional behavioral signals when designing click models for carousel-based recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Index Light, Reason Deep: Deferred Visual Ingestion for Visual-Dense Document Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing multimodal document question answering methods predominantly adopt a Pre-Ingestion (PI) strategy: during the indexing phase, a Vision Language Model (VLM) is called on every page to generate page descriptions that are then encoded into vectors, and questions are answered via embedding similarity retrieval. However, this approach faces a dual dilemma on visual-dense engineering documents: VLM blind descriptions inevitably lose critical visual details, and embedding retrieval systematically fails on highly similar documents. This paper proposes the Deferred Visual Ingestion (DVI) framework: zero VLM calls during preprocessing, leveraging only document structural information (table of contents, drawing numbers) to automatically build a hierarchical index through the HDNC (Hierarchical Drawing Number Clustering) algorithm; during inference, candidate pages are located via BM25 retrieval, and the original images along with the specific question are sent to a VLM for targeted analysis. Large-scale experiments on three datasets validate the effectiveness of DVI: on Bridge engineering drawings (1,323 questions), end-to-end QA accuracy reaches 65.6\% vs. PI's 24.3\% (+41.3pp); on Steel catalog (186 questions), 30.6\% vs. 16.1\% (+14.5pp); on CircuitVQA, a public benchmark (9,315 questions), retrieval ImgR@3 achieves 31.2\% vs. 0.7\%. On the Bridge dataset, we evaluated ColPali (ICLR 2025 visual retrieval SOTA), which achieved only 20.1\% PageR@3, demonstrating that the failure of embedding retrieval on homogeneous engineering documents is structural rather than due to insufficient model capability. Ablation studies show that HDNC zero-cost automatic indexing yields a +27.5pp retrieval improvement, and VLM conversion rate analysis confirms that the bottleneck lies on the retrieval side rather than the comprehension side.</description>

      <title>Both Ends Count! Just How Good are LLM Agents at "Text-to-Big SQL"?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL and Big Data are both extensively benchmarked fields, yet there is limited research that evaluates them jointly. In the real world, Text-to-SQL systems are often embedded with Big Data workflows, such as large-scale data processing or interactive data analytics. We refer to this as "Text-to-Big SQL". However, existing text-to-SQL benchmarks remain narrowly scoped and overlook the cost and performance implications that arise at scale. For instance, translation errors that are minor on small datasets lead to substantial cost and latency overheads as data scales, a relevant issue completely ignored by text-to-SQL metrics.
  In this paper, we overcome this overlooked challenge by introducing novel and representative metrics for evaluating Text-to-Big SQL. Our study focuses on production-level LLM agents, a database-agnostic system adaptable to diverse user needs. Via an extensive evaluation of frontier models, we show that text-to-SQL metrics are insufficient for Big Data. In contrast, our proposed text-to-Big SQL metrics accurately reflect execution efficiency, cost, and the impact of data scale. Furthermore, we provide LLM-specific insights, including fine-grained, cross-model comparisons of latency and cost.</description>
