      <title>A data-driven method to estimate contamination from light ion beam transmutation at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisions of relativistic light ions such as oxygen, neon, and magnesium, have been proposed as way to examine the system-size dependence of dynamics typically associated with the quark-gluon plasma produced in collisions of heavier ions such as xenon, gold, or lead. Recent efforts at both the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider have produced large datasets of proton-oxygen, oxygen-oxygen, and neon-neon collisions, catalyzing intense interest in experimental backgrounds associated with light ion collisions. In particular, electromagnetic dissociation of light ions while they are circulating in a collider can result in beam contamination that is difficult to simulate precisely. Here we propose a data-driven method for evaluating the potential impact of beam contaminants on physics analyses. The method exploits the time-dependence and smaller size of contaminant ion species to define control regions that can be used to quantify potential contamination effects. A simple model is used to illustrate the method and to study its robustness. This method can inform studies of recent LHC and RHIC data and could also be useful for future light ion programs at the LHC and beyond.</description>

      <title>Next generation direct RF sampling LLRF control and monitoring system for linear accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-level RF (LLRF) systems for linear accelerating structures are typically based on heterodyne architectures. The linear accelerators normally have many RF stations and multiple RF inputs and outputs for each station, so the complexity and size of the LLRF system grows rapidly when scaling up. To meet the design goals of being compact and affordable for future accelerators, or upgrading existing ones, we have developed and characterized the next generation LLRF (NG-LLRF) platform based on the RF system-on-chip (RFSoC) for S-band and C-band accelerating structures. The integrated RF data converters in RFSoC sample and generate the RF signals directly without any analogue mixing circuits, which significantly simplified the architecture compared with the conventional LLRF systems. We have performed high-power tests for the NG-LLRF with the S-band accelerating structure in the Next Linear Collider Test Accelerator (NLCTA) test facility at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and a C-band structure prototyped for Cool Cooper Collider (CCC). The NG-LLRF platform demonstrated pulse-to-pulse fluctuation levels considerably better than the requirements of the targeted applications and high precision and flexibility in generating and measuring the RF pulses. In this paper, the characterization results of the platform with different system architectures will be summarized and a selection of high-power test results of the NG-LLRF will be presented and analyzed.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium nonlinear response theory of amplitude-dependent dissipative conductivity in disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates amplitude-dependent nonlinear corrections to the dissipative conductivity in superconductors, using the Keldysh-Usadel theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity, which captures the nonequilibrium dynamics of both quasiparticles and the pair potential. Our rigorous formulation naturally incorporates both the direct nonlinear action of the photon field and indirect contributions mediated by nonequilibrium variations in the pair potential, namely the Eliashberg effect and the Higgs mode. The third-harmonic current, often regarded as a hallmark of the Higgs mode, arises from both the direct photon action and the Higgs mode. Our numerical results are in excellent agreement with previous studies. In contrast, the first-harmonic current, and consequently the dissipative conductivity, receives contributions from all three mechanisms: the direct photon action, the Higgs mode, and the Eliashberg effect. It is shown that that the nonlinear correction to dissipative conductivity can serve as a fingerprint of the Higgs mode, appearing as a resonance peak at a frequency near the superconducting gap \( \Delta \). In addition, our results provide microscopic insight into amplitude-dependent dissipation at frequencies well below \( \Delta \), which is particularly relevant for applied superconducting devices. In particular, the long-standing issue concerning the frequency dependence of the amplitude-dependent quality factor is explained as originating from the direct nonlinear action of the photon field, rather than from contributions by the Higgs mode and the Eliashberg effect. Our practical and explicit expression for the nonlinear conductivity formula makes our results accessible to a broad range of researchers.</description>
