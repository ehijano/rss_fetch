      <title>Pervasive impact of spatial dependence on predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the complex nature of spatial information is crucial for problem solving in social and environmental sciences. This study investigates how the underlying patterns of spatial data can significantly influence the outcomes of spatial predictions. Recognizing unique characteristics of spatial data, such as spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity, we delve into the fundamental differences and similarities between spatial and non-geospatial prediction models. Through the analysis of six different datasets of environment and socio-economic variables, comparing geospatial models with non-geospatial models, our research highlights the pervasive nature of spatial dependence beyond geographical boundaries. This innovative approach not only recognizes spatial dependence in geographic spaces defined by latitude and longitude but also identifies its presence in non-geographic, attribute-based dimensions. Our findings reveal the pervasive influence of spatial dependence on prediction outcomes across various domains, and spatial dependence significantly influences prediction performance across all spaces. Our findings suggest that the strongest spatial dependence is typically found in geographic space for environment variables, a trend that does not uniformly apply to socio-economic variables. This investigation not only advances the theoretical framework for spatial data analysis, but also proposes new methodologies for accurately capturing and expressing spatial dependence under complex conditions. Our research extends spatial analysis to non-geographic dimensions such as social networks and gene expression patterns, emphasizing the role of spatial dependence in improving prediction accuracy, thereby supporting interdisciplinary applications across fields such as geographic information science, environmental science, economics, sociology, and bioinformatics.</description>

      <title>Inferring ghost cities on the globe in newly developed urban areas based on urban vitality with multi-source data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to rapid urbanization over the past 20 years, many newly developed areas have lagged in socio-economic maturity, creating an imbalance with older cities and leading to the rise of "ghost cities." However, due to the complexity of socio-economic factors, no global studies have measured this phenomenon. We propose a unified framework based on urban vitality theory and multi-source data, validated by various data sources. We derived 8841 natural cities globally with an area over 5 square kiloxmeters and divided each into new urban areas (developed after 2005) and old urban areas (developed before 2005). Urban vitality was gauged using the density of road networks, points of interest (POIs), and population density with 1 km resolution across morphological, functional, and social dimensions. By comparing urban vitality in new and old urban areas, we quantify the ghost cities index (GCI) globally using the theory of urban vitality for the first time. The results reveal that the vitality of new urban areas is 7.69% that of old ones. The top 5% (442) of cities were designated as ghost cities, a finding mirrored by news media and other research. This study sheds light on strategies for sustainable global urbanization, crucial for the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.</description>

      <title>The networks of ingredient combination in cuisines around the world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating how different ingredients are combined in popular dishes is crucial to reveal the fundamental principles behind the formation of food preferences. Here, we use data from food repositories and network analysis to characterize worldwide cuisines. In our framework, each cuisine is represented as a network, where nodes correspond to ingredient types and weighted links describe how frequently pairs of ingredient types appear together in recipes. The networks of ingredient combinations reveal cuisine-specific patterns, highlighting similarities and differences in gastronomic preferences across different world regions. We find that popular ingredients, recurrent combinations, and the way they are organized within the backbone of the network provide a unique fingerprint for each cuisine. Hence, we demonstrate that networks of ingredient combinations are able to cluster global cuisines into meaningful geo-cultural groups, and can also be used to train models to uniquely identify a cuisine from a subset of its recipes. Our study advances our understanding of food combinations and helps uncover the geography of taste, paving the way for the creation of new and innovative recipes.</description>

      <title>Easy-access online social media metrics can effectively identify misinformation sharing users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Misinformation poses a significant challenge studied extensively by researchers, yet acquiring data to identify primary sharers is costly and challenging. To address this, we propose a low-barrier approach to differentiate social media users who are more likely to share misinformation from those who are less likely. Leveraging insights from previous studies, we demonstrate that easy-access online social network metrics -- average daily tweet count, and account age -- can be leveraged to help identify potential low factuality content spreaders on X (previously known as Twitter). We find that higher tweet frequency is positively associated with low factuality in shared content, while account age is negatively associated with it. We also find that some of the effects, namely the effect of the number of accounts followed and the number of tweets produced, differ depending on the number of followers a user has. Our findings show that relying on these easy-access social network metrics could serve as a low-barrier approach for initial identification of users who are more likely to spread misinformation, and therefore contribute to combating misinformation effectively on social media platforms.</description>

      <title>SatHub Panel: Satellite Interference in Observatories Around the World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite constellation interference occurs across astronomical disciplines. We present examples of interference from radio and $\gamma$-Ray astronomy to optical and spectroscopic interference in ground-based and space-borne facilities. In particular, we discuss the impact of artificial satellites on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), an Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope, as well as possible mitigation strategies for the European Southern Observatory 4-metre Multi-Object Spectrograph Telescope (ESO 4MOST). Furthermore, we shed light on how ground-based optical telescopes such as the Oukaimeden Observatory contribute to IAU Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference (IAU CPS) efforts that quantify satellite brightness.</description>

      <title>q-neighbor Ising model on a polarized network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the interplay between the lobby size $q$ in the $q$-neighbor Ising model of opinion formation [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 92}, 052105] and the level of overlap $v$ of two fully connected graphs. Results suggest that for each lobby size $q \ge 3$, a specific level of overlap $v^*$ exists, which destroys initially polarized clusters of opinions. By performing Monte-Carlo simulations, backed by an analytical approach, we show that the dependence of the $v^*$ on the lobby size $q$ is far from trivial in the absence of temperature, showing consecutive maximum and minimum, that additionally depends on the parity of $q$. The temperature is, in general, a destructive factor; its increase leads to the collapse of polarized clusters for smaller values of $v$ and additionally brings a substantial decrease in the level of polarization. However, we show that this behavior is counter-intuitively inverted for specific lobby sizes and temperature ranges.</description>

      <title>The rules of multiplayer cooperation in networks of communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community organization permeates both social and biological complex systems. To study its interplay with behavior emergence, we model mobile structured populations with multiplayer interactions. We derive general analytical methods for evolutionary dynamics under high home fidelity when populations self-organize into networks of asymptotically isolated communities. In this limit, community organization dominates over the network structure and emerging behavior is independent of network topology. We obtain the rules of multiplayer cooperation in networks of communities for different types of social dilemmas. The success of cooperation is a result of the benefits shared amongst communal cooperators outperforming the benefits reaped by defectors in mixed communities. Under weak selection, cooperation can evolve and be stable for any size (Q) and number (M) of communities if the reward-to-cost ratio (V/K) of public goods is higher than a critical value. Community organization is a solid mechanism for sustaining the evolution of cooperation under public goods dilemmas, particularly when populations are organized into a higher number of smaller communities. Contrary to public goods dilemmas relating to production, the multiplayer Hawk-Dove (HD) dilemma is a commons dilemma focusing on the fair consumption of preexisting resources. This game holds mixed results but tends to favour cooperation under larger communities, highlighting that the two types of social dilemmas might lead to solid differences in the behaviour adopted under community structure.</description>
