      <title>Embodiment-Induced Coordination Regimes in Tabular Multi-Agent Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centralized value learning is often assumed to improve coordination and stability in multi-agent reinforcement learning, yet this assumption is rarely tested under controlled conditions. We directly evaluate it in a fully tabular predator-prey gridworld by comparing independent and centralized Q-learning under explicit embodiment constraints on agent speed and stamina. Across multiple kinematic regimes and asymmetric agent roles, centralized learning fails to provide a consistent advantage and is frequently outperformed by fully independent learning, even under full observability and exact value estimation. Moreover, asymmetric centralized-independent configurations induce persistent coordination breakdowns rather than transient learning instability. By eliminating confounding effects from function approximation and representation learning, our tabular analysis isolates coordination structure as the primary driver of these effects. The results show that increased coordination can become a liability under embodiment constraints, and that the effectiveness of centralized learning is fundamentally regime and role dependent rather than universal.</description>

      <title>VissimRL: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Traffic Signal Control Based on Vissim</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic congestion remains a major challenge for urban transportation, leading to significant economic and environmental impacts. Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is one of the key measures to mitigate congestion, and recent studies have increasingly applied Reinforcement Learning (RL) for its adaptive capabilities. With respect to SUMO and CityFlow, the simulator Vissim offers high-fidelity driver behavior modeling and wide industrial adoption but remains underutilized in RL research due to its complex interface and lack of standardized frameworks. To address this gap, this paper proposes VissimRL, a modular RL framework for TSC that encapsulates Vissim's COM interface through a high-level Python API, offering standardized environments for both single- and multi-agent training. Experiments show that VissimRL significantly reduces development effort while maintaining runtime efficiency, and supports consistent improvements in traffic performance during training, as well as emergent coordination in multi-agent control. Overall, VissimRL demonstrates the feasibility of applying RL in high-fidelity simulations and serves as a bridge between academic research and practical applications in intelligent traffic signal control.</description>

      <title>Self-Organizing Railway Traffic Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving traffic management in case of perturbation is one of the main challenges in today's railway research. The great majority of the existing literature proposes approaches to make centralized decisions to minimize delay propagation. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm to the same aim: we design and implement a modular process to allow trains to self-organize. This process consists in having trains identifying their neighbors, formulating traffic management hypotheses, checking their compatibility and selecting the best ones through a consensus mechanism. Finally, these hypotheses are merged into a directly applicable traffic plan. In a thorough experimental analysis on a portion of the Italian network, we compare the results of self-organization with those of a state-of-the-art centralized approach. In particular, we make this comparison mimicking a realistic deployment thanks to a closed-loop framework including a microscopic railway simulator. The results indicate that self-organization achieves better results than the centralized algorithm, specifically thanks to the definition and exploitation of the instance decomposition allowed by the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Regret-Driven Portfolios: LLM-Guided Smart Clustering for Optimal Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We attempt to mitigate the persistent tradeoff between risk and return in medium- to long-term portfolio management. This paper proposes a novel LLM-guided no-regret portfolio allocation framework that integrates online learning dynamics, market sentiment indicators, and large language model (LLM)-based hedging to construct high-Sharpe ratio portfolios tailored for risk-averse investors and institutional fund managers. Our approach builds on a follow-the-leader approach, enriched with sentiment-based trade filtering and LLM-driven downside protection. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms a SPY buy-and-hold baseline by 69% in annualized returns and 119% in Sharpe ratio.</description>

      <title>ThinkTank-ME: A Multi-Expert Framework for Middle East Event Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event forecasting is inherently influenced by multifaceted considerations, including international relations, regional historical dynamics, and cultural contexts. However, existing LLM-based approaches employ single-model architectures that generate predictions along a singular explicit trajectory, constraining their ability to capture diverse geopolitical nuances across complex regional contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce ThinkTank-ME, a novel Think Tank framework for Middle East event forecasting that emulates collaborative expert analysis in real-world strategic decision-making. To facilitate expert specialization and rigorous evaluation, we construct POLECAT-FOR-ME, a Middle East-focused event forecasting benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of multi-expert collaboration in handling complex temporal geopolitical forecasting tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/LuminosityX/ThinkTank-ME.</description>

      <title>Learning to Collaborate: An Orchestrated-Decentralized Framework for Peer-to-Peer LLM Federation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized domains is constrained by a fundamental challenge: the need for diverse, cross-organizational data conflicts with the principles of data privacy and sovereignty. While Federated Learning (FL) provides a framework for collaboration without raw data exchange, its classic centralized form introduces a single point of failure and remains vulnerable to model inversion attacks. Decentralized FL (DFL) mitigates this risk by removing the central aggregator but typically relies on inefficient, random peer-to-peer (P2P) pairings, forming a collaboration graph that is blind to agent heterogeneity and risks negative transfer. This paper introduces KNEXA-FL, a novel framework for orchestrated decentralization that resolves this trade-off. KNEXA-FL employs a non-aggregating Central Profiler/Matchmaker (CPM) that formulates P2P collaboration as a contextual bandit problem, using a LinUCB algorithm on abstract agent profiles to learn an optimal matchmaking policy. It orchestrates direct knowledge exchange between heterogeneous, PEFT-based LLM agents via secure distillation, without ever accessing the models themselves. Our comprehensive experiments on a challenging code generation task show that KNEXA-FL yields substantial gains, improving Pass@1 by approx. 50% relative to random P2P collaboration. Critically, our orchestrated approach demonstrates stable convergence, in stark contrast to a powerful centralized distillation baseline which suffers from catastrophic performance collapse. Our work establishes adaptive, learning-based orchestration as a foundational principle for building robust and effective decentralized AI ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Agentic Systems: Beyond Model Explanations to System-Level Accountability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic systems have transformed how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged to create autonomous systems with goal-directed behaviors, consisting of multi-step planning and the ability to interact with different environments. These systems differ fundamentally from traditional machine learning models, both in architecture and deployment, introducing unique AI safety challenges, including goal misalignment, compounding decision errors, and coordination risks among interacting agents, that necessitate embedding interpretability and explainability by design to ensure traceability and accountability across their autonomous behaviors. Current interpretability techniques, developed primarily for static models, show limitations when applied to agentic systems. The temporal dynamics, compounding decisions, and context-dependent behaviors of agentic systems demand new analytical approaches. This paper assesses the suitability and limitations of existing interpretability methods in the context of agentic systems, identifying gaps in their capacity to provide meaningful insight into agent decision-making. We propose future directions for developing interpretability techniques specifically designed for agentic systems, pinpointing where interpretability is required to embed oversight mechanisms across the agent lifecycle from goal formation, through environmental interaction, to outcome evaluation. These advances are essential to ensure the safe and accountable deployment of agentic AI systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Self-Learning and Model Versioning for AI-native O-RAN Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AI-native vision of 6G requires Radio Access Networks to train, deploy, and continuously refine thousands of machine learning (ML) models that drive real-time radio network optimization. Although the Open RAN (O-RAN) architecture provides open interfaces and an intelligent control plane, it leaves the life-cycle management of these models unspecified. Consequently, operators still rely on ad-hoc, manual update practices that can neither scale across the heterogeneous, multi-layer stack of Cell-Site, Edge-, Regional-, and Central-Cloud domains, nor across the three O-RAN control loops (real-, near-real-, and non-real-time). We present a self-learning framework that provides an efficient closed-loop version management for an AI-native O-RAN edge. In this framework, training pipelines in the Central/Regional Cloud continuously generate new models, which are cataloged along with their resource footprints, security scores, and accuracy metrics in a shared version repository. An Update Manager consults this repository and applies a self-learning policy to decide when and where each new model version should be promoted into operation. A container orchestrator then realizes these decisions across heterogeneous worker nodes, enabling multiple services (rApps, xApps, and dApps) to obtain improved inference with minimal disruption. Simulation results show that an efficient RL-driven decision-making can guarantee quality of service, bounded latencies while balancing model accuracy, system stability, and resilience.</description>

      <title>Types for Grassroots Logic Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grassroots Logic Programs (GLP) is a concurrent logic programming language in which logic variables are partitioned into paired readers and writers. An assignment is produced at most once via a writer and consumed at most once via its paired reader, and may contain additional readers and/or writers. This enables the concise expression of rich multidirectional communication modalities.
  ``Logic Programs as Types for Logic Programs'' (LICS'91) defined types as regular sets of paths over derivable ground atoms. Here, we define types to be regular sets of moded paths, where a mode captures directionality of communication -- whether a subterm is consumed from or produced to the environment -- enabling the typing of interactive partial computations including those that eventually deadlock or fail, or never terminate. We provide a syntactic definition of well-typing and prove that a program is well-typed iff the path abstraction of its moded-atom semantics satisfies covariance and contravariance conditions with respect to its type.
  The GLP type system was implemented in Dart by AI, starting from a mathematical specification of Typed GLP (this paper), deriving from it an English spec (written by AI), and from the spec deriving Dart code (by AI). While GLP is naturally untyped, the motivation for Typed GLP comes from programming with AI: Asking AI to program complex communication modalities in GLP (and in general) and hoping for the best is a tenuous strategy. The emerging discipline we advocate and employ is for the human designer and AI to jointly develop and agree upon (1)~GLP types; (2)~GLP procedure type declarations; (3)~informal (English) descriptions of the procedures; and only then let AI attempt to write (4)~GLP code based on those.</description>

      <title>Eyes on the Mission: Mixed Methods Assessment of Eye-Tracker-Enabled Interactive Decision Support in a Simulated Unmanned Aerial Vehicle System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervisors in military command and control (C2) environments face dynamic conditions. Dynamically changing information continuously flows to the supervisors through multiple displays. In this environment, important pieces of information can be overlooked due to the complexity of tasks and environments. This study examined the efficacy of an eye-tracker-based adaptive attention-guided decision support tool (DST) for supervisors in a simulated C2 environment. The DST monitors supervisors' visual attention allocation in real time and displays visually salient cues if critical changes or events are missed. Twenty-five military students participated in a simulated intelligence task. Results indicated significant performance enhancement when the adaptive DST was present. Eye-tracking analysis also showed that longer, more frequent fixations on critical areas of interest were negatively correlated with performance. Additionally, post-experiment interviews revealed that the adaptive DST was unobtrusive and positively received. These findings underscore the potential of real-time gaze-based interventions to optimize supervisory decision-making. Future research could incorporate AI-driven approaches to better support supervisors in complex task environments.</description>

      <title>Dicey Games: Shared Sources of Randomness in Distributed Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a 4-player version of Matching Pennies where a team of three players competes against the Devil. Each player simultaneously says "Heads" or "Tails". The team wins if all four choices match; otherwise the Devil wins. If all team players randomise independently, they win with probability 1/8; if all players share a common source of randomness, they win with probability 1/2. What happens when each pair of team players shares a source of randomness? Can the team do better than win with probability 1/4? The surprising (and nontrivial) answer is yes! We introduce Dicey Games, a formal framework motivated by the study of distributed systems with shared sources of randomness (of which the above example is a specific instance). We characterise the existence, representation and computational complexity of optimal strategies in Dicey Games, and we study the problem of allocating limited sources of randomness optimally within a team.</description>

      <title>Emergent Cooperation in Quantum Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Using Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent cooperation in classical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning has gained significant attention, particularly in the context of Sequential Social Dilemmas (SSDs). While classical reinforcement learning approaches have demonstrated capability for emergent cooperation, research on extending these methods to Quantum Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning remains limited, particularly through communication. In this paper, we apply communication approaches to quantum Q-Learning agents: the Mutual Acknowledgment Token Exchange (MATE) protocol, its extension Mutually Endorsed Distributed Incentive Acknowledgment Token Exchange (MEDIATE), the peer rewarding mechanism Gifting, and Reinforced Inter-Agent Learning (RIAL). We evaluate these approaches in three SSDs: the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Iterated Stag Hunt, and Iterated Game of Chicken. Our experimental results show that approaches using MATE with temporal-difference measure (MATE\textsubscript{TD}), AutoMATE, MEDIATE-I, and MEDIATE-S achieved high cooperation levels across all dilemmas, demonstrating that communication is a viable mechanism for fostering emergent cooperation in Quantum Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.</description>

      <title>AdaReasoner: Dynamic Tool Orchestration for Iterative Visual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When humans face problems beyond their immediate capabilities, they rely on tools, providing a promising paradigm for improving visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Effective reasoning, therefore, hinges on knowing which tools to use, when to invoke them, and how to compose them over multiple steps, even when faced with new tools or new tasks. We introduce \textbf{AdaReasoner}, a family of multimodal models that learn tool use as a general reasoning skill rather than as tool-specific or explicitly supervised behavior. AdaReasoner is enabled by (i) a scalable data curation pipeline exposing models to long-horizon, multi-step tool interactions; (ii) Tool-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes tool selection and sequencing based on end-task success; and (iii) an adaptive learning mechanism that dynamically regulates tool usage. Together, these components allow models to infer tool utility from task context and intermediate outcomes, enabling coordination of multiple tools and generalization to unseen tools. Empirically, AdaReasoner exhibits strong tool-adaptive and generalization behaviors: it autonomously adopts beneficial tools, suppresses irrelevant ones, and adjusts tool usage frequency based on task demands, despite never being explicitly trained to do so. These capabilities translate into state-of-the-art performance across challenging benchmarks, improving the 7B base model by +24.9\% on average and surpassing strong proprietary systems such as GPT-5 on multiple tasks, including VSP and Jigsaw.</description>

      <title>LLM-Enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Expert Workflow for Real-Time P2P Energy Trading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity markets dynamically adapt to fluctuations in renewable energy and variations in demand, maximizing economic benefits through instantaneous price responses while enhancing grid flexibility. However, scaling expert guidance for massive personalized prosumers poses critical challenges, including diverse decision-making demands and a lack of customized modeling frameworks. This paper proposes an integrated large language model-multi-agent reinforcement learning (LLM-MARL) framework for real-time P2P energy trading to address challenges such as the limited technical capability of prosumers, the lack of expert experience, and security issues of distribution networks. LLMs are introduced as experts to generate personalized strategies, guiding MARL under the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm through imitation. To handle the scalability issues inherent in large-scale P2P networks, a differential attention-based critic network is introduced to efficiently extract key interaction features and enhance convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-generated strategies effectively substitute human experts. The proposed imitative expert MARL algorithms achieve significantly lower economic costs and voltage violation rates on test sets compared to baseline algorithms, while maintaining robust stability. This paper provides an effective solution for the real-time decision-making of the P2P electricity market by bridging expert knowledge with agent learning.</description>

      <title>TrustResearcher: Automating Knowledge-Grounded and Transparent Research Ideation with Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20844</link>

Abstract: Agentic systems have recently emerged as a promising tool to automate literature-based ideation. However, current systems often remain black-box, with limited transparency or control for researchers. Our work introduces TrustResearcher, a multi-agent demo system for knowledge-grounded and transparent ideation. Specifically, TrustResearcher integrates meticulously designed four stages into a unified framework: (A) Structured Knowledge Curation, (B) Diversified Idea Generation, (C) Multi-stage Idea Selection, and (D) Expert Panel Review and Synthesis. Different from prior pipelines, our system not only exposes intermediate reasoning states, execution logs, and configurable agents for inspections, but also enables diverse and evidence-aligned idea generation. Our design is also domain-agnostic, where the same pipeline can be instantiated in any scientific field. As an illustrative case, we demonstrate TrustResearcher on a graph-mining scenario (k-truss breaking problem), where it generates distinct, plausible candidates with evidence and critiques. A live demo and source code are available at https://github.com/valleysprings/TrustResearcher</description>

      <title>Agent Contracts: A Formal Framework for Resource-Bounded Autonomous AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Contract Net Protocol (1980) introduced coordination through contracts in multi-agent systems. Modern agent protocols standardize connectivity and interoperability; yet, none provide formal, resource governance-normative mechanisms to bound how much agents may consume or how long they may operate. We introduce Agent Contracts, a formal framework that extends the contract metaphor from task allocation to resource-bounded execution. An Agent Contract unifies input/output specifications, multi-dimensional resource constraints, temporal boundaries, and success criteria into a coherent governance mechanism with explicit lifecycle semantics. For multi-agent coordination, we establish conservation laws ensuring delegated budgets respect parent constraints, enabling hierarchical coordination through contract delegation. Empirical validation across four experiments demonstrates 90% token reduction with 525x lower variance in iterative workflows, zero conservation violations in multi-agent delegation, and measurable quality-resource tradeoffs through contract modes. Agent Contracts provide formal foundations for predictable, auditable, and resource-bounded autonomous AI deployment.</description>

      <title>Debate, Deliberate, Decide (D3): A Cost-Aware Adversarial Framework for Reliable and Interpretable LLM Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04663v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging due to inconsistency, bias, and the absence of transparent decision criteria in automated judging. We present Debate, Deliberate, Decide (D3), a cost-aware, adversarial multi-agent framework that orchestrates structured debate among role-specialized agents (advocates, a judge, and an optional jury) to produce reliable and interpretable evaluations. D3 instantiates two complementary protocols: (1) Multi-Advocate One-Round Evaluation (MORE), which elicits k parallel defenses per answer to amplify signal via diverse advocacy, and (2) Single-Advocate Multi-Round Evaluation (SAMRE) with budgeted stopping, which iteratively refines arguments under an explicit token budget and convergence checks. We develop a probabilistic model of score gaps that (i) characterizes reliability and convergence under iterative debate and (ii) explains the separation gains from parallel advocacy. Under mild assumptions, the posterior distribution of the round-r gap concentrates around the true difference and the probability of mis-ranking vanishes; moreover, aggregating across k advocates provably increases expected score separation. We complement theory with a rigorous experimental suite across MT-Bench, AlignBench, and AUTO-J, showing state-of-the-art agreement with human judgments (accuracy and Cohen's kappa), reduced positional and verbosity biases via anonymization and role diversification, and a favorable cost-accuracy frontier enabled by budgeted stopping. Ablations and qualitative analyses isolate the contributions of debate, aggregation, and anonymity. Together, these results establish D3 as a principled, practical recipe for reliable, interpretable, and cost-aware LLM evaluation.</description>

      <title>MAViS: A Multi-Agent Framework for Long-Sequence Video Storytelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08487v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we propose MAViS, a multi-agent collaborative framework designed to assist in long-sequence video storytelling by efficiently translating ideas into visual narratives. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling, keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage, agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools. Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness. Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative models and tools. With just a brief idea description, MAViS enables users to rapidly explore diverse visual storytelling and creative directions for sequential video generation by efficiently producing high-quality, complete long-sequence videos. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with narratives and background music.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Belief Reasoning with LLMs for Efficient Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents--a crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a Collaborative Belief World--an internal representation jointly modeling the physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables agents to parse external open-world knowledge into structured beliefs via a symbolic belief representation module, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World significantly reduces communication costs by 64-79% and improves task completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce capital games, which generalize the definition of standard games to incorporate dynamics. In capital games, payoffs are in units of capital which are not assumed to be units of utility. The dynamics allow us to infer player utilities from their individual payoffs and linearizable capital dynamics under the assumption that players aim to maximize the time-average growth rate of their capital.</description>

      <title>On the Fundamental Limits of LLMs at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have benefited enormously from scaling, yet these gains are bounded by five fundamental limitations: (1) hallucination, (2) context compression, (3) reasoning degradation, (4) retrieval fragility, and (5) multimodal misalignment. While existing surveys describe these phenomena empirically, they lack a rigorous theoretical synthesis connecting them to the foundational limits of computation, information, and learning. This work closes that gap by presenting a unified, proof-informed framework that formalizes the innate theoretical ceilings of LLM scaling. First, computability and uncomputability imply an irreducible residue of error: for any computably enumerable model family, diagonalization guarantees inputs on which some model must fail, and undecidable queries (e.g., halting-style tasks) induce infinite failure sets for all computable predictors. Second, information-theoretic and statistical constraints bound attainable accuracy even on decidable tasks, finite description length enforces compression error, and long-tail factual knowledge requires prohibitive sample complexity. Third, geometric and computational effects compress long contexts far below their nominal size due to positional under-training, encoding attenuation, and softmax crowding. We further show how likelihood-based training favors pattern completion over inference, how retrieval under token limits suffers from semantic drift and coupling noise, and how multimodal scaling inherits shallow cross-modal alignment. Across sections, we pair theorems and empirical evidence to outline where scaling helps, where it saturates, and where it cannot progress, providing both theoretical foundations and practical mitigation paths like bounded-oracle retrieval, positional curricula, and sparse or hierarchical attention.</description>

      <title>SWE-EVO: Benchmarking Coding Agents in Long-Horizon Software Evolution Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18470v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks for AI coding agents focus on isolated, single-issue tasks such as fixing a bug or implementing a small feature. However, real-world software engineering is fundamentally a long-horizon endeavor: developers must interpret high-level requirements, plan coordinated changes across many files, and evolve codebases over multiple iterations while preserving existing functionality. We introduce SWE-EVO, a benchmark that evaluates agents on this long-horizon software evolution challenge. Constructed from release notes and version histories of seven mature open-source Python projects, SWE-EVO comprises 48 evolution tasks that require agents to implement multi-step modifications spanning an average of 21 files, validated against comprehensive test suites averaging 874 tests per instance. Experiments with state-of-the-art models reveal a striking capability gap: even GPT-5 with OpenHands achieves only a 21 percent resolution rate on SWE-EVO, compared to 65 percent on the single-issue SWE-Bench Verified. This demonstrates that current agents struggle with sustained, multi-file reasoning. We also propose Fix Rate, a fine-grained metric that captures partial progress toward solving these complex, long-horizon tasks.</description>

      <title>The incompatibility of the Condorcet winner and loser criteria with positive involvement and resolvability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that there is no preferential voting method satisfying the Condorcet winner and loser criteria, positive involvement (if a candidate $x$ wins in an initial preference profile, then adding a voter who ranks $x$ uniquely first cannot cause $x$ to lose), and $n$-voter resolvability (if $x$ initially ties for winning, then $x$ can be made the unique winner by adding some set of up to $n$ voters). This impossibility theorem holds for any positive integer $n$. In a previous note, we proved an analogous result assuming an additional axiom of ordinal margin invariance, which we now show is unnecessary for an impossibility theorem, at least if the desired voting method is defined for five-candidate elections.</description>

      <title>CooperBench: Why Coding Agents Cannot be Your Teammates Yet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resolving team conflicts requires not only task-specific competence, but also social intelligence to find common ground and build consensus. As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence.</description>

      <title>TruthTensor: Evaluating LLMs through Human Imitation on Prediction Market under Drift and Holistic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating language models and AI agents remains fundamentally challenging because static benchmarks fail to capture real-world uncertainty, distribution shift, and the gap between isolated task accuracy and human-aligned decision-making under evolving conditions. This paper introduces TruthTensor, a novel, reproducible evaluation paradigm that measures reasoning models not only as prediction engines but as human-imitation systems operating in socially-grounded, high-entropy environments. Building on forward-looking, contamination-free tasks, our framework anchors evaluation to live prediction markets and combines probabilistic scoring to provide a holistic view of model behavior. TruthTensor complements traditional correctness metrics with drift-centric diagnostics and explicit robustness checks for reproducibility. It specify human vs. automated evaluation roles, annotation protocols, and statistical testing procedures to ensure interpretability and replicability of results. In experiments across 500+ real markets (political, economic, cultural, technological), TruthTensor demonstrates that models with similar forecast accuracy can diverge markedly in calibration, drift, and risk-sensitivity, underscoring the need to evaluate models along multiple axes (accuracy, calibration, narrative stability, cost, and resource efficiency). TruthTensor therefore operationalizes modern evaluation best practices, clear hypothesis framing, careful metric selection, transparent compute/cost reporting, human-in-the-loop validation, and open, versioned evaluation contracts, to produce defensible assessments of LLMs in real-world decision contexts. We publicly released TruthTensor at https://truthtensor.com.</description>

      <title>Collective intelligence in science: direct elicitation of diverse information from experts with unknown information structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose we need a deep collective analysis of an open scientific problem: there is a complex scientific hypothesis and a large online group of mutually unrelated experts with relevant private information of a diverse and unpredictable nature. This information may be results of experts' individual experiments, original reasoning of some of them, results of AI systems they use, etc. We propose a simple mechanism based on a self-resolving play-money prediction market entangled with a chat. We show that such a system can easily be brought to an equilibrium where participants directly share their private information on the hypothesis through the chat and trade as if the market were resolved in accordance with the truth of the hypothesis. This approach will lead to efficient aggregation of relevant information in a completely interpretable form even if the ground truth cannot be established and experts initially know nothing about each other and cannot perform complex Bayesian calculations. Finally, by rewarding the experts with some real assets proportionally to the play money they end up with, we can get an innovative way to fund large-scale collaborative studies of any type.</description>
