      <title>Diffusion posterior sampling for simulation-based inference in tall data settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining which parameters of a non-linear model could best describe a set of experimental data is a fundamental problem in science and it has gained much traction lately with the rise of complex large-scale simulators (a.k.a. black-box simulators). The likelihood of such models is typically intractable, which is why classical MCMC methods can not be used. Simulation-based inference (SBI) stands out in this context by only requiring a dataset of simulations to train deep generative models capable of approximating the posterior distribution that relates input parameters to a given observation. In this work, we consider a tall data extension in which multiple observations are available and one wishes to leverage their shared information to better infer the parameters of the model. The method we propose is built upon recent developments from the flourishing score-based diffusion literature and allows us to estimate the tall data posterior distribution simply using information from the score network trained on individual observations. We compare our method to recently proposed competing approaches on various numerical experiments and demonstrate its superiority in terms of numerical stability and computational cost.</description>

      <title>Robust performance metrics for imbalanced classification problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that established performance metrics in binary classification, such as the F-score, the Jaccard similarity coefficient or Matthews' correlation coefficient (MCC), are not robust to class imbalance in the sense that if the proportion of the minority class tends to $0$, the true positive rate (TPR) of the Bayes classifier under these metrics tends to $0$ as well. Thus, in imbalanced classification problems, these metrics favour classifiers which ignore the minority class. To alleviate this issue we introduce robust modifications of the F-score and the MCC for which, even in strongly imbalanced settings, the TPR is bounded away from $0$. We numerically illustrate the behaviour of the various performance metrics in simulations as well as on a credit default data set. We also discuss connections to the ROC and precision-recall curves and give recommendations on how to combine their usage with performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Overparameterized Multiple Linear Regression as Hyper-Curve Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper shows that the application of the fixed-effect multiple linear regression model to an overparameterized dataset is equivalent to fitting the data with a hyper-curve parameterized by a single scalar parameter. This equivalence allows for a predictor-focused approach, where each predictor is described by a function of the chosen parameter. It is proven that a linear model will produce exact predictions even in the presence of nonlinear dependencies that violate the model assumptions. Parameterization in terms of the dependent variable and the monomial basis in the predictor function space are applied here to both synthetic and experimental data. The hyper-curve approach is especially suited for the regularization of problems with noise in predictor variables and can be used to remove noisy and "improper" predictors from the model.</description>

      <title>Inferring Change Points in High-Dimensional Linear Regression via Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of localizing change points in high-dimensional linear regression. We propose an Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm for estimating both the signals and the change point locations. Assuming Gaussian covariates, we give an exact asymptotic characterization of its estimation performance in the limit where the number of samples grows proportionally to the signal dimension. Our algorithm can be tailored to exploit any prior information on the signal, noise, and change points. It also enables uncertainty quantification in the form of an efficiently computable approximate posterior distribution, whose asymptotic form we characterize exactly. We validate our theory via numerical experiments, and demonstrate the favorable performance of our estimators on both synthetic data and images.</description>

      <title>A solution for the mean parametrization of the von Mises-Fisher distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The von Mises-Fisher distribution as an exponential family can be expressed in terms of either its natural or its mean parameters. Unfortunately, however, the normalization function for the distribution in terms of its mean parameters is not available in closed form, limiting the practicality of the mean parametrization and complicating maximum-likelihood estimation more generally. We derive a second-order ordinary differential equation, the solution to which yields the mean-parameter normalizer along with its first two derivatives, as well as the variance function of the family. We also provide closed-form approximations to the solution of the differential equation. This allows rapid evaluation of both densities and natural parameters in terms of mean parameters. We show applications to topic modeling with mixtures of von Mises-Fisher distributions using Bregman Clustering.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Reinforcement Learning with Self-Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of multi-agent reinforcement learning (multi-agent RL) with differential privacy (DP) constraints. This is well-motivated by various real-world applications involving sensitive data, where it is critical to protect users' private information. We first extend the definitions of Joint DP (JDP) and Local DP (LDP) to two-player zero-sum episodic Markov Games, where both definitions ensure trajectory-wise privacy protection. Then we design a provably efficient algorithm based on optimistic Nash value iteration and privatization of Bernstein-type bonuses. The algorithm is able to satisfy JDP and LDP requirements when instantiated with appropriate privacy mechanisms. Furthermore, for both notions of DP, our regret bound generalizes the best known result under the single-agent RL case, while our regret could also reduce to the best known result for multi-agent RL without privacy constraints. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first line of results towards understanding trajectory-wise privacy protection in multi-agent RL.</description>

      <title>Applying Guidance in a Limited Interval Improves Sample and Distribution Quality in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guidance is a crucial technique for extracting the best performance out of image-generating diffusion models. Traditionally, a constant guidance weight has been applied throughout the sampling chain of an image. We show that guidance is clearly harmful toward the beginning of the chain (high noise levels), largely unnecessary toward the end (low noise levels), and only beneficial in the middle. We thus restrict it to a specific range of noise levels, improving both the inference speed and result quality. This limited guidance interval improves the record FID in ImageNet-512 significantly, from 1.81 to 1.40. We show that it is quantitatively and qualitatively beneficial across different sampler parameters, network architectures, and datasets, including the large-scale setting of Stable Diffusion XL. We thus suggest exposing the guidance interval as a hyperparameter in all diffusion models that use guidance.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Diffusion Models: Applications, Guided Generation, Statistical Rates and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models, a powerful and universal generative AI technology, have achieved tremendous success in computer vision, audio, reinforcement learning, and computational biology. In these applications, diffusion models provide flexible high-dimensional data modeling, and act as a sampler for generating new samples under active guidance towards task-desired properties. Despite the significant empirical success, theory of diffusion models is very limited, potentially slowing down principled methodological innovations for further harnessing and improving diffusion models. In this paper, we review emerging applications of diffusion models, understanding their sample generation under various controls. Next, we overview the existing theories of diffusion models, covering their statistical properties and sampling capabilities. We adopt a progressive routine, beginning with unconditional diffusion models and connecting to conditional counterparts. Further, we review a new avenue in high-dimensional structured optimization through conditional diffusion models, where searching for solutions is reformulated as a conditional sampling problem and solved by diffusion models. Lastly, we discuss future directions about diffusion models. The purpose of this paper is to provide a well-rounded theoretical exposure for stimulating forward-looking theories and methods of diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Quality check of a sample partition using multinomial distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we advocate a novel measure for the purpose of checking the quality of a cluster partition for a sample into several distinct classes, and thus, determine the unknown value for the true number of clusters prevailing the provided set of data. Our objective leads us to the development of an approach through applying the multinomial distribution to the distances of data members, clustered in a group, from their respective cluster representatives. This procedure is carried out independently for each of the clusters, and the concerned statistics are combined together to design our targeted measure. Individual clusters separately possess the category-wise probabilities which correspond to different positions of its members in the cluster with respect to a typical member, in the form of cluster-centroid, medoid or mode, referred to as the corresponding cluster representative. Our method is robust in the sense that it is distribution-free, since this is devised irrespective of the parent distribution of the underlying sample. It fulfills one of the rare coveted qualities, present in the existing cluster accuracy measures, of having the capability to investigate whether the assigned sample owns any inherent clusters other than a single group of all members or not. Our measure's simple concept, easy algorithm, fast runtime, good performance, and wide usefulness, demonstrated through extensive simulation and diverse case-studies, make it appealing.</description>

      <title>Post-Hoc Reversal: Are We Selecting Models Prematurely?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trained models are often composed with post-hoc transforms such as temperature scaling (TS), ensembling and stochastic weight averaging (SWA) to improve performance, robustness, uncertainty estimation, etc. However, such transforms are typically applied only after the base models have already been finalized by standard means. In this paper, we challenge this practice with an extensive empirical study. In particular, we demonstrate a phenomenon that we call post-hoc reversal, where performance trends are reversed after applying these post-hoc transforms. This phenomenon is especially prominent in high-noise settings. For example, while base models overfit badly early in training, both conventional ensembling and SWA favor base models trained for more epochs. Post-hoc reversal can also suppress the appearance of double descent and mitigate mismatches between test loss and test error seen in base models. Based on our findings, we propose post-hoc selection, a simple technique whereby post-hoc metrics inform model development decisions such as early stopping, checkpointing, and broader hyperparameter choices. Our experimental analyses span real-world vision, language, tabular and graph datasets from domains like satellite imaging, language modeling, census prediction and social network analysis. On an LLM instruction tuning dataset, post-hoc selection results in &gt; 1.5x MMLU improvement compared to naive selection.

      <title>Rate-Optimal Non-Asymptotics for the Quadratic Prediction Error Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quadratic prediction error method -- i.e., nonlinear least squares -- for a class of time-varying parametric predictor models satisfying a certain identifiability condition. While this method is known to asymptotically achieve the optimal rate for a wide range of problems, there have been no non-asymptotic results matching these optimal rates outside of a select few, typically linear, model classes. By leveraging modern tools from learning with dependent data, we provide the first rate-optimal non-asymptotic analysis of this method for our more general setting of nonlinearly parametrized model classes. Moreover, we show that our results can be applied to a particular class of identifiable AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) models, resulting in the first optimal non-asymptotic rates for identification of ARMA models.</description>

      <title>Random Forests for time-fixed and time-dependent predictors: The DynForest R package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The R package DynForest implements random forests for predicting a continuous, a categorical or a (multiple causes) time-to-event outcome based on time-fixed and time-dependent predictors. The main originality of DynForest is that it handles time-dependent predictors that can be endogeneous (i.e., impacted by the outcome process), measured with error and measured at subject-specific times. At each recursive step of the tree building process, the time-dependent predictors are internally summarized into individual features on which the split can be done. This is achieved using flexible linear mixed models (thanks to the R package lcmm) which specification is pre-specified by the user. DynForest returns the mean for continuous outcome, the category with a majority vote for categorical outcome or the cumulative incidence function over time for survival outcome. DynForest also computes variable importance and minimal depth to inform on the most predictive variables or groups of variables. This paper aims to guide the user with step-by-step examples for fitting random forests using DynForest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13356v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The usual goal of supervised learning is to find the best model, the one that optimizes a particular performance measure. However, what if the explanation provided by this model is completely different from another model and different again from another model despite all having similarly good fit statistics? Is it possible that the equally effective models put the spotlight on different relationships in the data? Inspired by Anscombe's quartet, this paper introduces a Rashomon Quartet, i.e. a set of four models built on a synthetic dataset which have practically identical predictive performance. However, the visual exploration reveals distinct explanations of the relations in the data. This illustrative example aims to encourage the use of methods for model visualization to compare predictive models beyond their performance.</description>

      <title>Spectral clustering in the Gaussian mixture block model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian mixture block models are distributions over graphs that strive to model modern networks: to generate a graph from such a model, we associate each vertex $i$ with a latent feature vector $u_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ sampled from a mixture of Gaussians, and we add edge $(i,j)$ if and only if the feature vectors are sufficiently similar, in that $\langle u_i,u_j \rangle \ge \tau$ for a pre-specified threshold $\tau$. The different components of the Gaussian mixture represent the fact that there may be different types of nodes with different distributions over features -- for example, in a social network each component represents the different attributes of a distinct community. Natural algorithmic tasks associated with these networks are embedding (recovering the latent feature vectors) and clustering (grouping nodes by their mixture component).
  In this paper we initiate the study of clustering and embedding graphs sampled from high-dimensional Gaussian mixture block models, where the dimension of the latent feature vectors $d\to \infty$ as the size of the network $n \to \infty$. This high-dimensional setting is most appropriate in the context of modern networks, in which we think of the latent feature space as being high-dimensional. We analyze the performance of canonical spectral clustering and embedding algorithms for such graphs in the case of 2-component spherical Gaussian mixtures, and begin to sketch out the information-computation landscape for clustering and embedding in these models.</description>

      <title>Grokking as the Transition from Lazy to Rich Training Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that the grokking phenomenon, where the train loss of a neural network decreases much earlier than its test loss, can arise due to a neural network transitioning from lazy training dynamics to a rich, feature learning regime. To illustrate this mechanism, we study the simple setting of vanilla gradient descent on a polynomial regression problem with a two layer neural network which exhibits grokking without regularization in a way that cannot be explained by existing theories. We identify sufficient statistics for the test loss of such a network, and tracking these over training reveals that grokking arises in this setting when the network first attempts to fit a kernel regression solution with its initial features, followed by late-time feature learning where a generalizing solution is identified after train loss is already low. We find that the key determinants of grokking are the rate of feature learning -- which can be controlled precisely by parameters that scale the network output -- and the alignment of the initial features with the target function $y(x)$. We argue this delayed generalization arises when (1) the top eigenvectors of the initial neural tangent kernel and the task labels $y(x)$ are misaligned, but (2) the dataset size is large enough so that it is possible for the network to generalize eventually, but not so large that train loss perfectly tracks test loss at all epochs, and (3) the network begins training in the lazy regime so does not learn features immediately. We conclude with evidence that this transition from lazy (linear model) to rich training (feature learning) can control grokking in more general settings, like on MNIST, one-layer Transformers, and student-teacher networks.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Representation-Induced Confounding Bias for Treatment Effect Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation make widespread use of representation learning. Here, the idea is to reduce the variance of the low-sample CATE estimation by a (potentially constrained) low-dimensional representation. However, low-dimensional representations can lose information about the observed confounders and thus lead to bias, because of which the validity of representation learning for CATE estimation is typically violated. In this paper, we propose a new, representation-agnostic refutation framework for estimating bounds on the representation-induced confounding bias that comes from dimensionality reduction (or other constraints on the representations) in CATE estimation. First, we establish theoretically under which conditions CATE is non-identifiable given low-dimensional (constrained) representations. Second, as our remedy, we propose a neural refutation framework which performs partial identification of CATE or, equivalently, aims at estimating lower and upper bounds of the representation-induced confounding bias. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our bounds in a series of experiments. In sum, our refutation framework is of direct relevance in practice where the validity of CATE estimation is of importance.</description>

      <title>Neural Hilbert Ladders: Multi-Layer Neural Networks in Function Space</title>

Abstract: To characterize the function space explored by neural networks (NNs) is an important aspect of learning theory. In this work, noticing that a multi-layer NN generates implicitly a hierarchy of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) - named a neural Hilbert ladder (NHL) - we define the function space as an infinite union of RKHSs, which generalizes the existing Barron space theory of two-layer NNs. We then establish several theoretical properties of the new space. First, we prove a correspondence between functions expressed by L-layer NNs and those belonging to L-level NHLs. Second, we prove generalization guarantees for learning an NHL with a controlled complexity measure. Third, we derive a non-Markovian dynamics of random fields that governs the evolution of the NHL which is induced by the training of multi-layer NNs in an infinite-width mean-field limit. Fourth, we show examples of depth separation in NHLs under the ReLU activation function. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the feature learning aspect of NN training through the lens of NHLs.</description>

      <title>Risk Estimation in a Markov Cost Process: Lower and Upper Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We tackle the problem of estimating risk measures of the infinite-horizon discounted cost within a Markov cost process. The risk measures we study include variance, Value-at-Risk (VaR), and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). First, we show that estimating any of these risk measures with $\epsilon$-accuracy, either in expected or high-probability sense, requires at least $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ samples. Then, using a truncation scheme, we derive an upper bound for the CVaR and variance estimation. This bound matches our lower bound up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we discuss an extension of our estimation scheme that covers more general risk measures satisfying a certain continuity criterion, e.g., spectral risk measures, utility-based shortfall risk. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to provide lower and upper bounds for estimating any risk measure beyond the mean within a Markovian setting. Our lower bounds also extend to the infinite-horizon discounted costs' mean. Even in that case, our lower bound of $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2) $ improves upon the existing $\Omega(1/\epsilon)$ bound [13].</description>

      <title>A quasi-polynomial time algorithm for Multi-Dimensional Scaling via LP hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS) is a family of methods for embedding an $n$-point metric into low-dimensional Euclidean space. We study the Kamada-Kawai formulation of MDS: given a set of non-negative dissimilarities $\{d_{i,j}\}_{i , j \in [n]}$ over $n$ points, the goal is to find an embedding $\{x_1,\dots,x_n\} \in \mathbb{R}^k$ that minimizes \[\text{OPT} = \min_{x} \mathbb{E}_{i,j \in [n]} \left[ \left(1-\frac{\|x_i - x_j\|}{d_{i,j}}\right)^2 \right] \]
  Kamada-Kawai provides a more relaxed measure of the quality of a low-dimensional metric embedding than the traditional bi-Lipschitz-ness measure studied in theoretical computer science; this is advantageous because strong hardness-of-approximation results are known for the latter, Kamada-Kawai admits nontrivial approximation algorithms. Despite its popularity, our theoretical understanding of MDS is limited. Recently, Demaine, Hesterberg, Koehler, Lynch, and Urschel (arXiv:2109.11505) gave the first approximation algorithm with provable guarantees for Kamada-Kawai in the constant-$k$ regime, with cost $\text{OPT} +\epsilon$ in $n^2 2^{\text{poly}(\Delta/\epsilon)}$ time, where $\Delta$ is the aspect ratio of the input. In this work, we give the first approximation algorithm for MDS with quasi-polynomial dependency on $\Delta$: we achieve a solution with cost $\tilde{O}(\log \Delta)\text{OPT}^{\Omega(1)}+\epsilon$ in time $n^{O(1)}2^{\text{poly}(\log(\Delta)/\epsilon)}$.
  Our approach is based on a novel analysis of a conditioning-based rounding scheme for the Sherali-Adams LP Hierarchy. Crucially, our analysis exploits the geometry of low-dimensional Euclidean space, allowing us to avoid an exponential dependence on the aspect ratio. We believe our geometry-aware treatment of the Sherali-Adams Hierarchy is an important step towards developing general-purpose techniques for efficient metric optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Group Decision-Making among Privacy-Aware Agents</title>

Abstract: How can individuals exchange information to learn from each other despite their privacy needs and security concerns? For example, consider individuals deliberating a contentious topic and being concerned about divulging their private experiences. Preserving individual privacy and enabling efficient social learning are both important desiderata but seem fundamentally at odds with each other and very hard to reconcile. We do so by controlling information leakage using rigorous statistical guarantees that are based on differential privacy (DP). Our agents use log-linear rules to update their beliefs after communicating with their neighbors. Adding DP randomization noise to beliefs provides communicating agents with plausible deniability with regard to their private information and their network neighborhoods. We consider two learning environments one for distributed maximum-likelihood estimation given a finite number of private signals and another for online learning from an infinite, intermittent signal stream. Noisy information aggregation in the finite case leads to interesting tradeoffs between rejecting low-quality states and making sure all high-quality states are accepted in the algorithm output. Our results flesh out the nature of the trade-offs in both cases between the quality of the group decision outcomes, learning accuracy, communication cost, and the level of privacy protections that the agents are afforded.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for particle gradient descent, and extensions of the log-Sobolev and Talagrand inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove non-asymptotic error bounds for particle gradient descent (PGD)~(Kuntz et al., 2023), a recently introduced algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of large latent variable models obtained by discretizing a gradient flow of the free energy. We begin by showing that, for models satisfying a condition generalizing both the log-Sobolev and the Polyak--{\L}ojasiewicz inequalities (LSI and P{\L}I, respectively), the flow converges exponentially fast to the set of minimizers of the free energy. We achieve this by extending a result well-known in the optimal transport literature (that the LSI implies the Talagrand inequality) and its counterpart in the optimization literature (that the P{\L}I implies the so-called quadratic growth condition), and applying it to our new setting. We also generalize the Bakry--\'Emery Theorem and show that the LSI/P{\L}I generalization holds for models with strongly concave log-likelihoods. For such models, we further control PGD's discretization error, obtaining non-asymptotic error bounds. While we are motivated by the study of PGD, we believe that the inequalities and results we extend may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Provable Privacy with Non-Private Pre-Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When analysing Differentially Private (DP) machine learning pipelines, the potential privacy cost of data-dependent pre-processing is frequently overlooked in privacy accounting. In this work, we propose a general framework to evaluate the additional privacy cost incurred by non-private data-dependent pre-processing algorithms. Our framework establishes upper bounds on the overall privacy guarantees by utilising two new technical notions: a variant of DP termed Smooth DP and the bounded sensitivity of the pre-processing algorithms. In addition to the generic framework, we provide explicit overall privacy guarantees for multiple data-dependent pre-processing algorithms, such as data imputation, quantization, deduplication and PCA, when used in combination with several DP algorithms. Notably, this framework is also simple to implement, allowing direct integration into existing DP pipelines.</description>
