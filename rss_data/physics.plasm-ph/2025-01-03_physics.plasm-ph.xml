      <title>Bulk and surface dominated phenomena and the formation of pentagonal structures in 2-D strongly coupled finite dust clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the prevalence of size-dependent aspects in the context of dust clusters with the help of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations in two dimensions. The transition from macroscale (identified by the dominance of the number of dust particles in bulk) to microscale (where the number of particles on the surface dominates) is explored systematically. The dust particles organize in a multi-ringed structure under transverse confinement. The ring size and the number of rings increase with increasing number of dust particles. Interestingly, the formation of an additional ring is always preceded by structures with a pentagonal symmetry in the core. A detailed study of this formation has been investigated under various symmetries of the boundary condition and different values of the shielding potential.</description>

      <title>On the Nature of Subharmonics of the Electron Emission from Ultracold Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most interesting phenomena in the ultracold plasmas are multiple subharmonics of the electron emission observed after its irradiation by radiowaves. Unfortunately, the early interpretation of this phenomenon as the so-called Tonks-Dattner resonances (i.e., actually the standing Langmuir waves) encounters a number of serious obstacles, such as a lack of the adequate boundary conditions, an incorrect dependence on the electron temperature, and an insensitivity to the shape of the cloud. Here, we suggest an alternative interpretation based on the quasi-classical multiphoton ionization of the secondary Rydberg atoms formed in the expanding and cooling plasma clouds. As follows from our numerical simulations, the efficiency of such ionization really exhibits a series of well-expressed peaks. Moreover, this process is evidently irrelevant to the boundary conditions and global shape of the cloud. Therefore, this should be a viable alternative to the earlier idea of Tonks-Dattner resonances.</description>

      <title>Thermionic Current Beyond the Traditional Space Charge Limit Enabled by Trapped Ions in the Virtual Cathode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that ion trapping in virtual cathodes can raise the transmitted current of emitted electrons much closer to the full emission than is predicted by theories without trapped ions. The transmitted current is controlled by the well voltage whose value must adjust to balance the creation of low-energy ions within the well, and their leakage over the well. Our model quantifies these rates and derives the current in terms of system parameters for cathode emission into a plasma in several geometries. A general prediction is that the current as a function of emitted flux does not saturate at the traditional space charge limit (the onset of a well) but can reach far higher values. Improved performance might be achieved in plasma technologies with hot cathodes through suitable optimization of the trapped ion balance.</description>

      <title>A Ritz variational principle for local collisionless gyrokinetic instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence driven by gyrokinetic instabilities is largely responsible for transport in magnetic fusion devices. To estimate this turbulent transport, integrated modeling codes often use mixing length estimates in conjunction with reduced models of the linearized gyrokinetic equation. One common method of formulating and solving the linearized gyrokinetic eigenvalue problem equation uses a Ritz variational principle, particularly in the local collisionless limit. However, the variational principle as typically stated in the literature is mathematically incorrect. In this work, we derive a mathematically correct form of the variational principle that applies to local linear collisionless gyrokinetics in general geometry with electromagnetic effects. We also explicitly derive a weak form of the gyrokinetic field equations suitable for numerical applications.</description>

      <title>Traveling wave antenna model of THz emission from a filament array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple traveling wave antenna model is used to theoretically study emission from an array of filaments. Both transverse and longitudinal arrays of filaments are considered. The angular distribution and power in the THz signal are significantly modified, which is consistent with other trends reported in the literature. The frequency content of the THz emission signal is also strongly modified under certain conditions. Whereas the emission from a single filament is broadband, the emission from a periodic transverse array consists of several discrete frequencies. For this latter case, the THz spectrum can be approximated as the product of two factors - the spectrum from a single filament and a complex frequency-dependent phase factor associated with the spatial distribution of the filaments. The complex phase factor accounts for interference effects, amplifying certain frequencies from the single filament spectrum while suppressing others. The location and width of the discrete frequencies present in the final spectrum depends on the number of filaments and their spacing. frequency content in the THz signal.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Helical-rotating Plasma Structures in Beam-generated Partially Magnetized E $\times$ B Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Azimuthal structures emerging in beam-generated partially magnetized E $\times$ B plasmas are investigated using three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Two distinct instability regimes are identified at low pressures. When the gas pressure is sufficiently high, quasi-neutrality is attained and 2D spiral-arm structures form as a result of the development of a lower-hybrid instability, resulting in enhanced cross-field transport. At lower pressures, quasi-neutrality is not achieved and a 3D helical-rotating plasma structure forms due to development of the diocotron instability. Analytical formulas are proposed for the critical threshold pressure between these regimes and for the rotation frequency of the helical structures.</description>

      <title>Amplifier scheme: driven by direct-drive under 10 MJ laser toward inertial fusion energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The National Ignition Facility successfully achieved target gain 2.4 thus marginally entering into burn stage.Meanwhile, a recent conceptual design on 10 MJ laser driver [Matter Radiat. Extremes 9, 043002 (2024)] provides a new room for exploring novel target designs and interesting phenomena in a burning plasma after ignition. In this paper, we propose an amplifier scheme with extended burn stage, which includes secondary implosion, generates extremely hot and dense fusion fireball, and produces additional gain. The amplifier scheme can be realized either by direct-drive or by indirect-drive. Here, we present a direct-drive amplifier design. The amplifier scheme can be realized at a low convergence ratio, so it can greatly relax the \r{ho} RT hot spot condition and the stringent requirements on engineering issues by a high gain fusion. Especially, the fireball lasts for 30 ps, reaching 330 g/cc, 350 keV, 54 Tbar at center when the secondary explosion happens, which leaves an important room for novel target designs towards clean fusion energy.</description>

      <title>The Extreme Space Weather Event of 1872 February: Sunspots, Magnetic Disturbance, and Auroral Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review observations of solar activity, geomagnetic variation, and auroral visibility for the extreme geomagnetic storm on 1872 February 4. The extreme storm (referred to here as the Chapman-Silverman storm) apparently originated from a complex active region of moderate area (\approx 500 {\mu}sh) that was favorably situated near disk center (S19{\deg} E05{\deg}). There is circumstantial evidence for an eruption from this region at 9--10 UT on 1872 February 3, based on the location, complexity, and evolution of the region, and on reports of prominence activations, which yields a plausible transit time of \approx29 hr to Earth. Magnetograms show that the storm began with a sudden commencement at \approx14:27 UT and allow a minimum Dst estimate of {\pounds} -834 nT. Overhead aurorae were credibly reported at Jacobabad (British India) and Shanghai (China), both at 19{\deg}.9 in magnetic latitude (MLAT) and 24{\deg}. 2 in invariant latitude (ILAT). Auroral visibility was reported from 13 locations with MLAT below |20|{\deg} for the 1872 storm (ranging from |10{\deg}. 0|--|19{\deg}. 9| MLAT) versus one each for the 1859 storm (|17{\deg}. 3| MLAT) and the 1921 storm (|16.{\deg}2| MLAT). The auroral extension and conservative storm intensity indicate a magnetic storm of comparable strength to the extreme storms of 1859 September (25{\deg}.1 \pm 0{\deg}.5 ILAT and -949 \pm 31 nT) and 1921 May (27{\deg}.1 ILAT and -907 \pm 132 nT), which places the 1872 storm among the three largest magnetic storms yet observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of electromotive field appears in various applications in space and astrophysical plasmas. A review is given on the electromotive field highlighting our current understanding of the theoretical picture and the spacecraft observations in interplanetary space. The electromotive field is a key concept to successfully close the set of turbulent magnetohydrodynamic equations and also to construct a more complete picture of space plasma turbulence. Applications to astrophysical cases (Earth magnetosphere, heliospheric shocks, interstellar medium, and relativistic jets) are also briefly introduced, as well.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Energetics of Resistive, Thermally Conductive, and Radiative Plasma in Coronal Current Sheets due to Asymmetric External Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymmetric interaction of wave-like velocity perturbation with a coronal current sheet (CS) in the presence of resistivity, thermal conduction (TC) and radiative cooling (RC). We analyze the dynamics and energetics of CS in four cases, namely, (i) no energy loss, (ii) TC only, (iii) RC only and, (iv) TC+RC. Before fragmentation, thinning and elongation of the CS are found to be identical in all four cases and therefore independent of presence or absence of energy loss effects. Onset times, corresponding Lundquist numbers and aspect ratios suggest that TC advances the onset of fragmentation while RC has the opposite effect in comparison to absence of energy losses. Reconnection takes place at a higher rate in presence of TC and TC+RC in the tearing unstable CS. The speed of plasmoids are also found to be higher under the effect of TC and TC+RC. In presence of TC and TC+RC, average density becomes higher within the tearing unstable CS than in other two cases. As expected, estimated average temperature is increasing with highest and lowest rate in absence of energy losses and in presence of both TC and RC respectively. After the onset of fragmentation, the rate of decrement of average magnetic energy density and increment of average kinetic energy density becomes higher in presence of TC and TC+RC than in other two cases. Thus we conclude that presence of energy loss mechanisms critically influence the dynamics, energetics, and plasmoid formation within a reconnecting coronal CS.</description>

      <title>Depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$ $(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ collisions in the solar photosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of a series of studies investigating collisional depolarization of solar molecular lines like those of MgH, CN and C$_2$. It is focused on the case of the solar molecule C$_2$ which exhibits striking scattering polarization profiles although its intensity profiles are inconspicuous and barely visible. In fact, interpretation of the C$_2$ polarization in terms of magnetic fields is incomplete due to the almost complete lack of collisional data. This work aims at accurately computing the collisional depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$~$(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ by isotropic collisions with hydrogen atoms H~$(^2S_{1/2})$. We also investigate the solar implications of our findings. We utilize the MOLPRO package to obtain potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the electronic states $X ^1\Sigma^+_g$ and $a^3\Pi_u$ of C$_2$, and the MOLSCAT code to study the quantum dynamics of the C$_2$~$(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ systems. We use the tensorial irreducible basis to express the resulting collisional cross-sections and rates. Furthermore, sophisticated genetic programming techniques are employed to determine analytical expressions for the temperature and total molecular angular momentum dependence of these collisional rates. We obtain quantum depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$ $(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ collisions in the temperature range T=2,000--15,000~K. We also determine analytical expressions giving these rates as functions of the temperature and total molecular angular momentum. In addition, we show that isotropic collisions with neutral hydrogen can only partially depolarize the lower state of C$_2$ lines, rather than completely. This highlights the limitations of the approximation of neglecting lower-level polarization while modeling the polarization of C$_2$ lines.</description>

      <title>Quasi-parallel anti-sunward propagating whistler waves associated to the electron-deficit in the near-Sun solar wind: Particle-in-Cell simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-situ observations of the solar wind have shown that the electron velocity distribution function (VDF) consists of a quasi-Maxwellian core, comprising most of the electron population, and two sparser components: the halo, which are suprathermal and quasi-isotropic electrons, and an escaping beam population, the strahl. Recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SO) observations have added one more ingredient to the known non-thermal features, the deficit-a depletion in the sunward region of the VDF, already predicted by exospheric models but never so extensively observed. By employing Particle-in-Cell simulations, we study electron VDFs that reproduce those typically observed in the inner heliosphere and investigate whether the electron deficit may contribute to the onset of kinetic instabilities. Previous studies and in-situ observations show that strahl electrons drive oblique whistler waves unstable, which in turn scatter them. As a result, suprathermal electrons can occupy regions of phase space where they fulfil resonance conditions with the parallel-propagating whistler wave. The suprathermal electrons lose kinetic energy, resulting in the generation of unstable waves. The sunward side of the VDF, initially depleted of electrons, is gradually filled, as this wave-particle interaction process, triggered by the depletion itself, takes place. Our findings are compared and validated against current PSP and SO observations: among others, our study provides a mechanism explaining the presence in the heliosphere of regularly observed parallel anti-sunward whistler waves; suggests why these waves are frequently observed in concomitant with distributions presenting an electron deficit; describes a non-collisional heat flux regulating process.</description>

      <title>Validation of the static forward Grad-Shafranov equilibrium solvers in FreeGSNKE and Fiesta using EFIT++ reconstructions from MAST-U</title>

Abstract: A key aspect in the modelling of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria in tokamak devices is having access to fast, accurate, and stable numerical simulation methods. There is an increasing demand for reliable methods that can be used to develop traditional or machine learning-based shape control feedback systems, optimise scenario designs, and integrate with other plasma edge or transport modelling codes. To handle such applications, these codes need to be flexible and, more importantly, they need to have been validated against both analytically known and real-world tokamak equilibria to ensure they are consistent and credible. In this paper, we are interested in solving the static forward Grad-Shafranov (GS) problem for free-boundary MHD equilibria. Our focus is on the validation of the static forward solver in the Python-based equilibrium code FreeGSNKE by solving equilibria from magnetics-only EFIT++ reconstructions of MAST-U shots. In addition, we also validate FreeGSNKE against equilibria simulated using the well-established MATLAB-based equilibrium code Fiesta. To do this, we develop a computational pipeline that allows one to load the same (a)symmetric MAST-U machine description into each solver, specify the required inputs (active/passive conductor currents, plasma profiles and coefficients, etc.) from EFIT++, and solve the GS equation for all available time slices across a shot. For a number of different MAST-U shots, we demonstrate that both FreeGSNKE and Fiesta can successfully reproduce various poloidal flux quantities and shape targets (e.g. midplane radii, magnetic axes, separatrices, X-points, and strikepoints) in agreement with EFIT++ calculations to a very high degree of accuracy. We also provide public access to the code/data required to load the MAST-U machine description in FreeGSNKE/Fiesta and reproduce the equilibria in the shots shown.</description>

Abstract: The S/XB ratios (ionization per emitted photon) allow one to relate spectroscopic emissivity measurements to the impurity influx from a localized source. In this work, we determine the tungsten influx by examining two dominant EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) line emissions at 382.13 \AA and 394.07 \AA, corresponding to the $4f 14 5f \rightarrow 4f 14 5d$ radiative transitions of the W$^{5+}$ ion. The ground configuration of W$^{5+}$ consists of the ground level and a metastable level, with the latter having a higher population than the ground state. Therefore, a simple approach assuming that the transitions are independent, i.e., only populated by a unique level source, requires correction. To address this, we have developed a fully collisional-radiative modeling in which 430 levels contribute to the ionization. We have utilized three advanced computational codes -- HULLAC (Hebrew University - Lawrence Livermore Atomic Code), AS (AutoStructure), and FAC (Flexible Atomic Code) -- for the atomic structure calculations. These codes provide the necessary information such as wavelengths, collisional and radiative transition rate coefficients. The FAC code was also used to calculate the direct electron-impact ionization under the distorted-wave approximation. We also included contributions to total ionization from excitation-autoionization processes up to $n = 15$ manifolds from the distorted-wave calculations. Subsequently, we used these results to ascertain the tungsten impurity influx in a dedicated discharge of the EAST tokamak, which operates with full tungsten divertors. In our findings, we observed that for the density range relevant to the edge region of a tokamak reactor, the S/XB ratios are almost independent of electron density but exhibit significant variation with electron temperature.</description>
