      <title>On groups with square-free gcd of character degree and codegree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $\chi$ be an irreducible character of $G$. The codegree of $\chi$ is defined as $\chi^c(1) =\frac{|G: \ker\chi|}{\chi(1)}$. In a paper by Gao, Wang, and Chen \cite{GWC24}, it was shown that $G$ cannot satisfy the condition that $\gcd(\chi(1),\chi^c(1))$ is prime for all $\chi\in\Irr(G)^\#$. We generalize this theorem by solving one of Guohua Qian's unsolved problems on character codegrees. In Qian's survey article \cite{Qiancodegree}, he inquires about the structure of non-solvable finite groups with square-free $\gcd$ instead. In particular, we prove that if $G$ is such that $\gcd(\chi(1),\chi^c(1))$ is square-free for every irreducible character $\chi$, then $G/\text{Sol}(G)$ is isomorphic to one among a particular list of almost simple groups.</description>

      <title>Non-orientable regular maps with negative prime-power Euler characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a classification of all regular maps on surfaces of Euler characteristic $-r^d$ for some odd prime $r$ and integer $d\ge 1$. Such maps are necessarily non-orientable, and the cases where $d = 1$ or $2$ have been dealt with previously.
  This classification splits naturally into three parts, based on the nature of the automorphism group $G$ of the map, and particularly the structure of its quotient $G/O(G)$ where $O(G)$ is the largest normal subgroup of $G$ of odd order. In fact $G/O(G)$ is isomorphic to either a $2$-group (in which case $G$ is soluble), or $\textrm{PSL}(2,q)$ or $\textrm{PGL}(2,q)$ where $q$ is an odd prime power. The result is a collection of $18$ non-empty families of regular maps, with conditions on the associated parameters.</description>

      <title>Generic infinite generation, fixed-point-poor representations and compact-element abundance in disconnected Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semidirect product $\mathbb{G}=\mathbb{L}\rtimes \mathbb{K}$ attached to a compact-group action on a connected, simply-connected solvable Lie group has a dense set of compact elements precisely when the $s\in \mathbb{K}$ operating on $\mathbb{L}$ fixed-point-freely constitute a dense set. This (along with a number of alternative equivalent characterizations) extends the Wu's analogous result for connected Lie $\mathbb{K}$, and also provides ample supplies of examples of almost-connected Lie groups $\mathbb{G}$ which do not have dense sets of compact elements, even though their identity components $\mathbb{G}_0$ do. This corrects prior literature on the subject, claiming the property equivalent for $\mathbb{G}$ and $\mathbb{G}_0$.
  In a related discussion we characterize those connected Lie groups $\mathbb{G}$ with large sets of $d$-tuples generating dense subgroups $\Gamma\le \mathbb{G}$ for which the derived subgroup $\Gamma^{(1)}$ fails to be finitely-generated: $\mathbb{G}$ must either be non-trivial topologically perfect or have non-nilpotent maximal solvable quotient.</description>

      <title>On commensurators of free groups and free pro-p groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the commensurators of free groups and free pro-$p$ groups, as well as certain subgroups of these. We prove that the commensurator $Comm(F)$ of a non-abelian free group of finite rank $F$ is not virtually simple, answering a question of Lubotzky. On the other hand, we exhibit a family of easy-to-define finitely generated subgroups of $Comm(F)$ and show that some groups in this family are simple.
  For a prime $p$, we also consider the p-commensurator $Comm_p(F)$, which is the commensurator of $F$ viewed as a group with pro-$p$ topology. By contrast with $Comm(F)$, we prove that $Comm_p(F)$ has a simple subgroup of index at most 2. Further, while the isomorphism class of $Comm(F)$ does not depend on the rank of $F$, we prove that the isomorphism class of $Comm_p(F)$ depends on the rank of $F$ and determine the exact dependency.
  If $\mathbf F$ is the pro-$p$ completion of $F$ (which is a free pro-$p$ group), $Comm(\mathbf F)$ is a totally disconnected locally compact (tdlc) group containing $\mathbf F$ as an open subgroup. We use $Comm_p(F)$ to construct an abstractly simple subgroup of $Comm(\mathbf F)$ containing $\mathbf F$ as well as a family of non-discrete tdlc groups which are compactly generated and simple.</description>

      <title>An explicit algorithm for the Higman Embedding Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm which for any recursive group $G$, given by its effectively enumerable generators and recursively enumerable relations, outputs an explicit embedding of $G$ into a finitely presented group directly written by its generators and defining relations. This is the explicit analogue of the remarkable Higman Embedding Theorem stating that a finitely generated group $G$ is embeddable into a finitely presented group if and only if $G$ is recursive. The constructed finitely presented group can even be chosen to be $2$-generator. This algorithm has already been applied, for example, to the additive group of rational numbers $\mathbb Q$, which is recursive. The question on explicit embedding of $\mathbb Q$ into a finitely presented group was mentioned in the literature by Johnson, De la Harpe, Bridson and others. The suggested method can be used to solve the problem of embeddings for some other recursive groups, also. The embedding algorithm is built using conventional free constructions and their modifications, including free products with amalgamation, HNN-extensions, and certain auxiliary $*$-constructions. We also analyze the steps of original Higman embedding to indicate which of its parts are or are not explicit.</description>

      <title>Twisted products of monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A twisting of a monoid $S$ is a map $\Phi:S\times S\to\mathbb{N}$ satisfying the identity $\Phi(a,b) + \Phi(ab,c) = \Phi(a,bc) + \Phi(b,c)$. Together with an additive commutative monoid $M$, and a fixed $q\in M$, this gives rise a so-called twisted product $M\times_\Phi^qS$, which has underlying set $M\times S$ and multiplication $(i,a)(j,b) = (i+j+\Phi(a,b)q,ab)$. This construction has appeared in the special cases where $M$ is $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition, $S$ is a diagram monoid (e.g.~partition, Brauer or Temperley-Lieb), and $\Phi$ counts floating components in concatenated diagrams.
  In this paper we identify a special kind of `tight' twisting, and give a thorough structural description of the resulting twisted products. This involves characterising Green's relations, (von Neumann) regular elements, idempotents, biordered sets, maximal subgroups, Sch\"{u}tzenberger groups, and more. We also consider a number of examples, including several apparently new ones, which take as their starting point certain generalisations of Sylvester's rank inequality from linear algebra.</description>

Abstract: We compute Schur multipliers of locally isotropic Steinberg groups and of all root graded Steinberg groups with root systems of rank at least $ 3 $ (excluding the types $ \mathsf H_3 $ and $ \mathsf H_4 $). As an application, we show that locally isotropic Steinberg groups are well defined as abstract groups.</description>

      <title>Two-sided homological properties of special and one-relator monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A monoid presentation is called special if the right-hand side of each defining relation is equal to 1. We prove results which relate the two-sided homological finiteness properties of a monoid defined by a special presentation with those of its group of units. Specifically we show that the monoid enjoys the homological finiteness property bi-$\mathrm{FP}_n$ if its group of units is of type $\mathrm{FP}_n$. We also obtain results which relate the Hochschild cohomological dimension of the monoid to the cohomological dimension of its group of units. In particular we show that the Hochschild cohomological dimension of the monoid is bounded above by the maximum of 2 and the cohomological dimension of its group of units. We apply these results to prove a Lyndon's Identity type theorem for the two-sided homology of one-relator monoids of the form $\langle A \mid r=1 \rangle$. In particular, we show that all such monoids are of type bi-$\mathrm{FP}_\infty$. Moreover, we show that if $r$ is not a proper power then the one-relator monoid has Hochschild cohomological dimension at most $2$, while if $r$ is a proper power then it has infinite Hochschild cohomological dimension. For non-special one-relator monoids with defining relation $u=v$ we show that if there is no non-empty word $r$ such that $u,v \in A^*r \cap r A^*$ then $M$ is of type bi-$\mathrm{FP}_\infty$ and the Hochschild cohomological dimension at most $2$.</description>

      <title>On the conjugacy problem for subdirect products of hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $G_1$ and $G_2$ are torsion-free hyperbolic groups and $P&lt;G_1\times G_2$ is a finitely generated subdirect product, then the conjugacy problem in $P$ is solvable if and only if there is a uniform algorithm to decide membership of the cyclic subgroups in the finitely presented group $G_1/(P\cap G_1)$. The proof of this result relies on a new technique for perturbing elements in a hyperbolic group to ensure that they are not proper powers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify an interesting special class of prime ideals in the finitary infinite symmetric group algebra. We show that the set of such ideals carries a semiring structure. Over the complex numbers, we establish a connection with spherical representations of (the Gelfand pair corresponding to) the infinite symmetric group. In positive characteristic, we investigate a close connection with the structure theory of symmetric tensor categories.</description>

      <title>On the Isomorphism Relation for Omnigenous Locally Finite Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of an omnigenous locally finite group was introduced in [2] as a generalization of Hall's universal countable locally finite group. In this paper we show that the class of all countable omnigenous locally finite groups is Borel complete, hence it has the maximum Borel cardinality of isomorphism types among all countable structures.

      <description>arXiv:2507.04474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cremona group of rank n over a field k is the group of birational automorphisms of the n-dimensional projective space over the field k. We study the minimal dimension such that all finite subgroups of the Cremona group have a faithful representation of that dimension over the same field. We find the exact value for rank 1 and 2 over all fields. We prove that the value is infinite for all fields of positive characteristic and rank greater than one. For many fields of characteristic 0, which include number fields and the complex field, we show that the value is finite for all ranks. Finally, for all fields of characteristic 0, we prove that the dimension is bounded below by a function that is exponential in the rank.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variant of Gromov's notion of measure equivalence for groups has been introduced for II$_1$ factors under different names. We propose the terminology of W*-correlated II$_1$ factors. We prove rigidity results up to W*-correlations for tensor products and graph products of II$_1$ factors. As a consequence, we construct the first uncountable family of discrete groups $\Gamma$ that are not von Neumann equivalent, which means that their group von Neumann algebras $L(\Gamma)$ are not W*-correlated, and which implies that these groups are neither measure equivalent, nor have isomorphic or virtually isomorphic group von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>Profinite geometric iterated monodromy groups of postcritically finite polynomials in degree 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the properties of profinite geometric iterated monodromy groups associated to polynomials. Such groups can be seen as generic representations of absolute Galois groups of number fields into the automorphism group of a regular rooted tree. Our main result is that, for a degree 3 postcritically finite polynomial over a number field, where each finite postcritical point has at least one preimage outside the critical orbits, the associated profinite geometric iterated monodromy group is finitely invariably generated. Moreover, this group is determined by the isomorphism class of the ramification portrait of the polynomial, up to conjugation by an automorphism of the ternary rooted tree. We also study the group-theoretical properties of such groups, namely their branch and torsion properties. In particular, we show that such groups are regular branch over the closure of their commutator subgroup, and that they contain torsion elements of any order realizable in the ternary tree.</description>

Abstract: The paper investigates two invariants for totally disconnected locally compact groups: the number of ends and the rational discrete cohomological dimension. For such a compactly generated group $G$ it is shown that its number of ends can be expressed in terms of the rational discrete cohomology of $G$. If $G$ is suitably acting on a building the number of ends and the rational cohomological dimension of $G$ are related to those of the Weyl group associated to the building. In special cases, we are also able to compare the rational discrete cohomological dimension of $G$ to the flat-rank of $G$. Moreover, examples of groups for which these two invariants coincide are given. Our approach leverages the combinatorics of Coxeter groups, yielding new results of independent interest in Coxeter theory. Finally, in the class of totally disconnected locally compact groups acting properly and cocompactly on locally finite buildings, an accessibility result is proved: we explicitly construct a cocompact proper action on a tree if the rational discrete cohomological dimension is one.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of solvable cube-free groups and counting certain types of split extensions</title>

Abstract: A group is said to be cube-free if its order is not divisible by the cube of any prime. Let $f_{cf,sol}(n)$ denote the isomorphism classes of solvable cube-free groups of order $n$. We find asymptotic bounds for $f_{cf,sol}(n)$ in this paper. Let $p$ be a prime and let $q = p^k$ for some positive integer $k$. We also give a formula for the number of conjugacy classes of the subgroups that are maximal amongst non-abelian solvable cube-free $p'$-subgroups of ${\rm GL}(2,q)$. Further, we find the exact number of split extensions of $P$ by $Q$ up to isomorphism of a given order where $P \in \{{\mathbb Z}_p \times {\mathbb Z}_p, {\mathbb Z}_{p^{\alpha}}\}$, $p$ is a prime, $\alpha$ is a positive integer and $Q$ is a cube-free abelian group of odd order such that $p \nmid |Q|$.</description>

      <title>Recognition by the set of exponents in the prime factorization of the product of element orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group. Let $\rho(G) = \prod_{g \in G} o(g)={p_1}^{\alpha_1} {p_2}^{\alpha_2} \cdots {p_k}^{\alpha_k}$, where $p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_k$ are distinct prime numbers and $o(g)$ denotes the order of $g \in G$. The set of exponents in the prime factorization of the product of element orders is denoted by $ {\operatorname{Exp}}_{\rho}(G)$, i.e., $ {\operatorname{Exp}}_{\rho}(G)=\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2, \cdots,\alpha_k\}$. In this paper, we give a new characterization for some groups by $ {\operatorname{Exp}}_{\rho}(G)$. We prove that the groups ${\rm PSL}(2, 5) \times \mathbb{Z}_p$, ${\rm PSL}(2, 7)$ and ${\rm PSL}(2, 11)$ are uniquely determined by $ {\operatorname{Exp}}_{\rho}(G)$. Furthermore, we prove that the groups ${\rm PSL}(2, 5)$ and ${\rm PSL}(2, 13)$ are uniquely determined by the parameters $ {\operatorname{Exp}}_{\rho}(G)$ and $|G|$. Additionally, we prove that if ${\operatorname{Exp}}_{\rho}(G) = {\operatorname{Exp}}_{\rho}(\mathbb{Z}_{2qr})$, then $G \cong {\rm PSL}(2, 5)$ or $G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{2qr}$, where $q$ and $r$ are distinct odd prime numbers.</description>

      <title>The affine group of a local field is Hermitian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The question of whether the group $\mathbb{Q}_p \rtimes \mathbb{Q}_p^*$ is Hermitian has been stated as an open question in multiple sources in the literature, even as recently as a paper by R. Palma published in 2015. In this note we confirm that this group is Hermitian by proving the following more general theorem: given any local field $\mathbb{K}$, the affine group $\mathbb{K} \rtimes \mathbb{K}^*$ is a Hermitian group. The proof is a consequence of results about Hermitian Banach $*$-algebras from the 1970's. In the case that $\mathbb{K}$ is a non-archimedean local field, this result produces examples of totally disconnected locally compact Hermitian groups with exponential growth, and these are the first examples of groups satisfying these properties. This answers a second question of Palma about the existence of such groups.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric inequalities in Hadamard spaces of asymptotic rank two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gromov's isoperimetric gap conjecture for Hadamard spaces states that cycles in dimensions greater than or equal to the asymptotic rank admit linear isoperimetric filling inequalities, as opposed to the inequalities of Euclidean type in lower dimensions. In the case of asymptotic rank 2, recent progress was made by Dru\c{t}u-Lang-Papasoglu-Stadler who established a homotopical inequality for Lipschitz 2-spheres with exponents arbitrarily close to 1. We prove a homological inequality of the same type for general cycles in dimensions at least 2, assuming that the ambient space has finite linearly controlled asymptotic dimension. This holds in particular for all Hadamard 3-manifolds and finite-dimensional CAT(0) cube complexes.</description>
