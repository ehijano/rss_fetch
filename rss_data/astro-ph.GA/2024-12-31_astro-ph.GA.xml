      <title>A new constraint on galaxy-halo connections of [O II] emitters via HOD modelling with angular clustering and luminosity functions from the Subaru HSC survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing a robust connection model between emission-line galaxies (ELGs) and their host dark haloes is of paramount importance in anticipation of upcoming redshift surveys. In this paper, we propose a novel halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework that incorporates galaxy luminosity, a key observable reflecting ELG star-formation activity, into the galaxy occupation model. This innovation enables prediction of galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) and facilitates joint analyses using both angular correlation functions (ACFs) and LFs. Using physical information from luminosity, our model provides more robust constraints on the ELG-halo connection compared to methods relying solely on ACF and number density constraints. Our model was applied to [O II]-emitting galaxies observed at two redshift slices at $z=1.193$ and $1.471$ from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam PDR2. Our model effectively reproduces observed ACFs and LFs observed in both redshift slices. Compared to the established \citeauthor{geach12} HOD model, our approach offers a more nuanced depiction of ELG occupation across halo mass ranges, suggesting a more realistic representation of ELG environments. Our findings suggest that ELGs at $z\sim1.4$ may evolve into Milky-Way-like galaxies, highlighting their role as potential building blocks in galaxy formation scenarios. By incorporating the LF as a constraint linking galaxy luminosity to halo properties, our HOD model provides a more precise understanding of ELG-host halo relationships. Furthermore, this approach facilitates the generation of high-quality ELG mock catalogues of for future surveys. As the LF is a fundamental observable, our framework is potentially applicable to diverse galaxy populations, offering a versatile tool for analysing data from next-generation galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Pattern Finding in mm-Wave Spectra of Massive Young Stellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars play a pivotal role in shaping their galactic surroundings due to their high luminosity and intense ionizing radiation. However, the precise mechanisms governing the formation of massive stars remain elusive. Complex organic molecules (COMs) offer an avenue for studying star formation across the low- to high-mass spectrum because COMs are found in every young stellar object phase and offer insight into the structure and temperature. We aim to unveil evolutionary patterns of COM chemistry in 41 massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) sourced from diverse catalogues, using ALMA Band 6 spectra. Previous line analysis of these sources showed the presence of CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CN, and CH$_3$CCH with diverse excitation temperatures and column densities, indicating a possible evolutionary path across sources. However, this analysis usually involves manual line extraction and rotational diagram fitting. Here, we improve upon this process by directly retrieving the physicochemical state of MYSOs from their dimensionally-reduced spectra. We use a Locally Linear Embedding to find a lower-dimensional projection for the physicochemical parameters obtained from individual line analysis. We identify clusters of similar MYSOs in this embedded space using a Gaussian Mixture Model. We find three groups of MYSOs with distinct physicochemical conditions: i) cold, COM-poor sources, ii) warm, medium-COM-abundance sources, and iii) hot, COM-rich sources. We then apply principal component analysis (PCA) to the spectral sample, finding further evidence for an evolutionary path across MYSO groups. Finally, we find that the physicochemical state of our sample can be derived directly from the spectra by training a simple random forest model on the first few PCA components. Our results highlight the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction in obtaining clear physical insights directly from MYSO spectra.</description>

      <title>Counting the Unseen II: Tidal Disruption Event Rates in Nearby Galaxies with REPTiDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are a class of transients that occur when a star is destroyed by the tides of a massive black hole (MBH). Their rates encode valuable MBH demographic information, but this can only be extracted if accurate TDE rate predictions are available for comparisons with observed rates. In this work, we present a new, observer-friendly Python package called REPTiDE, which implements a standard loss cone model for computing TDE rates given a stellar density distribution and an MBH mass. We apply this software to a representative sample of 91 nearby galaxies over a wide range of stellar masses with high-resolution nuclear density measurements from arXiv:2407.10911. We measure per-galaxy TDE rates ranging between 10$^{-7.7}$ and 10$^{-2.9}$ per year and find that the sample-averaged rates agree well with observations. We find a turnover in the TDE rate as a function of both galaxy stellar mass and black hole mass, with the peak rates being observed in galaxies at a galaxy mass of $10^{9.5}$ M$_\odot$ and a black hole mass of $10^{6.5}$ M$_\odot$. Despite the lower TDE rates inferred for intermediate-mass black holes, we find that they have gained a higher fraction of their mass through TDEs when compared to higher mass black holes. This growth of lower mass black holes through TDEs can enable us to place interesting constraints on their spins; we find maximum spins of $a_\bullet \approx 0.9$ for black holes with masses below $\sim10^{5.5}$ M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Demographics of black holes at $&lt;$100 R$_{\rm g}$ scales: accretion flows, jets, and shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), the gravitationally lensed rings around the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in Messier 87 (M87) and Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) have now been successfully imaged at a resolution under 10 gravitational radii (R$_{\rm g}$ $ = \rm{GM/c^2}$). To expand studies beyond M87 and Sgr A*, we have constructed the Event Horizon and Environs (ETHER) sample, a comprehensive database encompassing approximately 3.15 million SMBH mass estimates, $\sim$ 20,000 Very-Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) radio flux densities, and $\sim$ 36,000 hard X-ray flux densities. This database is designed to identify and optimize target selection for the EHT and its upgrades on the ground and in space. We have identified a Gold Sample (GS) of nearby low-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) within it that are ideal for studying jet bases and potentially imaging black hole shadows. We observed 27 of these AGNs using the EHT from 2022 to 2024, providing an opportunity to resolve and image accretion flows and jets at resolutions of $\leq$ 100 R$_{\rm g}$. Only a few SMBHs have sufficiently high enough flux density to be imaged at scales of $\leq$ 50 R$_{\rm g}$ with the present EHT. Among these are M87, Sgr A*, NGC4594 (Sombrero/M104), NGC4261, and NGC4374 (Messier 84/M84). Of these, NGC4261, Sombrero, and M84 have been observed and/or are scheduled for deep imaging with EHT+ALMA from 2023 to 2025. Sombrero, NGC4261, M84, NGC4278, and NGC5232 are clearly detected in our EHT+ALMA observations in 2022, indicating that the 230 GHz flux density from the accretion flows is significantly high. Ongoing imaging of the ETHER GS will enable measurements of black hole mass and spin, help constrain General Relativity, and enrich our understanding of jet launching and accretion inflows across a broad multi-parameter space, including black hole mass, spin, accretion rate, and orientation.</description>

      <title>A Slowly Flattening Milky Way Stellar Disk: Investigating Galactic Warping through Dynamical Orbital Inclinations of Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By evaluating angular momentum directions of open cluster (OC) samples across various Galactocentric radii, we assessed their orbital plane inclinations. Our findings reveal that, without considering the local tilt of the Galactic disk near the sun, our results are consistent with previous studies on Classical Cepheids (CCs). Notably, the warp precession derived from OCs closely mirror those of CCs. Nonetheless, we observed a systematic deviation between the geometric and dynamic warps, attributable to the tilt of the local disk. We identified a systematic vertical motion in the local region, associated with the warping feature near the solar vicinity. Ignoring this motion leads to underestimates of orbital plane inclinations compared to those derived from geometric positions. Our study indicates consistency between the inclinations derived from orbital dynamics and geometric positions at a vertical velocity of the sun relative to the Galactic mid-plane of Vz_sun = 9.4(0.2) km/s. This value is approximately 2 km/s higher than the historically estimated solar peculiar motion, W_sun, primarily due to an approximately 0.6-degree tilt of the local plane. Analysis suggests that previous estimates of the Galactic disk's warping precession rate may have been overestimated due to local warping influences. The findings indicate that the precession oscillates around zero and that the Galactic warp is progressively flattening. Additionally, the line of nodes tends to become consistent across various Galactocentric radii over a timescale of 100-200 million years.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the hidden physical structures and protostellar activities in the Low-Metallicity S284-RE region: results from ALMA and JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an observational study of the S284-RE region, a low-metallicity area associated with the extended S284 HII region. A thermally supercritical filament (mass $\sim$2402 $M_{\odot}$, length $\sim$8.5 pc) is investigated using the Herschel column density map. The Spitzer ratio 4.5 $\mu$m/3.6 $\mu$m map traces the H$_{2}$ outflows in this filament, where previously reported young stellar objects (YSOs) are spatially distributed. Analysis of the YSO distribution has revealed three active star-forming clusters (YCl1, YCl2, YCl3) within the filament. YCl3 seems to be the most evolved, YCl2 the youngest, while YCl1 displays signs of non-thermal fragmentation. The JWST (F470N+F444W)/F356W ratio map reveals at least seven bipolar H$_{2}$ outflows, with four (olc1--olc4) in YCl1 and three (ol1--ol3) in YCl2. The driving sources of these outflows are identified based on outflow geometry, ALMA continuum peaks, and YSO positions. Two ALMA continuum sources, #2 and #3, from the $M$-$R_{\rm eff}$ plot are recognized as potential massive star formation candidates. The ALMA continuum source #2 hosts at least three outflow-driving sources, whereas the ALMA continuum source #3 contains two. The bipolar outflow olc1, driven by an embedded object within the continuum source #2, is likely a massive protostar, as indicated by Br-$\alpha$ and PAH emissions depicted in the JWST (F405N+F444W)/F356W ratio map. The presence of H$_{2}$ knots in the outflows olc1 and ol1 suggests episodic accretion. Overall, the study investigates a massive protostar candidate, driving the $\sim$2.7 pc H$_{2}$ outflow olc1 and undergoing episodic accretion.</description>

      <title>Evolution of massive black hole in galactic nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scenario for mass evolution of massive black holes (MBH) in galactic nuclei, to explain both the mass correlation of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) with the bulge and the down-sizing behavior of the active galactic nuclei. Primordial gas structures to evolve galactic bulges are supposed to be formed at $z \sim$ 10 and the core region, called the nuclear region (NR) here, is considered to be a place for a MBH to grow to the SMBH. The down-sizing behavior requires the MBH to significantly increase the mass in a time $\sim$ 1 Gyr. The rapid mass increase is discussed to be realized only when the MBH stays in a very high density region such as a core of a molecular cloud throughout the period $\sim$ 1 Gyr. According to these arguments, the MBHs formed from the population III stars born in the mini halos at $z \sim$ 20 - 30 are excluded from the candidates for the seed black hole to the SMBH and only the MBHs from the population II stars born in the core of the central molecular cloud (CMC) in the NR remain as them. The MBHs in the dense core of the CMC started increasing the mass through mass-accretion and the most massive black hole (MMBH) got the most rapid evolution, possibly restraining relatively slow evolutions of the less massive black holes. Dynamical interactions of the MMBH with the ambient MCs induced the wandering motion and the further mass-increase. However, when the MMBH mass exceeded a boundary mass, the dynamical friction with the field stars brakes the MMBH wandering and the mass accretion. This scenario can semi-quantitatively reproduce both the down-sizing behavior and the SMBH mass - bulge mass correlation with reasonable parameter values.</description>

      <title>The Pristine survey. XXVI. Chemical abundances of subgiant stars of the extremelymetal-poor stream C-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The C-19 stellar stream is the most metal-poor stream known to date. While its width and velocity dispersion indicate a dwarf galaxy origin, its metallicity spread and abundance patterns are more similar to those of globular clusters (GCs). If it is indeed of GC origin, its extremely low metallicity ([Fe/H]=-3.4, estimated from giant stars) implies that these stellar systems can form out of gas that is as extremely poor in metals as this. Previously, only giant stream stars were observed spectroscopically, although the majority of stream stars are unevolved stars. Aims: We pushed the spectroscopic observations to the subgiant branch stars ($G\approx 20$) in order to consolidate the chemical and dynamical properties of C-19. Methods: We used the high-efficiency spectrograph X-shooter fed by the ESO 8.2 m VLT telescope to observe 15 candidate subgiant C-19 members. The spectra were used to measure radial velocities and to determine chemical abundances using the \mygi\ code. Results; We developed a likelihood model that takes metallicity and radial velocities into account. We conclude that 12 stars are likely members of C-19, while 3 stars (S05, S12, and S13) are likely contaminants. When these 3 stars are excluded, our model implies a mean metallicity $\rm \langle [Fe/H]\rangle = -3.1\pm 0.1$, the mean radial velocity is $\langle v_r\rangle = -192\pm3$ kms$^{-1}$, and the velocity dispersion is $\sigma_{vr} = 5.9^{+3.6}_{-5.9}$ kms$^{-1}$. This all agrees within errors with previous studies. The A(Mg) of a sample of 15 C-19 members, including 6 giant stars, shows a standard deviation of 0.44 dex, and the mean uncertainty on Mg is 0.25 dex. Conclusions: Our preferred interpretation of the current data is that C-19 is a disrupted GC. We cannot completely rule out the possibility that the GC could have belonged to a dwarf galaxy that contained more metal-rich stars, however. This scenario would explain the radial velocity members at higher metallicity, as well as the width and velocity dispersion of the stream. In either case, a GC formed out of gas as poor in metals as these stars seems necessary to explain the existence of C-19. The possibility that no GC was associated with C-19 cannot be ruled out either.</description>

      <title>Submillimeter-wave spectroscopy of the CH$_3$O radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The methoxy radical, CH$_3$O, has long been studied experimentally and theoretically by spectroscopists because it displays a weak Jahn-Teller effect in its electronic ground state, combined with a strong spin-orbit interaction. In this work, we report an extension of the measurement of the pure rotational spectrum of the radical in its vibrational ground state in the submillimeter-wave region (350$-$860 GHz). CH$_3$O was produced by H-abstraction from methanol using F-atoms, and its spectrum was probed in absorption using an association of source-frequency modulation and Zeeman modulation spectroscopy. All the observed transitions together with available literature data in $v = 0$ were combined and fit using an effective Hamiltonian allowing to reproduce the data at their experimental accuracy. The newly measured transitions involve significantly higher frequencies and rotational quantum numbers than those reported in the literature ($f &lt; 860$ GHz and $N \leq 15$ instead of 272 GHz and 7, respectively) which results in significant improvements in the spectroscopic parameters determination. The present model is well constrained and allows a reliable calculation of the rotational spectrum of the radical over the entire microwave to submillimeter-wave domain. It can be used with confidence for future searches of CH$_3$O in the laboratory and the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Spectra Networks (GaSNet). III. Generative pre-trained network for spectrum reconstruction, redshift estimate and anomaly detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classification of spectra (1) and anomaly detection (2) are fundamental steps to guarantee the highest accuracy in redshift measurements (3) in modern all-sky spectroscopic surveys. We introduce a new Galaxy Spectra Neural Network (GaSNet-III) model that takes advantage of generative neural networks to perform these three tasks at once with very high efficiency. We use two different generative networks, an autoencoder-like network and U-Net, to reconstruct the rest-frame spectrum (after redshifting). The autoencoder-like network operates similarly to the classical PCA, learning templates (eigenspectra) from the training set and returning modeling parameters. The U-Net, in contrast, functions as an end-to-end model and shows an advantage in noise reduction. By reconstructing spectra, we can achieve classification, redshift estimation, and anomaly detection in the same framework. Each rest-frame reconstructed spectrum is extended to the UV and a small part of the infrared (covering the blueshift of stars). Owing to the high computational efficiency of deep learning, we scan the chi-squared value for the entire type and redshift space and find the best-fitting point. Our results show that generative networks can achieve accuracy comparable to the classical PCA methods in spectral modeling with higher efficiency, especially achieving an average of $&gt;98\%$ classification across all classes ($&gt;99.9\%$ for star), and $&gt;99\%$ (stars), $&gt;98\%$ (galaxies) and $&gt;93\%$ (quasars) redshift accuracy under cosmology research requirements. By comparing different peaks of chi-squared curves, we define the ``robustness'' in the scanned space, offering a method to identify potential ``anomalous'' spectra. Our approach provides an accurate and high-efficiency spectrum modeling tool for handling the vast data volumes from future spectroscopic sky surveys.</description>

      <title>Multi-Epoch precise photometry from the ground: MUDEHaR, magnetic stars and everything around</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MUDEHaR is an on-going multi-epoch photometric survey with two narrow filters in H$\alpha$ and the calcium triplet window that uses the T80Cam wide-field imager at the JAST/T80 telescope at Spanish Javalambre astronomical observatory. It is obtaining 100 epochs/year per field for 20 fields in the Galactic disk, each of 2\,deg$^2$, for a total of 40\,deg$^2$. Focused on stellar clusters and HII regions including bright stars, its main objective is to detect tens of thousands OB stars that present emission variability in H$\alpha$ on days-months-years scale. The observed targets include magnetic massive stars, pulsating stars, and all kinds of variable stars. Among our driving scientific objectives of MUDEHaR observations is to identify potential magnetic candidates in massive stars. Only 10--20\,\% of OB stars display a measurable magnetic field, and its origin is still in debate. We outline here the multi-step process involved in identifying OB magnetic stars, highlighting the significance of MUDEHaR observations in this process.</description>

      <title>Refining lower bounds on sterile neutrino dark matter mass from estimates of phase space densities in dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are recognized as being highly dominated by Dark Matter (DM), making them excellent targets for testing DM models through astrophysical observations. One effective method involves estimating the coarse-grained phase-space density (PSD) of the galactic DM component. By comparing this PSD with that of DM particles produced in the early Universe, it is possible to establish lower bounds on the DM particle mass. These constraints are particularly relevant for models of warm DM, such as those involving sterile neutrinos. Utilizing the GravSphere code, we obtain a fit of the DM PSD based on the latest reliable stellar dynamics data for twenty of the darkest dSphs, refining earlier lower bounds on sterile neutrino masses in non-resonant production scenarios. Additionally, we introduce an alternative approach involving the Excess Mass Function (EMF), which yields even tighter constraints. Specifically, using the maximum PSD, we derive a lower bound of $m&gt;1.02$ keV at 95% confidence level, while the EMF method provides a stronger limit of $m&gt;1.98$ keV at 95% CL. Both methods are versatile and can be extended to more complex DM production mechanisms in the early Universe. For the first time, we also constrain parameters of models involving non-standard cosmologies during the epoch of neutrino production. Our analysis yields $m&gt;2.54$ keV for models with kination domination and $m&gt;4.71$ keV for scenarios with extremely low reheating temperature.</description>

Abstract: We consider fairly general class of dynamical systems under the assumptions guaranteeing the existence of Lyapunov function around some nontrivial stationary point. Moreover, the existence of heteroclinic trajectory is proved motivated by integrated densities approach to some astrophysical models of self-gravitating particles both in relativistic and non--relativistic frameworks. Finally, with the aid of geometric and topological reasoning we find the upper bounds for this trajectory yielding the critical mass--radius theorem for the astrophysical model.</description>

      <title>Rotational excitation cross sections for chloronium based on a new 5D interaction potential with molecular hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chloronium (H$_2$Cl$^+$) is an important intermediate of Cl-chemistry in space. The accurate knowledge of its collisional properties allows a better interpretation of the corresponding observations in interstellar clouds and therefore a better estimation of its abundance in these environments. While the ro-vibrational spectroscopy of H$_2$Cl$^+$ is well known, the studies of its collisional excitation are rather limited and these are available for the interaction with helium atoms only. We provide a new 5-dimensional rigid-rotor potential energy surface for the interaction of H$_2$Cl$^+$ with H$_2$, calculated from explicitly correlated coupled cluster ab initio theory, which was fitted then with a set of analytical functions, allowing to perform scattering calculations using accurate quantum theories. We analyze the collision-energy-dependence of the rotational state-to-state cross sections and the temperature dependence of the corresponding thermal rate coefficients, with a particular attention on the collisional propensity rules. When comparing our results for collisions with H$_2$ with those obtained with He as a colliding partner, we found very significant differences with non-linear scaling trends, which proves again that He is not a suitable proxy for collisions between hydride molecules and molecular hydrogen, the most abundant gas particle in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Resolving Pleiades binary stars with Gaia and speckle interferometric observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pleiades is the most prominent open star cluster visible from Earth and an important benchmark for simple stellar populations, unified by common origin, age, and distance. Binary stars are its essential ingredient, yet their contribution remains uncertain due to heavy observational biases. A resolved multiplicity survey was conducted for a magnitude-limited G &lt; 15mag sample of 423 potential cluster members, including sources with poorly fitted astrometric solutions in Gaia DR3. Speckle interferometric observations at the 2.5 meter telescope of SAI MSU observatory were combined with Gaia data, enabling the identification of 61 resolved binary or multiple systems within the 0.04 - 10 arcsec (5 - 1350 au) separation range. With speckle observations, we discovered 21 components in 20 systems. The existence of a Merope (23 Tau) companion is confirmed after several previous unsuccessful attempts. We show that the Gaia multipeak fraction is a strong predictor of subarcsecond multiplicity, as all sources with ipd_frac_multi_peak &gt; 4% are successfully resolved. We found that 10% of Pleiades stars have a companion with a mass ratio q &gt; 0.5 within projected separation of 27 &lt; s &lt; 1350 au, and confirm a deficit of wide binaries with s &gt; 300 au. An observed dearth of wide pairs with large mass ratio (q &gt; 0.55) may imprint the transition from hard to soft binaries regime at the early stages of cluster evolution. The total binary fraction for q &gt; 0.5 systems is extrapolated to be around 25%.</description>

      <title>Novel SiC UV Instrumentation Development with Potential Applications for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we detail recent and current work that is being carried out to fabricate and advance novel SiC UV instrumentation that is aimed at enabling more sensitive measurements across numerous disciplines, with a short discussion of the promise such detectors may hold for the Habitable Worlds Observatory. We discuss SiC instrument development progress that is being carried out under multiple NASA grants, including several PICASSO and SBIR grants, as well as an ECI grant. Testing of pixel design, properties and layout as well as maturation of the integration scheme developed through these efforts provide key technology and engineering advancement for potential HWO detectors. Achieving desired noise characteristics, responsivity, and validating operation of SiC detectors using standard read out techniques offers a compelling platform for operation of denser and higher dimensionality SiC photodiode arrays of interest for use in potential HWO Coronagraph, Spectrograph, and High Resolution Imaging Instruments. We incorporate these SiC detector properties into a simulation of potential NUV exoplanet observations by HWO using SiC detectors and also discuss potential application to HWO.</description>

      <title>PRIMER: JWST/MIRI reveals the evolution of star-forming structures in galaxies at z&lt;2.5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stellar structures of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) undergo significant size growth during their mass assembly and must pass through a compaction phase as they evolve into quiescent galaxies (QGs). To shed light on the mechanisms behind this structural evolution, we study the morphology of the star-forming components of 665 SFGs at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5 measured using JWST/MIRI observation and compare them with the morphology of their stellar components taken from the literature. The stellar and star-forming components of most SFGs (66%) have extended disk-like structures that are aligned with each other and are of the same size. The star-forming components of these galaxies follow a mass-size relation, similar to that followed by their stellar components. At the highest mass, the optical S\'ersic index of these SFGs increases to 2.5, suggesting the presence of a dominant stellar bulge. Because their star-forming components remain disk-like, these bulges cannot have formed by secular in-situ growth. We identify a second population of galaxies lying below the MIR mass-size relation, with compact star-forming components embedded in extended stellar components (EC galaxy). These galaxies are overall rare (15%) but become more dominant (30%) at high mass ($&gt;10^{10.5}M_\odot$). The compact star-forming components of these galaxies are also concentrated and slightly spheroidal, suggesting that this compaction phase can build dense bulge in-situ. Finally, we identify a third population of SFGs (19%), with both compact stellar and star-forming components. The density of their stellar cores resemble those of QGs and are compatible with being the descendants of EC galaxy. Overall, the structural evolution of SFGs is mainly dominated by a secular inside-out growth, which can, however, be interrupted by violent compaction phase(s) that can build dominant stellar bulges like those in massive SFGs or QGs.</description>

      <title>The Multiple Extended Tidal Tails of NGC 288</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using photometry and proper motions from Pan-STARRS, DECaLS, and Gaia DR3, we detect a ~35 to 70 degree-long trailing stellar debris stream associated with the globular cluster NGC 288. The trajectory of the trailing tail is not well matched by a model stream evolved in a static Galactic potential, but is reasonably well-matched by a stream modeled in a potential that incorporates a massive, infalling Large Magellanic Cloud. We also detect a broad, at least ~40 degree-long leading tail that appears to be composed of at least two narrower, spatially offset, and kinematically distinct streams. Stream modeling predicts a similar broad composite of streams and suggests that these narrower components could each be made up of one or more generations of tidal tails, each formed during different orbits over the past few gigayears. On the other hand, NGC 288 is believed to have been brought into the Galactic halo during the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage accretion event, and the tangential velocity dispersions of our stream candidates are indeed most consistent with having been stripped in a parent galaxy that had a large, cored dark matter halo. Tables of the most highly ranked stream star candidates are provided for ongoing and future spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>The GD-1 stellar stream perturber as a core-collapsed self-interacting dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The GD-1 stellar stream exhibits spur and gap structures that may result from a close encounter with a dense substructure. When interpreted as a dark matter subhalo, the perturber is denser than predicted in the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. In self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), however, a halo could evolve into a phase of gravothermal collapse, resulting in a higher central density than its CDM counterpart. We conduct high-resolution controlled N-body simulations to show that a collapsed SIDM halo could account for the GD-1 perturber's high density. We model a progenitor halo with a mass of $3\times10^8~M_\odot$, motivated by a cosmological simulation of a Milky Way analog, and evolve it in the Milky Way's tidal field. For a cross section per mass of $\sigma/m\approx30-100~{\rm cm^2~g^{-1}}$ at $V_{\rm max }\sim10~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$, the enclosed mass of the SIDM halo within the inner $10~{\rm pc}$ can be increased by more than an order of magnitude compared to its CDM counterpart, leading to a good agreement with the properties of the GD-1 perturber. Our findings indicate that stellar streams provide a novel probe into the self-interacting nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>ALMA-IMF XVIII: The assembly of a star cluster: Dense N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) kinematics in the massive G351.77 protocluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ALMA-IMF observed 15 massive protoclusters capturing multiple spectral lines and the continuum emission. We focus on the G351.77 protocluster ($\sim$ 2500 M$_{\odot}$, estimated from single-dish continuum observations) located at 2 kpc. We trace the dense gas emission and kinematics with N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) at $\sim$ 4 kau resolution. We estimate an N$_2$H$^+$ relative abundance $\sim (1.7 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{-10}$. We decompose the N$_2$H$^+$ emission into up to two velocity components, highlighting the kinematic complexity in the dense gas. By examining the position-velocity (PV) diagrams on small scales, we observe clear inflow signatures (V-shapes) associated with dense cores. The most prominent V-shape has a mass inflow rate of $\sim 9.8 \times 10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a short timescale of $\sim$ 15.6 kyr. We also observe V-shapes without associated cores. This suggests both that cores or centers of accretion exist below the 1.3 mm detection limit, and that the V-shapes may be viable tracers of very early accretion and star formation on $\sim$ 4 kau scales. The large-scale PV diagram shows that the protocluster is separated into 2 principal velocity structures. Combined with smaller scale DCN and H$_2$CO emission, we propose a scenario of larger scale slow contraction with rotation in the center based on simple toy models. This scenario leads the suggestion of outside-in evolution of the protocluster as it collapses. The gas depletion times implied by the V-shapes are short ($\sim$ 0.3 Myr), requiring either very fast cluster formation, and/or continuous mass feeding of the protocluster. The latter is possible via the Mother Filament G351.77 is forming out of. The similarities in the properties of G351.77 and the recently published work in G353.41 indicate that many of the physical conditions inferred via the ALMA-IMF N$_2$H$^+$ observations may be generic to protoclusters.</description>

      <title>AEOS: Star-by-Star Cosmological Simulations of Early Chemical Enrichment and Galaxy Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The AEOS project introduces a series of high-resolution cosmological simulations that model star-by-star chemical enrichment and galaxy formation in the early Universe, achieving 1 pc resolution. These simulations capture the complexities of galaxy evolution within the first ~300 Myr by modeling individual stars and their feedback processes. By incorporating chemical yields from individual stars, AEOS generates galaxies with diverse stellar chemical abundances, linking them to hierarchical galaxy formation and early nucleosynthetic events. These simulations underscore the importance of chemical abundance patterns in ancient stars as vital probes of early nucleosynthesis, star formation histories, and galaxy formation. We examine the metallicity floors of various elements resulting from Pop III enrichment, providing best-fit values for eight different metals (e.g., [O/H] = -4.0) to guide simulations without Pop III models. Additionally, we identify galaxies that begin star formation with Pop II after external enrichment and investigate the frequency of CEMP stars at varying metallicities. The AEOS simulations offer detailed insights into the relationship between star formation, feedback, and chemical enrichment. Future work will extend these simulations to later epochs to interpret the diverse stellar populations of the Milky Way and its satellites.</description>

      <title>The 3D morphology of open clusters in the solar neighborhood III: Fractal dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the fractal dimension of open clusters using 3D spatial data from Gaia DR3 for 93 open clusters from Pang et al. (2024) and 127 open clusters from Hunt &amp; Reffert (2024) within 500 pc. The box-counting method is adopted to calculate the fractal dimension of each cluster in three regions: the all-member region, $r \leq r_t$ (inside the tidal radius), and $r &gt; r_t$ (outside the tidal radius). In both the Pang and Hunt catalogs, the fractal dimensions are smaller for the regions $r &gt; r_t$ than those for $r \leq r_t$, indicating that the stellar distribution is more clumpy in the cluster outskirts. We classify cluster morphology based on the fractal dimension via the Gaussian Mixture Model. Our study shows that the fractal dimension can efficiently classify clusters in the Pang catalog into two groups. The fractal dimension of the clusters in the Pang catalog declines with age, which is attributed to the development of tidal tails. This is consistent with the expectations from the dynamical evolution of open clusters. We find strong evidence that the fractal dimension increases with cluster mass, which implies that higher-mass clusters are formed hierarchically from the mergers of lower-mass filamentary-type stellar groups. The transition of the fractal dimension for the spatial distribution of open clusters provides a useful tool to trace the Galactic star forming structures, from the location of the Local Bubble within the solar neighborhood to the spiral arms across the Galaxy.</description>

Abstract: Aims. We analyze whether the effects of secular perturbations, originating from a substellar companion, on the dust dynamics in a debris disk can be investigated with spatially resolved observations.
  Methods. We numerically simulated the collisional evolution of narrow and eccentric cold planetesimal belts around a star of spectral type A3V that are secularly perturbed by a companion that orbits either closer to or farther from the star than the belt. Based on the resulting spatial dust distributions, we simulated spatially resolved maps of their surface brightness in the $K$, $N$, and $Q$ bands and at wavelengths of 70$\mu$m and 1300$\mu$m.
  Results. Assuming a nearby debris disk seen face-on, we find that the brightness distribution varies significantly with observing wavelength, for example between the $N$ and $Q$ band. This can be explained by the varying relative contribution of the emission of the smallest grains near the blowout limit. The orbits of both the small grains that form the halo and the large grains close to the parent belt precess due to the secular perturbations induced by a companion orbiting inward of the belt. The halo, being composed of older grains, trails the belt. The magnitude of the trailing decreases with increasing perturber mass and hence with increasing strength of the perturbation, a trend we recovered in synthetic maps of surface brightness by fitting ellipses to lines of constant brightness. Systems with an outer perturber do not show a uniform halo precession since the orbits of small grains are strongly altered. We identified features of the brightness distributions suitable for distinguishing between systems with a potentially detectable inner or outer perturber, especially with a combined observation with JWST/MIRI in the $Q$ band tracing small grain emission and with ALMA at mm wavelengths tracing the position of the parent planetesimal belt.</description>

      <title>An In-depth Investigation of the Primordial Cluster Pair ASCC 19 and ASCC 21</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing \texttt{Gaia} data from the literature, we report a new young ($\sim$8.9~Myr) cluster pair, ASCC~19 and ASCC~21, located near the Orion star-forming complex. The clusters are separated by a 3D distance of ~27.00~$\pm$~7.51~pc. Both clusters share a common age (Log(age)~=~6.95~$\pm$~0.05), similar radial velocities ($R_{v}$~=~21.34~$\pm$~4.47~km s$^{-1}$ for ASCC~19 and $R_{v}$~=~20.05~$\pm$~3.86~km s$^{-1}$ for ASCC~21), and comparable metallicities ([Fe/H]~=~$-$0.14~$\pm$~0.25~dex for ASCC~19 and [Fe/H]~=~$-$0.12~$\pm$~0.04~dex for ASCC~21, from LAMOST-DR11). These similarities suggest that the clusters likely originated from the fragmentation of the same molecular cloud, forming a primordial cluster pair. Furthermore, the formation of the two clusters is attributed to the coalescence of multiple subclusters, as inferred from the distribution analysis between metal abundances and distances to clusters' centers. Neither cluster shows significant mass segregation. Their members with radial velocities exceeding 100~km s$^{-1}$ are young variables. Additionally, a tidal interaction between the clusters is observed. Comparisons of the Roche radius with tidal radii, and velocity difference with orbital velocity, suggest that the pair is an unbound system, that is, a double cluster. Finally, orbital motion simulations show that the clusters will not merge into a single system.</description>

      <title>Early-time millimeter observations of the nearby Type II SN 2024ggi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The short-lived ionized emission lines in early spectroscopy of the nearby type II supernova SN 2024ggi signify the presence of dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to its progenitor star. We proposed the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations by its Director's Discretionary Time program to catch the potential synchrotron radiation associated with the ejecta-CSM interaction. Multi-epoch observations were conducted using ALMA band 6 at +8, +13, and +17 days after the discovery. The data show non-detections at the position of SN 2024ggi with a 3sigma upper limit of less than 0.15 mJy, corresponding to a luminosity of approximately 8*10^24 erg/s/Hz. In this paper, we leverage the non-detections to place constraints on the properties of CSM surrounding SN 2024ggi. We investigate both the Wind and Eruptive models for the radial distribution of CSM, assuming a constant mass-loss rate in the Wind model and a distance-variant mass-loss rate in the Eruptive model. The derived CSM distribution for the Wind model does not align with the early-time spectral features, while the ALMA observations suggest a mass-loss rate of ~ 5*10^-3 Msun/year for the Eruptive model. Conducting multi-epoch millimeter/submillimeter observations shortly after the explosion, with a cadence of a few days, could offer a promising opportunity to capture the observable signature of the Eruptive model.</description>

      <title>MPI-Rockstar: a Hybrid MPI and OpenMP Parallel Implementation of the Rockstar Halo finder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MPI-Rockstar is a massively parallel halo finder based on the Rockstar phase-space temporal halo finder code, which is one of the most extensively used halo finding codes. Compared to the original code, parallelized by a primitive socket communication library, we parallelized it in a hybrid way using MPI and OpenMP, which is suitable for analysis on the hybrid shared and distributed memory environments of modern supercomputers. This implementation can easily handle the analysis of more than a trillion particles on more than 100,000 parallel processes, enabling the production of a huge dataset for the next generation of cosmological surveys. As new functions to the original Rockstar code, MPI-Rockstar supports HDF5 as an output format and can output additional halo properties such as the inertia tensor.</description>
