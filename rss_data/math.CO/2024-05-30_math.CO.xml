      <title>Two lower bounds for maximum matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove two lower bounds for the maximum matching size in an arbitrary undirected graph. Despite their simplicity, these results are not widely known. This article aims to bring pleasure to the reader by giving short combinatorial proofs of these easy-to-state estimates.</description>

      <title>Tournament completions of bipartite tournaments and their augmented directed cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tournament $T$ is a tournament completion of a bipartite tournament $D$ if $D$ is a spanning subdigraph of $T$, i.e., $V(D)=V(T)$ and $A(D)\subseteq A(T)$. If $C$ is a $k$-dicycle (i.e., directed cycle of length $k$) in a tournament completion $T$ of $D$ and $C$ is not a dicycle in $D$, i.e., $A(C)\subseteq A(T)$ and $A(C)\not\subseteq A(D)$, then we call $C$ an augmented $k$-dicycle of $T$. In this paper, we investigate the families of bipartite tournaments for which there exists a tournament completion with exactly one augmented $3$-dicycle and with no augmented $4$-dicycles. Our investigation may be viewed as a variant of the orientation completion problem initiated by Bang-Jensen et al..</description>

      <title>Coloring some $(P_6,C_4)$-free graphs with $\Delta-1$ colors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Borodin-Kostochka Conjecture states that for a graph $G$, if $\Delta(G)\geq9$, then $\chi(G)\leq\max\{\Delta(G)-1,\omega(G)\}$. We use $P_t$ and $C_t$ to denote a path and a cycle on $t$ vertices, respectively. Let $C=v_1v_2v_3v_4v_5v_1$ be an induced $C_5$. A {\em $C_5^+$} is a graph obtained from $C$ by adding a $C_3=xyzx$ and a $P_2=t_1t_2$ such that (1) $x$ and $y$ are both exactly adjacent to $v_1,v_2,v_3$ in $V(C)$, $z$ is exactly adjacent to $v_2$ in $V(C)$, $t_1$ is exactly adjacent to $v_4,v_5$ in $V(C)$ and $t_2$ is exactly adjacent to $v_1,v_4,v_5$ in $V(C)$, (2) $t_1$ is exactly adjacent to $z$ in $\{x,y,z\}$ and $t_2$ has no neighbors in $\{x,y,z\}$. In this paper, we show that the Borodin-Kostochka Conjecture holds for ($P_6,C_4,H$)-free graphs, where $H\in \{K_7,C_5^+\}$. This generalizes some results of Gupta and Pradhan in \cite{GP21,GP24}.</description>

      <title>Linear arboricity of graphs with large minimum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1980, Akiyama, Exoo, and Harary conjectured that any graph $G$ can be decomposed into at most $\lceil(\Delta(G)+1)/2\rceil$ linear forests. We confirm the conjecture for sufficiently large graphs with large minimum degree. Precisely, we show that for any given $0&lt;\varepsilon &lt;1$, there exists $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ for which the following statement holds: If $G$ is a graph on $n\ge n_0$ vertices of minimum degree at least $(1+\varepsilon )n/2$, then $G$ can be decomposed into at most $\lceil(\Delta(G)+1)/2\rceil$ linear forests.</description>

      <title>De Bruijn Polyominoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of de Bruijn polyominoes and prismatic polyominoes, which generalize the notions of de Bruijn sequences and arrays. Given a small fixed polyomino $p$ and a set of colors $[n]$, a de Bruijn polyomino for $(p,n)$ is a colored fixed polyomino $P$ with cells colored from $[n]$ such that every possible coloring of $p$ from $[n]$ exists as a subset of $P$. We call de Bruijn polyominoes for $(p,n)$ of minimum size $(p,n)$-prismatic. We discuss for some values of $p$ and $n$ the shape of a $(p,n)$-prismatic polyomino $P$, the construction of a coloring of $P$, and the enumeration of the colorings of $P$. We find evidence that the difficulty of these problems may depend on the parity of the size of $p$</description>

      <title>A combinatorial interpretation of the Bernstein degree of modules of covariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce sets $\mathcal{R}(\sigma)$ consisting of semistandard tableaux of shape $\sigma$, subject to a certain restriction on the initial column. These $\mathcal{R}(\sigma)$ are generalizations of the rational, symplectic, or orthogonal tableaux (which furnish a weight basis for the irreducible finite-dimensional representations $U_\sigma$ of the classical groups $H = \operatorname{GL}_k$, $\operatorname{Sp}_{2k}$, or $\operatorname{O}_k$, respectively). As our main result, we show that the cardinality of $\mathcal{R}(\sigma)$ gives the Bernstein degree (i.e., multiplicity) of the modules of covariants (of type $U_\sigma$) of each classical group $H$. Via Howe duality, these modules can also be viewed as $(\mathfrak{g},K)$-modules of unitary highest weight representations of a real reductive group $G_{\mathbb{R}}$. Notably, our result using $\mathcal{R}(\sigma)$ is valid regardless of the rank of $H$, whereas the previous result of Nishiyama-Ochiai-Taniguchi (expressing the Bernstein degree in terms of $\dim U_\sigma$) holds only when $k$ is at most the real rank of $G_{\mathbb{R}}$. In effect, as $k$ increases beyond this range, $|\mathcal{R}(\sigma)|$ interpolates between $\dim U_\sigma$ and the dimension of a certain "limiting" $K$-module.</description>

      <title>On line upper ideal relation graphs of rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upper ideal relation graph $\Gamma_{U}(R)$ of a commutative ring $R$ with unity is a simple undirected graph with the set of all non-unit elements of $R$ as a vertex set and two vertices $x$, $y$ are adjacent if and only if the principal ideals $(x)$ and $(y)$ are contained in the principal ideal $(z)$ for some non-unit element $z\in R$. This manuscript characterizes all the Artinian rings $R$ such that the graph $\Gamma_{U}(R)$ is a line graph. Moreover, all the Artinian rings $R$ for which $\Gamma_{U}(R)$ is the complement of a line graph have been described.</description>

      <title>Number of Independent Sets in Regular and Irregular Graphs: A 31 Year Journey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the progress made on bounding the number of independent sets in $d$-regular and irregular graphs over the last 31 years. We particularly focus on contributions from Kahn, Zhao, and Sah et al. in incrementally proving stronger and more general versions of the upper bound. We reproduce the main results of these works, particularly focusing on the unweighted special case (with fugacity $\lambda = 1$), which allows us to provide more intuitive and clear explanations of the key ideas that have been developed in the field over three decades.</description>

      <title>Daisy cubes as resonance graphs and maximal independent sets of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assume that $G$ is a homeomorphically peripheral color alternating graph with inner dual $G^*$ and resonance graph $R(G)$. We first establish a bijection between the set of maximal hypercubes of the resonance graph $R(G)$ and the set of maximal independent sets of the inner dual $G^*$, where $G^*$ is a tree and isomorphic to the $\tau$-graph of $R(G)$. A novel characterization on when resonance graphs are daisy cubes follows naturally. Furthermore, the proof of the characterization provides a binary code labelling for the vertex set of a resonance graph $R(G)$ as a daisy cube with respect to the set of maximal independent sets of the inner dual $G^*$ of $G$. We then show that a daisy cube with at least one edge is a resonance graph of a plane bipartite graph if and only if its $\tau$-graph is a forest. As applications of our main theorems, interesting results are obtained for Fibonacci cubes and Lucas cubes which are special types of daisy cubes. Structure properties are also provided for daisy cubes whose $\tau$-graphs are trees and have at most five maximal hypercubes. We conclude the paper with two algorithms which provide a binary code labelling for the vertex set of a resonance graph as a daisy cube.</description>

      <title>$S$-packing colorings of distance graphs with distance sets of cardinality $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a non-decreasing sequence $S=(s_1,s_2,\ldots)$ of positive integers, a partition of the vertex set of a graph $G$ into subsets $X_1,\ldots, X_\ell$, such that vertices in $X_i$ are pairwise at distance greater than $s_i$ for every $i\in\{1,\ldots,\ell\}$, is called an $S$-packing $\ell$-coloring of $G$. The minimum $\ell$ for which $G$ admits an $S$-packing $\ell$-coloring is called the $S$-packing chromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\chi_S(G)$. In this paper, we consider $S$-packing colorings of distance graphs $G(\mathbb{Z},\{k,t\})$, where $k$ and $t$ are positive integers, which are the graphs whose vertex set is $\mathbb{Z}$, and two vertices $x,y\in \mathbb{Z}$ are adjacent whenever $|x-y|\in\{k,t\}$. We complement partial results from two earlier papers, thus determining all values of $\chi_S(G(\mathbb{Z},\{k,t\}))$ when $S$ is any sequence with $s_i\le 2$ for all $i$. In particular, if $S=(1,1,2,2,\ldots)$, then the $S$-packing chromatic number is $2$ if $k+t$ is even, and $4$ otherwise, while if $S=(1,2,2,\ldots)$, then the $S$-packing chromatic number is $5$, unless $\{k,t\}=\{2,3\}$ when it is $6$; when $S=(2,2,2,\ldots)$, the corresponding formula is more complex.</description>

      <title>Constructing new geometries: a generalized approach to halving for hypertopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a residually connected incidence geometry $\Gamma$ that satisfies two conditions, denoted $(B_1)$ and $(B_2)$, we construct a new geometry $H(\Gamma)$ with properties similar to those of $\Gamma$. This new geometry $H(\Gamma)$ is inspired by a construction of Percsy, Percsy and Leemans [1]. We show how $H(\Gamma)$ relates to the classical halving operation on polytopes, allowing us to generalize the halving operation to a broader class of geometries, that we call non-degenerate leaf hypertopes. Finally, we apply this generalization to cubic toroids in order to generate new examples of regular hypertopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the year 1976, Sergiu Hart considered and solved the following combinatorial problem: given two parameters $k$ and $n$, find a set of k vertices in the $n$-cube which has a maximal number of interconnecting edges. Here we consider the more general problem with $q$-dimensional induced subcubes (for some fixed but arbitrary choice of $q$) instead of the interconnecting edges. In a different, but provably equivalent formulation, this problem has been solved quite recently but the proof that had been given is complicated. In this paper, we present a direct and comparably simple proof for the extension of Hart's result.</description>

      <title>The largest Laplacian eigenvalue and the balancedness of simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a simplical complex, and let $\mathcal{L}_i^{up}(K), \mathcal{Q}_i^{up}(K)$ be the $i$-th up Laplacian and signless Laplacian of $K$, respectively. In this paper we proved that the largest eigenvalue of $\mathcal{L}_i^{up}(K)$ is not greater than the largest eigenvalue of $\mathcal{Q}_i^{up}(K)$; furthermore, if $K$ is $(i+1)$-path connected, then the equality holds if and only if the $i$-th incidence signed graph $B_i(K)$ of $K$ is balanced. As an application we provided an upper bound for the largest eigenvalue of the $i$-th up Laplacian of $K$, which improves the bound given by Horak and Jost and generalizes the result of Anderson and Morley on graphs.We characterized the balancedness of simplicial complexes under operations such as wedge sum, join, Cartesian product and duplication of motifs. For each $i \ge 0$, by using wedge sum or duplication of motifs, we can construct an infinitely many $(i+1)$-path connected simplicial complexes $K$ with $B_i(K)$ being balanced.</description>

      <title>Typical Ramsey properties of the primes, abelian groups and other discrete structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a matrix $A$ with integer entries, a subset $S$ of an abelian group and $r \in \mathbb N$, we say that $S$ is $(A,r)$-Rado if any $r$-colouring of $S$ yields a monochromatic solution to the system of equations $Ax=0$. A classical result of Rado characterises all those matrices $A$ such that $\mathbb N$ is $(A,r)$-Rado for all $r \in \mathbb N$. R\"odl and Ruci\'nski and Friedgut, R\"odl and Schacht proved a random version of Rado's theorem where one considers a random subset of $[n]:=\{1,\dots,n\}$ instead of $\mathbb N$.
  In this paper, we investigate the analogous random Ramsey problem in the more general setting of abelian groups. Given a sequence $(S_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ of finite subsets of abelian groups, let $S_{n,p}$ be a random subset of $S_n$ obtained by including each element of $S_n$ independently with probability $p$. We are interested in determining the probability threshold $\hat p:=\hat p(n)$ such that
  $$\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb P [ S_{n,p} \text{ is } (A,r)\text{-Rado}]= \begin{cases} 0 &amp;\text{ if } p=o(\hat p); \\ 1 &amp;\text{ if } p=\omega(\hat p). \end{cases}$$
  Our main result, which we coin the random Rado lemma, is a general black box to tackle problems of this type. Using this tool in conjunction with a series of supersaturation results, we determine the probability threshold for a number of different cases. A consequence of the Green-Tao theorem is the van der Waerden theorem for the primes: every finite colouring of the primes contains arbitrarily long monochromatic arithmetic progressions. Using our machinery, we obtain a random version of this result. We also prove a novel supersaturation result for $S_n:=[n]^d$ and use it to prove an integer lattice generalisation of the random version of Rado's theorem. Various threshold results for abelian groups are also given.</description>

      <title>Quasimetric spaces with few lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chen and Chv\'atal conjectured in 2008 that in any finite metric space either there is a line containing all the points - a universal line -, or the number of lines is at least the number of points. This is a generalization of a classical result due to Erd\H{o}s that says that a set of $n$ non-collinear points in the Euclidean plane defines at least $n$ different lines.
  A line of a metric space with metric $\rho$ is defined in terms of a notion called the betweenness of the space which is the set of all triples $(x,z,y)$ such that $\rho(x,y)=\rho(x,z)+\rho(z,y)$.
  In this work we prove that for each $n\geq 4$ there are $p_3(n)$ non isomorphic betweennesses arising from \emph{quasimetric} spaces with $n$ points, without universal lines and with exactly 3 lines, where $p_3(n)$ is the number of partitions of an integer $n$ into three parts. We also prove that for $n\geq 5$, there are $2p_3(n-1)$ non isomorphic betweennesses arising from quasimetric spaces on $n$ points, without universal lines and with exactly 4 lines. Here two betweennesses are isomorphic if they are isomorphic as relational structures.
  None of the betweennesses mentioned above is metric which implies that Chen and Chv\'atal's conjecture is valid for metric spaces with at most five points.</description>

It is shown that any non-asymmetric incomplete digraph lacks sign symmetric $P_{0,1}^+$-completion, digraphs of order at most four are completely classified and finally comparisons between sign symmetric $P_{0,1}^+$-completion and other matrix completions was given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a drawing $D$ of a graph $G$, we define the crossing number between any two cycles $C_1,C_2$ in $D$ to be the number of crossings that involve at least one edge from each of $C_1$ and $C_2$ except the crossings between edges that are common to both cycles. We show that if the crossing number between every two cycles in $G$ is even in a drawing of $G$ on the plane, then there is a planar drawing of $G$. This result can be extended to arbitrary surfaces.</description>

      <title>Invariant Subspaces of Nilpotent Operators. Level, Mean, and Colevel: The Triangle $\Bbb T(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the category $\mathcal S(n)$ of all pairs $X = (U,V)$, where $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space with a nilpotent operator $T$ with $T^n = 0$, and $U$ is a subspace of $V$ such that $T(U) \subseteq U$. Our main interest in an object $X=(U,V)$ are the three numbers $uX=\dim U$ (for the subspace), $wX=\dim V/U$ (for the factor) and $bX=\dim {\rm Ker} T$ (for the operator). Actually, instead of looking at the reference space $\Bbb R^3$ with the triples $(uX,wX,bX)$, we will focus the attention to the corresponding projective space $\Bbb T(n)$ which contains for a non-zero object $X$ the level-colevel pair {\bf pr}$X = (uX/bX,wX/bX)$ supporting the object $X$.
  We use $\Bbb T(n)$ to visualize part of the categorical structure of $\mathcal S(n)$: The action of the duality $D$ and the square $\tau_n^2$ of the Auslander-Reiten translation are represented on $\Bbb T(n)$ by a reflection and a rotation by $120^\circ$ degrees, respectively. Moreover for $n\geq 6$, each component of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of $\mathcal S(n)$ has support either contained in the center of $\Bbb T(n)$ or with the center as its only accumulation point.
  We show that the only indecomposable objects $X$ in $\mathcal S(n)$ with support having boundary distance smaller than 1 are objects with $bX=1$ which lie on the boundary, whereas any rational vector in $\Bbb T(n)$ with boundary distance at least 2 supports infinitely many indecomposable objects. At present, it is not clear at all what happens for vectors with boundary distance between 1 and 2. The use of $\Bbb T(n)$ provides even in the (quite well-understood) case $n = 6$ some surprises: In particular, we will show that any indecomposable object in $\mathcal S(6)$ lies on one of 12 central lines in $\Bbb T(6)$.
  The paper is essentially self-contained, all prerequisites which are needed are outlined in detail.</description>

      <title>A simple inverse power method for balanced graph cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existing inverse power ($\mathbf{IP}$) method for solving the balanced graph cut lacks local convergence and its inner subproblem requires a nonsmooth convex solver. To address these issues, we develop a simple inverse power ($\mathbf{SIP}$) method using a novel equivalent continuous formulation of the balanced graph cut, and its inner subproblem allows an explicit analytic solution, which is the biggest advantage over $\mathbf{IP}$ and constitutes the main reason why we call it $\mathit{simple}$. By fully exploiting the closed-form of the inner subproblem solution, we design a boundary-detected subgradient selection with which $\mathbf{SIP}$ is proved to be locally converged. We show that $\mathbf{SIP}$ is also applicable to a new ternary valued $\theta$-balanced cut which reduces to the balanced cut when $\theta=1$. When $\mathbf{SIP}$ reaches its local optimum, we seamlessly transfer to solve the $\theta$-balanced cut within exactly the same iteration algorithm framework and thus obtain $\mathbf{SIP}$-$\mathbf{perturb}$ -- an efficient local breakout improvement of $\mathbf{SIP}$, which transforms some ``partitioned" vertices back to the ``un-partitioned" ones through the adjustable $\theta$. Numerical experiments on G-set for Cheeger cut and Sparsest cut demonstrate that $\mathbf{SIP}$ is significantly faster than $\mathbf{IP}$ while maintaining approximate solutions of comparable quality, and $\mathbf{SIP}$-$\mathbf{perturb}$ outperforms $\mathtt{Gurobi}$ in terms of both computational cost and solution quality.</description>

Abstract: We present a new application of multi-orbit cyclic subspace codes to construct large optical orthogonal codes, with the aid of the multiplicative structure of finite fields extensions. This approach is different from earlier approaches using combinatorial and additive (character sum) structures of finite fields. Consequently, we immediately obtain new classes of optical orthogonal codes with different parameters.</description>

Abstract: We construct a pair of non-isomorphic, bipartite graphs which are not distinguished by counting the number of homomorphisms to any tree. This answers a question raised by Atserias et al. (LICS 2021). In order to establish the construction, we analyse the equivalence relations induced by counting homomorphisms to trees of diameter two and three and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for two graphs to be equivalent. We show that three is the optimal diameter for our construction.</description>

      <title>Sparse High Dimensional Expanders via Local Lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High dimensional expanders (HDXs) are a hypergraph generalization of expander graphs. They are extensively studied in the math and TCS communities due to their many applications. Like expander graphs, HDXs are especially interesting for applications when they are bounded degree, namely, if the number of edges adjacent to every vertex is bounded. However, only a handful of constructions are known to have this property, all of which rely on non-trivial algebraic techniques. In particular, no random or combinatorial construction of bounded degree HDXs is known. As a result, our understanding of these objects is limited.
  The degree of an $i$-face in an HDX is the number of $(i+1)$-faces containing it. In this work we construct HDXs whose higher dimensional faces have bounded degree. This is done by giving an elementary and deterministic algorithm that takes as input a regular $k$-dimensional HDX $X$ and outputs another $k$-dimensional HDX $\widehat{X}$ with twice as many vertices. While the degree of vertices in $\widehat{X}$ grows, the degree of the $(k-1)$-faces in $\widehat{X}$ stays the same. As a result, we obtain a new `algebra-free' construction of HDXs whose $(k-1)$-face degree is bounded.
  Our algorithm is based on a simple and natural generalization of the construction by Bilu and Linial (Combinatorica, 2006), which build expanders using lifts coming from edge signings. Our construction is based on local lifts of HDXs, where a local lift is a complex whose top-level links are lifts of links in the original complex. We demonstrate that a local lift of an HDX is an HDX in many cases.
  In addition, combining local lifts with existing bounded degree constructions creates new families of bounded degree HDXs with significantly different links than before. We use this technique to construct bounded degree high dimensional expanders with links that have arbitrarily large diameters.</description>

Abstract: Let $ABC$ be an equilateral triangle. For certain triangles $T$ (the "tile") and certain $N$, it is possible to cut $ABC$ into $N$ copies of $T$. It is known that only certain shapes of $T$ are possible, but until now very little was known about the possible values of $N$. Here we prove that for $N&gt;3$, $N$ cannot be prime, and study more closely the possible tilings when the tile has a $\pi/3$ angle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.09753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a discrete poset $\mathcal X$ McCord proved that the natural map $|{\mathcal X}|\to {\mathcal X}$ from the order complex to the poset equipped with the Up topology is a weak homotopy equivalence. Much later, Zivaljevi\'{c} defined the notion of order complex for a topological poset. For a large class of such topological posets we prove the analog of McCord's theorem, namely that the natural map from the order complex to the topological poset with the Up topology is a weak homotopy equivalence. A familiar topological example is the Grassmann poset of proper non-zero linear subspaces of R^{n+1} partially ordered by inclusion. But our motivation in topological combinatorics is to apply the theorem to posets associated with tropical phased matroids over the tropical phase hyperfield, and in particular to elucidate the tropical version of the MacPhersonian Conjecture. This is explained in Section 2.</description>

Abstract: A separating path system for a graph $G$ is a collection $\mathcal{P}$ of paths in $G$ such that for every two edges $e$ and $f$ in $G$, there is a path in $\mathcal{P}$ that contains $e$ but not $f$. We show that every $n$-vertex graph has a separating path system of size $O(n \log^* n)$. This improves upon the previous best upper bound of $O(n \log n)$, and makes progress towards a conjecture of Falgas-Ravry--Kittipassorn--Kor\'andi--Letzter--Narayanan and Balogh--Csaba--Martin--Pluh\'ar, according to which an $O(n)$ bound should hold.</description>

      <title>On the Small Quasi-kernel conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An independent vertex subset $S$ of the directed graph $G$ is a kernel if the set of out-neighbors of $S$ is $V(G)\setminus S$. An independent vertex subset $Q$ of $G$ is a quasi-kernel if the union of the first and second out-neighbors contains $V(G)\setminus S$ as a subset. Deciding whether a directed graph has a kernel is an NP-hard problem. In stark contrast, each directed graph has quasi-kernel(s) and one can be found in linear time. In this article, we will survey the results on quasi-kernel and their connection with kernels. We will focus on the small quasi-kernel conjecture which states that if the graph has no vertex of zero in-degree, then there exists a quasi-kernel of size not larger than half of the order of the graph. The paper also contains new proofs and some new results as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study hook lengths of ordinary partitions and $t$-regular partitions. We establish hook length biases for the ordinary partitions and motivated by them we find a few interesting hook length biases in $2$-regular partitions. For a positive integer $k$, let $p_{(k)}(n)$ denote the number of hooks of length $k$ in all the partitions of $n$. We prove that $p_{(k)}(n)\geq p_{(k+1)}(n)$ for all $n\geq0$ and $n\ne k+1$; and $p_{(k)}(k+1)- p_{(k+1)}(k+1)=-1$ for $k\geq 2$. For integers $t\geq2$ and $k\geq1$, let $b_{t,k}(n)$ denote the number of hooks of length $k$ in all the $t$-regular partitions of $n$. We find generating functions of $b_{t,k}(n)$ for certain values of $t$ and $k$. Exploring hook length biases for $b_{t,k}(n)$, we observe that in certain cases biases are opposite to the biases for ordinary partitions. We prove that $b_{2,2}(n)\geq b_{2,1}(n)$ for all $n&gt;4$, whereas $b_{2,2}(n)\geq b_{2,3}(n)$ for all $n\geq 0$. We also propose some conjectures on biases among $b_{t,k}(n)$.</description>

Abstract: Given a finite directed acyclic graph, the space of non-negative unit flows is a lattice polytope called the flow polytope of the graph. We consider the volumes of flow polytopes for directed acyclic graphs on $n+1$ vertices with a fixed degree sequence, with a focus on graphs having in- and out-degree two on every internal vertex. When the out-degree of the source is three and the number of vertices is fixed, we prove that there is an interchange operation on the edge set of these graphs that induces a partial order on the graphs isomorphic to a Boolean algebra. Further, we prove that as we move up through this partial order, the volumes of the corresponding flow polytopes weakly decrease. Finally, we show that each such graph is strongly planar and we provide an alternative interpretation of our results in the context of linear extensions for posets that are bipartite non-crossing trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.14597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give general conditions for the existence of a Hamiltonian operator whose discrete time evolution matches the partition function of certain solvable lattice models. In particular, we examine two classes of lattice models: the classical six-vertex model and a generalized family of $(2n+4)$-vertex models for each positive integer $n$. These models depend on a statistic called charge, and are associated to the quantum group $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(1|n))$. Our results show a close and unexpected connection between Hamiltonian operators and the Yang-Baxter equation.
  The six-vertex model can be associated with Hamiltonians from classical Fock space, and we show that such a correspondence exists precisely when the Boltzmann weights are free fermionic. This allows us to prove that the free fermionic partition function is always a (skew) supersymmetric Schur function and then use the Berele-Regev formula to correct a result from of Brubaker, Bump, and Friedberg on the free fermionic domain-wall partition function. In this context, the supersymmetric function involution takes us between two lattice models that generalize the vicious walker and osculating walker models.
  Then, we prove a sharp solvability criterion for the six-vertex model with charge that provides the proper analogue of the free fermion condition. Building on results by Brubaker, Buciumas, Bump, and Gustafsson, we show that this criterion exactly dictates when a charged model has a Hamiltonian operator acting on a Drinfeld twist of $q$-Fock space. The resulting partition function is then a (skew) supersymmetric LLT polynomial, and almost all supersymmetric LLT polynomials appear as partition functions of our lattice models. We also prove a Cauchy identity for skew supersymmetric LLT polynomials. (see 2024 author's note below)</description>

      <title>New cluster algebras from old: integrability beyond Zamolodchikov periodicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00721v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider discrete dynamical systems obtained as deformations of mutations in cluster algebras associated with finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras. The original (undeformed) dynamical systems provide the simplest examples of Zamolodchikov periodicity: they are affine birational maps for which every orbit is periodic with the same period. Following on from preliminary work by one of us with Kouloukas, here we present integrable maps obtained from deformations of cluster mutations related to the following simple root systems: $A_3$, $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$. We further show how new cluster algebras arise, by considering Laurentification, that is, a lifting to a higher-dimensional map expressed in a set of new variables (tau functions), for which the dynamics exhibits the Laurent property. For the integrable map obtained by deformation of type $A_3$, which already appeared in our previous work, we show that there is a commuting map of Quispel-Roberts-Thompson (QRT) type which is built from a composition of mutations and a permutation applied to the same cluster algebra of rank 6, with an additional 2 frozen variables. Furthermore, both the deformed $A_3$ map and the QRT map correspond to addition of a point in the Mordell-Weil group of a rational elliptic surface of rank two, and the underlying cluster algebra comes from a quiver that mutation equivalent to the $q$-Painlev\'e III quiver found by Okubo. The deformed integrable maps of types $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$ are also related to elliptic surfaces.
  From a dynamical systems viewpoint, the message of the paper is that special families of birational maps with completely periodic dynamics under iteration admit natural deformations that are aperiodic yet completely integrable.</description>

      <title>An optimal algorithm for geodesic mutual visibility on hexagonal grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13615</link>

Abstract: For a set of robots (or agents) moving in a graph, two properties are highly desirable: confidentiality (i.e., a message between two agents must not pass through any intermediate agent) and efficiency (i.e., messages are delivered through shortest paths). These properties can be obtained if the \textsc{Geodesic Mutual Visibility} (GMV, for short) problem is solved: oblivious robots move along the edges of the graph, without collisions, to occupy some vertices that guarantee they become pairwise geodesic mutually visible. This means there is a shortest path (i.e., a ``geodesic'') between each pair of robots along which no other robots reside. In this work, we optimally solve GMV on finite hexagonal grids $G_k$. This, in turn, requires first solving a graph combinatorial problem, i.e. determining the maximum number of mutually visible vertices in $G_k$.</description>

      <title>Cluster expansion formulas and perfect matchings for type B and C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{P}_{2n+2}$ be the regular polygon with $2n+2$ vertices, and let $\theta$ be the rotation of 180$^\circ$. Fomin and Zelevinsky proved that $\theta$-invariant triangulations of $\mathbf{P}_{2n+2}$ are in bijection with the clusters of cluster algebras of type $B_n$ or $C_n$. Furthermore, cluster variables correspond to the orbits of the action of $\theta$ on the diagonals of $\mathbf{P}_{2n+2}$. In this paper, we associate a labeled modified snake graph $\mathcal{G}_{ab}$ to each $\theta$-orbit $[a,b]$, and we get the cluster variables of type $B_n$ and $C_n$ which correspond to $[a,b]$ as perfect matching Laurent polynomials of $\mathcal{G}_{ab}$. This extends the work of Musiker for cluster algebras of type B and C to every seed.</description>
