      <title>Exploring the Capabilities and Limitations of Large Language Models for Radiation Oncology Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to the rapidly evolving integration of LLMs into decision-support tools, a significant transformation is happening across large-scale systems. Like other medical fields, the use of LLMs such as GPT-4 is gaining increasing interest in radiation oncology as well. An attempt to assess GPT-4's performance in radiation oncology was made via a dedicated 100-question examination on the highly specialized topic of radiation oncology physics, revealing GPT-4's superiority over other LLMs. GPT-4's performance on a broader field of clinical radiation oncology is further benchmarked by the ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training (TXIT) exam where GPT-4 achieved a high accuracy of 74.57%. Its performance on re-labelling structure names in accordance with the AAPM TG-263 report has also been benchmarked, achieving above 96% accuracies. Such studies shed light on the potential of LLMs in radiation oncology. As interest in the potential and constraints of LLMs in general healthcare applications continues to rise5, the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in radiation oncology decision support have not yet been fully explored.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Mitigating Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning-Based MRI Reconstruction Without Any Retraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods, especially those based on physics-driven DL, have become the state-of-the-art for reconstructing sub-sampled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. However, studies have shown that these methods are susceptible to small adversarial input perturbations, or attacks, resulting in major distortions in the output images. Various strategies have been proposed to reduce the effects of these attacks, but they require retraining and may lower reconstruction quality for non-perturbed/clean inputs. In this work, we propose a novel approach for detecting and mitigating adversarial attacks on MRI reconstruction models without any retraining. Our detection strategy is based on the idea of cyclic measurement consistency. The output of the model is mapped to another set of MRI measurements for a different sub-sampling pattern, and this synthesized data is reconstructed with the same model. Intuitively, without an attack, the second reconstruction is expected to be consistent with the first, while with an attack, disruptions are present. Subsequently, this idea is extended to devise a novel objective function, which is minimized within a small ball around the attack input for mitigation. Experimental results show that our method substantially reduces the impact of adversarial perturbations across different datasets, attack types/strengths and PD-DL networks, and qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms conventional mitigation methods that involve retraining.</description>

      <title>Decoding Gray Matter: large-scale analysis of brain cell morphometry to inform microstructural modeling of diffusion MR signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) is a formidable technique for non-invasively characterizing brain microstructure. Biophysical modelling is often necessary to gain specificity to cellular structure. However, designing sensible biophysical models and appropriate dMRI acquisitions is challenging, especially for gray matter (GM), as little is known about typical values of relevant features of braincell morphology contributing to dMRI signal.
  This work addressees this unmet need. We analysed about 3,500 cells from mouse, rat, monkey and human brains to determine statistical distributions of a set of morphological features (structural, topological and shape descriptors) relevant to GM microstructure modelling. Illustrative examples demonstrate how this study can inform biophysical modelling and important implications for biophysical modelling of GM are discussed, enabling the design of more sensible models and suitable data acquisitions.</description>

      <title>A Passive Mechanical Add-on for Treadmill Exercise (P-MATE) in Stroke Rehabilitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic rehabilitation can deliver high-dose gait therapy and improve motor function after a stroke. However, for many devices, high costs and lengthy setup times limit clinical adoption. Thus, we designed, built, and evaluated the Passive Mechanical Add-on for Treadmill Exercise (P-MATE), a low-cost passive end-effector add-on for treadmills that couples the movement of the paretic and non-paretic legs via a reciprocating system of elastic cables and pulleys. Two human-device mechanical interfaces were designed to attach the elastic cables to the user. The P-MATE and two interface prototypes were tested with a physical therapist and eight unimpaired participants. Biomechanical data, including kinematics and interaction forces, were collected alongside standardized questionnaires to assess usability and user experience. Both interfaces were quick and easy to attach, though user experience differed, highlighting the need for personalization. We also identified areas for future improvement, including pretension adjustments, tendon derailing prevention, and understanding long-term impacts on user gait. Our preliminary findings underline the potential of the P-MATE to provide effective, accessible, and sustainable stroke gait rehabilitation.</description>

      <title>Magnetization transfer explains most of the $T_1$ variability in the MRI literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To identify the predominant source of the $T_1$ variability described in the literature, which ranges from 0.6-1.1 s for brain white matter at 3 T.
  Methods: 25 $T_1$-mapping methods from the literature were simulated with a mono-exponential and various magnetization-transfer (MT) models, each followed by mono-exponential fitting. A single set of model parameters was assumed for the simulation of all methods, and these parameters were estimated by fitting the simulation-based to the corresponding literature $T_1$ values of white matter at 3 T. We acquired in vivo data with a quantitative magnetization transfer and three $T_1$-mapping techniques. The former was used to synthesize MR images that correspond to the three $T_1$-mapping methods. A mono-exponential model was fitted to the experimental and corresponding synthesized MR images.
  Results: Mono-exponential simulations suggest good inter-method reproducibility and fail to explain the highly variable $T_1$ estimates in the literature. In contrast, MT simulations suggest that a mono-exponential fit results in a variable $T_1$ and explain up to 62% of the literature's variability. In our own in vivo experiments, MT explains 70% of the observed variability.
  Conclusion: The results suggest that a mono-exponential model does not adequately describe longitudinal relaxation in biological tissue. Therefore, $T_1$ in biological tissue should be considered only a semi-quantitative metric that is inherently contingent upon the imaging methodology; and comparisons between different $T_1$-mapping methods and the use of simplistic spin systems - such as doped-water phantoms - for validation should be viewed with caution.</description>

      <title>A Novel Automatic Real-time Motion Tracking Method for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided Radiotherapy: Leveraging the Enhanced Tracking-Learning-Detection Framework with Automatic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background and Purpose: Accurate motion tracking in MRI-guided Radiotherapy (MRIgRT) is essential for effective treatment delivery. This study aimed to enhance motion tracking precision in MRIgRT through an automatic real-time markerless tracking method using an enhanced Tracking-Learning-Detection (ETLD) framework with automatic segmentation. Materials and Methods: We developed a novel MRIgRT motion tracking and segmentation method by integrating the ETLD framework with an improved Chan-Vese model (ICV), named ETLD+ICV. The ETLD framework was upgraded for real-time cine MRI, including advanced image preprocessing, no-reference image quality assessment, an enhanced median-flow tracker, and a refined detector with dynamic search region adjustments. ICV was used for precise target volume coverage, refining the segmented region frame by frame using tracking results, with key parameters optimized. The method was tested on 3.5D MRI scans from 10 patients with liver metastases. Results: Evaluation of 106,000 frames across 77 treatment fractions showed sub-millimeter tracking errors of less than 0.8mm, with over 99% precision and 98% recall for all subjects in the Beam Eye View(BEV)/Beam Path View(BPV) orientation. The ETLD+ICV method achieved a dice global score of more than 82% for all subjects, demonstrating the method's extensibility and precise target volume coverage. Conclusion: This study successfully developed an automatic real-time markerless motion tracking method for MRIgRT that significantly outperforms current methods. The novel method not only delivers exceptional precision in tracking and segmentation but also shows enhanced adaptability to clinical demands, making it an indispensable asset in improving the efficacy of radiotherapy treatments.</description>
