      <title>Mechanical presymplectic structures and Marsden-Weinstein reduction of time-dependent Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1986, Albert proposed a Marsden-Weinstein reduction process for cosymplectic structures. In this paper, we present the limitations of this theory in the application of the reduction of symmetric time-dependent Hamiltonian systems. As a consequence, we conclude that cosymplectic geometry is not appropriate for this reduction. Motived for this fact, we replace cosymplectic structures by more general structures: mechanical presymplectic structures. Then, we develop Marsden-Weinstein reduction for this kind of structures and we apply this theory to interesting examples of time-dependent Hamiltonian systems for which Albert's reduction method doesn't work.</description>

      <title>Dimension estimate and existence of holomorphic sections with polynomial growth on gradient K\"ahler Ricci shrinkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an upper bound for the dimension of the linear space of holomorphic functions with polynomial growth on gradient K\"ahler Ricci shrinkers with bounded curvature. The upper bound is given as a power function of the growth rate. Similar results hold for holomorphic $(p, 0)-$forms, and holomorphic sections of the pluri-anticanonical line bundle $K_M^{-q}$. We also prove the existence of holomorphic sections of $K_M^{-q}$ with polynomial growth when the K\"ahler Ricci shrinker is asymptotically conical, provided $q$ is sufficiently large; as an application, we show that the Kodaira map constructed using such sections is a holomorphic embbedding into a complex projective space.</description>

      <title>On weakly Einstein Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Riemannian manifold is called \emph{weakly Einstein} if the tensor $R_{iabc}R_{j}^{~~abc}$ is a scalar multiple of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$. We consider weakly Einstein Lie groups with a left-invariant metric which are weakly Einstein. We prove that there exist no weakly Einstein non-abelian $2$-step nilpotent Lie groups and no weakly Einstein non-abelian nilpotent Lie groups whose dimension is at most $5$. We also prove that an almost abelian Lie group is weakly Einstein if and only if at the Lie algebra level it is defined by a normal operator whose square is a multiple of the identity.</description>

      <title>Non-persistence of strongly isolated singularities, and geometric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a generic regularity result for stationary integral $n$-varifolds assumed to have only strongly isolated singularities inside $N$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, without any restriction on the dimension ($n\geq 2$) and codimension. As a special case, we prove that for any $n\geq 2$ and any compact $(n+1)$-dimensional manifold $M$ the following holds: for a generic choice of the background metric $g$ all stationary integral $n$-varifolds in $(M,g)$ will either be entirely smooth or have at least one singular point that is not strongly isolated. In other words, for a generic metric only "more complicated" singularities may possibly persist. This implies, for instance, a generic finiteness result for the class of all closed minimal hypersurfaces of area at most $4\pi^2-\varepsilon$ (for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$) in nearly round four-spheres: we can thus give precise answers, in the negative, to the questions of persistence of the Clifford football and of Hsiang's hyperspheres in nearly-round metrics. The aforementioned main regularity result is achieved as a consequence of the fine analysis of the Fredholm index of the Jacobi operator for such varifolds: we prove on the one hand an exact formula relating that number to the Morse indices of the conical links at the singular points, while on the other hand we show that such an index is non-negative for all such varifolds if the ambient metric is generic.</description>

      <title>The Hidden M-Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following arguments that the (hidden) M-algebra serves as the maximal super-exceptional tangent space for 11D supergravity, we make explicit here its integration to a (super-Lie) group. This is equipped with a left-invariant extension of the ''decomposed'' M-theory 3-form, such that it constitutes the Kleinian space on which super-exceptional spacetimes are to be locally modeled as Cartan geometries.
  As a simple but consequential application, we highlight how to describe lattice subgroups $\mathbb{Z}^{k \leq 528}$ of the hidden M-group that allow to toroidially compactify also the ''hidden'' dimensions of a super-exceptional spacetime, akin to the familiar situation in topological T-duality.
  In order to deal with subtleties in these constructions, we (i) provide a computer-checked re-derivation of the ''decompose'' M-theory 3-form, and (ii) present a streamlined conception of super-Lie groups, that is both rigorous while still close to physics intuition and practice.
  Thereby this article highlights modernized super-Lie theory along the example of the hidden M-algebra, with an eye towards laying foundations for super-exceptional geometry. Among new observations is the dimensional reduction of the hidden M-algebra to a ''hidden IIA-algebra'' which in a companion article we explain as the exceptional extension of the T-duality doubled super-spacetime.</description>

      <title>A Calder\'{o}n Problem for Beltrami Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a $3$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with boundary, we define an analogue of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for Beltrami fields, which are the eigenvectors of the curl operator and play a major role in fluid mechanics. This map sends the normal component of a Beltrami field to its tangential component on the boundary. In this paper we establish two results showing how this normal-to-tangential map encodes geometric information on the underlying manifold. First, we show that the normal-to-tangential map is a pseudodifferential operator of order zero on the boundary whose total symbol determines the Taylor series of the metric at the boundary. Second, we go on to show that a real-analytic simply connected $3$-manifold can be reconstructed from its normal-to-tangential map. Interestingly, since Green's functions do not exist for the Beltrami field equation, a key idea of the proof is to find an appropriate substitute, which turn out to have a natural physical interpretation as the magnetic fields generated by small current loops.</description>

      <title>Horizons of some asymptotically stationary spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a class of dynamical spacetimes which are asymptotic as $t\to\infty$ to a stationary spacetime containing a horizon $\mathcal{H}_0$, we show the existence of a unique null hypersurface $\mathcal{H}$ which is asymptotic to $\mathcal{H}_0$. This is a special case of a general unstable manifold theorem for perturbations of flows which translate in time and have a normal sink at an invariant manifold in space. Examples of horizons $\mathcal{H}_0$ to which our result applies include event horizons of subextremal Kerr and Kerr-Newman black holes as well as event and cosmological horizons of subextremal Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black holes. In the Kerr(-Newman) case, we show that $\mathcal{H}$ is equal to the boundary of the black hole region of the dynamical spacetime.</description>

      <title>Volume gap for minimal submanifolds in spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a closed minimal submanifold $f:M^n\looparrowright \mathbb{S}^{N}$ in the unit sphere $(n&lt;N)$, we prove $${\rm Vol}(M^n) \geq\frac{n+1}{n+2}\int_{M}\left( 1+\varphi_{p}^2\right) \geq m{\rm Vol}(\mathbb{S}^{n}),$$ where $\varphi_{p}(x):=\langle f(x),p\rangle$ is the height function in direction $p\in f(M)$, $m$ denotes the multiplicity of $p\in f(M)$ and ${\rm Vol}$ denotes the Riemannian volume functional, and each equality holds if and only if $M$ is totally geodesic. As an application, if the volume of $M^n$ is less than or equal to the volume of any $n$-dimensional minimal Clifford torus, then $M^n$ must be embedded, verifying the non-embedded case of Yau's conjecture. In addition, we also get volume gaps for minimal hypersurfaces with constant scalar curvature, improving Cheng-Li-Yau's classical volume gap in this case. Some other volume gaps and related pinching rigidities are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Non-abelian symmetric critical gravitating vortices on a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We produce examples of solutions to the non-abelian gravitating vortex equations, which are a dimensional reduction of the K\"aher-Yang-Mills- Higgs equations. These are equations for a K\"ahler metric and a metric on a vector bundle. We consider a symmetric situation on a sphere with a relationship between the parameters involved (criticality), and perform a non-trivial reduction of the problem to a system of ordinary differential equations on the real line with complicated boundary conditions at infinity. This system involves a parameter whose dependence on the volume of the K\"ahler metric is non-explicit. We prove existence to this system using the method of continuity. We then prove that the parameter can be varied to make sure that all possible admissible volumes are attained.</description>

      <title>Semimartingale driven mechanics and reduction by symmetry for stochastic and dissipative dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent interest in structure preserving stochastic Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems raises questions regarding how such models are to be understood and the principles through which they are to be derived. By considering a mathematically sound extension of the Hamilton-Pontryagin principle, we derive a stochastic analogue of the Euler-Lagrange equations, driven by independent semimartingales. Using this as a starting point, we can apply symmetry reduction carefully to derive non-canonical stochastic Lagrangian / Hamiltonian systems, including the stochastic Euler-Poincar\'e / Lie-Poisson equations, studied extensively in the literature. Furthermore, we develop a framework to include dissipation that balances the structure-preserving noise in such a way that the overall stochastic dynamics preserves the Gibbs measure on the symplectic manifold, where the dynamics effectively take place. In particular, this leads to a new derivation of double-bracket dissipation by considering Lie group invariant stochastic dissipative dynamics, taking place on the cotangent bundle of the group.</description>
