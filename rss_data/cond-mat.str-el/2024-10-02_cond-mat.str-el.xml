      <title>Itinerant magnetism in Hubbard models with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide variety of experimental platforms, ranging from semiconductor quantum-dot arrays to moir\'e materials, have recently emerged as powerful quantum simulators for studying the Hubbard model and its variants. Motivated by these developments, here, we investigate a generalization of the Hubbard model which includes the effects of long-range Coulomb interactions. Working on finite-sized two-dimensional square and triangular lattices, we use exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group calculations to probe the magnetic structure of the ground state in the strong-coupling regime, where $U$ (the onsite repulsion) $\gg$ $t$ (the nearest-neighbor hopping). For small electron dopings above the half-filled antiferromagnet, we numerically uncover a rich variety of magnetically ordered states, and in conjunction with theoretical arguments, infer the phase diagram of the system as a function of doping and interaction strengths. In particular, we find that the inclusion of long-range Coulomb interactions induces an instability of high-spin states$\unicode{x2014}$such as the saturated Nagaoka ferromagnet$\unicode{x2014}$towards phase separation and stripe ordering. We also present proposals for the observation of some of our key findings in experiments that would shed further light on this paradigmatic strongly correlated system.</description>

      <title>Multi-orbital two-particle self-consistent approach -- strengths and limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending many-body numerical techniques which are powerful in the context of simple model calculations to the realm of realistic material simulations can be a challenging task. Realistic systems often involve multiple active orbitals, which increases the complexity and numerical cost because of the large local Hilbert space and the large number of interaction terms or sign-changing off-diagonal Green's functions. The two-particle self-consistent approach (TPSC) is one such many-body numerical technique, for which multi-orbital extensions have proven to be involved due to the substantially more complex structure of the local interaction tensor. In this paper we extend earlier multi-orbital generalizations of TPSC by setting up two different variants of a fully self-consistent theory for TPSC in multi-orbital systems. We first investigate the strengths and limitations of the approach analytically, and then benchmark both variants against exact diagonalization (ED) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) results. We find that the exact behavior of the system can be faithfully reproduced in the weak coupling regime, while at stronger couplings the performance of the two approaches strongly depends on details of the system.</description>

      <title>A Closed Band-Projected Density Algebra Must be Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The band-projected density operators in a Landau level obey the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP) algebra, and a large amount of effort in the study of fractional Chern insulators has been directed towards approximating this algebra in a Chern band. In this paper, we prove that the GMP algebra, up to form factors, is the $\textit{only}$ closed algebra that projected density operators can satisfy in two and three dimensions, highlighting the central place it occupies in the study of Chern bands in general. A number of interesting corollaries follow.</description>

      <title>Metamagnetism in UPt$_3$: An augmented Landau approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several heavy fermion materials, including UPt3, exhibit metamagnetism, a rapid but gradual rise in the magnetization with field, without an apparent phase transition at any temperature T &gt; 0, with the possibility of a first order transition at T = 0. To model such a quantum phase transition it is most appropriate to develop approaches considering the quantum nature of the spins. Within a fully classical framework, we show that it is sufficient to start from a Landau-type free energy with an added Bragg-Williams entropy term to arrive at a number of key experimental features as seen in UPt3. In particular, we show that correctly arriving at the meassured (low-field) higher order susceptibilities necessarily invokes an isobestic (crossing) point at a high field in the magnetization isotherms. We also present a full analysis of the angular dependence of the (low-field) linear and nonlinear susceptibilities which when extended also capture the anisotropic high field response of the magnetization. Key to this success is the proper conversion of the evaluated magnetization from constant volume to a constant pressure situation relevant at high fields in heavy fermion materials.</description>

      <title>Topological orders with classical Lie group symmetries from coupling electron wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topological order that arises from chiral states with ${\rm SU}(N)$ or ${\rm SO}(N)$ edge-state symmetry. This extends our previous study of topological orders that descend from the bosonic $E_8$ quantum Hall state. We use exactly solvable models of coupled electron wires to construct states with ${\rm SU}(m)_n$, ${\rm SO}(m)_n$, or ${\rm Sp}(m)_n$ topological order for various levels $n$. We use our constructions to write down string operators for various non-Abelian anyons. We thereby provide a systematic, microscopic understanding of quantum Hall states, topological superconductors, and spin liquids with emergent non-Abelian quasiparticle excitations, including those of Ising, metaplectic, and Fibonacci type.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in infinite-layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently discovered superconducting infinite-layer nickelates $R$NiO$_2$ ($R$=Nd, La, Pr) attract increasing attention due to the similarites to cuprates. Both $R$NiO$_2$ and YBCO cuprates exhibit the non-fermi-liquid transport behavior, characterized by resistivity proportional to temperature near the quantum critical point of the charge or spin density wave. In this study, we analyze the resistivity of infinite-layer nickelate Nd$_{0.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$NiO$_2$ based on a three-dimensional tight-binding model by applying linear response theory. We take account of the self-energy by the fluctuation exchange (FLEX) approximation for the Ni orbital and the T-matrix approximation for an impurity effect on the Nd orbitals. We find that (i) the $T$-linear resistivity at low temperatures is derived from the spin fluctuations, and (ii) a negative and $T$-linear Seebeck coefficient is obtained. The resulting $T$-linear resistivity suggests that NdNiO$_2$ behaves as a quasi-two-dimensional electron system similar to CeCoIn$_5$.</description>

      <title>Terahertz harmonic generation across the Mott insulator-metal transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate terahertz (THz) harmonic generation across the Mott insulator-metal transition in rare-earth nickelates (RNiO$_3$, R = rare-earth atom). The THz harmonic generation is observed in all the three different phases with distinct behaviors: the intensity of harmonics increases upon cooling in both the low-temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulating and high-temperature paramagnetic (PM) metallic phases, while this trend is reversed in the intermediate PM insulating phase. Using single- and two-band Hubbard models, we find different dominant origins of THz harmonics in different phases: strong spin-charge and orbital-charge couplings in the AFM insulating phase, intraband currents from renormalized quasi-particles with frequency-dependent scattering rate in the PM metallic phase, and the reduction of the charge carrier density due to the opening of the Mott gap in the PM insulating phase. Our study offers strategies for efficient THz harmonic generation from Mott and other strongly correlated systems and insights into the fundamental physics of complex materials.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Induced Symmetry Breaking in Circular Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates interaction-induced symmetry breaking in circular quantum dots. We explain that the anisotropic static Wigner molecule ground states frequently observed in simulations are created by interference effects that occur even in the non-interacting limit. They have nothing in common with the interaction-driven crystallization of the uniform electron gas described by Wigner. This leads us to define the term Wigner molecule more carefully, via a finite analog of the spontaneous symmetry breaking that arises in the homogeneous electron gas when the interactions are strong. According to this definition, the charge density patterns characteristic of true interaction-induced Wigner molecules can only be seen if a small symmetry-breaking perturbation is applied to a strongly interacting quantum dot. A simple argument based on separation of variables into center-of-mas and internal coordinates shows that the strength of the perturbation required to produce a finite effect on the density tends to zero in the limit as the strength of the interaction tends to infinity. We confirm computationally that interaction-induced Wigner molecules satisfying these two criteria exist. The neural-network variational Monte Carlo method used in our simulations proves more accurate than the coupled cluster and diffusion Monte Carlo methods employed in previous benchmark calculations of quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Spin-fermion coupling enhances pairing in the pseudogap regime of the hole-doped Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a fluctuation analysis of the pairing interaction in the hole-doped Hubbard model within the dynamical cluster approximation. Our analysis reveals that spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing differs qualitatively in the over- and underdoped regimes. In the underdoped regime spin fluctuations open a pseudogap. We show that in this regime the spin-fermion coupling mediates a giant attraction between antinodal fermions. As a consequence, despite the lack of coherent fermionic quasiparticles, a strong superconducting pairing is sustained down to small dopings.</description>

      <title>Korteweg de-Vries Dynamics at the Edge of Laughlin State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show that the edge dynamics of the Laughlin state in the weakly nonlinear regime is governed by the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. Our starting point is the Chern-Simons-Ginzburg-Landau theory in the lower half-plane, where the effective edge dynamics are encoded in anomaly-compatible boundary conditions. The saddle point bulk dynamics and the corresponding boundary conditions of this action can be reformulated as two-dimensional compressible fluid dynamic equations, subject to a quantum Hall constraint that links the superfluid vorticity to its density fluctuations. The boundary conditions in this hydrodynamic framework consist of no-penetration and no-stress conditions. We then apply the method of multiple scales to this hydrodynamic system and derive the KdV equation for the edge dynamics in the weakly nonlinear regime. By employing the Hamiltonian framework for the KdV equation, we show that we can recover the chiral Luttinger liquid theory in the linearized regime and provide a pathway for canonically quantizing the edge dynamics in the weakly non-linear limit.</description>

      <title>Topological ground state degeneracy of the two-channel Kondo lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are indications from the large-N analysis that multi-channel Kondo lattices have topological order. We use the coupled-wire construction to study the channel paramagnetic regime of a two-channel Kondo lattice model of spin-1/2 SU(2) spins. Using abelian bosonization we show that in presence of particle-hole symmetry, each wire is described by a [SO(5)$\times$Ising]/Z$_2\times$ SU(2) symmetric theory. When the wires are coupled together and the time-reversal symmetry is broken, the system exhibits topological order with fractional edge states and anyonic excitations. By an explicit construction of the Heisenberg algebra acting on the ground state manifold, we demonstrate that in presence of particle-hole symmetry, the ground state on a torus is eight-fold degenerate. This is also discussed using a heuristic approach which is applicable to other topologically ordered states.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We show that there exists a natural analogue of the Yang-Mills equations using the Fr\"olicher-Nijenhuis bracket between vector-valued differential forms. The gauge field is a rank-two tensor, and when one constrains it to be symmetric, then the system exhibits fractonic behaviours. In the linearised limit, the constrained equations of motion reduce to those of the covariant fracton model [Bertolini-Maggiore 2022].</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the standard bulk-boundary correspondence does not hold for non-Hermitian systems in which also new phenomena such as exceptional points do occur. Here we study by analytical and numerical means a paradigmatic one-dimensional non-Hermitian model with dimerization, asymmetric hopping, and imaginary staggered potentials. We present analytical solutions for the eigenspectrum of this model with both open and closed boundary conditions as well as for the singular-value spectrum. We explicitly demonstrate the proper bulk-boundary correspondence between topological winding numbers in the periodic case and singular values in the open case. We also show that a non-trivial topology leads to protected eigenvalues in the entanglement spectrum. In the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric case, we find that the model has a phase where exceptional points become dense in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

We consider the 3-orbital (per Cr site) model, containing only $t_{2g}$ states, the $5$-orbital model, including all $d$-states, as well as the model including also the oxygen $p$-states. Using the recently proposed approach of calculation of exchange interactions in paramagnetic phase, we extract exchange interaction parameters and magnon dispersions for these models. While the magnon dispersion in the 3-orbital model possesses negative branches in accordance with previous studies in ferromagnetic phase, this drawback is removed in the $5$-orbital model. The model including oxygen states (with purely local interaction at chromium sites) overestimates the exchange interactions and spin wave stiffness. While this overestimate is partly corrected by including non-local interaction between chromium and oxygen states within mean-field approximation, the $5$-orbital model appears as most adequate for describing magnetic properties of CrO$_2$ with local Coulomb interaction. The possibility of describing magnetic properties of this material starting from paramagnetic phase points to the correspondence of magnetic properties in this phase and ferromagnetic phase, as well as important contributions of double exchange in paramagnetic phase of CrO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Charge-Density-Wave State in Extremely Overdoped Cuprates Driven by Phonons</title>

Abstract: Recent resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) experiments revealed a novel charge order in extremely overdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LSCO) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131,116002]. The observed charge order appears around the $(\pi/3,0)$ wavevector, distinct from the well-known stripe fluctuations near 1/8 doping, and persists from cryogenic temperatures to room temperature. To investigate the origin of this charge order in the overdoped regime, we use determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations to examine correlated models with various interactions. We demonstrate that this distinctive CDW originates from remnant correlations in extremely overdoped cuprates, with its specific pattern shaped by interactions beyond the Hubbard model, particularly electron-phonon couplings. The persistence of the $(\pi/3,0)$ wavevector across different doping levels indicates the presence of nonlocal couplings. Our study reveals the significant role of phonons in cuprates, which assist correlated electrons in the formation of unconventional phases.</description>

      <title>Signatures of metal to insulator crossover in the repulsive Fermi Hubbard model through static correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cold atom systems provide a rich platform to realize strongly interacting condensed matter systems, and recent progress in fluorescence imaging technique has enabled identification of nontrivial doublon, singlon, and holon correlation functions. We show that these correlators can be used to identify the conditions under which local moments form in an interacting electronic system. Toward this end, we report a Determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) study of such correlation functions in the two-dimensional repulsive Fermi Hubbard model on a square lattice as a function of doping, interaction strength and temperature. We find definite signatures of the crossover from small U(band regime) to large U(correlated insulator regime). Our key findings are: (1) An opening of a charge gap in the thermodynamic density of states is accompanied by the appearance of temperature insensitive points in the equation of state at finite doping, which can be used to distinguish the band regime in cold atom experiments. (2) Nearest neighbor doublon holon correlations track the opening of charge gap; these compete with density correlations to generate moment moment correlations that show different behavior in the metallic and correlated insulator regime. (3) Non local correlation functions can be used to distinguish between the two regimes, both at and away from half filling. Our results allow comparisons of different correlation functions with recent experimental findings and guide further experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Paired fermions in strong magnetic fields and daughters of even-denominator Hall plateaus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent quantum Hall experiments have observed `daughter states' next to several plateaus at half-integer filling factors in various platforms. These states were first proposed based on model wavefunctions for the Moore-Read state by Levin and Halperin. We show that these daughters and their parents belong to an extensive family tree that encompasses all pairing channels and permits a unified description in terms of weakly interacting composite fermions. Each daughter represents a bosonic integer quantum Hall state formed by composite-fermion pairs. The pairing of the parent dictates an additional number of filled composite-fermion Landau levels. We support our field-theoretic composite-fermion treatment by using the K-matrix formalism, analysis of trial wavefunctions, and a coupled-wire construction. Our analysis yields the topological orders, quantum numbers, and experimental signatures of all daughters of paired states at half-filling and `next-generation' even-denominators. Crucially, no two daughters share the same two parents. The unique parentage implies that Hall conductance measurements alone could pinpoint the topological order of even-denominator plateaus. Additionally, we propose a numerically suitable trial wavefunction for one daughter of the SU(2)$_2$ topological order, which arises at filling factor $\nu=\frac{6}{11}$. Finally, our insights explain experimentally observed features of transitions in wide-quantum wells, such as suppression of the Jain states with the simultaneous development of half-filled and daughter states.</description>

      <title>Topological chiral superconductivity beyond paring in Fermi-liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a mechanism to produce superconductivity by strong purely repulsive interactions, without using paring instability in Fermi-liquid. The resulting superconductors break both time-reversal and reflection symmetries in the orbital motion of electrons, and exhibit non-trivial topological order. Our findings suggest that this topological chiral superconductivity is more likely to emerge near or between fully spin-valley polarized metallic phase and Wigner crystal phase. Unlike conventional BCS superconductors in fully spin-valley polarized metals, these topological chiral superconductors are only partially spin-valley polarized, even though the neighboring normal state remains fully spin-valley polarized. The ratios of electron densities associated with different spin-valley quantum numbers are quantized as simple rational numbers. Furthermore, many of these topological chiral superconductors exhibit charge-4 or higher condensation. One of the topological chiral superconductors is in the same phase as the "spin"-triplet $p+ \textrm{i} p$ BCS superconductor, while others are in different phases than any BCS superconductors. The same mechanism is also used to produce anyon superconductivity between fractional anomalous quantum Hall states in the presence of a periodic potential.</description>

      <title>Thermal Purcell effect and cavity-induced renormalization of dissipations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years there has been great interest towards optical cavities as a tool to manipulate the properties and phases of embedded quantum materials. Due to the Purcell effect, a cavity changes the photon phase space and thus the rate of electromagnetic transitions within the material, modifying the exchange rate of heat radiation with the photon environment. Here, I derive a simple expression for the radiative heat power absorbed by the material, investigate how it changes in the presence of a cavity and show that it is enhanced dramatically for appropriate cavity geometries. I compare this effect with typical energy dissipation processes, provide a criterion to establish its impact on the temperature of a material coupled to the cavity and apply it to 1T-TaS$_2$.</description>

      <title>On AdS$_3$/ICFT$_2$ with a dynamical scalar field located on the brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exploit holographic duality to study the system of a one-dimensional interface contacting two semi-infinite two-dimensional CFTs. Central to our investigation is the introduction of a dynamical scalar field located on the bulk interface brane which breaks the scaling symmetry of the dual interface field theory, along with its consequential backreaction on the system. We define an interface entropy from holographic entanglement entropy. At zero temperature we construct several illustrative examples and observe that the $g$-theorem is always satisfied. These examples also reveal distinct features of the interface entropy that are intricately linked to the scalar potential profiles. At finite temperature we find that the dynamical scalar field enables the bulk theory to have new configurations which would be infeasible solely with a tension term on the interface brane.</description>

      <title>Integrals of Products of Bessel Functions: An Insight from the Physics of Bloch Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08155v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrals of products of Bessel functions exhibit an intriguing feature: under certain conditions on the parameters specifying the integrand, they vanish identically. We provide a physical interpretation of this feature in the context of both single-particle and many-body properties of electrons on a lattice (``Bloch electrons''), namely, in terms of their density of states and umklapp scattering rate. (In an umklapp event, the change in the momentum of two colliding electrons is equal to a reciprocal lattice vector, which gives rise to a finite resistivity due to electron-electron interaction.) In this context, the vanishing of an integral follows simply from the condition that either the density of states vanishes due to the electron energy lying outside the band in which free propagation of electron waves is allowed, or that an umklapp process is kinematically forbidden due to the Fermi surface being smaller than a critical value.</description>

      <title>Covariant Jacobi-Legendre expansion for total energy calculations within the projector-augmented-wave formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning models can be trained to predict the converged electron charge density of a density functional theory (DFT) calculation. In general, the value of the density at a given point in space is invariant under global translations and rotations having that point as a centre. Hence, one can construct locally invariant machine-learning density predictors. However, the widely used projector augmented wave (PAW) implementation of DFT requires the evaluation of the one-center augmentation contributions, that are not rotationally invariant. Building on our recently proposed Jacobi-Legendre charge-density scheme, we construct a covariant Jacobi-Legendre model capable of predicting the local occupancies needed to compose the augmentation charge density. Our formalism is then applied to the prediction of the energy barrier for the 1H-to-1T phase transition of two-dimensional MoS$_2$. With extremely modest training, the model is capable of performing a non-self-consistent nudged elastic band calculation at virtually the same accuracy as a fully DFT-converged one, thus saving thousands of self-consistent DFT steps. Furthermore, at variance with machine-learning force fields, the charge density is here available for any nudged elastic band image, so that we can trace the evolution of the electronic structure across the phase transition.</description>
