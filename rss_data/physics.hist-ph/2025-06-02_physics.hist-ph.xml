      <title>On the Physical Untenability of the Standard Notion of Quantum State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of quantum state plays a fundamental role within the Standard account of Quantum Mechanics (SQM) as established by Dirac and von Neumann during 1930s and up to the present. In this work we expose the deep inconsistencies that exist within the multiple definitions of the notion of quantum state that are provided within this axiomatic formulation. As we will argue, these different inconsistent definitions continue to be -- even today -- uncritically confused within the mainstream physical and philosophical literature leading to self-contradictory statements and wrong conclusions. We end with a discussion regarding the untenability of this concept for any rational understanding of theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Reassessing the strength of a class of Wigner's friend no-go theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two recent, prominent theorems--the "no-go theorem for observer-independent facts" and the "Local Friendliness no-go theorem"--employ so-called extended Wigner's friend scenarios to try to impose novel, non-trivial constraints on the possible nature of physical reality. While the former is argued to entail that there can be no theory in which the results of Wigner and his friend can both be considered objective, the latter is said to place on reality stronger constraints than the Bell and Kochen-Specker theorems. Here, I conduct a thorough analysis of these theorems and show that they suffer from a list of shortcomings that question their validity and limit their strength. I conclude that the "no-go theorem for observer-independent facts" and the "Local Friendliness no-go theorem" fail to impose significant constraints on the nature of physical reality.</description>
