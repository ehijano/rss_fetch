      <title>Counting of lattices containing up to four comparable reducible elements and having nullity up to three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2020 Bhavale and Waphare introduced the concept of a nullity of a poset as nullity of its cover graph. According to Bhavale and Waphare, if a dismantlable lattice of nullity k contains r reducible elements then 2 $\leq$ r $\leq$ 2k. In 2003 Pawar and Waphare counted all non-isomorphic lattices with equal number of elements and edges, which are precisely the lattices of nullity one. Recently, Bhavale and Aware counted all non-isomorphic lattices on n elements having nullity up to two. Bhavale and Aware also counted all non-isomorphic lattices on n elements, containing up to three reducible elements, having nullity k $\geq$ 2. In this paper, we count up to isomorphism the class of all lattices on n elements containing four comparable reducible elements, and having nullity three.</description>

      <title>Frequent elements in union-closed set families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Union-Closed Sets Conjecture asks whether every union-closed set family $\mathcal{F}$ has an element contained in $\frac12 |\mathcal{F}|$ of its sets. In 2022, Nagel posed a generalisation of this problem, suggesting that the $k$th most popular element in a union-closed set family must be contained in at least $\frac{1}{2^{k-1} + 1} |\mathcal{F}|$ sets.
  We combine the entropic method of Gilmer with the combinatorial arguments of Knill to show that this is indeed the case for all $k \ge 3$, and when $k = 2$ and either $|\mathcal{F}| \le 44$ or $|\mathcal{F}| \ge 114$, and characterise the families that achieve equality.
  Furthermore, we show that when $|\mathcal{F}| \to \infty$, the $k$th most frequent element will appear in at least $\left( \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - o(1) \right) |\mathcal{F}|$ sets, reflecting the recent progress made for the Union-Closed Set Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Further analysis on the second frequency of union-closed set families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Union-Closed Sets Conjecture, also known as Frankl's conjecture, asks whether, for any union-closed set family $\mathcal{F}$ with $m$ sets, there is an element that lies in at least $\frac{1}{2}\cdot m$ sets in $\mathcal{F}$. In 2022, Nagel posed a stronger conjecture that within any union-closed family whose ground set size is at least $k$, there are always $k$ elements in the ground set that appear in at least $\frac{1}{2^{k-1}+1}$ proportion of the sets in the family.
  Das and Wu showed that this conjecture is true for $k\geq 3$ and $k=2$ if $|\mathcal{F}|$ is outside a particular range. In this companion paper, we analyse further when $\mathcal{F}$ fails Nagel's conjecture for $k=2$ via linear programming.</description>

      <title>Sparse graphs with an independent or foresty minimum vertex cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A connected graph is called fragile if it contains an independent vertex cut. In 2002 Chen and Yu proved that every connected graph of order $n$ and size at most $2n-4$ is fragile, and in 2013 Le and Pfender characterized the non-fragile graphs of order $n$ and size $2n-3.$ It is natural to consider minimum vertex cuts. We prove two results. (1) Every connected graph of order $n$ with $n\ge 7$ and size at most $\lfloor 3n/2\rfloor$ has an independent minimum vertex cut; (2) every connected graph of order $n$ with $n\ge 7$ and size at most $2n$ has a foresty minimum vertex cut. Both results are best possible.</description>

      <title>On $P$-partitions Extended by Two-Rowed Plane Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Gansner's elegant $k$-trace generating function for rectangular plane partitions, we introduce two novel operators, $\varphi_{z}$ and $\psi_{z}$, along with their combinatorial interpretations. Through these operators, we derive a new formula for $P$-partitions of posets extended by two-rowed plane partitions. This formula allows us to compute explicit enumerative generating functions for various classes of $P$-partitions. Our findings encompass skew plane partitions, diamond-related two-rowed plane partitions, an extended $V$-poset, and ladder poset extensions, enriching the theory of $P$-partitions.</description>

      <title>A note on infinite versions of $(p,q)$-theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that fractional Helly and $(p,q)$-theorems imply $(\aleph_0,q)$-theorems in an entirely abstract setting. We give a plethora of applications, including reproving almost all earlier $(\aleph_0,q)$-theorems about geometric hypergraphs that were proved recently. Some of the corollaries are new results, for example, we prove that if $\mathcal{F}$ is an infinite family of convex compact sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and among every $\aleph_0$ of the sets some $d+1$ contain a point in their intersection with integer coordinates, then all the members of $\mathcal{F}$ can be hit with finitely many points with integer coordinates.</description>

Abstract: Pin sequences play an important role in the structural study of permutation classes. In this paper, we study the permutation classes that comprise all the finite subpermutations contained in an infinite pin sequence. We prove that these permutation classes have proper growth rates and establish a procedure for calculating these growth rates.</description>

      <title>WalkSAT is linear on random 2-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an influential article Papadimitriou [FOCS 1991] proved that a local search algorithm called WalkSAT finds a satisfying assignment of a satisfiable 2-CNF with $n$ variables in $O(n^2)$ expected time. Variants of the WalkSAT algorithm have become a mainstay of practical SAT solving (e.g., [Hoos and St\"utzle 2000]). In the present article we analyse the expected running time of WalkSAT on random 2-SAT instances. Answering a question raised by Alekhnovich and Ben-Sasson [SICOMP 2007], we show that WalkSAT runs in linear expected time for all clause/variable densities up to the random 2-SAT satisfiability threshold.</description>

      <title>A note on high-dimensional discrepancy of subtrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a tree $T$ and a function $f \colon E(T)\to \mathbb{S}^d$, the imbalance of a subtree $T'\subseteq T$ is given by $|\sum_{e \in E(T')} f(e)|$. The $d$-dimensional discrepancy of the tree $T$ is the minimum, over all functions $f$ as above, of the maximum imbalance of a subtree of $T$. We prove tight asymptotic bounds for the discrepancy of a tree $T$, confirming a conjecture of Krishna, Michaeli, Sarantis, Wang and Wang. We also settle a related conjecture on oriented discrepancy of subtrees by the same authors.</description>

      <title>On Local Irregularity Conjecture for 2-multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multigraph in which adjacent vertices have different degrees is called locally irregular. The locally irregular edge coloring is an edge coloring of a multigraph $G$ in which every color induces a locally irregular submultigraph of $G$. We denote by $\operatorname{lir}(G)$ the locally irregular chromatic index of a multigraph $G$, which is the smallest number of colors required in a locally irregular edge coloring of $G$, given that such a coloring of $G$ exists. By $^2G$ we denote a 2-multigraph obtained from a simple graph $G$ by doubling each its edge. In 2022 Grzelec and Wo\'zniak conjectured that $\operatorname{lir}(^2G) \leq 2$ for every connected simple graph $G$ different from $K_2$; the conjecture is known as Local Irregularity Conjecture for 2-multigraphs. In this paper, we prove this conjecture in the case of regular graphs, split graphs, and some particular families of subcubic graphs. Moreover, we provide a constant upper bound on the locally irregular chromatic index of planar 2-multigraphs (except for $^2K_2$), and we obtain a better constant upper bound on $\operatorname{lir}(^2G)$ if $G$ is a simple subcubic graph different from $K_2$. In the proofs, special decompositions of graphs and the relation of Local Irregularity Conjecture to the well-known 1-2-3 Conjecture are utilized.</description>

      <title>Counter Example to a Strong Matroid Minor Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main result of this note asserts that a strong form of the Matroid Minor Conjecture due to J. Draisma is not true, i.e., there exist properly ascending chains of $S_\infty$-stable ideals in the affine coordinate ring of the affine infinite Grassmannian, where $S_\infty$ is the infinite symmetric group. In fact, we explicitly construct such an ascending chain. His conjectures on topological noetherian property for the affine infinite Grassmannian remain open though.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph burning, matchings, and zero forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lazy burning is a recently introduced variation of burning where only one set of vertices is chosen to burn in the first round. In hypergraphs, lazy burning spreads when all but one vertex in a hyperedge is burned. The lazy burning number is the minimum number of initially burned vertices that eventually burns all vertices. We give several equivalent characterizations of lazy burning on hypergraphs using matchings and zero forcing, and then apply these to give new bounds and complexity results.
  We prove that the lazy burning number of a hypergraph $H$ equals its order minus the maximum cardinality of a certain matching on its incidence graph. Using this characterization, we give a formula for the lazy burning number of a dual hypergraph and give new bounds on the lazy burning number based on various hypergraph parameters. We show that the lazy burning number of a hypergraph may be characterized by a maximal subhypergraph that results from iteratively deleting vertices in singleton hyperedges.
  We prove that lazy burning on a hypergraph is equivalent to zero forcing on its incidence graph and show an equivalence between skew zero forcing on a graph and lazy burning on its neighborhood hypergraph. As a result, we show that finding an upper bound on the lazy burning number of a hypergraph is NP-complete, which resolves a conjecture from \cite{BJR}. By applying lazy burning, we show that computing an upper bound on the skew zero forcing number for bipartite graphs is NP-complete. We finish with open problems.</description>

      <title>On high genus extensions of Negami's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negami's famous planar cover conjecture is equivalent to the statement that a connected graph can be embedded in the projective plane if and only if it has a projective planar cover. In 1999, Hlin\v{e}n\'y proposed extending this conjecture to higher genus non-orientable surfaces. In this paper, we put forward a natural extension that encompasses orientable surfaces as well; for every compact surface $\Sigma$, a connected graph $G$ has a finite cover embeddable in $\Sigma$ if and only if $G$ is embeddable in a surface covered by $\Sigma$.
  As evidence toward this, we prove that for every surface $\Sigma$, the connected graphs with a finite cover embeddable in $\Sigma$ have bounded Euler genus. Moreover, we show that these extensions of Negami's conjecture are decidable for every compact surface of sufficiently large Euler genus, surpassing what is known for Negami's original conjecture. We also prove the natural analogue for countable graphs embeddable into a compact (orientable) surface. More precisely, we prove that a connected countable graph $G$ has a finite ply cover that embeds into a compact (orientable) surface if and only if $G$ embeds into a compact (orientable) surface.
  Our most general theorem, from which these results are derived, is that there is a constant $c&gt;0$ such that for every surface $\Sigma$, there exists a decreasing function $p_\Sigma:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with $\lim_{g\to \infty}p_\Sigma(g) =0$ such that every finite cover embeddable in $\Sigma$ of any connected graph with Euler genus $g\ge c$ has ply at most $p_\Sigma(g)$.</description>

Abstract: For the Hamming graph $H(n,q)$, where a $q$ is a constant prime power and $n$ grows, we construct perfect colorings without non-essential arguments such that $n$ depends exponentially on the off-diagonal part of the quotient matrix. In particular, we construct unbalanced Boolean ($q=2$) functions such that the number of essential arguments depends exponentially on the degree of the function.</description>

      <title>Arrangements of small circles for Morse-Bott functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a topic of mathematics, "arrangements", systems of hyperplanes, circles, and general (regular) submanifolds, attract us strongly. We present a natural elementary study of arrangements of circles. It is also a kind of new studies. Our study is closely related to geometry and singularity theory of Morse(-Bott) functions. Regions surrounded by circles are regarded as images of real algebraic maps and composing them with projections gives Morse-Bott functions: this observation is natural, and surprisingly, recently presented first, by the author. We present a new way of their construction.
  We present a systematic way of constructing such arrangements by choosing small circles centered at existing circles inductively. We are interested in graphs the regions surrounded by the circles naturally collapse. They are essentially so-called Reeb graphs of the previous Morse-Bott functions: they are spaces of all components of preimages of single points for the functions.</description>

      <title>Some ergodic theorems involving Omega function and their applications</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we build some ergodic theorems involving function $\Omega$, where $\Omega(n)$ denotes the number of prime factors of a natural number $n$ counted with multiplicities. As a combinatorial application, it is shown that for any $k\in \mathbb{N}$ and every $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ with positive upper Banach density, there are $a,d\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $$a,a+d,\ldots,a+kd,a+\Omega(d)\in A.$$</description>

      <title>Relationship between mis\`ere NIM and two-player GOISHI HIROI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In combinatorial game theory, there are two famous winning conventions, normal play and mis\`ere play. Under normal play convention, the winner is the player who moves last and under mis\`ere play convention, the loser is the player who moves last. The difference makes these conventions completely different, and usually, games under mis\`ere play convention is much difficult to analyze than games under normal play convention. In this study, we show an interesting relationship between rulesets under different winning conventions; we can determine the winner of two-player GOISHI HIROI under normal play convention by using NIM under mis\`ere play convention. We also analyze two-player GOISHI HIROI under mis\`ere play convention.</description>

      <title>Extending Robinson Spaces: Complexity and Algorithmic Solutions for Non-Symmetric Dissimilarity Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the concept of Robinson spaces to asymmetric dissimilarities, enhancing their applicability in representing and analyzing complex data. Within this generalized framework, we introduce two different problems that extend the classical seriation problem: an optimization problem and a decision problem. We establish that these problems are NP-hard and NP-complete, respectively. Despite this complexity results, we identify several non-trivial instances where these problems can be solved in polynomial time, providing valuable insights into their tractability.</description>

      <title>Robust Contraction Decomposition for Minor-Free Graphs and its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a robust contraction decomposition theorem for $H$-minor-free graphs, which states that given an $H$-minor-free graph $G$ and an integer $p$, one can partition in polynomial time the vertices of $G$ into $p$ sets $Z_1,\dots,Z_p$ such that $\operatorname{tw}(G/(Z_i \setminus Z')) = O(p + |Z'|)$ for all $i \in [p]$ and $Z' \subseteq Z_i$. Here, $\operatorname{tw}(\cdot)$ denotes the treewidth of a graph and $G/(Z_i \setminus Z')$ denotes the graph obtained from $G$ by contracting all edges with both endpoints in $Z_i \setminus Z'$.
  Our result generalizes earlier results by Klein [SICOMP 2008] and Demaine et al. [STOC 2011] based on partitioning $E(G)$, and some recent theorems for planar graphs by Marx et al. [SODA 2022], for bounded-genus graphs (more generally, almost-embeddable graphs) by Bandyapadhyay et al. [SODA 2022], and for unit-disk graphs by Bandyapadhyay et al. [SoCG 2022].
  The robust contraction decomposition theorem directly results in parameterized algorithms with running time $2^{\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k})} \cdot n^{O(1)}$ or $n^{O(\sqrt{k})}$ for every vertex/edge deletion problems on $H$-minor-free graphs that can be formulated as Permutation CSP Deletion or 2-Conn Permutation CSP Deletion. Consequently, we obtain the first subexponential-time parameterized algorithms for Subset Feedback Vertex Set, Subset Odd Cycle Transversal, Subset Group Feedback Vertex Set, 2-Conn Component Order Connectivity on $H$-minor-free graphs. For other problems which already have subexponential-time parameterized algorithms on $H$-minor-free graphs (e.g., Odd Cycle Transversal, Vertex Multiway Cut, Vertex Multicut, etc.), our theorem gives much simpler algorithms of the same running time.</description>

      <title>Partial Betti splittings with applications to binomial edge ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a partial Betti splitting of a homogeneous ideal, generalizing the notion of a Betti splitting first given by Francisco, H\`a, and Van Tuyl. Given a homogeneous ideal $I$ and two ideals $J$ and $K$ such that $I = J+K$, a partial Betti splitting of $I$ relates some of the graded Betti of $I$ with those of $J, K$, and $J\cap K$. As an application, we focus on the partial Betti splittings of binomial edge ideals. Using this new technique, we generalize results of Saeedi Madani and Kiani related to binomial edge ideals with cut edges, we describe a partial Betti splitting for all binomial edge ideals, and we compute the total second Betti number of binomial edge ideals of trees.</description>

      <title>The critical Karp--Sipser core of Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Karp--Sipser algorithm consists in removing recursively the leaves as well their unique neighbours and all isolated vertices of a given graph. The remaining graph obtained when there is no leaf left is called the Karp--Sipser core. When the underlying graph is the classical sparse Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph $ \mathrm{G}[n, \lambda/n]$, it is known to exhibit a phase transition at $\lambda = \mathrm{e}$. We show that at criticality, the Karp--Sipser core has size of order $n^{3/5}$, which proves a conjecture of Bauer and Golinelli. We provide the asymptotic law of this renormalized size as well as a description of the distribution of the core as a graph. Our approach relies on the differential equation method, and builds up on a previous work on a configuration model with bounded degrees.</description>

      <title>Packing colourings in complete bipartite graphs and the inverse problem for correspondence packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applications of graph colouring often involve taking restrictions into account, and it is desirable to have multiple (disjoint) solutions. In the optimal case, where there is a partition into disjoint colourings, we speak of a packing. However, even for complete bipartite graphs, the list chromatic number can be arbitrarily large, and its exact determination is generally difficult. For the packing variant, this question becomes even harder.
  In this paper, we study the correspondence- and list packing numbers of (asymmetric) complete bipartite graphs. In the most asymmetric cases, Latin squares come into play. Our results show that every $z \in \mathbb Z^+ \setminus {3}$ can be equal to the correspondence packing number of a graph. Additionally, we disprove a recent conjecture that relates the list packing number and the list flexibility number.</description>

      <title>The cycle double cover conjecture from the perspective of percolation theory on iterated line graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cycle double cover conjecture is a long standing problem in graph theory, which links local properties, the valency of a vertex and no bridges, and a global property of the graph, being covered by a particular set of cycles. We tackle this problem via an interpretation motivated by notions from percolation theory. Our approach consists in a lift of walks and cycles in $G$ to sets of open and closed edges on $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{L}(G))$, the line graph of the line graph of $G$. We exploit that triangles are preserved by the line graph operator to obtain a one-to-one mapping from walks in the underlying graph $G$ to walks on $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{L}(G))$ minus a certain subset of its triangles. The final argument is then inspired by percolation theory, using and flipping $\lbrace 0,1\rbrace$ labels on the resulting object to open or block specific edges in $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{L}(G))$ to be traversed by a walk. We prove that there is a labeling such that its projection back to $G$ implies a double cycle cover, if $G$ is an simple bridgeless triangle-free cubic graph.</description>

      <title>List Packing and Correspondence Packing of Planar Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G$ and a list assignment $L$ with $|L(v)|=k$ for all $v$, an $L$-packing consists of $L$-colorings $\varphi_1,\cdots,\varphi_k$ such that $\varphi_i(v)\ne\varphi_j(v)$ for all $v$ and all distinct $i,j\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$. Let $\chi^{\star}_{\ell}(G)$ denote the smallest $k$ such that $G$ has an $L$-packing for every $L$ with $|L(v)|=k$ for all $v$. Let $\mathcal{P}_k$ denote the set of all planar graphs with girth at least $k$. We show that (i) $\chi^{\star}_{\ell}(G)\le 8$ for all $G\in \mathcal{P}_3$ and (ii) $\chi^{\star}_{\ell}(G)\le 5$ for all $G\in \mathcal{P}_4$ and (iii) $\chi^{\star}_{\ell}(G)\le 4$ for all $G\in \mathcal{P}_5$. Part (i) makes progress on a problem of Cambie, Cames van Batenburg, Davies, and Kang. We also construct outerplanar graphs $G$ such that $\chi^{\star}_{\ell}(G)=4$, which matches the known upper bound $\chi^{\star}_{\ell}(G)\le 4$ for all outerplanar graphs. Finally, we consider the analogue of $\chi^{\star}_{\ell}$ for correspondence coloring, $\chi^{\star}_c$. In fact, all bounds stated above for $\chi^{\star}_{\ell}$ also hold for $\chi^{\star}_c$.</description>

      <title>Sublinear hitting sets for some geometric graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an $n$-vertex graph $G$, let $h(G)$ denote the smallest size of a subset of $V(G)$ such that it intersects every maximum independent set of $G$. A conjecture posed by Bollob\'{a}s, Erd\H{o}s and Tuza in early 90s remains widely open, asserting that for any $n$-vertex graph $G$, if the independence number $\alpha(G) =\Omega(n) $, then $h(G) = o(n)$. In this paper, we establish the validity of this conjecture for various classes of graphs, Our main contributions include: \begin{enumerate}
  \item We provide a novel unified framework to find sub-linear hitting sets for graphs with certain locally sparse properties. Based on this framework, we can find hitting sets of size at most $O(\frac{n}{\log{n}})$ in any $n$-vertex even-hole-free graph (in particular, chordal graph) and in any $n$-vertex disk graph, with linear independence numbers.
  \item Utilizing geometric observations and combinatorial arguments, we show that any $n$-vertex circle graph $G$ with linear independence number satisfies $h(G)\le O(\sqrt{n})$. Moreover, we extend this methodology to more general classes of graphs.
  \item We show the conjecture holds for those hereditary graphs having sublinear balanced separators. \end{enumerate}
  We also show that $h(G)$ can be upper bounded by constants for several sporadic families of graphs with large independence numbers.</description>

      <title>Ollivier-Ricci curvature of regular graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive explicit formulas for the Lin-Lu-Yau curvature and the Ollivier-Ricci curvature in terms of graph parameters and an optimal assignment. Utilizing these precise expressions, we examine the relationship between the Lin-Lu-Yau curvature and the 0-Ollivier-Ricci curvature, resulting in an equality condition on regular graphs. This condition allows us to characterize edges that are bone idle in regular graphs of girth four and to construct a family of bone idle graphs with this girth. We then use our formulas to provide an efficient implementation of the Ollivier-Ricci curvature on regular graphs, enabling us to identify all bone idle, regular graphs with fewer than 15 vertices. Moreover, we establish a rigidity theorem for cocktail party graphs, proving that a regular graph is a cocktail party graph if and only if its Lin-Lu-Yau curvature is equal to one. Furthermore, we present a condition on the degree of a regular graph that guarantees positive Ricci curvature. We conclude this work by discussing the maximal number of vertices that a regular graph of fixed degree with positive Lin-Lu-Yau curvature can have.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every tree on $n$ edges decomposes $K_{nx,nx}$ and $K_{2nx + 1}$ for all positive integers $x$. The said decompositions are obtained by proving that every tree admits a $\vec{\beta}$-labeling (oriented beta-labeling). Our proof employs the polynomial method by identifying trees as functions in the transformation monoid $\mathbb{Z}_n^{\mathbb{Z}_n}$. A proof of the graceful tree conjecture (1967) follows as an immediate consequence of the current result. Finally, we introduce additional algebraic properties derived from the decomposition results.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits on 2-regular circulant digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic orbits (equivalence classes of closed cycles up to cyclic shifts) play an important role in applications of graph theory. For example, they appear in the definition of the Ihara zeta function and exact trace formulae for the spectra of quantum graphs. Circulant graphs are Cayley graphs of $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Here we consider directed Cayley graphs with two generators (2-regular Cayley digraphs). We determine the number of primitive periodic orbits of a given length (total number of directed edges) in terms of the number of times edges corresponding to each generator appear in the periodic orbit (the step count). Primitive periodic orbits are those periodic orbits that cannot be written as a repetition of a shorter orbit. We describe the lattice structure of lengths and step counts for which periodic orbits exist and characterize the repetition number of a periodic orbit by its winding number (the sum of the step sequence divided by the number of vertices) and the repetition number of its step sequence. To obtain these results, we also evaluate the number of Lyndon words on an alphabet of two letters with a given length and letter count.</description>

      <title>On large Sidon sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Sidon set $M$ is a subset of $\mathbb{F}_2^t$ such that the sum of four distinct elements of $M$ is never 0. The goal is to find Sidon sets of large size. In this note we show that the graphs of almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions with high linearity can be used to construct large Sidon sets. Thanks to recently constructed APN functions $\mathbb{F}_2^8\to \mathbb{F}_2^8$ with high linearity, we can construct Sidon sets of size 192 in $\mathbb{F}_2^{15}$, where the largest sets so far had size 152. Using the inverse and the Dobbertin function also gives larger Sidon sets as previously known. Each of the new large Sidon sets $M$ in $\mathbb{F}_2^t$ yields a binary linear code with $t$ check bits, minimum distance 5, and a length not known so far. Moreover, we improve the upper bound for the linearity of arbitrary APN functions.</description>

      <title>Demazure product and hopping in type D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Demazure product, also called the 0-Hecke product, is an associative operation on Coxeter groups with interesting properties and applications. In (Li et al 2024) it was shown that the Demazure product of two permutations can be described purely combinatorially: using only their one-line notation and not relying on reduced words. In this paper, we extend this to type D Coxeter groups.</description>

      <title>On the thresholds of degenerate hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $n$-vertex $k$-uniform hypergraph $G$ is $(d,\alpha)$-degenerate if $m_1(G)\le{d}$ and there exists a constant $\varepsilon &gt;0$ such that for every subset $U\subseteq{V(G)}$ with size $2\le|U|\le{\varepsilon n}$, we have $e\left(G[U]\right)\le{d\left(|U|-1\right)-\alpha}$. These hypergraphs include many natural graph classes, such as the degenerate hypergraphs, the planar graphs, and the power of cycles. In this paper, we consider the threshold of the emergence of a $(d,\alpha)$-degenerate hypergraph with bounded maximum degree in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model. We show that its threshold is at most $n^{-1/d}$, improving previous results of Riordan and Kelly-M\"uyesser-Pokrovskiy.</description>

      <title>Multisets with few special directions and small weight codewords in Desarguesian planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we tie together two well studied topics related to finite Desarguesian affine and projective planes. The first topic concerns directions determined by a set, or even a multiset, of points in an affine plane. The second topic concerns the linear code generated by the incidence matrix of a projective plane. We show how a multiset determining only $k$ special directions, in a modular sense, gives rise to a codeword whose support can be covered by $k$ concurrent lines. The reverse operation of going from a codeword to a multiset of points is trickier, but we describe a possible strategy and show some fruitful applications.
  Given a multiset of affine points, we use a bound on the degree of its so-called projection function to yield lower bounds on the number of special directions, both in an ordinary and in a modular sense.
  In the codes related to projective planes of prime order $p$, there exists an odd codeword, whose support is covered by 3 concurrent lines, but which is not a linear combination of these 3 lines. We generalise this codeword to codewords whose support is contained in an arbitrary number of concurrent lines. In case $p$ is large enough, this allows us to extend the classification of codewords from weight at most $4p-22$ to weight at most $5p-36$.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions of composition schemes: Mittag-Leffler and mixed Poisson distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.03751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multitudinous probabilistic and combinatorial objects are associated with generating functions satisfying a composition scheme $F(z)=G(H(z))$. The analysis becomes challenging when this scheme is critical (i.e., $G$ and $H$ are simultaneously singular). Motivated by many examples (random mappings, planar maps, directed lattice paths), we consider a natural extension of this scheme, namely $F(z,u)=G(u H(z))M(z)$. We also consider a variant of this scheme, which allows us to analyse the number of $H$-components of a given size in $F$.
  We prove that these two models lead to a rich world of limit laws, where we identify the key role played by a new universal law introduced in this article: the three-parameter Mittag-Leffler distribution, which is essentially the product of a beta and a Mittag-Leffler distribution. We also prove (double) phase transitions, additionally involving Boltzmann and mixed Poisson distributions, bringing a unified explanation of the associated thresholds. In all cases we obtain moment convergence and local limit theorems. We end with extensions of the critical composition scheme to a cycle scheme and to the multivariate case, leading to product distributions. Applications are presented for random walks, trees (supertrees of trees, increasingly labelled trees, preferential attachment trees), triangular P\'olya urns, and the Chinese restaurant process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03721v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct small resolutions of the moduli space $\overline{Q}_n$ of stable scaled $n$-marked lines of Ziltener and Ma'u--Woodward and of the moduli space $\overline{P}_n$ of stable $n$-marked ${\mathbb G}_a$-rational trees introduced in earlier work. The resolution of $\overline{P}_n$ is the augmented wonderful variety corresponding to the graphic matroid of the complete graph. The resolution of $\overline{Q}_n$ is a further blowup, also a wonderful model of an arrangement in ${\mathbb P}^{n-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the weighted KLRW algebras of finite type, and their cyclotomic quotients, are cellular algebras. The cellular bases are explicitly described using crystal graphs. As a special case, this proves that the KLR algebras of finite type are cellular. As one application, we give explicit formulas for the graded decomposition numbers of the cyclotomic algebras in level one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the anti-ferromagnetic Potts model on trees exhibits strong spatial mixing for a near-optimal range of parameters. Our work complements recent results of Chen, Liu, Mani, and Moitra [arXiv.2304.01954] who showed this to be true in the infinite temperature setting, corresponding to uniform proper colorings. We furthermore prove weak spatial mixing results complementing results in [arXiv.2304.01954].</description>

      <title>On de Bruijn Rings and Families of Almost Perfect Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: De Bruijn tori, or perfect maps, are two-dimensional periodic arrays of letters from a finite alphabet, where each possible pattern of shape (m,n) appears exactly once in a single period. While the existence of certain de Bruijn tori, such as square tori with odd m=n element {3,5,7} and even alphabet sizes, remains unresolved, sub-perfect maps are often sufficient in applications like positional coding. These maps capture a large number of patterns, with each appearing at most once. While previous methods for generating such sub-perfect maps cover only a fraction of the possible patterns, we present a construction method for generating almost perfect maps for arbitrary pattern shapes and arbitrary non-prime alphabet sizes, including the above mentioned square tori with odd m=n element {3,5,7} as long that the alphabet size is non-prime. This is achieved through the introduction of de Bruijn rings, a minimal-height sub-perfect map and a formalization of the concept of families of almost perfect maps. The generated sub-perfect maps are easily decodable which makes them perfectly suitable for positional coding applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cluster structures on spinor helicity and momentum twistor varieties which describe the kinematic spaces of massless scattering (with or without dual conformal symmetry). Both are instances of partial flag varieties. We exhibit embeddings of the corresponding cluster algebras into cluster algebras of sufficiently large Grassmannians and show how the former is obtained from the latter by freezing certain cluster variables and deleting some cluster variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if all the finite coset spaces of a polycyclic group have diameter bounded uniformly below by a polynomial in their size then the group is virtually nilpotent. We obtain the same conclusion for a finitely generated residually torsion-free nilpotent group under the weaker assumption that the finite quotient groups have diameter bounded uniformly below by a polynomial in their size. This extends work of Khukhro and Valette.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the equivariant cohomology classes of torus-equivariant subvarieties of the space of matrices. For a large class of torus actions, we prove that the polynomials representing these classes (up to suitably changing signs) are covolume polynomials in the sense of Aluffi. We study the cohomology rings of complex varieties in terms of Macaulay inverse systems over $\mathbb{Z}$. As applications, we show that under certain conditions, the Macaulay dual generator is a denormalized Lorentzian polynomial in the sense of Br\"and\'en and Huh, and we give a characteristic-free extension (over $\mathbb{Z}$) of the result of Khovanskii and Pukhlikov describing the cohomology ring of toric varieties in terms of volume polynomials.</description>
