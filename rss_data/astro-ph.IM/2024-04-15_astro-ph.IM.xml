      <title>2D probe of multi-parameter functions: an MCMC alternative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate multi-parameter functions by fixing all parameter values, but two. The temperature power spectrum of the lensed cosmic microwave background (CMB) serves as an example in which the amplitude, $A_{s}$, nears linearity at small deviations, reducing power spectra computation to a 1D problem. We apply the analysis to assess the shift in the apparent value of ${H_0}$ as a result of cosmic infrared background (CIB), and Poisson point sources (PS). By iteratively cycling through parameters paired with $A_{s}$, and within a few hundred calls for spectra, we derive values in agreement with Planck. We adjudge that when neither variable is linear, thousands of calls are required, still competitive with the MCMC method.</description>

      <title>Development of a data overflow protection system for Super-Kamiokande to maximize data from nearby supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos from very nearby supernovae, such as Betelgeuse, are expected to generate more than ten million events over 10\,s in Super-Kamokande (SK). At such large event rates, the buffers of the SK analog-to-digital conversion board (QBEE) will overflow, causing random loss of data that is critical for understanding the dynamics of the supernova explosion mechanism. In order to solve this problem, two new DAQ modules were developed to aid in the observation of very nearby supernovae. The first of these, the SN module, is designed to save only the number of hit PMTs during a supernova burst and the second, the Veto module, prescales the high rate neutrino events to prevent the QBEE from overflowing based on information from the SN module. In the event of a very nearby supernova, these modules allow SK to reconstruct the time evolution of the neutrino event rate from beginning to end using both QBEE and SN module data. This paper presents the development and testing of these modules together with an analysis of supernova-like data generated with a flashing laser diode. We demonstrate that the Veto module successfully prevents DAQ overflows for Betelgeuse-like supernovae as well as the long-term stability of the new modules. During normal running the Veto module is found to issue DAQ vetos a few times per month resulting in a total dead time less than 1\,ms, and does not influence ordinary operations. Additionally, using simulation data we find that supernovae closer than 800~pc will trigger Veto module resulting in a prescaling of the observed neutrino data.</description>

      <title>Keck Primary Mirror Closed-Loop Segment Control using a Vector-Zernike Wavefront Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first on-sky segmented primary mirror closed-loop piston control using a Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS) installed on the Keck II telescope. Segment co-phasing errors are a primary contributor to contrast limits on Keck and will be necessary to correct for the next generation of space missions and ground-based extremely large telescopes (ELTs), which will all have segmented primary mirrors. The goal of the ZWFS installed on Keck is to monitor and correct primary mirror co-phasing errors in parallel with science observations. The ZWFS is ideal for measuring phase discontinuities such as segment co-phasing errors and is one of the most sensitive WFS, but has limited dynamic range. The vector-ZWFS at Keck works on the adaptive optics (AO) corrected wavefront and consists of a metasurface focal plane mask which imposes two different phase shifts on the core of the point spread function (PSF) to two orthogonal light polarizations, producing two pupil images. This design extends the dynamic range compared with the scalar ZWFS. The primary mirror segment pistons were controlled in closed-loop using the ZWFS, improving the Strehl ratio on the NIRC2 science camera by up to 10 percentage points. We analyze the performance of the closed-loop tests, the impact on NIRC2 science data, and discuss the ZWFS measurements.</description>

      <title>Transient Classifiers for Fink: Benchmarks for LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera Rubin Observatory is expected to detect a few million transients per night, which will generate a live alert stream during the entire 10 years of the survey. This will be distributed via community brokers whose task is to select subsets of the stream and direct them to scientific communities. Given the volume and complexity of data, machine learning (ML) algorithms will be paramount for this task. We present the infrastructure tests and classification methods developed within the {\sc Fink} broker in preparation for LSST. This work aims to provide detailed information regarding the underlying assumptions, and methods, behind each classifier, enabling users to make informed follow-up decisions from {\sc Fink} photometric classifications. Using simulated data from the Extended LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC), we showcase the performance of binary and multi-class ML classifiers available in {\sc Fink}. These include tree-based classifiers coupled with tailored feature extraction strategies, as well as deep learning algorithms. We introduce the CBPF Alert Transient Search (CATS), a deep learning architecture specifically designed for this task. Results show that {\sc Fink} classifiers are able to handle the extra complexity which is expected from LSST data. CATS achieved $97\%$ accuracy on a multi-class classification while our best performing binary classifier achieve $99\%$ when classifying the Periodic class. ELAsTiCC was an important milestone in preparing {\sc Fink} infrastructure to deal with LSST-like data. Our results demonstrate that {\sc Fink} classifiers are well prepared for the arrival of the new stream; this experience also highlights that transitioning from current infrastructures to Rubin will require significant adaptation of currently available tools.</description>

      <title>Radioastrometry at different frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) technique allows us to determine positions of thousands of radio sources using the absolute astrometry approach. I have investigated the impact of a selection of observing frequencies in a range from 2 to 43 GHz in single-band, dual-band, and quad-band observing modes on astrometric results. I processed seven datasets in a range of 72 thousands to 6.9 million observations, estimated source positions, and compared them. I found that source positions derived from dual-band, quad-band, and 23.6 GHz single-band data agree at a level below 0.2 mas. Comparison of independent datasets allowed me to assess the error level of individual catalogues: 0.05-0.07 mas per position component. Further comparison showed that individual catalogues have systematic errors at the same level. Positions from 23.6 GHz single-band data show systematic errors related to the residual ionosphere contribution. Analysis of source positions differences revealed systematic errors along the jet direction at a level of 0.09 mas. Network related systematic errors affect all the data regardless of frequency. Comparison of position estimates allowed me to derive the stochastic error model that closes the error budget. Based on collected evidence, I made a conclusion that development of frequency-dependent reference frames of the entire sky is not warranted. In most cases dual-band, quad-band, and single-band data at frequency 22 GHz and higher can be used interchangeably, which allows us to exploit the strength of a specific frequency setup for given objects. Mixing observations at different frequencies causes errors not exceeding 0.07 mas.</description>

      <title>A fast photometric image alignment algorithm with row and column means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an astronomical image alignment algorithm. This algorithm uses the means of the rows and columns of the original image for alignment, and finds the optimal offset corresponding to the maximum similarity by comparing different offsets between images. The similarity is evaluated by the standard deviation of the quotient divided by the means. This paper also discusses the theoretical feasibility of this algorithm. Through practical testing, it has been confirmed that the algorithm is fast and robust.</description>

      <title>Astrometric detection of a Neptune-mass candidate planet in the nearest M-dwarf binary system GJ65 with VLTI/GRAVITY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of low-mass planets orbiting the nearest stars is a central stake of exoplanetary science, as they can be directly characterized much more easily than their distant counterparts. Here, we present the results of our long-term astrometric observations of the nearest binary M-dwarf Gliese 65 AB (GJ65), located at a distance of only 2.67 pc. We monitored the relative astrometry of the two components from 2016 to 2023 with the VLTI/GRAVITY interferometric instrument. We derived highly accurate orbital parameters for the stellar system, along with the dynamical masses of the two red dwarfs. The GRAVITY measurements exhibit a mean accuracy per epoch of 50-60 microarcseconds in 1.5h of observing time using the 1.8m Auxiliary Telescopes. The residuals of the two-body orbital fit enable us to search for the presence of companions orbiting one of the two stars (S-type orbit) through the reflex motion they imprint on the differential A-B astrometry. We detected a Neptune-mass candidate companion with an orbital period of p = 156 +/- 1 d and a mass of m = 36 +/- 7 Mearth. The best-fit orbit is within the dynamical stability region of the stellar pair. It has a low eccentricity, e = 0.1 - 0.3, and the planetary orbit plane has a moderate-to-high inclination of i &gt; 30{\deg} with respect to the stellar pair, with further observations required to confirm these values. These observations demonstrate the capability of interferometric astrometry to reach microarcsecond accuracy in the narrow-angle regime for planet detection by reflex motion from the ground. This capability offers new perspectives and potential synergies with Gaia in the pursuit of low-mass exoplanets in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Interferometer measurements in interstellar communications: methods and observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extraterrestrial communication signals are hypothesized to be present in an extensive search space. Using principles of communication theory and system design, methods are studied and implemented to reduce the signal search space, while considering intentional transmitter detectability. The design and observational work reported in this paper adds material to previous related reports. (ref. arXiv:2105.03727, arXiv:2106.10168, arXiv:2202.12791, arXiv:2203.10065). In the current work, a two-element radio interferometer telescope and receiver algorithms are utilized to perform differential angle-of-arrival and multi-bandwidth measurements of delta-t delta-f polarized pulse pairs. The system enhances extraterrestrial signal detectability, while reducing signal false positives caused by noise and radio frequency interference. Statistical analysis utilizes a Right Ascension filter spanning celestial coordinate ranges that include the previously determined anomalous celestial direction: 5.25 +- 0.15 hr Right Ascension, -7.6 degrees +- 1 degree Declination. Observations were conducted during a duration of 61 days, comprising 244 hours of interferometer measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exoplanet detection is the most exciting and challenging field of astronomy. The discovery of many exoplanets has revolutionized our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems and has showed new ways to search for extra terrestrial life. In recent years, some primary methods of exoplanet detection like transit, radial velocity, gravitational microlensing, direct imaging and astrometry have played a important role for the discovery of exoplanets. In this paper we explored detection methodologies with all the implications and analytics of comparison between them. Here we also discussed on different machine learning algorithms for exoplanet detection and visualization. Finally, concluded with the significant discoveries made by some missions and their implications on our understanding for the properties, environmental conditions and importance of exoplanets in the universe.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based identification of Gaia astrometric exoplanet orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The third Gaia data release (DR3) contains $\sim$170 000 astrometric orbit solutions of two-body systems located within $\sim$500 pc of the Sun. Determining component masses in these systems, in particular of stars hosting exoplanets, usually hinges on incorporating complementary observations in addition to the astrometry, e.g. spectroscopy and radial velocities. Several DR3 two-body systems with exoplanet, brown-dwarf, stellar, and black-hole components have been confirmed in this way. We developed an alternative machine learning approach that uses only the DR3 orbital solutions with the aim of identifying the best candidates for exoplanets and brown-dwarf companions. Based on confirmed substellar companions in the literature, we use semi-supervised anomaly detection methods in combination with extreme gradient boosting and random forest classifiers to determine likely low-mass outliers in the population of non-single sources. We employ and study feature importance to investigate the method's plausibility and produced a list of 22 best candidates of which four are exoplanet candidates and another five are either very-massive brown dwarfs or very-low mass stars. Three candidates, including one initial exoplanet candidate, correspond to false-positive solutions where longer-period binary star motion was fitted with a biased shorter-period orbit. We highlight nine candidates with brown-dwarf companions for preferential follow-up. One candidate companion around the Sun-like star G 15-6 could be confirmed as a genuine brown dwarf using external radial-velocity data. This new approach is a powerful complement to the traditional identification methods for substellar companions among Gaia astrometric orbits. It is particularly relevant in the context of Gaia DR4 and its expected exoplanet discovery yield.</description>

      <title>The Quasar Catalogue for S-PLUS DR4 (QuCatS) and the estimation of photometric redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of massive broad-band photometric surveys enabled photometric redshift estimates for unprecedented numbers of galaxies and quasars. These estimates can be improved using better algorithms or by obtaining complementary data such as narrow-band photometry, and broad-band photometry over an extended wavelength range. We investigate the impact of both approaches on photometric redshifts for quasars using data from S-PLUS DR4, GALEX DR6/7, and unWISE in three machine learning methods: Random Forest (RF), FlexCoDE, and Bayesian Mixture Density Network (BMDN). Including narrow-band photometry improves the root-mean-square error by 11% in comparison to a model trained with only broad-band photometry. Narrow-band information only provided an improvement of 3.8% when GALEX and WISE colours were included. Thus narrow bands play a more important role for objects that do not have GALEX or WISE counterparts, which respectively makes 92% and 25% of S-PLUS data considered here. Nevertheless, the inclusion of narrow-band information provided better estimates of the probability density functions obtained with FlexCoDE and BMDN. We publicly release a value-added catalogue of photometrically-selected quasars with the photo-z predictions from all methods studied here. The catalogue provided with this work covers the S-PLUS DR4 area (~3000deg$^2$), containing 645 980, 244 912, 144 991 sources with the probability of being a quasar higher than, 80%, 90%, 95% up to r &lt; 21.3 and good photometry quality in the detection image. More quasar candidates can be retrieved from the S-PLUS database by considering less restrictive selection criteria.</description>

      <title>Finding Lensed Radio Sources with the VLA Sky Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio observations of strongly lensed objects are valuable as cosmological probes. Lensed radio sources have proven difficult to identify in large part due to the limited depth and angular resolution of the previous generation of radio sky surveys, and as such, only a few dozen lensed radio sources are known. In this work we present the results of a pilot study using the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) in combination with optical data to more efficiently identify lensed radio sources. We obtain high-resolution (0.2") VLA follow-up observations for 11 targets that we identify using three different techniques: i) a search for compact radio sources offset from galaxies with high lensing potential, ii) VLASS detections of known lensed galaxies, iii) VLASS detections of known lensed quasars. 5 of our targets show radio emission from the lensed images, including 100% of the lensed optical quasar systems. This work demonstrates the efficacy of combining deep and high-resolution wide-area radio and optical survey data to efficiently find lensed radio sources, and we discuss the potential impact of such an approach using next-generation surveys with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, Euclid, and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and characterization of optical filters from polymeric aerogels loaded with diamond scattering particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a suite of infrared-blocking filters made by embedding diamond scattering particles in a polyimide aerogel substrate. We demonstrate the ability to tune the spectral performance of the filters based on both the composition of the base aerogel material and the properties of the scattering particles. We summarize the fabrication, optical modeling, and characterization of these filters. We investigate two polyimide base aerogel formulations and the effects of loading them with diamond scattering particles of varying sizes and relative densities. We describe a model for the filters' behavior using a combination of Maxwell Garnett and Mie Scattering techniques. We present optical characterization results for diamond-loaded aerogel filters with cutoff frequencies (50% transmittance) ranging between 2.5 and 15 THz, and confirm that the measured spectral performance is in agreement with our optical models. We also measure the filters' refractive index in the microwave and report findings in agreement with Maxwell Garnett model predictions (typically n &lt; 1.08).</description>

      <title>How I wonder where you are: pinpointing coalescing binary neutron star sources with the IGWN, including LIGO-Aundha</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LIGO-Aundha (A1), the Indian gravitational wave detector, is expected to join the IGWN and begin operations in the early 2030s. We study the impact of A1 on the accuracy of determining the direction of incoming transient signals from coalescing BNS sources with moderately high SNRs. It is conceivable that A1's sensitivity, effective bandwidth, and duty cycle will improve incrementally through multiple detector commissioning rounds to achieve the desired `LIGO-A+' design sensitivity. For this purpose, we examine A1 under two distinct noise PSDs. One mirrors the conditions during the O4 run of the LIGO Hanford and Livingston detectors, simulating an early commissioning stage, while the other represents the A+ design sensitivity. We consider various duty cycles of A1 at the sensitivities mentioned above for a comprehensive analysis. We show that even at the O4 sensitivity with a modest $20\%$ duty cycle, A1's addition to the IGWN leads to a $15\%$ reduction in median sky-localization errors ($\Delta \Omega_{90\%}$) to $5.6$~sq.~deg. At its design sensitivity and $80\%$ duty cycle, this error shrinks further to $2.4$~sq.~deg, with 84\% sources localized within a nominal error box of $10$~sq.~deg! Even in the worst-case scenario, where signals are sub-threshold in A1, we demonstrate its critical role in reducing the localization uncertainties of the BNS source. Our results are obtained from a large Bayesian PE study using simulated signals injected in a heterogeneous network of detectors using the recently developed meshfree approximation aided rapid Bayesian inference pipeline. We consider a seismic cut-off frequency of 10 Hz for all the detectors. We also present hypothetical improvements in sky localization for a few GWTC-like events injected in real data and demonstrate A1's role in resolving the degeneracy between the luminosity distance and inclination angle parameters.</description>

      <title>A precise symbolic emulator of the linear matter power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing the matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, as a function of cosmological parameters can be prohibitively slow in cosmological analyses, hence emulating this calculation is desirable. Previous analytic approximations are insufficiently accurate for modern applications, so black-box, uninterpretable emulators are often used. We utilise an efficient genetic programming based symbolic regression framework to explore the space of potential mathematical expressions which can approximate the power spectrum and $\sigma_8$. We learn the ratio between an existing low-accuracy fitting function for $P(k)$ and that obtained by solving the Boltzmann equations and thus still incorporate the physics which motivated this earlier approximation. We obtain an analytic approximation to the linear power spectrum with a root mean squared fractional error of 0.2% between $k = 9\times10^{-3} - 9 \, h{\rm \, Mpc^{-1}}$ and across a wide range of cosmological parameters, and we provide physical interpretations for various terms in the expression. Our analytic approximation is 950 times faster to evaluate than camb and 36 times faster than the neural network based matter power spectrum emulator BACCO. We also provide a simple analytic approximation for $\sigma_8$ with a similar accuracy, with a root mean squared fractional error of just 0.1% when evaluated across the same range of cosmologies. This function is easily invertible to obtain $A_{\rm s}$ as a function of $\sigma_8$ and the other cosmological parameters, if preferred. It is possible to obtain symbolic approximations to a seemingly complex function at a precision required for current and future cosmological analyses without resorting to deep-learning techniques, thus avoiding their black-box nature and large number of parameters. Our emulator will be usable long after the codes on which numerical approximations are built become outdated.</description>

      <title>syren-halofit: A fast, interpretable, high-precision formula for the $\Lambda$CDM nonlinear matter power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid and accurate evaluation of the nonlinear matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, as a function of cosmological parameters and redshift is of fundamental importance in cosmology. Analytic approximations provide an interpretable solution, yet current approximations are neither fast nor accurate relative to numerical emulators. We use symbolic regression to obtain simple analytic approximations to the nonlinear scale, $k_\sigma$, the effective spectral index, $n_{\rm eff}$, and the curvature, $C$, which are required for the halofit model. We then re-optimise the coefficients of halofit to fit a wide range of cosmologies and redshifts. We explore the space of analytic expressions to fit the residuals between $P(k)$ and the optimised predictions of halofit. Our results are designed to match the predictions of EuclidEmulator2, but are validated against $N$-body simulations. Our symbolic expressions for $k_\sigma$, $n_{\rm eff}$ and $C$ have root mean squared fractional errors of 0.8%, 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, for redshifts below 3 and a wide range of cosmologies. The re-optimised halofit parameters reduce the root mean squared fractional error (compared to EuclidEmulator2) from 3% to below 2% for wavenumbers $k=9\times10^{-3}-9 \, h{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. We introduce syren-halofit (symbolic-regression-enhanced halofit), an extension to halofit containing a short symbolic correction which improves this error to 1%. Our method is 2350 and 3170 times faster than current halofit and hmcode implementations, respectively, and 2680 and 64 times faster than EuclidEmulator2 (which requires running class) and the BACCO emulator. We obtain comparable accuracy to EuclidEmulator2 and BACCO when tested on $N$-body simulations. Our work greatly increases the speed and accuracy of symbolic approximations to $P(k)$, making them significantly faster than their numerical counterparts without loss of accuracy.</description>
