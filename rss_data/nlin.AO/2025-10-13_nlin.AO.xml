      <title>Triadic percolation on multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triadic interactions are special types of higher-order interactions that occur when regulator nodes modulate the interactions between other two or more nodes. In presence of triadic interactions, a percolation process occurring on a single-layer network becomes a fully-fledged dynamical system, characterized by period-doubling and a route to chaos. Here, we generalize the model to multilayer networks and name it as the multilayer triadic percolation (MTP) model. We find a much richer dynamical behavior of the MTP model than its single-layer counterpart. MTP displays a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, leading to oscillations of arbitrarily large period or pseudo-periodic oscillations. Moreover, MTP admits period-two oscillations without negative regulatory interactions, whereas single-layer systems only display discontinuous hybrid transitions. This comprehensive model offers new insights on the importance of regulatory interactions in real-world systems such as brain networks, climate, and ecological systems.</description>

      <title>Mixed higher-order coupling stabilizes new states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how higher-order interactions affect collective behavior is a central problem in nonlinear dynamics and complex systems. Most works have focused on a single higher-order coupling function, neglecting other viable choices. Here we study coupled oscillators with dyadic and three different types of higher-order couplings. By analyzing the stability of different twisted states on rings, we show that many states are stable only for certain combinations of higher-order couplings, and thus the full range of system dynamics cannot be observed unless all types of higher-order couplings are simultaneously considered.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for polyadic epidemic and voter models with multiscale groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polyadic (or higher-order) interactions can significantly impact the dynamics of interacting particle systems. However, previous studies have often assumed group sizes to be relatively small. In this work, we examine the influence of multiscale polyadic group interactions, where some groups are small and others are very large. We consider two paradigmatic examples, an SIS-epidemic and the adaptive voter model. On the level of the mean field, we specifically discuss the impact of the multiscale polyadic interactions on equilibrium dynamics and phase transitions. For the SIS-epidemic model, we find a region of bistability that protects the disease-free state over a wide range beyond the classical epidemic threshold from a significant outbreak. For the adaptive voter model, we show that multiscale polyadic interactions can stabilize the network or increase the convergence rate to an unbiased equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Spike-frequency and h-current based adaptation are dynamically equivalent in a Wilson-Cowan field model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During slow-wave sleep, the brain produces traveling waves of slow oscillations (SOs; $\leq 2$ Hz), characterized by the propagation of alternating high- and low-activity states. The question of internal mechanisms that modulate traveling waves of SOs is still unanswered although it is established that it is an adaptation mechanism that mediates them. One mechanism investigated is spike-frequency adaptation, a hyperpolarizing feedback current that is activated during periods of high-activity. An alternative mechanism is based on hyperpolarization-activated currents, which are positive feedback currents that are activated in low-activity states. Both adaptation mechanisms were shown to feature SO-like dynamics in neuronal populations, and the inclusion of a spatial domain seems to enhance observable differences in their effects. To investigate this in detail, we examine a spatially extended two-population Wilson-Cowan model with local spatial coupling and the excitatory populations equipped with either one of the two adaptation mechanisms. We describe them with the same dynamical equation and include the inverse mode of action by changing the signs of adaptation strength and gain. We show that the dynamical systems are mathematically equivalent under a compensatory external input, which depends on the adaptation strength, leading to a shift in state space of the otherwise equivalent bifurcation structure. Strong enough adaptation is required to induce traveling waves. Additionally, adaptation modulates the properties of the spatio-temporal activity patterns, such as temporal and spatial frequencies, and the speed of the traveling waves, all of which increase with increasing strength. Though being dynamically equivalent, our results also explain why location-dependent variations in feedback strength cause differences in the propagation of traveling waves between both adaptation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Fixation and extinction in time-fluctuating spatially structured metapopulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacteria evolve in volatile environments and complex spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations and environmental variability therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of microbial populations. Here, we consider a class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular (circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a time-fluctuating environment in which demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow cell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly switches between two values associated to harsh and mild environmental conditions. Environmental variability can lead to population bottlenecks, following which the population is prone to fluctuation-induced extinction. Here, we analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and fluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle, and square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large, bottlenecks are weak and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus captured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean time of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in contrast to static environments, the mutant fixation probability depends on the rate of migration. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation time can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the carrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and the metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and strain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we identify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the metapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in the context of an idealised treatment strategy and discuss possible generalisations of our models.</description>
