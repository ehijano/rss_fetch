      <title>FloodSQL-Bench: A Retrieval-Augmented Benchmark for Geospatially-Grounded Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Text-to-SQL benchmarks primarily focus on single-table queries or limited joins in general-purpose domains, and thus fail to reflect the complexity of domain-specific, multi-table and geospatial reasoning, To address this limitation, we introduce FLOODSQL-BENCH, a geospatially grounded benchmark for the flood management domain that integrates heterogeneous datasets through key-based, spatial, and hybrid joins. The benchmark captures realistic flood-related information needs by combining social, infrastructural, and hazard data layers. We systematically evaluate recent large language models with the same retrieval-augmented generation settings and measure their performance across difficulty tiers. By providing a unified, open benchmark grounded in real-world disaster management data, FLOODSQL-BENCH establishes a practical testbed for advancing Text-to-SQL research in high-stakes application domains.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Curse of Dimensionality: On the Stability of Modern Vector Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern vector databases enable efficient retrieval over high-dimensional neural embeddings, powering applications from web search to retrieval-augmented generation. However, classical theory predicts such tasks should suffer from the curse of dimensionality, where distances between points become nearly indistinguishable, thereby crippling efficient nearest-neighbor search. We revisit this paradox through the lens of stability, the property that small perturbations to a query do not radically alter its nearest neighbors. Building on foundational results, we extend stability theory to three key retrieval settings widely used in practice: (i) multi-vector search, where we prove that the popular Chamfer distance metric preserves single-vector stability, while average pooling aggregation may destroy it; (ii) filtered vector search, where we show that sufficiently large penalties for mismatched filters can induce stability even when the underlying search is unstable; and (iii) sparse vector search, where we formalize and prove novel sufficient stability conditions. Across synthetic and real datasets, our experimental results match our theoretical predictions, offering concrete guidance for model and system design to avoid the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>FuXi-$\gamma$: Efficient Sequential Recommendation with Exponential-Power Temporal Encoder and Diagonal-Sparse Positional Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation aims to model users' evolving preferences based on their historical interactions. Recent advances leverage Transformer-based architectures to capture global dependencies, but existing methods often suffer from high computational overhead, primarily due to discontinuous memory access in temporal encoding and dense attention over long sequences. To address these limitations, we propose FuXi-$\gamma$, a novel sequential recommendation framework that improves both effectiveness and efficiency through principled architectural design. FuXi-$\gamma$ adopts a decoder-only Transformer structure and introduces two key innovations: (1) An exponential-power temporal encoder that encodes relative temporal intervals using a tunable exponential decay function inspired by the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve. This encoder enables flexible modeling of both short-term and long-term preferences while maintaining high efficiency through continuous memory access and pure matrix operations. (2) A diagonal-sparse positional mechanism that prunes low-contribution attention blocks using a diagonal-sliding strategy guided by the persymmetry of Toeplitz matrix. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FuXi-$\gamma$ achieves state-of-the-art performance in recommendation quality, while accelerating training by up to 4.74$\times$ and inference by up to 6.18$\times$, making it a practical and scalable solution for long-sequence recommendation. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yeedzhi/FuXi-gamma.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Scientific Literature Explorer using Machine Learning (ISLE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid acceleration of scientific publishing has created substantial challenges for researchers attempting to discover, contextualize, and interpret relevant literature. Traditional keyword-based search systems provide limited semantic understanding, while existing AI-driven tools typically focus on isolated tasks such as retrieval, clustering, or bibliometric visualization. This paper presents an integrated system for scientific literature exploration that combines large-scale data acquisition, hybrid retrieval, semantic topic modeling, and heterogeneous knowledge graph construction. The system builds a comprehensive corpus by merging full-text data from arXiv with structured metadata from OpenAlex. A hybrid retrieval architecture fuses BM25 lexical search with embedding-based semantic search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Topic modeling is performed on retrieved results using BERTopic or non-negative matrix factorization depending on computational resources. A knowledge graph unifies papers, authors, institutions, countries, and extracted topics into an interpretable structure. The system provides a multi-layered exploration environment that reveals not only relevant publications but also the conceptual and relational landscape surrounding a query. Evaluation across multiple queries demonstrates improvements in retrieval relevance, topic coherence, and interpretability. The proposed framework contributes an extensible foundation for AI-assisted scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>SPAR: Session-based Pipeline for Adaptive Retrieval on Legacy File Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to extract value from historical data is essential for enterprise decision-making. However, much of this information remains inaccessible within large legacy file systems that lack structured organization and semantic indexing, making retrieval and analysis inefficient and error-prone. We introduce SPAR (Session-based Pipeline for Adaptive Retrieval), a conceptual framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture specifically designed for legacy enterprise environments. Unlike conventional RAG pipelines, which require costly construction and maintenance of full-scale vector databases that mirror the entire file system, SPAR employs a lightweight two-stage process: a semantic Metadata Index is first created, after which session-specific vector databases are dynamically generated on demand. This design reduces computational overhead while improving transparency, controllability, and relevance in retrieval. We provide a theoretical complexity analysis comparing SPAR with standard LLM-based RAG pipelines, demonstrating its computational advantages. To validate the framework, we apply SPAR to a synthesized enterprise-scale file system containing a large corpus of biomedical literature, showing improvements in both retrieval effectiveness and downstream model accuracy. Finally, we discuss design trade-offs and outline open challenges for deploying SPAR across diverse enterprise settings.</description>

      <title>BLADE: A Behavior-Level Data Augmentation Framework with Dual Fusion Modeling for Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-behavior sequential recommendation aims to capture users' dynamic interests by modeling diverse types of user interactions over time. Although several studies have explored this setting, the recommendation performance remains suboptimal, mainly due to two fundamental challenges: the heterogeneity of user behaviors and data sparsity. To address these challenges, we propose BLADE, a framework that enhances multi-behavior modeling while mitigating data sparsity. Specifically, to handle behavior heterogeneity, we introduce a dual item-behavior fusion architecture that incorporates behavior information at both the input and intermediate levels, enabling preference modeling from multiple perspectives. To mitigate data sparsity, we design three behavior-level data augmentation methods that operate directly on behavior sequences rather than core item sequences. These methods generate diverse augmented views while preserving the semantic consistency of item sequences. These augmented views further enhance representation learning and generalization via contrastive learning. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Do Reviews Matter for Recommendations in the Era of Large Language Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), the landscape of recommender systems is undergoing a significant transformation. Traditionally, user reviews have served as a critical source of rich, contextual information for enhancing recommendation quality. However, as LLMs demonstrate an unprecedented ability to understand and generate human-like text, this raises the question of whether explicit user reviews remain essential in the era of LLMs. In this paper, we provide a systematic investigation of the evolving role of text reviews in recommendation by comparing deep learning methods and LLM approaches. Particularly, we conduct extensive experiments on eight public datasets with LLMs and evaluate their performance in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. We further introduce a benchmarking evaluation framework for review-aware recommender systems, RAREval, to comprehensively assess the contribution of textual reviews to the recommendation performance of review-aware recommender systems. Our framework examines various scenarios, including the removal of some or all textual reviews, random distortion, as well as recommendation performance in data sparsity and cold-start user settings. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of functioning as effective review-aware recommendation engines, generally outperforming traditional deep learning approaches, particularly in scenarios characterized by data sparsity and cold-start conditions. In addition, the removal of some or all textual reviews and random distortion does not necessarily lead to declines in recommendation accuracy. These findings motivate a rethinking of how user preference from text reviews can be more effectively leveraged.

      <title>Reveal Hidden Pitfalls and Navigate Next Generation of Vector Similarity Search from Task-Centric Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector Similarity Search (VSS) in high-dimensional spaces is rapidly emerging as core functionality in next-generation database systems for numerous data-intensive services -- from embedding lookups in large language models (LLMs), to semantic information retrieval and recommendation engines. Current benchmarks, however, evaluate VSS primarily on the recall-latency trade-off against a ground truth defined solely by distance metrics, neglecting how retrieval quality ultimately impacts downstream tasks. This disconnect can mislead both academic research and industrial practice.
  We present Iceberg, a holistic benchmark suite for end-to-end evaluation of VSS methods in realistic application contexts. From a task-centric view, Iceberg uncovers the Information Loss Funnel, which identifies three principal sources of end-to-end performance degradation: (1) Embedding Loss during feature extraction; (2) Metric Misuse, where distances poorly reflect task relevance; (3) Data Distribution Sensitivity, highlighting index robustness across skews and modalities. For a more comprehensive assessment, Iceberg spans eight diverse datasets across key domains such as image classification, face recognition, text retrieval, and recommendation systems. Each dataset, ranging from 1M to 100M vectors, includes rich, task-specific labels and evaluation metrics, enabling assessment of retrieval algorithms within the full application pipeline rather than in isolation. Iceberg benchmarks 13 state-of-the-art VSS methods and re-ranks them based on application-level metrics, revealing substantial deviations from traditional rankings derived purely from recall-latency evaluations. Building on these insights, we define a set of task-centric meta-features and derive an interpretable decision tree to guide practitioners in selecting and tuning VSS methods for their specific workloads.</description>

      <title>Are Large Language Models Really Effective for Training-Free Cold-Start Recommendation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems usually rely on large-scale interaction data to learn from users' past behaviors and make accurate predictions. However, real-world applications often face situations where no training data is available, such as when launching new services or handling entirely new users. In such cases, conventional approaches cannot be applied. This study focuses on training-free recommendation, where no task-specific training is performed, and particularly on \textit{training-free cold-start recommendation} (TFCSR), the more challenging case where the target user has no interactions. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been explored as a promising solution, and numerous studies have been proposed. As the ability of text embedding models (TEMs) increases, they are increasingly recognized as applicable to training-free recommendation, but no prior work has directly compared LLMs and TEMs under identical conditions. We present the first controlled experiments that systematically evaluate these two approaches in the same setting. The results show that TEMs outperform LLM rerankers, and this trend holds not only in cold-start settings but also in warm-start settings with rich interactions. These findings indicate that direct LLM ranking is not the only viable option, contrary to the commonly shared belief, and TEM-based approaches provide a stronger and more scalable basis for training-free recommendation.</description>

      <title>Progressive Refinement of E-commerce Search Ranking Based on Short-Term Activities of the Buyer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In e-commerce shopping, aligning search results with a buyer's immediate needs and preferences presents a significant challenge, particularly in adapting search results throughout the buyer's shopping journey as they move from the initial stages of browsing to making a purchase decision or shift from one intent to another. This study presents a systematic approach to adapting e-commerce search results based on the current context. We start with basic methods and incrementally incorporate more contextual information and state-of-the-art techniques to improve the search outcomes. By applying this evolving contextual framework to items displayed on the search engine results page (SERP), we progressively align search outcomes more closely with the buyer's interests and current search intentions. Our findings demonstrate that this incremental enhancement, from simple heuristic autoregressive features to advanced sequence models, significantly improves ranker performance. The integration of contextual techniques enhances the performance of our production ranker, leading to improved search results in both offline and online A/B testing in terms of Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Overall, the paper details iterative methodologies and their substantial contributions to search result contextualization on e-commerce platforms.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Effective Framework for Symmetric Consistent Indexing in Large-Scale Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense retrieval has become the industry standard in large-scale information retrieval systems due to its high efficiency and competitive accuracy. Its core relies on a coarse-to-fine hierarchical architecture that enables rapid candidate selection and precise semantic matching, achieving millisecond-level response over billion-scale corpora. This capability makes it essential not only in traditional search and recommendation scenarios but also in the emerging paradigm of generative recommendation driven by large language models, where semantic IDs-themselves a form of coarse-to-fine representation-play a foundational role. However, the widely adopted dual-tower encoding architecture introduces inherent challenges, primarily representational space misalignment and retrieval index inconsistency, which degrade matching accuracy, retrieval stability, and performance on long-tail queries. These issues are further magnified in semantic ID generation, ultimately limiting the performance ceiling of downstream generative models.
  To address these challenges, this paper proposes a simple and effective framework named SCI comprising two synergistic modules: a symmetric representation alignment module that employs an innovative input-swapping mechanism to unify the dual-tower representation space without adding parameters, and an consistent indexing with dual-tower synergy module that redesigns retrieval paths using a dual-view indexing strategy to maintain consistency from training to inference. The framework is systematic, lightweight, and engineering-friendly, requiring minimal overhead while fully supporting billion-scale deployment. We provide theoretical guarantees for our approach, with its effectiveness validated by results across public datasets and real-world e-commerce datasets.</description>

      <title>Towards Practical Large-scale Dynamical Heterogeneous Graph Embedding: Cold-start Resilient Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying dynamic heterogeneous graph embeddings in production faces key challenges of scalability, data freshness, and cold-start. This paper introduces a practical, two-stage solution that balances deep graph representation with low-latency incremental updates. Our framework combines HetSGFormer, a scalable graph transformer for static learning, with Incremental Locally Linear Embedding (ILLE), a lightweight, CPU-based algorithm for real-time updates. HetSGFormer captures global structure with linear scalability, while ILLE provides rapid, targeted updates to incorporate new data, thus avoiding costly full retraining. This dual approach is cold-start resilient, leveraging the graph to create meaningful embeddings from sparse data. On billion-scale graphs, A/B tests show HetSGFormer achieved up to a 6.11% lift in Advertiser Value over previous methods, while the ILLE module added another 3.22% lift and improved embedding refresh timeliness by 83.2%. Our work provides a validated framework for deploying dynamic graph learning in production environments.</description>

      <title>Know Your Users! Estimating User Domain Knowledge in Conversational Recommenders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ideal conversational recommender system (CRS) acts like a savvy salesperson, adapting its language and suggestions to each user's level of expertise. However, most current systems treat all users as experts, leading to frustrating and inefficient interactions when users are unfamiliar with a domain. Systems that can adapt their conversational strategies to a user's knowledge level stand to offer a much more natural and effective experience. To make a step toward such adaptive systems, we introduce a new task: estimating user domain knowledge from conversations, enabling a CRS to better understand user needs and personalize interactions. A key obstacle to developing such adaptive systems is the lack of suitable data; to our knowledge, no existing dataset captures the conversational behaviors of users with varying levels of domain knowledge. Furthermore, in most dialogue collection protocols, users are free to express their own preferences, which tends to concentrate on popular items and well-known features, offering little insight into how novices explore or learn about unfamiliar features. To address this, we design a game-based data collection protocol that elicits varied expressions of knowledge, release the resulting dataset, and provide an initial analysis to highlight its potential for future work on user-knowledge-aware CRS.</description>

      <title>BlossomRec: Block-level Fused Sparse Attention Mechanism for Sequential Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer structures have been widely used in sequential recommender systems (SRS). However, as user interaction histories increase, computational time and memory requirements also grow. This is mainly caused by the standard attention mechanism. Although there exist many methods employing efficient attention and SSM-based models, these approaches struggle to effectively model long sequences and may exhibit unstable performance on short sequences. To address these challenges, we design a sparse attention mechanism, BlossomRec, which models both long-term and short-term user interests through attention computation to achieve stable performance across sequences of varying lengths. Specifically, we categorize user interests in recommendation systems into long-term and short-term interests, and compute them using two distinct sparse attention patterns, with the results combined through a learnable gated output. Theoretically, it significantly reduces the number of interactions participating in attention computation. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that BlossomRec, when integrated with state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, achieves comparable or even superior performance while significantly reducing memory usage, providing strong evidence of BlossomRec's efficiency and effectiveness.The code is available at https://github.com/ronineume/BlossomRec.</description>

      <title>Automated Information Flow Selection for Multi-scenario Multi-task Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-scenario multi-task recommendation (MSMTR) systems must address recommendation demands across diverse scenarios while simultaneously optimizing multiple objectives, such as click-through rate and conversion rate. Existing MSMTR models typically consist of four information units: scenario-shared, scenario-specific, task-shared, and task-specific networks. These units interact to generate four types of relationship information flows, directed from scenario-shared or scenario-specific networks to task-shared or task-specific networks. However, these models face two main limitations: 1) They often rely on complex architectures, such as mixture-of-experts (MoE) networks, which increase the complexity of information fusion, model size, and training cost. 2) They extract all available information flows without filtering out irrelevant or even harmful content, introducing potential noise. Regarding these challenges, we propose a lightweight Automated Information Flow Selection (AutoIFS) framework for MSMTR. To tackle the first issue, AutoIFS incorporates low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to decouple the four information units, enabling more flexible and efficient information fusion with minimal parameter overhead. To address the second issue, AutoIFS introduces an information flow selection network that automatically filters out invalid scenario-task information flows based on model performance feedback. It employs a simple yet effective pruning function to eliminate useless information flows, thereby enhancing the impact of key relationships and improving model performance. Finally, we evaluate AutoIFS and confirm its effectiveness through extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets and an online A/B test.</description>

      <title>Not All Transparency Is Equal: Source Presentation Effects on Attention, Interaction, and Persuasion in Conversational Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational search systems increasingly provide source citations, yet how citation or source presentation formats influence user engagement remains unclear. We conducted a crowdsourcing user experiment with 394 participants comparing four source presentation designs that varied citation visibility and accessibility: collapsible lists, hover cards, footer lists, and aligned sidebars.High-visibility interfaces generated substantially more hovering on sources, though clicking remained infrequent across all conditions. While interface design showed limited effects on user experience and perception measures, it significantly influenced knowledge, interest, and agreement changes. High-visibility interfaces initially reduced knowledge gain and interest, but these positive effects emerged with increasing source usage. The sidebar condition uniquely increased agreement change. Our findings demonstrate that source presentation alone may not enhance engagement and can even reduce it when insufficient sources are provided.</description>

      <title>Patch-wise Retrieval: A Bag of Practical Techniques for Instance-level Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instance-level image retrieval aims to find images containing the same object as a given query, despite variations in size, position, or appearance. To address this challenging task, we propose Patchify, a simple yet effective patch-wise retrieval framework that offers high performance, scalability, and interpretability without requiring fine-tuning. Patchify divides each database image into a small number of structured patches and performs retrieval by comparing these local features with a global query descriptor, enabling accurate and spatially grounded matching. To assess not just retrieval accuracy but also spatial correctness, we introduce LocScore, a localization-aware metric that quantifies whether the retrieved region aligns with the target object. This makes LocScore a valuable diagnostic tool for understanding and improving retrieval behavior. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, backbones, and region selection strategies, showing that Patchify outperforms global methods and complements state-of-the-art reranking pipelines. Furthermore, we apply Product Quantization for efficient large-scale retrieval and highlight the importance of using informative features during compression, which significantly boosts performance.

      <title>Hindsight is 20/20: Building Agent Memory that Retains, Recalls, and Reflects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent memory has been touted as a dimension of growth for LLM-based applications, enabling agents that can accumulate experience, adapt across sessions, and move beyond single-shot question answering. The current generation of agent memory systems treats memory as an external layer that extracts salient snippets from conversations, stores them in vector or graph-based stores, and retrieves top-k items into the prompt of an otherwise stateless model. While these systems improve personalization and context carry-over, they still blur the line between evidence and inference, struggle to organize information over long horizons, and offer limited support for agents that must explain their reasoning. We present Hindsight, a memory architecture that treats agent memory as a structured, first-class substrate for reasoning by organizing it into four logical networks that distinguish world facts, agent experiences, synthesized entity summaries, and evolving beliefs. This framework supports three core operations -- retain, recall, and reflect -- that govern how information is added, accessed, and updated. Under this abstraction, a temporal, entity aware memory layer incrementally turns conversational streams into a structured, queryable memory bank, while a reflection layer reasons over this bank to produce answers and to update information in a traceable way. On key long-horizon conversational memory benchmarks like LongMemEval and LoCoMo, Hindsight with an open-source 20B model lifts overall accuracy from 39% to 83.6% over a full-context baseline with the same backbone and outperforms full context GPT-4o. Scaling the backbone further pushes Hindsight to 91.4% on LongMemEval and up to 89.61% on LoCoMo (vs. 75.78% for the strongest prior open system), consistently outperforming existing memory architectures on multi-session and open-domain questions.</description>

      <title>SignRAG: A Retrieval-Augmented System for Scalable Zero-Shot Road Sign Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated road sign recognition is a critical task for intelligent transportation systems, but traditional deep learning methods struggle with the sheer number of sign classes and the impracticality of creating exhaustive labeled datasets. This paper introduces a novel zero-shot recognition framework that adapts the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm to address this challenge. Our method first uses a Vision Language Model (VLM) to generate a textual description of a sign from an input image. This description is used to retrieve a small set of the most relevant sign candidates from a vector database of reference designs. Subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM) reasons over the retrieved candidates to make a final, fine-grained recognition. We validate this approach on a comprehensive set of 303 regulatory signs from the Ohio MUTCD. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, achieving 95.58% accuracy on ideal reference images and 82.45% on challenging real-world road data. This work demonstrates the viability of RAG-based architectures for creating scalable and accurate systems for road sign recognition without task-specific training.</description>

      <title>Unified Interactive Multimodal Moment Retrieval via Cascaded Embedding-Reranking and Temporal-Aware Score Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth of video content has created an urgent need for efficient multimodal moment retrieval systems. However, existing approaches face three critical challenges: (1) fixed-weight fusion strategies fail across cross modal noise and ambiguous queries, (2) temporal modeling struggles to capture coherent event sequences while penalizing unrealistic gaps, and (3) systems require manual modality selection, reducing usability. We propose a unified multimodal moment retrieval system with three key innovations. First, a cascaded dual-embedding pipeline combines BEIT-3 and SigLIP for broad retrieval, refined by BLIP-2 based reranking to balance recall and precision. Second, a temporal-aware scoring mechanism applies exponential decay penalties to large temporal gaps via beam search, constructing coherent event sequences rather than isolated frames. Third, Agent-guided query decomposition (GPT-4o) automatically interprets ambiguous queries, decomposes them into modality specific sub-queries (visual/OCR/ASR), and performs adaptive score fusion eliminating manual modality selection. Qualitative analysis demonstrates that our system effectively handles ambiguous queries, retrieves temporally coherent sequences, and dynamically adapts fusion strategies, advancing interactive moment search capabilities.</description>

      <title>Finch: Benchmarking Finance &amp; Accounting across Spreadsheet-Centric Enterprise Workflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a finance &amp; accounting benchmark (Finch) for evaluating AI agents on real-world, enterprise-grade professional workflows -- interleaving data entry, structuring, formatting, web search, cross-file retrieval, calculation, modeling, validation, translation, visualization, and reporting. Finch is sourced from authentic enterprise workspaces at Enron (15,000 spreadsheets and 500,000 emails from 150 employees) and other financial institutions, preserving in-the-wild messiness across multimodal artifacts (text, tables, formulas, charts, code, and images) and spanning diverse domains such as budgeting, trading, and asset management.
  We propose a workflow construction process that combines LLM-assisted discovery with expert annotation: (1) LLM-assisted, expert-verified derivation of workflows from real-world email threads and version histories of spreadsheet files, and (2) meticulous expert annotation for workflows, requiring over 700 hours of domain-expert effort. This yields 172 composite workflows with 384 tasks, involving 1,710 spreadsheets with 27 million cells, along with PDFs and other artifacts, capturing the intrinsically messy, long-horizon, knowledge-intensive, and collaborative nature of real-world enterprise work.
  We conduct both human and automated evaluations of frontier AI systems including GPT 5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, Grok 4, and Qwen 3 Max, and GPT 5.1 Pro spends 48 hours in total yet passes only 38.4% of workflows, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 passes just 25.0%. Comprehensive case studies further surface the challenges that real-world enterprise workflows pose for AI agents.</description>

      <title>Learning to Retrieve with Weakened Labels: Robust Training under Label Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Encoders are frequently used in the NLP domain to perform dense retrieval tasks, for instance, to generate the candidate documents for a given query in question-answering tasks. However, sparse annotation and label noise in the training data make it challenging to train or fine-tune such retrieval models. Although existing works have attempted to mitigate these problems by incorporating modified loss functions or data cleaning, these approaches either require some hyperparameters to tune during training or add substantial complexity to the training setup. In this work, we consider a label weakening approach to generate robust retrieval models in the presence of label noise. Instead of enforcing a single, potentially erroneous label for each query document pair, we allow for a set of plausible labels derived from both the observed supervision and the model's confidence scores. We perform an extensive evaluation considering two retrieval models, one re-ranking model, considering four diverse ranking datasets. To this end, we also consider a realistic noisy setting by using a semantic-aware noise generation technique to generate different ratios of noise. Our initial results show that label weakening can improve the performance of the retrieval tasks in comparison to 10 different state-of-the-art loss functions.</description>

      <title>No One Left Behind: How to Exploit the Incomplete and Skewed Multi-Label Data for Conversion Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In most real-world online advertising systems, advertisers typically have diverse customer acquisition goals. A common solution is to use multi-task learning (MTL) to train a unified model on post-click data to estimate the conversion rate (CVR) for these diverse targets. In practice, CVR prediction often encounters missing conversion data as many advertisers submit only a subset of user conversion actions due to privacy or other constraints, making the labels of multi-task data incomplete. If the model is trained on all available samples where advertisers submit user conversion actions, it may struggle when deployed to serve a subset of advertisers targeting specific conversion actions, as the training and deployment data distributions are mismatched. While considerable MTL efforts have been made, a long-standing challenge is how to effectively train a unified model with the incomplete and skewed multi-label data. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained Knowledge transfer framework for Asymmetric Multi-Label data (KAML). We introduce an attribution-driven masking strategy (ADM) to better utilize data with asymmetric multi-label data in training. However, the more relaxed masking in ADM is a double-edged sword: it provides additional training signals but also introduces noise due to skewed data. To address this, we propose a hierarchical knowledge extraction mechanism (HKE) to model the sample discrepancy within the target task tower. Finally, to maximize the utility of unlabeled samples, we incorporate ranking loss strategy to further enhance our model. The effectiveness of KAML has been demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on offline industry datasets and online A/B tests, which show significant performance improvements over existing MTL baselines.</description>

      <title>TARA: Simple and Efficient Time Aware Retrieval Adaptation of MLLMs for Video Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our objective is to build a general time-aware video-text embedding model for retrieval. To that end, we propose a simple and efficient recipe, dubbed TARA (Time Aware Retrieval Adaptation), to adapt Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to a time-aware video-text embedding model without using any video data at all. For evaluating time-awareness in retrieval, we propose a new benchmark with temporally opposite (chiral) actions as hard negatives and curated splits for chiral and non-chiral actions. We show that TARA outperforms all existing video-text models on this chiral benchmark while also achieving strong results on standard benchmarks. Furthermore, we discover additional benefits of TARA beyond time-awareness: (i) TARA embeddings are negation-aware as shown in NegBench benchmark that evaluates negation in video retrieval, (ii) TARA achieves state of the art performance on verb and adverb understanding in videos. Overall, TARA yields a strong, versatile, time-aware video-text embedding model with state of the art zero-shot performance.</description>

      <title>Large-Language Memorization During the Classification of United States Supreme Court Cases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) have been shown to respond in a variety of ways for classification tasks outside of question-answering. LLM responses are sometimes called "hallucinations" since the output is not what is ex pected. Memorization strategies in LLMs are being studied in detail, with the goal of understanding how LLMs respond. We perform a deep dive into a classification task based on United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) decisions. The SCOTUS corpus is an ideal classification task to study for LLM memory accuracy because it presents significant challenges due to extensive sentence length, complex legal terminology, non-standard structure, and domain-specific vocabulary. Experimentation is performed with the latest LLM fine tuning and retrieval-based approaches, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning, auto-modeling, and others, on two traditional category-based SCOTUS classification tasks: one with 15 labeled topics and another with 279. We show that prompt-based models with memories, such as DeepSeek, can be more robust than previous BERT-based models on both tasks scoring about 2 points better than previous models not based on prompting.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Upper Limits of Text-Based Collaborative Filtering Using Large Language Models: Discoveries and Insights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-based collaborative filtering (TCF) has emerged as the prominent technique for text and news recommendation, employing language models (LMs) as text encoders to represent items. However, the current landscape of TCF models mainly relies on the utilization of relatively small or medium-sized LMs. The potential impact of using larger, more powerful language models (such as these with over 100 billion parameters) as item encoders on recommendation performance remains uncertain. Can we anticipate unprecedented results and discover new insights?
  To address this question, we undertake a comprehensive series of experiments aimed at exploring the performance limits of the TCF paradigm. Specifically, we progressively augment the scale of item encoders, ranging fromone hundred million to one hundred billion parameters, in order to reveal the scaling limits of the TCF paradigm. Moreover, we investigate whether these exceptionally large LMs have the potential to establish a universal item representation for the recommendation task, thereby revolutionizing the traditional ID paradigm, which is considered a significant obstacle to developing transferable "one model fits all" recommender models. Our study not only demonstrates positive results but also uncovers unexpected negative outcomes, illuminating the current state of the TCF paradigm within the community. These findings will evoke deep reflection and inspire further research on text-based recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Can Offline Metrics Measure Explanation Goals? A Comparative Survey Analysis of Offline Explanation Metrics in Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14379v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explanations in a Recommender System (RS) provide reasons for recommendations to users and can enhance transparency, persuasiveness, engagement, and trust-known as explanation goals. Evaluating the effectiveness of explanation algorithms offline remains challenging due to subjectivity. Initially, we conducted a literature review on current offline metrics, revealing that algorithms are often assessed with anecdotal evidence, offering convincing examples, or with metrics that don't align with human perception. We investigated whether, in explanations connecting interacted and recommended items based on shared content, the selection of item attributes and interacted items affects explanation goals. Metrics measuring the diversity and popularity of attributes and the recency of item interactions were used to evaluate explanations from three state-of-the-art agnostic algorithms across six recommendation systems. These offline metrics were compared with results from an online user study. Our findings reveal a trade-off: transparency and trust relate to popular properties, while engagement and persuasiveness are linked to diversified properties. This study contributes to the development of more robust evaluation methods for explanation algorithms in recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Improving Collaborative Filtering Recommendation via Graph Learning</title>

Abstract: Recommendation systems aim to provide personalized predictions by identifying items that are most appealing to individual users. Among various recommendation approaches, k-nearest-neighbor (kNN)-based collaborative filtering (CF) remains one of the most widely used in practice. However, the kNN scheme often results in running the algorithm on a highly dense graph, which degrades computational efficiency. In addition, enforcing a uniform neighborhood size is not well suited to capturing the true underlying structure of the data. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in graph signal processing (GSP) to learn a sparse yet high-quality graph, improving the efficiency of collaborative filtering without sacrificing recommendation accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can successfully perform CF-based recommendation using an extremely sparse graph while maintaining competitive performance.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Self-Supervised Learning for Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Recommender systems play a crucial role in tackling the challenge of information overload by delivering personalized recommendations based on individual user preferences. Deep learning techniques, such as RNNs, GNNs, and Transformer architectures, have significantly propelled the advancement of recommender systems by enhancing their comprehension of user behaviors and preferences. However, supervised learning methods encounter challenges in real-life scenarios due to data sparsity, resulting in limitations in their ability to learn representations effectively. To address this, self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have emerged as a solution, leveraging inherent data structures to generate supervision signals without relying solely on labeled data. By leveraging unlabeled data and extracting meaningful representations, recommender systems utilizing SSL can make accurate predictions and recommendations even when confronted with data sparsity. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of self-supervised learning frameworks designed for recommender systems, encompassing a thorough analysis of over 170 papers. We conduct an exploration of nine distinct scenarios, enabling a comprehensive understanding of SSL-enhanced recommenders in different contexts. For each domain, we elaborate on different self-supervised learning paradigms, namely contrastive learning, generative learning, and adversarial learning, so as to present technical details of how SSL enhances recommender systems in various contexts. We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at https://github.com/HKUDS/Awesome-SSLRec-Papers.</description>

      <title>FlippedRAG: Black-Box Opinion Manipulation Adversarial Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02968v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches LLMs by dynamically retrieving external knowledge, reducing hallucinations and satisfying real-time information needs. While existing research mainly targets RAG's performance and efficiency, emerging studies highlight critical security concerns. Yet, current adversarial approaches remain limited, mostly addressing white-box scenarios or heuristic black-box attacks without fully investigating vulnerabilities in the retrieval phase. Additionally, prior works mainly focus on factoid Q&amp;A tasks, their attacks lack complexity and can be easily corrected by advanced LLMs. In this paper, we investigate a more realistic and critical threat scenario: adversarial attacks intended for opinion manipulation against black-box RAG models, particularly on controversial topics. Specifically, we propose FlippedRAG, a transfer-based adversarial attack against black-box RAG systems. We first demonstrate that the underlying retriever of a black-box RAG system can be reverse-engineered, enabling us to train a surrogate retriever. Leveraging the surrogate retriever, we further craft target poisoning triggers, altering vary few documents to effectively manipulate both retrieval and subsequent generation. Extensive empirical results show that FlippedRAG substantially outperforms baseline methods, improving the average attack success rate by 16.7%. FlippedRAG achieves on average a 50% directional shift in the opinion polarity of RAG-generated responses, ultimately causing a notable 20% shift in user cognition. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of several potential defensive measures, concluding that existing mitigation strategies remain insufficient against such sophisticated manipulation attacks. These results highlight an urgent need for developing innovative defensive solutions to ensure the security and trustworthiness of RAG systems.</description>

      <title>DeepResearchGym: A Free, Transparent, and Reproducible Evaluation Sandbox for Deep Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep research systems represent an emerging class of agentic information retrieval methods that generate comprehensive and well-supported reports to complex queries. However, most existing frameworks rely on dynamic commercial search APIs, which pose reproducibility and transparency challenges in addition to their cost. To address these limitations, we introduce \textsc{DeepResearchGym} as an open-source sandbox that combines a reproducible search API with a rigorous evaluation protocol for benchmarking deep research systems. The API indexes large-scale public web corpora, namely ClueWeb22 and FineWeb, using a state-of-the-art dense retriever and approximate nearest neighbor search via DiskANN. It achieves lower latency than popular commercial APIs while ensuring stable document rankings across runs, and is free for research use. To evaluate deep research systems' outputs, we extend the Researchy Questions benchmark with automatic metrics through LLM-as-a-judge to measure alignment with users' information needs, retrieval faithfulness, and report quality. Experimental results show that systems integrated with~\textsc{DeepResearchGym} achieve performance comparable to those using commercial APIs, with performance rankings remaining consistent across evaluation metrics. A case study on short-answer search agents further demonstrates the sandbox's utility for cost-effective training, showing that models trained within the sandbox can generalize to commercial search.</description>

      <title>ModernVBERT: Towards Smaller Visual Document Retrievers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieving specific information from a large corpus of documents is a prevalent industrial use case of modern AI, notably due to the popularity of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Although neural document retrieval models have historically operated exclusively in the text space, Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) models - large vision-language decoders repurposed as embedding models which directly work with page screenshots as inputs - are increasingly popular due to the performance and indexing latency gains they offer. In this work, we show that, while cost-efficient, this approach of repurposing generative models bottlenecks retrieval performance. Through controlled experiments, we revisit the entire training pipeline, and establish a principled recipe for improving visual document retrieval models. We notably measure the impact of attention masking, image resolution, modality alignment data regimes, and late interaction centered contrastive objectives which emerge as central performance factors. Building on these insights, we release ModernVBERT, a compact 250M-parameter vision-language encoder that outperforms recent models up to 10 times larger when fine-tuned on document retrieval tasks, enabling efficient inference on cheap CPU hardware and greatly reducing latency and costs while maintaining strong performance. Models, code and data are available at https://huggingface.co/ModernVBERT.</description>

      <title>HHFT: Hierarchical Heterogeneous Feature Transformer for Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose HHFT (Hierarchical Heterogeneous Feature Transformer), a Transformer-based architecture tailored for industrial CTR prediction. HHFT addresses the limitations of DNN through three key designs: (1) Semantic Feature Partitioning: Grouping heterogeneous features (e.g. user profile, item information, behaviour sequennce) into semantically coherent blocks to preserve domain-specific information; (2) Heterogeneous Transformer Encoder: Adopting block-specific QKV projections and FFNs to avoid semantic confusion between distinct feature types; (3) Hiformer Layer: Capturing high-order interactions across features. Our findings reveal that Transformers significantly outperform DNN baselines, achieving a +0.4% improvement in CTR AUC at scale. We have successfully deployed the model on Taobao's production platform, observing a significant uplift in key business metrics, including a +0.6% increase in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV).</description>

      <title>Meta Lattice: Model Space Redesign for Cost-Effective Industry-Scale Ads Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapidly evolving landscape of products, surfaces, policies, and regulations poses significant challenges for deploying state-of-the-art recommendation models at industry scale, primarily due to data fragmentation across domains and escalating infrastructure costs that hinder sustained quality improvements.
  To address this challenge, we propose Lattice, a recommendation framework centered around model space redesign that extends Multi-Domain, Multi-Objective (MDMO) learning beyond models and learning objectives. Lattice addresses these challenges through a comprehensive model space redesign that combines cross-domain knowledge sharing, data consolidation, model unification, distillation, and system optimizations to achieve significant improvements in both quality and cost-efficiency.
  Our deployment of Lattice at Meta has resulted in 10% revenue-driving top-line metrics gain, 11.5% user satisfaction improvement, 6% boost in conversion rate, with 20% capacity saving.</description>

      <title>STARS: Semantic Tokens with Augmented Representations for Recommendation at Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world ecommerce recommender systems must deliver relevant items under strict tens-of-milliseconds latency constraints despite challenges such as cold-start products, rapidly shifting user intent, and dynamic context including seasonality, holidays, and promotions. We introduce STARS, a transformer-based sequential recommendation framework built for large-scale, low-latency ecommerce settings. STARS combines several innovations: dual-memory user embeddings that separate long-term preferences from short-term session intent; semantic item tokens that fuse pretrained text embeddings, learnable deltas, and LLM-derived attribute tags, strengthening content-based matching, long-tail coverage, and cold-start performance; context-aware scoring with learned calendar and event offsets; and a latency-conscious two-stage retrieval pipeline that performs offline embedding generation and online maximum inner-product search with filtering, enabling tens-of-milliseconds response times. In offline evaluations on production-scale data, STARS improves Hit@5 by more than 75 percent relative to our existing LambdaMART system. A large-scale A/B test on 6 million visits shows statistically significant lifts, including Total Orders +0.8%, Add-to-Cart on Home +2.0%, and Visits per User +0.5%. These results demonstrate that combining semantic enrichment, multi-intent modeling, and deployment-oriented design can yield state-of-the-art recommendation quality in real-world environments without sacrificing serving efficiency.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Popularity Bias in Collaborative Filtering via Analytical Vector Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Popularity bias fundamentally undermines the personalization capabilities of collaborative filtering (CF) models, causing them to disproportionately recommend popular items while neglecting users' genuine preferences for niche content. While existing approaches treat this as an external confounding factor, we reveal that popularity bias is an intrinsic geometric artifact of Bayesian Pairwise Ranking (BPR) optimization in CF models. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that BPR systematically organizes item embeddings along a dominant "popularity direction" where embedding magnitudes directly correlate with interaction frequency. This geometric distortion forces user embeddings to simultaneously handle two conflicting tasks-expressing genuine preference and calibrating against global popularity-trapping them in suboptimal configurations that favor popular items regardless of individual tastes. We propose Directional Decomposition and Correction (DDC), a universally applicable framework that surgically corrects this embedding geometry through asymmetric directional updates. DDC guides positive interactions along personalized preference directions while steering negative interactions away from the global popularity direction, disentangling preference from popularity at the geometric source. Extensive experiments across multiple BPR-based architectures demonstrate that DDC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art debiasing methods, reducing training loss to less than 5% of heavily-tuned baselines while achieving superior recommendation quality and fairness.

      <title>Adaptive Risk Mitigation in Demand Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.10690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study dynamic pricing of a product with an unknown demand distribution over a finite horizon. Departing from the standard no-regret learning environment in which prices can be adjusted at any time, we restrict price changes to predetermined points in time to reflect common retail practice. This constraint, coupled with demand model ambiguity and an unknown customer arrival pattern, imposes a high risk of revenue loss, as a price based on a misestimated demand model may be applied to many customers before it can be revised. We develop an adaptive risk learning (ARL) framework that embeds a data-driven ambiguity set (DAS) to quantify demand model ambiguity by adapting to the unknown arrival pattern. Initially, when arrivals are few, the DAS includes a broad set of plausible demand models, reflecting high ambiguity and revenue risk. As new data is collected through pricing, the DAS progressively shrinks, capturing the reduction in model ambiguity and associated risk. We establish the probabilistic convergence of the DAS to the true demand model and derive a regret bound for the ARL policy that explicitly links revenue loss to the data required for the DAS to identify the true model with high probability. The dependence of our regret bound on the arrival pattern is unique to our constrained dynamic pricing problem and contrasts with no-regret learning environments, where regret is constant and arrival-pattern independent. Relaxing the constraint on infrequent price changes, we show that ARL attains the known constant regret bound. Numerical experiments further demonstrate that ARL outperforms benchmarks that prioritize either regret or risk alone by adaptively balancing both without knowledge of the arrival pattern. This adaptive risk adjustment is crucial for achieving high revenues and low downside risk when prices are sticky and both demand and arrival patterns are unknown.</description>

Abstract: Traditional vertical federated learning schema suffers from two main issues: 1) restricted applicable scope to overlapped samples and 2) high system challenge of real-time federated serving, which limits its application to advertising systems. To this end, we advocate a new practical learning setting, Semi-VFL (Vertical Semi-Federated Learning), for real-world industrial applications, where the learned model retains sufficient advantages of federated learning while supporting independent local serving. To achieve this goal, we propose the carefully designed Joint Privileged Learning framework (JPL) to i) alleviate the absence of the passive party's feature with federated equivalence imitation and ii) adapt to the heterogeneous full sample space with cross-branch rank alignment. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world advertising datasets validate the effectiveness of our method over baseline methods.</description>

      <title>OM4OV: Leveraging Ontology Matching for Ontology Versioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20302v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the dynamic nature of the Semantic Web, version control is necessary to capture time-varying information for widely used ontologies. Despite the long-standing recognition of ontology versioning (OV) as a crucial component of efficient ontology management, many views treat OV as similar to ontology matching (OM) and directly reuse OM systems for OV tasks. In this study, we systematically analyse the similarities and differences between OM and OV and formalise the OM4OV pipeline. The pipeline is implemented and evaluated in the state-of-the-art OM system Agent-OM. The experimental results indicate that OM systems can be reused for OV tasks, but without necessary modifications, the current OM4OV pipeline can produce skewed measurements, poor performance in detecting update entities, and less explainability for false mappings. To tackle these issues, we propose an optimisation method called the cross-reference (CR) mechanism, building upon the existing alignment(s) from OM to reduce the number of matching candidates and improve overall OV performance.</description>

      <title>Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical Evidence: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation System for Querying UK NICE Clinical Guidelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for querying the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines using Large Language Models (LLMs). The extensive length and volume of these guidelines can impede their utilisation within a time-constrained healthcare system, a challenge this project addresses through the creation of a system capable of providing users with precisely matched information in response to natural language queries. The system's retrieval architecture, composed of a hybrid embedding mechanism, was evaluated against a corpus of 10,195 text chunks derived from three hundred guidelines. It demonstrates high performance, with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.814, a Recall of 81% at the first chunk and of 99.1% within the top ten retrieved chunks, when evaluated on 7901 queries. The most significant impact of the RAG system was observed during the generation phase. When evaluated on a manually curated dataset of seventy question-answer pairs, RAG-enhanced models showed substantial gains in performance. Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the source text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the RAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused Meditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. Clinical evaluation by seven Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) further validated these findings, with GPT-4.1 achieving 98.7% accuracy while reducing unsafe responses by 67% compared to O4-Mini (from 3.0 to 1.0 per evaluator). This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling cost-effective access to medical guidelines.</description>

      <title>Spatially-Grounded Document Retrieval via Patch-to-Region Relevance Propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Late-interaction multimodal retrieval models like ColPali achieve state-of-the-art document retrieval by embedding pages as images and computing fine-grained similarity between query tokens and visual patches. However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on area efficiency. We evaluate on BBox-DocVQA with ground-truth bounding boxes. For within-page localization (given correct page retrieval), ColQwen3-4B with percentile-50 thresholding achieves 59.7% hit rate at IoU@0.5 (84.4% at IoU@0.25, 35.8% at IoU@0.7), with mean IoU of 0.569, compared to ~6.7% for random region selection. Our approach reduces context tokens by 28.8% compared to returning all OCR regions and by 52.3% compared to full-page image tokens. Our approach operates at inference time without additional training. We release Snappy, an open-source implementation at https://github.com/athrael-soju/Snappy.</description>

Abstract: Email phishing is one of the most prevalent and globally consequential vectors of cyber intrusion. As systems increasingly deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) applications, these systems face evolving phishing email threats that exploit their fundamental architectures. Current LLMs require substantial hardening before deployment in email security systems, particularly against coordinated multi-vector attacks that exploit architectural vulnerabilities. This paper proposes LLMPEA, an LLM-based framework to detect phishing email attacks across multiple attack vectors, including prompt injection, text refinement, and multilingual attacks. We evaluate three frontier LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Grok-3) and comprehensive prompting design to assess their feasibility, robustness, and limitations against phishing email attacks. Our empirical analysis reveals that LLMs can detect the phishing email over 90% accuracy while we also highlight that LLM-based phishing email detection systems could be exploited by adversarial attack, prompt injection, and multilingual attacks. Our findings provide critical insights for LLM-based phishing detection in real-world settings where attackers exploit multiple vulnerabilities in combination.</description>
