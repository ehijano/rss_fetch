      <title>Sign-changing solutions of variational inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the sign-changing solutions of variational inequality problems. In order to give the existence results of the sign-changing solutions for variational inequality problems, we first construct a suitable penalty problem related to the variational inequality, and prove the existence of a sign-changing solution for this penalty problem using the invariant set of descending flow method. Secondly, we perform a series of estimates on the sign-changing solution sequence of the penalty problem, and prove that the limit of convergence of the sign-changing solution sequence is the sign-changing solution of the original variational inequality problem. Variational inequality problems have extensive and important applications. In this paper, we used penalty method and the method of invariant set of descending flow to obtain the existence results for solutions of a variational inequality. In particular, we obtain the existence results for sign-changing solutions of variational inequalities for the first time based on the method of invariant set of descending flow.</description>

      <title>Classification of positive solutions of critical anisotropic Sobolev equation without the finite volume constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify all positive solutions of the critical anisotropic Sobolev equation \begin{equation*} -\Delta^{H}_{p}u = u^{p^{*}-1}, \ \ x\in \mathbb{R}^n \end{equation*} without the finite volume constraint for $n \geq 2$ and $\frac{(n+1)}{3} \leq p &lt; n$, where $p^{*} = \frac{np}{n-p}$ denotes the critical Sobolev exponent and $-\Delta^{H}_{p}=-div(H^{p-1}(\cdot)\nabla H(\cdot))$ denotes the anisotropic $p$-Laplace operator. This result removes the finite volume assumption on the classification of critical anisotropic $p$-Laplace equation which was obtained by Ciraolo-Figalli-Roncoroni in the literature \cite{CFR}. The method is based on constructing suitable vector fields integral inequality and using Newton's type inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper consists in using variational methods to establish the existence of heteroclinic solutions for some classes of prescribed mean curvature equations of the type
  $$
  -div\left(\frac{\nabla u}{\sqrt{1+|\nabla u|^2}}\right) + A(\epsilon x,y)V'(u)=0~~\text{ in }~~\mathbb{R}^2,
  $$
  where $\epsilon&gt;0$ and $V$ is a double-well potential with minima at $t=\alpha$ and $t=\beta$ with $\alpha&lt;\beta$. Here, we consider some class of functions $A(x,y)$ that are oscillatory in the variable $y$ and satisfy different geometric conditions such as periodicity in all variables or asymptotically periodic at infinity.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Heteroclinic Solutions in a Class of Autonomous Quasilinear ODE Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence, uniqueness and qualitative properties of heteroclinic solution for a class of autonomous quasilinear ordinary differential equations of the Allen-Cahn type given by
  $$
  -\left(\phi(|u'|)u'\right)'+V'(u)=0~~\text{ in }~~\mathbb{R},
  $$
  where $V$ is a double-well potential with minima at $t=\pm\alpha$ and $\phi:(0,+\infty)\to(0,+\infty)$ is a $C^1$ function satisfying some technical assumptions. Our results include the classic case $\phi(t)=t^{p-2}$, which is related to the celebrated $p$-Laplacian operator, presenting the explicit solution in this specific scenario. Moreover, we also study the case $\phi(t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^2}}$, which is directly associated with the prescribed mean curvature operator.</description>

      <title>Saddle solutions for Allen-Cahn type equations involving the prescribed mean curvature operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to investigate the existence of saddle solutions for some classes of elliptic partial differential equations of the Allen-Cahn type, formulated as follows:
  \begin{equation*}
  -div\left(\frac{\nabla u}{\sqrt{1+|\nabla u|^2}}\right) + A(x,y)V'(u)=0~~\text{ in }~~\mathbb{R}^2.
  \end{equation*}
  Here, the function $A:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$ exhibits periodicity in all its arguments, while $V:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ characterizes a double-well symmetric potential with minima at $t=\pm\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Periodic traveling waves for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with non-zero conditions at infinity in $ \R ^2 $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonzero conditions at infinity in $\R^2$. We investigate the existence of traveling waves that are periodic in the direction transverse to the direction of propagation and minimize the energy when the momentum is kept fixed. We show that for any given value of the momentum, there is a critical value of the period such that traveling waves with period smaller than the critical value are one-dimensional, and those with larger periods depend on two variables.</description>

      <title>Solutions to discrete nonlinear Kirchhoff-Choquard equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the discrete Kirchhoff-Choquard equation $$ -\left(a+b \int_{\mathbb{Z}^3}|\nabla u|^{2} d \mu\right) \Delta u+V(x) u=\left(R_{\alpha} *F(u)\right)f(u),\quad x\in \mathbb{Z}^3, $$ where $a,\,b&gt;0$ are constants, $R_{\alpha}$ is the Green's function of the discrete fractional Laplacian with $\alpha \in(0,3)$, which has no singularity but has same asymptotics as the Riesz potential. Under some suitable assumptions on $V$ and $f$, we prove the existence of nontrivial solutions and ground state solutions by variational methods.</description>

      <title>Effective medium theory for Van-Der-Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the electromagnetic medium equivalent to a collection of all-dielectric nano-particles (enjoying high refractive indices) distributed locally non-periodically in a smooth domain $\Omega$. Such distributions are used to model well known structures in material sciences as the Van-der-Waals heterostructures. Since the nano-particles are all-dielectric, then the permittivity remains unchanged while the permeability is altered by this effective medium. This equivalent medium describes, in particular, the effective medium of 2 dimensional type Van-der-Waals heterostructures. These structures are 3 dimensional which are build as superposition of identical (2D)-sheets each supporting locally non-periodic distributions of nano-particles. An explicit form of this effective medium is provided for the particular case of honeycomb heterostructures.
  At the mathematical analysis level, we propose a new approach to derive the effective medium when the subwavelength nano-particles are distributed non-periodically. The first step consists in deriving the point interaction approximation, also called the Foldy-Lax approximation. The scattered field is given as a superposition of dipoles (or poles for other models) multiplied by the elements of a vector which is itself solution of an algebraic system. This step is done regardless of the way how the particles are distributed. As a second step, which is the new and critical step, we rewrite this algebraic system according to the way how these nano-particles are locally distributed. The new algebraic system will then fix the related continuous Lippmann Schwinger system which, in its turn, indicates naturally the equivalent medium.</description>

      <title>Refined behavior and structural universality of the blow-up profile for the semilinear heat equation with non scale invariant nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the semilinear heat equation $$u_t-\Delta u=f(u) $$
  for a large class of non scale invariant nonlinearities of the form
  $f(u)=u^pL(u)$, where $p&gt;1$ is Sobolev subcritical and $L$ is a slowly varying function (which includes for instance logarithms and their powers and iterates, as well as some strongly oscillating functions).
  For any positive radial decreasing blow-up solution, we obtain the sharp, global blow-up profile in the scale of the original variables $(x, t)$, which takes the form:
  $$u(x,t)=(1+o(1))\,G^{-1}\bigg(T-t+\frac{p-1}{8p}\frac{|x|^2}{|\log |x||}\bigg),
  \ \hbox{as $(x,t)\to (0,T)$, \quad where } G(X)=\int_{X}^{\infty}\frac{ ds}{f(s)}.$$ This estimate in particular provides the sharp final space profile and the refined space-time profile.
  As a remarkable fact and completely new observation, our results reveal a {\it structural universality} of the global blow-up profile, being given by the "resolvent" $G^{-1}$ of the ODE, composed with a universal, time-space building block, which is the same as in the pure power case.</description>

      <title>Transition threshold for the 2-D Couette flow in whole space via Green's function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transition threshold problem concerning the 2-D Navier-Stokes equations in the context of Couette flow $(y,0)$ at high Reynolds number $Re$ in whole space. By utilizing Green's function estimates for the linearized equations around Couette flow, we initially establish refined dissipation estimates for the linearized Navier-Stokes equations with a precise decay rate $(1+t)^{-1}.$ As an application, we prove that if the initial perturbation of vorticity satisfies$$\|\omega_{0}\|_{H^{1}\cap L^1}\leq c_0\nu^{\frac{3}{4}}$$ for some small constant $c_0$ independent of the viscosity $\nu$, then we can reach the conclusion that the solution remains within $O\left( \nu ^{\frac{3}{4}}\right) $ of the Couette flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Pohozaev identities, Kelvin transformation and their applications of semilinear Grushin equation. First, we establish two Pohozaev identities generated from translations and determine the location of the concentration point for solution of a kind of Grushin equation by such identities. Next, we establish Pohozaev identity generated from scaling and prove the nonexistence of nontrivial solutions of another kind of Grushin equation by such identity. Finally, we provide the change of Grushin operator by Kelvin transformation and obtain the decay rate of solution at infinity for a critical Grushin equation by Kelvin transformation.</description>

      <title>Single-peak and multi-peak solutions for Hamiltonian elliptic systems in dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the Hamiltonian elliptic system in dimension two\begin{equation*}\aligned \left\{ \begin{array}{lll} -\epsilon^2\Delta u+V(x)u=g(v)\ &amp; \text{in}\quad \mathbb{R}^2,\\ -\epsilon^2\Delta v+V(x)v=f(u)\ &amp; \text{in}\quad \mathbb{R}^2, \end{array}\right.\endaligned \end{equation*} where $V\in C(\mathbb{R}^2)$ has local minimum points, and $f,g\in C^1(\mathbb{R})$ are assumed to be of exponential growth in the sense of Trudinger-Moser inequality. When $V$ admits one or several local strict minimum points, we show the existence and concentration of single-peak and multi-peak semiclassical states respectively, as well as strong convergence and exponential decay. In addition, positivity of solutions and uniqueness of local maximum points of solutions are also studied. Our theorems extend the results of Ramos and Tavares [Calc. Var. 31 (2008) 1-25], where $f$ and $g$ have polynomial growth. It seems that it is the first attempt to obtain multi-peak semiclassical states for Hamiltonian elliptic system with exponential growth.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the solution to an elliptic diffraction problem in the union of a smooth set $\Omega$ and a thin layer $\Sigma$ locally described by $\varepsilon h$, where $h$ is a positive function defined on the boundary $\partial\Omega$, and $\varepsilon$ is the ellipticity constant of the differential operator in the thin layer $\Sigma$. We study the problem in the limit for $\varepsilon$ going to zero and prove a first-order asymptotic development by $\Gamma$-convergence of the associated energy functional.</description>

Abstract: We investigate nonexistence of nontrivial nonnegative solutions to a class of semilinear parabolic equations with a positive potential, posed on weighted graphs. Assuming an upper bound on the Laplacian of the distance and a suitable weighted space-time volume growth condition, we show that no global solutions exists. We also discuss the optimality of the hypotheses, thus recovering a critical exponent phenomenon of Fujita type.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on studying the long-time dynamics of the subordination process for a range of linear evolution equations, with a special emphasis on the fractional heat equation. By treating inverse subordinators as random time variables and employing the subordination principle to solve forward Kolmogorov equations, we explore the behavior of the solutions over extended periods. We provide a detailed description of the specific classes of subordinators suitable for conducting asymptotic analysis. Our findings not only extend existing research, but also enhance the results previously presented in [9, 10].</description>

      <title>Cahn-Hilliard equations with singular potential, reaction term and pure phase initial datum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider local and nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equations with constant mobility and singular potentials including, e.g., the Flory-Huggins potential, subject to no-flux (or periodic) boundary conditions. The main goal is to show that the presence of a suitable class of reaction terms allows to establish the existence of a weak solution to the corresponding initial and boundary value problem even though the initial condition is a pure state. In other words, the separation process takes place even in presence of a pure phase, provided that it is triggered by a convenient reaction term. This fact was already observed by the authors in a previous contribution devoted to a specific biological model. In this context, we generalize the previously-mentioned concept by examining the essential assumptions required for the reaction term to apply the new strategy. Also, we explore the scenario involving the nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation and provide illustrative examples that contextualize within our abstract framework.</description>

      <title>No pattern formation in a quasilinear chemotaxis model with local sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convergence to spatially homogeneous steady states is shown for a chemotaxis model with local sensing and possibly nonlinear diffusion when the intrinsic diffusion rate $\phi$ dominates the inverse of the chemotactic motility function $\gamma$, in the sense that $(\phi\gamma)'\ge 0$. This result encompasses and complies with the analysis and numerical simulations performed in Choi \&amp; Kim (2023). The proof involves two steps: first, a Liapunov functional is constructed when $\phi\gamma$ is non-decreasing. The convergence proof relies on a detailed study of the dissipation of the Liapunov functional and requires additional technical assumptions on $\phi$ and $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Mathematical analysis of a model-constrained inverse problem for the reconstruction of early states of prostate cancer growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The availability of cancer measurements over time enables the personalised assessment of tumour growth and therapeutic response dynamics. However, many tumours are treated after diagnosis without collecting longitudinal data, and cancer monitoring protocols may include infrequent measurements. To facilitate the estimation of disease dynamics and better guide ensuing clinical decisions, we investigate an inverse problem enabling the reconstruction of earlier tumour states by using a single spatial tumour dataset and a biomathematical model describing disease dynamics. We focus on prostate cancer, since aggressive cases of this disease are usually treated after diagnosis. We describe tumour dynamics with a phase-field model driven by a generic nutrient ruled by reaction-diffusion dynamics. The model is completed with another reaction-diffusion equation for the local production of prostate-specific antigen, which is a key prostate cancer biomarker. We first improve previous well-posedness results by further showing that the solution operator is continuously Fr\'echet differentiable. We then analyse the backward inverse problem concerning the reconstruction of earlier tumour states starting from measurements of the model variables at the final time. Since this problem is severely ill-posed, only very weak conditional stability of logarithmic type can be recovered from the terminal data. However, by restricting the unknowns to a compact subset of a finite-dimensional subspace, we can derive an optimal Lipschitz stability estimate.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a broad class of fully nonlinear elliptic equations on Hermitian manifolds. On one hand, under the optimal structural assumptions we derive $C^{2,\alpha}$-estimate for solutions of the equations on closed Hermitian manifolds. On the other hand, we treat the Dirichlet problem. In both cases, we prove the existence theorems with unbounded condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1991, Ramshaw and Mesina proposed a novel synthesis of penalty methods and artificial compression methods. When the two were balanced they found the combination was 3-4 orders more accurate than either alone. This report begins the study of their interesting method applied to the Navier-Stokes equations. We perform stability analysis, semi-discrete error analysis, and tests of the algorithm. Although most of the results for implicit time discretizations of our numerical tests comply with theirs for explicit time discretizations, the behavior in damping pressure oscillations and violations of incompressibility are different from their findings and our heuristic analysis.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we define a model of non-interacting quantum fields satisfying $(\Delta_g-\lambda^2)\phi=0$ on a Riemannian scattering space $(M,g)$ with two boundary components, i.e. a manifold with two asymptotically conic ends (meaning asymptotic to the "large end" of a cone). Our main result describes a canonical construction of two-point functions satisfying a version of the Hadamard condition.</description>

      <title>Global regularity of integral 2-varifolds with square integrable mean curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide sharp sufficient criteria for an integral $2$-varifold to be induced by a $W^{2,2}$-conformal immersion of a smooth surface. Our approach is based on a fine analysis of the Hausdorff density for $2$-varifolds with critical integrability of the mean curvature and a recent local regularity result by Bi-Zhou. In codimension one, there are only three possible density values below $2$, each of which can be attained with equality in the Li--Yau inequality for the Willmore functional by the unit sphere, the double bubble, and the triple bubble. We show that below an optimal threshold for the Willmore energy, a varifold induced by a current without boundary is in fact a curvature varifold with a uniform bound on its second fundamental form. Consequently, the minimization of the Willmore functional in the class of curvature varifolds with prescribed even Euler characteristic provides smooth solutions for the Willmore problem. In particular, the "ambient" varifold approach and the "parametric" approach are equivalent for minimizing the Willmore energy.</description>

      <title>Quantitative homogenization and hydrodynamic limit of non-gradient exclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the non-gradient exclusion process, we prove its approximation rate of diffusion matrix/conductivity by local functions. The proof follows the quantitative homogenization theory developed by Armstrong, Kuusi, Mourrat and Smart, while the new challenge here is the hard core constraint of particle number on every site. Therefore, a coarse-grained method is proposed to lift the configuration to a larger space without exclusion, and a gradient coupling between two systems is applied to capture the spatial cancellation. Moreover, the approximation rate of conductivity is uniform with respect to the density via the regularity of the local corrector. As an application, we integrate this result in the work by Funaki, Uchiyama and Yau [IMA Vol. Math. Appl., 77 (1996), pp. 1-40.] and yield a quantitative hydrodynamic limit. In particular, our new approach avoids to show the characterization of closed forms. We also discuss the possible extensions in the presence of disorder on the bonds.</description>

Abstract: We consider the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb{T}^2$ with Wick ordered power nonlinearity, and prove almost sure global well-posedness with respect to the associated Gibbs measure. The heart of the matter is the uniqueness of the solution as limit of solutions to canonically truncated systems. The invariance of the Gibbs measure under the global dynamics follows as a consequence. The proof relies on the novel idea of random averaging operators.</description>

Abstract: We consider a nonlinear parabolic equation with a nonlocal term, which preserves the $L^2$-norm of the solution. We study the local and global well posedness on a bounded domain, as well as the whole Euclidean space, in $H^1$. Then we study the asymptotic behavior of solutions. In general, we obtain weak convergence in H^1 to a stationary state. For a ball, we prove strong asymptotic convergence to the ground state when the initial condition is positive.</description>

      <title>Construction of unstable concentrated solutions of the Euler and gSQG equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct solutions to the Euler and gSQG equations that are concentrated near unstable stationary configurations of point-vortices. Those solutions are themselves unstable, in the sense that their localization radius grows from order $\varepsilon$ to order $\varepsilon^\beta$ (with $\beta &lt; 1$) in a time of order $|\ln\varepsilon|$. This proves in particular that the logarithmic lower-bound obtained in previous papers (in particular [P. Butt\`a and C. Marchioro, Long time evolution of concentrated Euler flows with planar symmetry, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 50(1):735-760, 2018]) about vorticity localization in Euler and gSQG equations is optimal. In addition we construct unstable solutions of the Euler equations in bounded domains concentrated around a single unstable stationary point. To achieve this we construct a domain whose Robin's function has a saddle point.</description>

      <title>The semiclassical limit from the Pauli-Poisswell to the Euler-Poisswell system by WKB methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06660v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-consistent Pauli-Poisswell equation for 2-spinors is the first order in $1/c$ semi-relativistic approximation of the Dirac-Maxwell equation for 4-spinors coupled to the self-consistent electromagnetic fields generated by the density and current density of a fast moving electric charge. It consists of a vector-valued magnetic Schr\"odinger equation with an extra term coupling spin and magnetic field via the Pauli matrices coupled to 1+3 Poisson type equations as the magnetostatic approximation of Maxwell's equations. The Pauli-Poisswell equation is a consistent $O(1/c)$ model that keeps both relativistic effects magnetism and spin which are both absent in the non-relativistic Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation and inconsistent in the magnetic Schr\"odinger-Maxwell equation.
  We present the mathematically rigorous semiclassical limit $\hbar \rightarrow 0$ of the Pauli-Poisswell equation towards the magnetic Euler-Poisswell equation. We use WKB analysis which is valid locally in time only. A key step is to obtain an a priori energy estimate for which we have to take into account the Poisson equations for the magnetic potential with the current as source term. Additionally we obtain the weak convergence of the monokinetic Wigner transform and strong convergence of the density and the current density. We also prove local wellposedness of the Euler-Poisswell equation which is global unless a finite time blow-up occurs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15974v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we provide a survey of Fuglede's flux extensions of first order partial differential operators, a concept largely forgotten today. A long the way we also survey the classical weak and strong extensions of PDE operators and the works of Friedrichs and H\"ormander. We give several applications of this theory showing its usefulness, as well as connecting it to more recent developments in connection to various sharp versions of the divergence theorem. In particular, we use it to prove a generalization of Morera's theorem valid for general first order operators. Using this theory we also prove a new local limit formula for the maximal extension of a first order operator. We initiate a study of this limit and connect it to the wave cone of the operator, a concept that first arose in the theory of compensated compactness. Hopefully, this will contribute to a rival of Fuglede's beautiful ideas.</description>

      <title>A $\mathrm{L}^2$-maximum principle for circular arcs on the disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we prove a novel $\mathrm{L}^2$-maximum principle for harmonic functions on the disk with respect to circular arcs. More precisely, we prove that for any harmonic function $u$ on a disk $\Omega$ with non-tangential maximal function in $\mathrm{L}^2(\partial \Omega)$, the supremum of $\lVert u \rVert_{\mathrm{L}^2 (\Gamma)}$ over circular arcs $\Gamma \subset \overline{\Omega}$ is attained at the boundary $\Gamma = \partial \Omega$. We achieve this through a sharp geometry-dependent estimate on the norm $\lVert u \rVert_{\mathrm{L}^2(\Gamma)}$ in the special case where $\Gamma$ is a circular arc intersecting the boundary of $\Omega$ in exactly two points and the boundary data $u\rvert_{\partial \Omega}$ is supported along one of the connected components of $\partial \Omega\setminus \overline{\Gamma}$. As a corollary of this result, we also deduce new $\mathrm{L}^p$ maximum principles with $p \in [2,\infty)$ for circular arcs on the disk. These results have applications in the convergence analysis of Schwarz domain decomposition methods on the union of overlapping disks.
  We have discovered a critical error in the proof of Lemma 3.9 (highlighted in red in the paper), and therefore, the proof of Theorem 1.2 presented here is only valid under the restriction $\pi/2 \leq \theta+\sigma\leq 3\pi/2$, where $\theta,\sigma$ are the angles described in Section 2. In particular, the proofs of Corollaries 1.3--1.5 are incomplete.</description>

Abstract: Llarull's theorem characterizes the round sphere $S^n$ among all spin manifolds whose scalar curvature is bounded from below by $n(n-1)$. In this paper we show that if the scalar curvature is bounded from below by $n(n-1)-\varepsilon$, the underlying manifold is $C^0$-close to a finite number of spheres outside a small bad set. This completely solves Gromov's spherical stability problem.</description>

      <title>Extended symmetry analysis of (1+2)-dimensional fine Kolmogorov backward equation</title>

Abstract: Within the class of (1+2)-dimensional ultraparabolic linear equations, we distinguish a fine Kolmogorov backward equation with a quadratic diffusivity. Modulo the point equivalence, it is a unique equation within the class whose essential Lie invariance algebra is five-dimensional and nonsolvable. Using the direct method, we compute the point symmetry pseudogroup of this equation and analyze its structure. In particular, we single out its essential subgroup and classify its discrete elements. We exhaustively classify all subalgebras of the corresponding essential Lie invariance algebra up to inner automorphisms and up to the action of the essential point-symmetry group. This allowed us to classify Lie reductions and Lie invariant solutions of the equation under consideration. We also discuss the generation of its solutions using point and linear generalized symmetries and carry out its peculiar generalized reductions. As a result, we construct wide families of its solutions parameterized by an arbitrary finite number of arbitrary solutions of the (1+1)-dimensional linear heat equation or one or two arbitrary solutions of (1+1)-dimensional linear heat equations with inverse square potentials.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous compensation of input delay and state/input quantization for linear systems via switched predictor feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a switched predictor-feedback law, which achieves global asymptotic stabilization of linear systems with input delay and with the plant and actuator states available only in (almost) quantized form. The control design relies on a quantized version of the nominal predictor-feedback law for linear systems, in which quantized measurements of the plant and actuator states enter the predictor state formula. A switching strategy is constructed to dynamically adjust the tunable parameter of the quantizer (in a piecewise constant manner), in order to initially increase the range and subsequently decrease the error of the quantizers. The key element in the proof of global asymptotic stability in the supremum norm of the actuator state is derivation of solutions' estimates combining a backstepping transformation with small-gain and input-to-state stability arguments, for addressing the error due to quantization. We extend this result to the input quantization case and illustrate our theory with a numerical example.</description>
