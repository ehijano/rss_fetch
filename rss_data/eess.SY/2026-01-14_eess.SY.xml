      <title>Human as an Actuator Dynamic Model Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for estimating parameters that form a general model for human pilot response for specific tasks. The human model is essential for the dynamic analysis of piloted vehicles. Data are generated on a simulator with multiple trials being incorporated to find the single model that best describes the data. The model is found entirely in the time domain by constructing a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem implicitly represents the state of the underlying system, making it robust to natural variation in human responses. It is demonstrated by estimating the human response model for a position control task with a quadcopter drone.</description>

      <title>Can Inherent Communication Noise Guarantee Privacy in Distributed Cooperative Control ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates privacy-preserving distributed cooperative control for multi-agent systems within the framework of differential privacy. In cooperative control, communication noise is inevitable and is usually regarded as a disturbance that impairs coordination. This work revisits such noise as a potential privacy-enhancing factor. A linear quadratic regulator (LQR)-based framework is proposed for agents communicating over noisy channels, \textcolor{black}{where the noise variance depends on the relative state differences between neighbouring agents.} The resulting controller achieves formation while protecting the reference signals from inference attacks. It is analytically proven that the inherent communication noise can guarantee bounded $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy without adding dedicated privacy noise, while the \textcolor{black}{system cooperative tracking error} remains bounded and convergent in both the mean-square and almost-sure sense.</description>

      <title>Formalizing the Relationship between Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unify Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability and Reinforcement Learning (RL) through a proposed running cost formulation. We prove that the resultant travel-cost value function is the unique bounded viscosity solution of a time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi Bellman (HJB) Partial Differential Equation (PDE) with zero terminal data, whose negative sublevel set equals the strict backward-reachable tube. Using a forward reparameterization and a contraction inducing Bellman update, we show that fixed points of small-step RL value iteration converge to the viscosity solution of the forward discounted HJB. Experiments on a classical benchmark compare learned values to semi-Lagrangian HJB ground truth and quantify error.</description>

      <title>DRL-based Power Allocation in LiDAL-Assisted RLNC-NOMA OWC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technique for optical wireless communication (OWC), enabling multiple users to share the optical spectrum simultaneously through the power domain. However, the imperfection of channel state information (CSI) and residual errors in decoding process deteriorate the performance of NOMA, especially when multi-parameteric and realistic dense-user indoor scenarios are considered. In this work, we model a LiDAL-assisted RLNC-NOMA OWC system, where the light detection and localization (LiDAL) technique exploits spatio-temporal information to improve user CSI, while random linear network coding (RLNC) enhances data resilience in the NOMA successive decoding process. Power allocation (PA) is a crucial issue in communication systems, particularly in the modeled system, due to the complex interactions between multiple users and the coding and detection processes. However, optimizing continuous PA dynamically requires advanced techniques to avoid excessive computational complexity. Therefore, we adopt a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to efficiently learn near-optimal power allocation strategies, enabling enhanced system performance. In particular, a DRL-based normalized advantage function (NAF) algorithm is proposed to maximize the average sum rate of the system, and its performance is analyzed and compared to other widely used DRL-based and conventional PA schemes, such as deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), gain ratio PA (GRPA), and exhaustive search.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Cooling and Compute Management for AI Datacenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AI datacenters are currently being deployed on a large scale to support the training and deployment of power-intensive large-language models (LLMs). Extensive amount of computation and cooling required in datacenters increase concerns about the energy use and carbon emissions of AI datacenters. Although current state-of-the-art has examined the energy efficiency of LLM inference, most prior research focused on optimizing compute-side scheduling without considering thermal objectives or constraints. Since GPU-intensive inference generates substantial heat that can degrade datacenter performance, ignoring thermal effects can increase total energy consumption and reduce the efficiency of LLM serving. To fill this gap, we profile the characteristics of GPU servers under varying cooling and AI jobs, and develop a joint cooling and computing modeling approach for AI datacenters. Built upon such workload and thermal dynamics models, a novel hierarchical control framework is proposed to co-optimize computing and thermal management by identifying the optimal GPU parallelism, frequency (DVFS), and cooling control knobs. Using real Azure inference traces and detailed GPU profiling, our model balances serving latency and thermal constraints in AI datacenters while significantly improving AI datacenters' energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Memetic Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy for Bilinear Matrix Inequality Problems in Control System Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilinear Matrix Inequalities (BMIs) are fundamental to control system design but are notoriously difficult to solve due to their nonconvexity. This study addresses BMI-based control optimization problems by adapting and integrating advanced evolutionary strategies. Specifically, a memetic Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (memetic CMA-ES) is proposed, which incorporates a local refinement phase via a (1+1)-CMA-ES within the global search process. While these algorithmic components are established in evolutionary computing, their tailored integration and specific tuning for control design tasks represent a novel application in this context. Experimental evaluations on $H_{\infty}$ controller synthesis and spectral abscissa optimization demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to existing BMI solvers in terms of both solution quality and robustness. This work bridges the gap between evolutionary computation and control theory, providing a practical and effective approach to tackling challenging BMI-constrained problems.</description>

      <title>Research on Mechanical Properties and Deformation-Fracture Energy Consumption Characteristics of Plateau Frozen Rocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploitation of mineral resources in plateau regions is confronted with critical challenges including low blasting efficiency, excessive energy consumption,and compromised operational safety when dealing with low-temperature water-bearing frozen rock masses.This study systematically investigates the dynamic-static mechanical properties,deformation-fracture behaviors,and energy consumption characteristics of plateau frozen sandstone under the coupled effects of temperature and moisture content (5%-15%).The research methodology integrates field sampling, low-pressure low-temperature simulation tests, graded impact loading tests, and numerical inversion analysis. Results demonstrate that freezing significantly enhances the dynamic strength and brittleness of saturated sandstone.The pore structure undergoes substantial evolution with decreasing temperature, with the porosity increasing by 63.15%.Based on PFC3D microscopic simulations, the mechanism of frost heave damage and the regulatory effect of water-ice phase transition on rock mechanical behaviors are elucidated.A quantitative analysis method for energy dissipation is proposed, revealing that the energy absorption increment of frozen rocks is higher than that of room-temperature samples.The findings provide a theoretical basis and technical support for optimizing blasting parameters, realizing directional energy release,and promoting green construction of frozen rock masses in high-altitude areas.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Centralized Distributed Control for Lifelong MAPF over Wireless Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In lifelong multi-agent path finding (MAPF) with many robots, unreliable wireless links and stochastic executions are the norm. Existing approaches typically either rely on centralized planning under idealized communication, or run fully distributed local controllers with fixed communication patterns; they rarely couple communication scheduling with policy learning, and thus struggle when bandwidth is scarce or packets are frequently dropped. We address this joint control--communication problem and propose a hybrid centralized--distributed scheme: a centralized cloud policy sends small residual corrections only when selected, while a lightweight on-board Gated recurrent unit (GRU) policy provides a safe default fallback when wireless connection is not available.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents finite-time and fixed-time stabilization results for inhomogeneous abstract evolution problems, extending existing theories. We prove well-posedness for strong and weak solutions, and estimate upper bounds for settling times for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems. We generalize finite-dimensional results to infinite-dimensional systems and demonstrate partial state stabilization with actuation on a subset of the domain. The interest of these results are illustrated through an application of a heat equation with memory term.</description>

      <title>Minimal Actuator Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting a few available actuators to ensure the controllability of a linear system is a fundamental problem in control theory. Previous works either focus on optimal performance, simplifying the controllability issue, or make the system controllable under structural assumptions, such as in graphs or when the input matrix is a design parameter. We generalize these approaches to offer a precise characterization of the general minimal actuator selection problem where a set of actuators is given, described by a fixed input matrix, and goal is to choose the fewest actuators that make the system controllable. We show that this problem can be equivalently cast as an integer linear program and, if actuation channels are sufficiently independent, as a set multicover problem under multiplicity constraints. The latter equivalence is always true if the state matrix has all distinct eigenvalues, in which case it simplifies to the set cover problem. Such characterizations hold even when a robust selection that tolerates a given number of faulty actuators is desired. Our established connection legitimates a designer to use algorithms from the rich literature on the set multicover problem to select the smallest subset of actuators, including exact solutions that do not require brute-force search.</description>

      <title>Blockchain-Enabled Renewable Energy Certificate Trading: A Secure and Privacy-Preserving Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 21st century, transitioning to renewable energy sources is imperative, with fossil fuel reserves depleting rapidly and recognizing critical environmental issues such as climate change, air pollution, water pollution, and habitat destruction. Embracing renewable energy is not only an environmental necessity but also a strategic move with multiple benefits. By shifting to renewable energy sources and supporting their production through the acquisition of renewable energy certificates, we foster innovation and drive economic growth in the renewable energy sector. This, in turn, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with global efforts to mitigate climate change. Additionally, renewable energy certificates ensure compliance with regulations that mandate the use of renewable energy, enhancing legal adherence while promoting transparency and trust in energy sourcing. To monitor the uptake of renewable energy, governments have implemented Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) as a tracking mechanism for the production and consumption of renewable energy. However, there are two main challenges to the existing REC schema: 1) The RECs have not been globally adopted due to inconsistent design; 2) The consumer privacy has not been well incorporated in the design of blockchain. In this study, we investigate the trading of RECs between suppliers and consumers using the directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain system and introduce a trading schema to help protect consumer information. Our results demonstrate lower transaction time by 41\% and energy consumption by 65\% compared to proof-of-stake.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a data-driven h2 model reduction method for discrete-time linear time-invariant systems. Specifically, we solve the h2 model reduction problem defined over a finite horizon using only impulse response data. Furthermore, we show that the proposed data-driven algorithm converges to a stationary point under certain assumptions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method constructs a good reduced-order model in terms of the h2 norm defined over the finite horizon using a SLICOT benchmark (the CD player model).</description>

      <title>Multiobjective Model Predictive Control for Residential Demand Response Management Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Residential users in demand response programs must balance electricity costs and user dissatisfaction under real-time pricing. This study proposes a multiobjective model predictive control approach for home energy management systems with battery storage, aiming to minimize both objectives while mitigating uncertainties. Laguerre functions parameterize control signals, transforming the optimization problem into one with linear inequalities for efficient exploration. A constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, incorporating convex sampler-based crossover and mutation, is developed to ensure feasible solutions. Simulations show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, limiting cost increases to 0.52\% under uncertainties, compared to at least 2.3\% with other methods.</description>

      <title>Current and temperature imbalances in parallel-connected grid storage battery modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge with large battery systems is heterogeneous currents and temperatures in modules with parallel-connected cells. Although extreme currents and temperatures are detrimental to the performance and lifetime of battery cells, there is not a consensus on the scale of typical imbalances within grid storage modules. Here, we quantify these imbalances through simulations and experiments on an industrially representative grid storage battery module consisting of prismatic lithium iron phosphate cells, elucidating the evolution of current and temperature imbalances and their dependence on individual cell and module parameter variations. Using a sensitivity analysis, we find that varying contact resistances and cell resistances contribute strongly to temperature differences between cells, from which we define safety thresholds on cell-to-cell variability. Finally, we investigate how these thresholds change for different applications, to outline a set of robustness metrics that show how cycling at lower C-rates and narrower SOC ranges can mitigate failures.</description>

      <title>Disturbance observer-based tracking control for roll-to-roll slot die coating systems under gap and pump rate disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Roll-to-roll slot die coating is a widely used industrial manufacturing technique applied in a diverse range of applications such as the production of lithium-ion batteries, solar cells and optical films. The efficiency of roll-to-roll slot die coating depends on the precise control of various input parameters such as pump rate, substrate velocity and coating gap. However, these inputs are sensitive to disturbances in process conditions, leading to inconsistencies in the various characteristics of the produced film. To address this challenge, a \gls{DO} is utilized for detecting disturbances, which may occur in the same or different channels as the control signal within the system. A generalized compensator is then implemented to mitigate the impact of these disturbances on the output, thereby enhancing uncertainty suppression. Additionally, integrating the disturbance rejection system with an output tracking controller enables the coating system to maintain the desired thickness under varying input conditions and disturbances. The effectiveness of this approach is then validated using a test rig equipped with a camera system, which facilitates the development of a data-driven model of the dynamic process, represented by state-space equations. The simulation results were demonstrated to showcase the effectiveness of the DOBOTC system, which provides a resilient solution for the output tracking issue in a data-driven model with generalized disturbances.</description>

      <title>Improving the GMAW process through current control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A control strategy for the electrical current in GMAW processes is proposed. The control is in closed-loop, designed by formal methods, based on a mathematical model of the electrical behavior of the GMAW process, and implemented in C+ language in a microcontroller. The model consists of a switched equivalent electrical circuit whose parameters are obtained in a data-driven manner. The strategy is tested in numerous experiments with both manual and robot welding, showing improvements in the overall welding process.</description>

      <title>STO-RL: Offline RL under Sparse Rewards via LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from pre-collected datasets, avoiding costly and risky online interactions, but it often struggles with long-horizon tasks involving sparse rewards. Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions. The resulting augmented dataset with shaped rewards enables efficient offline training of high-performing policies. Evaluations on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks demonstrate that STO-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories. Ablation studies further confirm STO-RL's robustness to imperfect or noisy LLM-generated subgoal sequences, demonstrating that LLM-guided subgoal temporal structures combined with theoretically grounded reward shaping provide a practical and scalable solution for long-horizon offline RL.</description>

      <title>Efficient Incremental SLAM via Information-Guided and Selective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient incremental SLAM back-end that achieves the accuracy of full batch optimization while substantially reducing computational cost. The proposed approach combines two complementary ideas: information-guided gating (IGG) and selective partial optimization (SPO). IGG employs an information-theoretic criterion based on the log-determinant of the information matrix to quantify the contribution of new measurements, triggering global optimization only when a significant information gain is observed. This avoids unnecessary relinearization and factorization when incoming data provide little additional information. SPO executes multi-iteration Gauss-Newton (GN) updates but restricts each iteration to the subset of variables most affected by the new measurements, dynamically refining this active set until convergence. Together, these mechanisms retain all measurements to preserve global consistency while focusing computation on parts of the graph where it yields the greatest benefit. We provide theoretical analysis showing that the proposed approach maintains the convergence guarantees of full GN. Extensive experiments on benchmark SLAM datasets show that our approach consistently matches the estimation accuracy of batch solvers, while achieving significant computational savings compared to conventional incremental approaches. The results indicate that the proposed approach offers a principled balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it a robust and scalable solution for real-time operation in dynamic data-rich environments.</description>

      <title>Modal Parameter Extraction via Propeller-Driven Vibration Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground Vibration Testing (GVT) supports aircraft certification but often requires lengthy and costly campaigns. Propeller-driven Vibration Testing (PVT) is assessed here as an output-only alternative, in line with Operational Modal Analysis approaches such as Taxi Vibration Testing and Flight Vibration Testing. A cantilever Aluminium 7075-T6 wing spar is instrumented with seven accelerometers and excited by an outboard electric motor and propeller. Seven runs are carried out: a motor-off baseline, five constant-throttle cases, and a manual up-down throttle sweep. The acquired spectra indicate that the dominant resonances remain observable under propeller excitation, while low-throttle conditions introduce narrowband harmonics that may mask structural peaks; the sweep reduces persistent overlap. Modal parameters are identified for the baseline and sweep cases using the Natural Excitation Technique with the Loewner Framework (NExT-LF). The first two modes remain closely matched (Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) &gt; 0.99), whereas the third mode shows reduced repeatability (MAC = 0.827) and a larger frequency shift, consistent with propeller-induced bending--torsion coupling and non-ideal sweep control. Overall, PVT provides a viable complement to GVT for extracting low-frequency modal information and motivates pursuing future work on automated throttle scheduling and coupling-aware test planning.</description>

      <title>Reverse Flow Matching: A Unified Framework for Online Reinforcement Learning with Diffusion and Flow Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion and flow policies are gaining prominence in online reinforcement learning (RL) due to their expressive power, yet training them efficiently remains a critical challenge. A fundamental difficulty in online RL is the lack of direct samples from the target distribution; instead, the target is an unnormalized Boltzmann distribution defined by the Q-function. To address this, two seemingly distinct families of methods have been proposed for diffusion policies: a noise-expectation family, which utilizes a weighted average of noise as the training target, and a gradient-expectation family, which employs a weighted average of Q-function gradients. Yet, it remains unclear how these objectives relate formally or if they can be synthesized into a more general formulation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, reverse flow matching (RFM), which rigorously addresses the problem of training diffusion and flow models without direct target samples. By adopting a reverse inferential perspective, we formulate the training target as a posterior mean estimation problem given an intermediate noisy sample. Crucially, we introduce Langevin Stein operators to construct zero-mean control variates, deriving a general class of estimators that effectively reduce importance sampling variance. We show that existing noise-expectation and gradient-expectation methods are two specific instances within this broader class. This unified view yields two key advancements: it extends the capability of targeting Boltzmann distributions from diffusion to flow policies, and enables the principled combination of Q-value and Q-gradient information to derive an optimal, minimum-variance estimator, thereby improving training efficiency and stability. We instantiate RFM to train a flow policy in online RL, and demonstrate improved performance on continuous-control benchmarks compared to diffusion policy baselines.</description>

Abstract: Large AI Model (LAM) have been proposed to applications of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), that offer better performance with its great generalization and reduced task specific trainings. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent that is guided by a Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM operates as a high level coordinator that generates textual guidance that shape the reward of the DRL agent during training. The results show that the LAM-DRL outperforms the traditional DRL by 40% in nominal weather scenarios and 64% in extreme weather scenarios compared to heuristics in terms of throughput, fairness, and outage probability.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models to Enhance Multi-task Drone Operations in Simulated Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benefiting from the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), human-drone interaction has reached unprecedented opportunities. In this paper, we propose a method that integrates a fine-tuned CodeT5 model with the Unreal Engine-based AirSim drone simulator to efficiently execute multi-task operations using natural language commands. This approach enables users to interact with simulated drones through prompts or command descriptions, allowing them to easily access and control the drone's status, significantly lowering the operational threshold. In the AirSim simulator, we can flexibly construct visually realistic dynamic environments to simulate drone applications in complex scenarios. By combining a large dataset of (natural language, program code) command-execution pairs generated by ChatGPT with developer-written drone code as training data, we fine-tune the CodeT5 to achieve automated translation from natural language to executable code for drone tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior task execution efficiency and command understanding capabilities in simulated environments. In the future, we plan to extend the model functionality in a modular manner, enhancing its adaptability to complex scenarios and driving the application of drone technologies in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>AUV Trajectory Learning for Underwater Acoustic Energy Transfer and Age Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internet of underwater things (IoUT) is increasingly gathering attention with the aim of monitoring sea life and deep ocean environment, underwater surveillance as well as maintenance of underwater installments. However, conventional IoUT devices, reliant on battery power, face limitations in lifespan and pose environmental hazards upon disposal. This paper introduces a sustainable approach for simultaneous information uplink from the IoUT devices and acoustic energy transfer (AET) to the devices via an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), potentially enabling them to operate indefinitely. To tackle the time-sensitivity, we adopt age of information (AoI), and Jain's fairness index. We develop two deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, offering a high-complexity, high-performance frequency division duplex (FDD) solution and a low-complexity, medium-performance time division duplex (TDD) approach. The results elucidate that the proposed FDD and TDD solutions significantly reduce the average AoI and boost the harvested energy as well as data collection fairness compared to baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Grid-Aware Charging and Operational Optimization for Mixed-Fleet Public Transit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of urban populations and the increasing need for sustainable transportation solutions have prompted a shift towards electric buses in public transit systems. However, the effective management of mixed fleets consisting of both electric and diesel buses poses significant operational challenges. One major challenge is coping with dynamic electricity pricing, where charging costs vary throughout the day. Transit agencies must optimize charging assignments in response to such dynamism while accounting for secondary considerations such as seating constraints. This paper presents a comprehensive mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to address these challenges by jointly optimizing charging schedules and trip assignments for mixed (electric and diesel bus) fleets while considering factors such as dynamic electricity pricing, vehicle capacity, and route constraints. We address the potential computational intractability of the MILP formulation, which can arise even with relatively small fleets, by employing a hierarchical approach tailored to the fleet composition. By using real-world data from the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA, we show that our approach can result in significant savings in the operating costs of the mixed transit fleets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The semi-tensor product of vectors generalizes the conventional inner product, enabling algebraic operations between vectors of different dimensions. Building upon this foundation, we introduce a domain-based convolutional product and integrate it with the STP to formulate a padding-free convolutional operation. This new operation inherently avoids zero or other artificial padding, thereby eliminating redundant information and boundary artifacts commonly present in conventional convolutional neural networks. Based on this operation, we further develop an STP-based CNN framework that extends convolutional computation to irregular and cross-dimensional data domains. Applications to image processing and third-order signal identification demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in handling irregular, incomplete, and high-dimensional data without the distortions caused by padding.</description>

      <title>A predictive modular approach to constraint satisfaction under uncertainty -- with application to glycosylation in continuous monoclonal antibody biosimilar production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper proposes a modular-based approach to constraint handling in process optimization and control. This is partly motivated by the recent interest in learning-based methods, e.g., within bioproduction, for which constraint handling under uncertainty is a challenge. The proposed constraint handler, called predictive filter, is combined with an adaptive constraint margin and a constraint violation cost monitor to minimize the cost of violating soft constraints due to model uncertainty and disturbances. The module can be combined with any controller and is based on minimally modifying the controller output, in a least squares sense, such that constraints are satisfied within the considered horizon. The proposed method is computationally efficient and suitable for real-time applications. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated through a realistic case study of glycosylation constraint satisfaction in continuous monoclonal antibody biosimilar production using Chinese hamster ovary cells, employing a metabolic network model consisting of 23 extracellular metabolites and 126 reactions. In the case study, the average constraint-violation cost is reduced by more than 60% compared to the case without the proposed constraint-handling method.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Scheduling: A Reinforcement Learning Whittle Index Approach for Wireless Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning based scheduling framework for Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) problems, centred on a Whittle Index Q-Learning policy with Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) exploration, referred to as WIQL-UCB. Unlike existing approaches that rely on fixed or adaptive epsilon-greedy strategies and require careful hyperparameter tuning, the proposed method removes problem-specific tuning and is therefore more generalisable across diverse RMAB settings. We evaluate WIQL-UCB on standard RMAB benchmarks and on a practical sensor scheduling application based on the Age of Incorrect Information (AoII), using an edge-based state estimation scheme that requires no prior knowledge of system dynamics. Experimental results show that WIQL-UCB achieves near-optimal performance while significantly improving computational and memory efficiency. For a representative problem size of N = 15 and M = 3, the proposed method requires only around 600 bytes of memory, compared with several kilobytes for tabular Q-learning and hundreds of kilobytes to megabytes for deep reinforcement learning baselines. In addition, WIQL-UCB achieves sub-millisecond per-decision runtimes and is several times faster than deep reinforcement learning approaches, while maintaining competitive performance. Overall, these results demonstrate that WIQL-UCB consistently outperforms both non-Whittle-based and Whittle-index learning baselines across a wide range of RMAB settings.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Orbit Feedback Control in NSLS-II Storage Ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) uses highly stable electron beam to produce high-quality X-ray beams with high brightness and low-emittance synchrotron radiation. The traditional algorithm to stabilize the beam applies singular value decomposition (SVD) on the orbit response matrix to remove noise and extract actions. Supervised learning has been studied on NSLS-II storage ring stabilization and other accelerator facilities recently. Several problems, for example, machine status drifting, environment noise, and non-linear accelerator dynamics, remain unresolved in the SVD-based and supervised learning algorithms. To address these problems, we propose an adaptive training framework based on model-based reinforcement learning. This framework consists of two types of optimizations: trajectory optimization attempts to minimize the expected total reward in a differentiable environment, and online model optimization learns non-linear machine dynamics through the agent-environment interaction. Through online training, this framework tracks the internal status drifting in the electron beam ring. Simulation and real in-facility experiments on NSLS-II reveal that our method stabilizes the beam position and minimizes the alignment error, defined as the root mean square (RMS) error between adjusted beam positions and the reference position, down to ~1$\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Analysis, detection and control of secure and safe cyber-physical control systems in a unified framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with analysis, simultaneous detection of faults and attacks, fault-tolerant control and attack-resilient of cyber-physical control systems. In our recent work, it has been observed that an attack detector driven by an input residual signal is capable of reliably detecting attacks. In particular, observing system dynamics from the perspective of the system input-output signal space reveals that attacks and system uncertainties act on different system subspaces. These results motivate our exploration of secure and safe cyber-physical control systems in the unified framework of control and detection. The unified framework is proposed to handle control and detection issues uniformly and in subspaces of system input-output data. Its mathematical and control-theoretic basis is system coprime factorizations with Bezout identity at its core. We firstly explore those methods and schemes of the unified framework, which serve as the major control-theoretic tool in our work. It is followed by re-visiting and examining established attack detection and resilient control schemes. The major part of our work is the endeavours to develop a control-theoretic paradigm, in which analysis, simultaneous detection of faults and attacks, fault-tolerant and attack-resilient control of cyber-physical control systems are addressed in a unified manner.</description>

Abstract: We examine stability properties of primal-dual gradient flow dynamics for composite convex optimization problems with multiple, possibly nonsmooth, terms in the objective function under the generalized consensus constraint. The proposed dynamics are based on the proximal augmented Lagrangian and they provide a viable alternative to ADMM which faces significant challenges from both analysis and implementation viewpoints in large-scale multi-block scenarios. In contrast to customized algorithms with individualized convergence guarantees, we develop a systematic approach for solving a broad class of challenging composite optimization problems. We leverage various structural properties to establish global (exponential) convergence guarantees for the proposed dynamics. Our assumptions are much weaker than those required to prove (exponential) stability of primal-dual dynamics as well as (linear) convergence of discrete-time methods such as standard two-block and multi-block ADMM and EXTRA algorithms. Finally, we show necessity of some of our structural assumptions for exponential stability and provide computational experiments to demonstrate the convenience of the proposed approach for parallel and distributed computing applications.</description>

      <title>Large-scale Regional Traffic Signal Control Based on Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09252</link>

Abstract: In the context of global urbanization and motorization, traffic congestion has become a significant issue, severely affecting the quality of life, environment, and economy. This paper puts forward a single-agent reinforcement learning (RL)-based regional traffic signal control (TSC) model. Different from multi - agent systems, this model can coordinate traffic signals across a large area, with the goals of alleviating regional traffic congestion and minimizing the total travel time. The TSC environment is precisely defined through specific state space, action space, and reward functions. The state space consists of the current congestion state, which is represented by the queue lengths of each link, and the current signal phase scheme of intersections. The action space is designed to select an intersection first and then adjust its phase split. Two reward functions are meticulously crafted. One focuses on alleviating congestion and the other aims to minimize the total travel time while considering the congestion level. The experiments are carried out with the SUMO traffic simulation software. The performance of the TSC model is evaluated by comparing it with a base case where no signal-timing adjustments are made. The results show that the model can effectively control congestion. For example, the queuing length is significantly reduced in the scenarios tested. Moreover, when the reward is set to both alleviate congestion and minimize the total travel time, the average travel time is remarkably decreased, which indicates that the model can effectively improve traffic conditions. This research provides a new approach for large-scale regional traffic signal control and offers valuable insights for future urban traffic management.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Learning of Interpretable Reduced-Order Models for Jumping Quadruped Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reduced-order models are central to motion planning and control of quadruped robots, yet existing templates are often hand-crafted for a specific locomotion modality. This motivates the need for automatic methods that extract task-specific, interpretable low-dimensional dynamics directly from data. We propose a methodology that combines a linear autoencoder with symbolic regression to derive such models. The linear autoencoder provides a consistent latent embedding for configurations, velocities, accelerations, and inputs, enabling the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to operate in a compact, physics-aligned space. A multi-phase, hybrid-aware training scheme ensures coherent latent coordinates across contact transitions. We focus our validation on quadruped jumping-a representative, challenging, yet contained scenario in which a principled template model is especially valuable. The resulting symbolic dynamics outperform the state-of-the-art handcrafted actuated spring-loaded inverted pendulum (aSLIP) baseline in simulation and hardware across multiple robots and jumping modalities.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Neuro-Controller Developed for a Prosthetic Hand Wrist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The significance of employing a controller in prosthetic hands cannot be overstated, as it plays a crucial role in enhancing the functionality and usability of these systems. This paper introduces an adaptive neuro-controller specifically developed for a tendon-driven soft continuum wrist of a prosthetic hand. Kinematic and dynamic modeling of the wrist is carried out using the Timoshenko beam theory. A Neural Network (NN) based strategy is adopted to predict the required motor currents to manipulate the wrist tendons from the errors in the deflection of the wrist section. The Timoshenko beam theory is used to compute the required tendon tension from the input motor current. A comparison of the adaptive neuro-controller with other similar controllers is conducted to analyze the performance of the proposed approach. Simulation studies and experimental validations of the fabricated wrist are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller.</description>
