      <title>Improved Honeycomb and Hyper-Honeycomb Lattice Hamiltonians for Quantum Simulations of Non-Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improved Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonians for quantum simulations of non-Abelian Yang-Mills gauge theories are developed for honeycomb (2+1D) and hyper-honeycomb (3+1D) spatial tessellations. This is motivated by the desire to identify lattices for quantum simulations that involve only 3-link vertices among the gauge field group spaces in order to reduce the complexity in applications of the plaquette operator. For the honeycomb lattice, we derive a classically ${\cal O}(b^2)$-improved Hamiltonian, with $b$ being the lattice spacing. Tadpole improvement via the mean-field value of the plaquette operator is used to provide the corresponding quantum improvements. We have identified the (non-chiral) hyper-honeycomb as a candidate spatial tessellation for 3+1D quantum simulations of gauge theories, and determined the associated ${\cal O}(b)$-improved Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Parallel Tempered Metadynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When approaching the continuum limit in lattice QCD or other theories in a setup with topological sectors, conventional update algorithms experience a particularly severe form of critical slowing down that is caused by high action barriers between the sectors. The qualitative scaling behavior of this critical slowing down appears to be universal across different update algorithms and (gauge) actions. We demonstrate that a combination of Metadynamics with parallel tempering, along with other modifications, can significantly reduce autocorrelation times while avoiding the need for reweighting. We also discuss strategies to extend the methods to QCD simulations with dynamical fermions, and present first results for $N_f = 2$ simulations at unphysical pion masses.</description>

      <title>$bb\bar u\bar d$ and $bs\bar u\bar d$ tetraquarks from lattice QCD using two-meson and diquark-antidiquark variational basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD investigation of isoscalar tetraquark systems involving bottom quarks with explicit flavor content $bb\bar{u}\bar{d}$ and $bs\bar{u}\bar{d}$. In the doubly bottom sector, the study focuses on axialvector $J^P=1^+$ quantum numbers, whereas in the $bs\bar{u}\bar{d}$ channel both axial vector $J^P=1^+$ and scalar $J^P=0^+$ quantum numbers are investigated in search of signatures for possible tetraquark bound states. The calculations are performed on four ensembles with dynamical quark fields up to the charm quark generated by the MILC Collaboration, with lattice spacings ranging from approximately 0.058 fm to 0.12 fm, and at different values of the valence light quark mass $m_{u/d}$, corresponding to pseudoscalar meson masses, $M_{ps}=0.5$, 0.6 and 0.7 GeV. The energy eigenvalues in the finite volume are determined by applying a variational procedure to correlation matrices constructed from two-meson interpolating operators and diquark-antidiquark operators. Continuum extrapolated elastic $S$-wave scattering amplitudes of $BB^*$, $KB^*$ and $KB$ are extracted from the ground state eigenenergies following a finite-volume analysis \'a la L\"uscher. The chiral and continuum extrapolated binding energy estimates for the isoscalar axialvector doubly bottom tetraquark $T_{bb}$ from the extracted elastic $BB^*$ $S$-wave scattering amplitudes is found to be $\Delta E_{T_{bb}}(1^+)=-116(^{+30}_{-36})$ MeV. In the $bs\bar{u}\bar{d}$, no statistically significant deviations were observed in the ground state energies from the respective elastic threshold energies, leading to no conclusive evidence for any bound states.</description>

      <title>Signs of Non-Monotonic Finite-Volume Corrections to $g_A$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite-volume (FV) corrections to determinations of $g_A$ via lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) using analytic results and numerical analysis. We observe that $SU(2)$ Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory does not provide an unambiguous prediction for the sign of the FV correction, which is not surprising when one also considers large-$N_c$ constraints on the axial couplings. We further show that non-monotonic FV corrections are naturally allowed when one considers either including explicit $\Delta$-resonance degrees of freedom or one works to higher orders in the chiral expansion. We investigate the potential impact of these FV corrections with a precision study of $g_A$ using models of FV corrections that are monotonic and non-monotonic. Using lattice QCD data that is approximately at the 1% level of precision, we do not see significant evidence of non-monotonic corrections. Looking forward to the next phase of lattice QCD calculations, we estimate that calculations that are between the 0.1%-1%-level of precision may be sensitive to these FV artifacts. Finally, we present an update of the CalLat prediction of $g_A$ in the isospin limit with sub-percent precision, $g_A^{\rm QCD} = 1.2674(96)$.</description>

      <title>$\eta$, $\eta^\prime$ mesons from lattice QCD in fully physical conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine masses and mixing parameters of the $\eta$ and $M_{\eta^\prime}$ meson in lattice QCD. The calculations are carried out on a set of 13 ETMC gauge ensembles with $N_f=2+1+1$ (maximally) twisted-mass Clover-improved quarks. These ensemble cover four values of the lattice spacing $a=0.057\mathrm{fm},...,0.092\mathrm{fm}$ and pion masses from $140\mathrm{MeV}$ to $360\mathrm{MeV}$, including three ensembles at physical quark masses and six ensembles with $M_\pi&lt;200\mathrm{MeV}$. The strange-quark contribution is treated in a mixed-action approach using Osterwalder-Seiler fermions to avoid complications due to flavor mixing in the heavy quark sector and to enable the use of the one-end trick in the computation of strange quark-disconnected diagrams. With the strange-quark mass tuned to its physical value and several ensembles having close-to-physical light-quark mass, uncertainties related to the chiral extrapolations are reduced significantly compared to earlier studies. Physical results are computed with fully controlled systematics from a combined chiral, continuum and infinite-volume extrapolation, and a full error budget is obtained from model averages over of various fit ans\"atze and data cuts. Our results for the masses are given by $M_\eta=551(16)\mathrm{MeV}$ and $M_{\eta^\prime}=972(20)\mathrm{MeV}$, respectively, where statistical and systematic errors have been added in quadrature. For the mixing angle and decay-constant parameters the Feldmann-Kroll-Stech scheme is employed to compute them from pseudoscalar matrix elements in the quark-flavor basis. For the mixing angle we obtain $\phi^\mathrm{phys}=39.3(2.0)^\circ$ and our results for the decay-constant parameters are given by $f_l^\mathrm{phys}=138.6(4.4)\mathrm{MeV}$ and $f_s^\mathrm{phys}=170.7(3.3)\mathrm{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>Scalar Thermal Field Theory for a Rotating Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper it is initiated the systematic study of thermal field theory for generic equilibrium density matrices, which feature arbitrary values not only of temperature and chemical potentials, but also of average angular momentum. The focus here is on scalar fields, although some results also apply to fields with arbitrary spins. A general technique to compute ensemble averages is provided. Moreover, path-integral methods are developed to study thermal Green's functions (with an arbitrary number of points) in generic theories, which cover both the real-time and imaginary-time formalism. It is shown that, while the average angular momentum, like the chemical potentials, does not contribute positively to the Euclidean action, its negative contributions can be compensated by some other contributions that are instead positive, at least in some cases. As an application of the developed general formalism, it is shown that the production of particles weakly coupled to a rotating plasma can be significantly enhanced compared to the non-rotating case. These finding can be useful, for example, to investigate the physics of rotating stars, ordinary and primordial black holes and more exotic compact objects.</description>

      <title>Dominance of gluonic scale anomaly in confining pressure inside nucleon and D-term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the confining pressure inside the nucleon and the related gravitational form factor referred to as the D-term, using the skyrmion approach based on the scale-invariant chiral perturbation theory, where the skyrmion is described as the nucleon and a scalar meson couples to the scale anomaly through the low energy theorem. Within this model framework, the current quark mass and gluonic quantum contributions to the scale anomaly can be described by the pion and scalar meson masses, respectively, through matching with the underlying QCD. By considering the decomposition of the energy momentum tensor of nucleon, we examine the role of the scale anomaly contributions in the pressure inside the nucleon. As a result, the gluonic scale anomaly is found to dominate the confining pressure. Compared to the result based on the conventional chiral perturbation theory in the chiral limit, our result for the total pressure is capable of qualitatively improving the alignment with lattice QCD observations. Moreover, the pressure from the gluonic scale anomaly is widely distributed in position space, leading to its substantial contribution to the D-term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the spectrum of excited states of the nucleon is vital to our understanding of how QCD is realized in the baryon spectrum. Using a simultaneous analysis of the pion nucleon scattering data up to 2 GeV as well as the results of lattice QCD calculations, we obtain new insight into the nature of the Roper resonance as well as the excited states around 1.9 GeV.</description>

      <title>Reappraisal of rho meson in nuclear matter by inverse QCD sum rules method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive reappraisal of the in-medium properties of the rho meson using the inverse QCD sum rules (QCDSR) formalism, offering a novel, model-independent approach to studying hadronic modifications in nuclear matter. Unlike conventional QCDSR, which rely on a predefined pole+continuum structure, the inverse method reconstructs the spectral function directly from the operator product expansion (OPE), eliminating assumptions about the spectral ansatz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of the inverse QCDSR method to the rho meson in nuclear matter. Our analysis reveals a significant reduction in the rho meson mass, consistent with previous theoretical predictions, and highlights the crucial role of medium-induced modifications, including condensate suppression and factorization-breaking effects. Furthermore, we assess the sensitivity of our results to the factorization assumption and higher-dimensional condensates, demonstrating the necessity of refining nonperturbative contributions for an accurate description of in-medium hadron properties. Our findings establish the inverse QCDSR method as a robust alternative to conventional spectral analysis techniques, providing a systematically controlled framework for exploring strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions. These results offer important theoretical benchmarks for lattice QCD simulations and heavy-ion collision experiments, shedding light on the restoration of chiral symmetry and the evolution of hadronic matter in dense environments.</description>

      <title>2025 update on $\varepsilon_K$ in the Standard Model with lattice QCD inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present theoretical results for the indirect CP violation parameter, $|\varepsilon_K|$ calculated directly from the standard model using lattice QCD inputs such as $\hat{B}_K$, $|V_{cb}|$, $|V_{us}|$, $|V_{ud}|$, $\xi_0$, $\xi_2$, $F_K$, and $m_c$ (charm quark mass). We find a strong tension in $|\varepsilon_K|$ at the $\approx 5\sigma$ ($5.2\sigma \sim 4.6\sigma$) level between the experimental value and the theoretical value calculated directly from the standard model using lattice QCD inputs. The standard model with lattice QCD inputs describes only 65\% of the experimental value of $|\varepsilon_K|$, and does not explain its remaining 35\%. We also find that this tension disappears when we use inclusive $|V_{cb}|$ which comes from the heavy quark expansion and QCD sum rules. This tension is highly correlated with the discrepancy between exclusive $|V_{cb}|$, and inclusive $|V_{cb}|$. We also present results for $|\varepsilon_K|$ obtained using the Brod-Gorbahn-Stamou (BGS) method of $u-t$ unitarity, which leads to even a stronger tension at the $5.5\sigma \sim 4.9\sigma$ level with lattice QCD inputs.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of computational cost of maintaining adiabaticity for long paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work argued that the scaling of a dimensionless quantity $Q_D$ with path length is a better proxy for quantifying the scaling of the computational cost of maintaining adiabaticity than the timescale. It also conjectured that generically the scaling will be superlinear (although special cases exist in which it is linear). The quantity $Q_D$ depends only on the properties of ground states along the Hamiltonian path and the rate at which the path is followed. In this paper, we demonstrate that this conjecture holds for simple Hamiltonian systems that can be studied numerically. In particular, the systems studied exhibit the behavior that $Q_D$ grows approximately as $L \log L$ where $L$ is the path length when the threshold error is fixed.</description>

Abstract: We express Kitaev's exact solution of spin models on the honeycomb lattice as a special case of a higher dimensional duality between staggered Majorana fermions and Pauli spins. General models with bilinear nearest neighbor couplings of spins and external magnetic fields are soluble in this way. Each model gives rise to an infinite number of single particle fermion Schrodinger equations, depending on the choice of discrete gauge field flux.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Generative Samplers for Investigating Critical Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating critical phenomena or phase transitions is of high interest in physics and chemistry, for which Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, a crucial tool for numerically analyzing macroscopic properties of given systems, are often hindered by an emerging divergence of correlation length -- known as scale invariance at criticality (SIC) in the renormalization group theory. SIC causes the system to behave the same at any length scale, from which many existing sampling methods suffer: long-range correlations cause critical slowing down in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and require intractably large receptive fields for generative samplers. In this paper, we propose a Renormalization-informed Generative Critical Sampler (RiGCS) -- a novel sampler specialized for near-critical systems, where SIC is leveraged as an advantage rather than a nuisance. Specifically, RiGCS builds on MultiLevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) with Heat Bath (HB) algorithms, which perform ancestral sampling from low-resolution to high-resolution lattice configurations with site-wise-independent conditional HB sampling. Although MLMC-HB is highly efficient under exact SIC, it suffers from a low acceptance rate under slight SIC violation. Notably, SIC violation always occurs in finite-size systems, and may induce long-range and higher-order interactions in the renormalized distributions, which are not considered by independent HB samplers. RiGCS enhances MLMC-HB by replacing a part of the conditional HB sampler with generative models that capture those residual interactions and improve the sampling efficiency. Our experiments show that the effective sample size of RiGCS is a few orders of magnitude higher than state-of-the-art generative model baselines in sampling configurations for 128x128 two-dimensional Ising systems.</description>
