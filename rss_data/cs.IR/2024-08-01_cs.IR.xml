      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Retrieval Methods in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era dominated by information overload, effective recommender systems are essential for managing the deluge of data across digital platforms. Multi-stage cascade ranking systems are widely used in the industry, with retrieval and ranking being two typical stages. Retrieval methods sift through vast candidates to filter out irrelevant items, while ranking methods prioritize these candidates to present the most relevant items to users. Unlike studies focusing on the ranking stage, this survey explores the critical yet often overlooked retrieval stage of recommender systems. To achieve precise and efficient personalized retrieval, we summarize existing work in three key areas: improving similarity computation between user and item, enhancing indexing mechanisms for efficient retrieval, and optimizing training methods of retrieval. We also provide a comprehensive set of benchmarking experiments on three public datasets. Furthermore, we highlight current industrial applications through a case study on retrieval practices at a specific company, covering the entire retrieval process and online serving, along with practical implications and challenges. By detailing the retrieval stage, which is fundamental for effective recommendation, this survey aims to bridge the existing knowledge gap and serve as a cornerstone for researchers interested in optimizing this critical component of cascade recommender systems.</description>

      <title>LLM-Find: An Autonomous GIS Agent Framework for Geospatial Data Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powered by the emerging large language models (LLMs), autonomous geographic information systems (GIS) agents have the potential to accomplish spatial analyses and cartographic tasks. However, a research gap exists to support fully autonomous GIS agents: how to enable agents to discover and download the necessary data for geospatial analyses. This study proposes LLM-Find, an autonomous GIS agent framework capable of selecting and fetching required geospatial data by generating, executing, and debugging programs. LLM-Find utilizes the LLM as the decision-maker, selects the appropriate data source (s) from a pre-defined source list, and fetches the data from the chosen source. Each data source has a handbook that records the metadata and technical details for data retrieval. The proposed framework is designed in a plug-and-play style to ensure flexibility and extensibility. Human users or autonomous data scrawlers can add a new data source by adding a new handbook. We developed a prototype agent based on LLM-Find, and experiment results demonstrate its capability of retrieving data from various sources including OpenStreetMap, administrative boundaries and demographic data from the US Census Bureau, satellite basemaps from ESRI World Imagery, weather data from a commercial provider, and the COVID-19 data from the NYTimes GitHub. Our study is among the first attempts to develop an autonomous geospatial data retrieval agent.</description>

      <title>Multi-Grained Query-Guided Set Prediction Network for Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) is an emerging information extraction (IE) task, aiming to simultaneously extract entity spans, types, and entity-matched bounding box groundings in images from given sentence-image pairs data. Recent unified methods employing machine reading comprehension (MRC-based) frameworks or sequence generation-based models face challenges in understanding the relationships of multimodal entities. MRC-based frameworks, utilizing human-designed queries, struggle to model intra-entity connections. Meanwhile, sequence generation-based outputs excessively rely on inter-entity dependencies due to pre-defined decoding order. To tackle these, we propose a novel unified framework named Multi-grained Query-guided Set Prediction Network (MQSPN) to learn appropriate relationships at intra-entity and inter-entity levels. Specifically, MQSPN consists of a Multi-grained Query Set (MQS) and a Multimodal Set Prediction Network (MSP). MQS combines specific type-grained and learnable entity-grained queries to adaptively strengthen intra-entity connections by explicitly aligning visual regions with textual spans. Based on solid intra-entity modeling, MSP reformulates GMNER as a set prediction, enabling the parallel prediction of multimodal entities in a non-autoregressive manner, eliminating redundant dependencies from preceding sequences, and guiding models to establish appropriate inter-entity relationships from a global matching perspective. Additionally, to boost better alignment of two-level relationships, we also incorporate a Query-guided Fusion Net (QFNet) to work as a glue network between MQS and MSP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances in widely used benchmarks. Notably, our method improves 2.83% F1 in the difficult fine-grained GMNER benchmark.</description>

      <title>Watermarking Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems embody significant commercial value and represent crucial intellectual property. However, the integrity of these systems is constantly challenged by malicious actors seeking to steal their underlying models. Safeguarding against such threats is paramount to upholding the rights and interests of the model owner. While model watermarking has emerged as a potent defense mechanism in various domains, its direct application to recommender systems remains unexplored and non-trivial. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing Autoregressive Out-of-distribution Watermarking (AOW), a novel technique tailored specifically for recommender systems. Our approach entails selecting an initial item and querying it through the oracle model, followed by the selection of subsequent items with small prediction scores. This iterative process generates a watermark sequence autoregressively, which is then ingrained into the model's memory through training. To assess the efficacy of the watermark, the model is tasked with predicting the subsequent item given a truncated watermark sequence. Through extensive experimentation and analysis, we demonstrate the superior performance and robust properties of AOW. Notably, our watermarking technique exhibits high-confidence extraction capabilities and maintains effectiveness even in the face of distillation and fine-tuning processes.</description>

      <title>GenRec: Generative Personalized Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation is a task to capture hidden user preferences from historical user item interaction data. Significant progress has been made in this domain by leveraging classification based learning methods. Inspired by the recent paradigm of 'pretrain, prompt and predict' in NLP, we consider sequential recommendation as a sequence to sequence generation task and propose a novel model named Generative Recommendation (GenRec). Unlike classification based models that learn explicit user and item representations, GenRec utilizes the sequence modeling capability of Transformer and adopts the masked item prediction objective to effectively learn the hidden bidirectional sequential patterns. Different from existing generative sequential recommendation models, GenRec does not rely on manually designed hard prompts. The input to GenRec is textual user item sequence and the output is top ranked next items. Moreover, GenRec is lightweight and requires only a few hours to train effectively in low-resource settings, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios and helping to democratize large language models in the sequential recommendation domain. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that GenRec generalizes on various public real-world datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results. Our experiments also validate the effectiveness of the the proposed masked item prediction objective that improves the model performance by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Implementing Streaming algorithm and k-means clusters to RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has achieved great success in information retrieval to assist large models because it builds an external knowledge database. However, it also has many problems: it consumes a lot of memory because of the huge database. When faced with massive streaming data, it is unable to update the established index database in time. To save the memory of building the database and maintain accuracy simultaneously, we proposed a new approach combining a streaming algorithm and k-means cluster with RAG. Our approach applies a streaming algorithm to update the index and reduce memory consumption. Then use the k-means algorithm to cluster documents with high similarities together, the query time will be shortened by doing this. We conducted comparative experiments on four methods, and the results show that RAG with streaming algorithm and k-means cluster performs well in accuracy and memory. For massive streaming data, we find that our method behaves better than traditional RAG</description>

      <title>Personalized Multi-task Training for Recommender System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the vast landscape of internet information, recommender systems (RecSys) have become essential for guiding users through a sea of choices aligned with their preferences. These systems have applications in diverse domains, such as news feeds, game suggestions, and shopping recommendations. Personalization is a key technique in RecSys, where modern methods leverage representation learning to encode user/item interactions into embeddings, forming the foundation for personalized recommendations. However, integrating information from multiple sources to enhance recommendation performance remains challenging. This paper introduces a novel approach named PMTRec, the first personalized multi-task learning algorithm to obtain comprehensive user/item embeddings from various information sources. Addressing challenges specific to personalized RecSys, we develop modules to handle personalized task weights, diverse task orientations, and variations in gradient magnitudes across tasks. PMTRec dynamically adjusts task weights based on gradient norms for each user/item, employs a Task Focusing module to align gradient combinations with the main recommendation task, and uses a Gradient Magnitude Balancing module to ensure balanced training across tasks. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets with different scales, we demonstrate that PMTRec significantly outperforms existing multi-task learning methods, showcasing its effectiveness in achieving enhanced recommendation accuracy by leveraging multiple tasks simultaneously. Our contributions open new avenues for advancing personalized multi-task training in recommender systems.</description>

      <title>ABCDE: Application-Based Cluster Diff Evals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of evaluating clusterings of very large populations of items. Given two clusterings, namely a Baseline clustering and an Experiment clustering, the tasks are twofold: 1) characterize their differences, and 2) determine which clustering is better. ABCDE is a novel evaluation technique for accomplishing that. It aims to be practical: it allows items to have associated importance values that are application-specific, it is frugal in its use of human judgements when determining which clustering is better, and it can report metrics for arbitrary slices of items, thereby facilitating understanding and debugging. The approach to measuring the delta in the clustering quality is novel: instead of trying to construct an expensive ground truth up front and evaluating the each clustering with respect to that, where the ground truth must effectively pre-anticipate clustering changes, ABCDE samples questions for judgement on the basis of the actual diffs between the clusterings. ABCDE builds upon the pointwise metrics for clustering evaluation, which make the ABCDE metrics intuitive and simple to understand. The mathematical elegance of the pointwise metrics equip ABCDE with rigorous yet practical ways to explore the clustering diffs and to estimate the quality delta.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Hourglass Phenomenon of Residual Quantization: Enhancing the Upper Bound of Generative Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative retrieval (GR) has emerged as a transformative paradigm in search and recommender systems, leveraging numeric-based identifier representations to enhance efficiency and generalization. Notably, methods like TIGER employing Residual Quantization-based Semantic Identifiers (RQ-SID), have shown significant promise in e-commerce scenarios by effectively managing item IDs. However, a critical issue termed the "\textbf{Hourglass}" phenomenon, occurs in RQ-SID, where intermediate codebook tokens become overly concentrated, hindering the full utilization of generative retrieval methods. This paper analyses and addresses this problem by identifying data sparsity and long-tailed distribution as the primary causes. Through comprehensive experiments and detailed ablation studies, we analyze the impact of these factors on codebook utilization and data distribution. Our findings reveal that the "Hourglass" phenomenon substantially impacts the performance of RQ-SID in generative retrieval. We propose effective solutions to mitigate this issue, thereby significantly enhancing the effectiveness of generative retrieval in real-world E-commerce applications.</description>

      <title>Learning Effective Representations for Retrieval Using Self-Distillation with Adaptive Relevance Margins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representation-based retrieval models, so-called biencoders, estimate the relevance of a document to a query by calculating the similarity of their respective embeddings. Current state-of-the-art biencoders are trained using an expensive training regime involving knowledge distillation from a teacher model and batch-sampling. Instead of relying on a teacher model, we contribute a novel parameter-free loss function for self-supervision that exploits the pre-trained language modeling capabilities of the encoder model as a training signal, eliminating the need for batch sampling by performing implicit hard negative mining. We investigate the capabilities of our proposed approach through extensive ablation studies, demonstrating that self-distillation can match the effectiveness of teacher distillation using only 13.5% of the data, while offering a speedup in training time between 3x and 15x compared to parametrized losses. Code and data is made openly available.</description>

      <title>MOSAIC: Multimodal Multistakeholder-aware Visual Art Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual art (VA) recommendation is complex, as it has to consider the interests of users (e.g. museum visitors) and other stakeholders (e.g. museum curators). We study how to effectively account for key stakeholders in VA recommendations while also considering user-centred measures such as novelty, serendipity, and diversity. We propose MOSAIC, a novel multimodal multistakeholder-aware approach using state-of-the-art CLIP and BLIP backbone architectures and two joint optimisation objectives: popularity and representative selection of paintings across different categories. We conducted an offline evaluation using preferences elicited from 213 users followed by a user study with 100 crowdworkers. We found a strong effect of popularity, which was positively perceived by users, and a minimal effect of representativeness. MOSAIC's impact extends beyond visitors, benefiting various art stakeholders. Its user-centric approach has broader applicability, offering advancements for content recommendation across domains that require considering multiple stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Advancing Chart Question Answering with Robust Chart Component Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chart comprehension presents significant challenges for machine learning models due to the diverse and intricate shapes of charts. Existing multimodal methods often overlook these visual features or fail to integrate them effectively for chart question answering (ChartQA). To address this, we introduce Chartformer, a unified framework that enhances chart component recognition by accurately identifying and classifying components such as bars, lines, pies, titles, legends, and axes. Additionally, we propose a novel Question-guided Deformable Co-Attention (QDCAt) mechanism, which fuses chart features encoded by Chartformer with the given question, leveraging the question's guidance to ground the correct answer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches significantly outperform baseline models in chart component recognition and ChartQA tasks, achieving improvements of 3.2% in mAP and 15.4% in accuracy, respectively. These results underscore the robustness of our solution for detailed visual data interpretation across various applications.</description>

      <title>What Matters in Explanations: Towards Explainable Fake Review Detection Focusing on Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Customers' reviews and feedback play crucial role on electronic commerce~(E-commerce) platforms like Amazon, Zalando, and eBay in influencing other customers' purchasing decisions. However, there is a prevailing concern that sellers often post fake or spam reviews to deceive potential customers and manipulate their opinions about a product. Over the past decade, there has been considerable interest in using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to identify such fraudulent reviews. Unfortunately, the decisions made by complex ML and DL models - which often function as \emph{black-boxes} - can be surprising and difficult for general users to comprehend. In this paper, we propose an explainable framework for detecting fake reviews with high precision in identifying fraudulent content with explanations and investigate what information matters most for explaining particular decisions by conducting empirical user evaluation. Initially, we develop fake review detection models using DL and transformer models including XLNet and DistilBERT. We then introduce layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) technique for generating explanations that can map the contributions of words toward the predicted class. The experimental results on two benchmark fake review detection datasets demonstrate that our predictive models achieve state-of-the-art performance and outperform several existing methods. Furthermore, the empirical user evaluation of the generated explanations concludes which important information needs to be considered in generating explanations in the context of fake review identification.</description>

      <title>Modular RAG: Transforming RAG Systems into LEGO-like Reconfigurable Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has markedly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. The increasing demands of application scenarios have driven the evolution of RAG, leading to the integration of advanced retrievers, LLMs and other complementary technologies, which in turn has amplified the intricacy of RAG systems. However, the rapid advancements are outpacing the foundational RAG paradigm, with many methods struggling to be unified under the process of "retrieve-then-generate". In this context, this paper examines the limitations of the existing RAG paradigm and introduces the modular RAG framework. By decomposing complex RAG systems into independent modules and specialized operators, it facilitates a highly reconfigurable framework. Modular RAG transcends the traditional linear architecture, embracing a more advanced design that integrates routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms. Drawing on extensive research, this paper further identifies prevalent RAG patterns-linear, conditional, branching, and looping-and offers a comprehensive analysis of their respective implementation nuances. Modular RAG presents innovative opportunities for the conceptualization and deployment of RAG systems. Finally, the paper explores the potential emergence of new operators and paradigms, establishing a solid theoretical foundation and a practical roadmap for the continued evolution and practical deployment of RAG technologies.</description>

      <title>LawLLM: Law Large Language Model for the US Legal System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of legal analytics, finding relevant cases and accurately predicting judicial outcomes are challenging because of the complexity of legal language, which often includes specialized terminology, complex syntax, and historical context. Moreover, the subtle distinctions between similar and precedent cases require a deep understanding of legal knowledge. Researchers often conflate these concepts, making it difficult to develop specialized techniques to effectively address these nuanced tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Law Large Language Model (LawLLM), a multi-task model specifically designed for the US legal domain to address these challenges. LawLLM excels at Similar Case Retrieval (SCR), Precedent Case Recommendation (PCR), and Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP). By clearly distinguishing between precedent and similar cases, we provide essential clarity, guiding future research in developing specialized strategies for these tasks. We propose customized data preprocessing techniques for each task that transform raw legal data into a trainable format. Furthermore, we also use techniques such as in-context learning (ICL) and advanced information retrieval methods in LawLLM. The evaluation results demonstrate that LawLLM consistently outperforms existing baselines in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, offering unparalleled multi-task capabilities and filling critical gaps in the legal domain.</description>

      <title>ProSpec RL: Plan Ahead, then Execute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imagining potential outcomes of actions before execution helps agents make more informed decisions, a prospective thinking ability fundamental to human cognition. However, mainstream model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods lack the ability to proactively envision future scenarios, plan, and guide strategies. These methods typically rely on trial and error to adjust policy functions, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards or long-term value, even if such high-reward decisions place the environment in extremely dangerous states. To address this, we propose the Prospective (ProSpec) RL method, which makes higher-value, lower-risk optimal decisions by imagining future n-stream trajectories. Specifically, ProSpec employs a dynamic model to predict future states (termed "imagined states") based on the current state and a series of sampled actions. Furthermore, we integrate the concept of Model Predictive Control and introduce a cycle consistency constraint that allows the agent to evaluate and select the optimal actions from these trajectories. Moreover, ProSpec employs cycle consistency to mitigate two fundamental issues in RL: augmenting state reversibility to avoid irreversible events (low risk) and augmenting actions to generate numerous virtual trajectories, thereby improving data efficiency. We validated the effectiveness of our method on the DMControl benchmarks, where our approach achieved significant performance improvements. Code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Conversational Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of integrating large language models into the development of conversational systems, many studies have shown the effectiveness of retrieving and augmenting external knowledge for informative responses. Hence, many existing studies commonly assume the always need for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in a conversational system without explicit control. This raises a research question about such a necessity. In this study, we propose to investigate the need for each turn of system response to be augmented with external knowledge. In particular, by leveraging human judgements on the binary choice of adaptive augmentation, we develop RAGate, a gating model, which models conversation context and relevant inputs to predict if a conversational system requires RAG for improved responses. We conduct extensive experiments on devising and applying RAGate to conversational models and well-rounded analyses of different conversational scenarios. Our experimental results and analysis indicate the effective application of RAGate in RAG-based conversational systems in identifying system responses for appropriate RAG with high-quality responses and a high generation confidence. This study also identifies the correlation between the generation's confidence level and the relevance of the augmented knowledge.</description>

      <title>Neural Retrievers are Biased Towards LLM-Generated Content</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the paradigm of information retrieval (IR) applications, especially in web search, by generating vast amounts of human-like texts on the Internet. As a result, IR systems in the LLM era are facing a new challenge: the indexed documents are now not only written by human beings but also automatically generated by the LLMs. How these LLM-generated documents influence the IR systems is a pressing and still unexplored question. In this work, we conduct a quantitative evaluation of IR models in scenarios where both human-written and LLM-generated texts are involved. Surprisingly, our findings indicate that neural retrieval models tend to rank LLM-generated documents higher. We refer to this category of biases in neural retrievers towards the LLM-generated content as the \textbf{source bias}. Moreover, we discover that this bias is not confined to the first-stage neural retrievers, but extends to the second-stage neural re-rankers. Then, in-depth analyses from the perspective of text compression indicate that LLM-generated texts exhibit more focused semantics with less noise, making it easier for neural retrieval models to semantic match. To mitigate the source bias, we also propose a plug-and-play debiased constraint for the optimization objective, and experimental results show its effectiveness. Finally, we discuss the potential severe concerns stemming from the observed source bias and hope our findings can serve as a critical wake-up call to the IR community and beyond. To facilitate future explorations of IR in the LLM era, the constructed two new benchmarks are available at https://github.com/KID-22/Source-Bias.</description>

      <title>Attribute-driven Disentangled Representation Learning for Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommendation algorithms forecast user preferences by correlating user and item representations derived from historical interaction patterns. In pursuit of enhanced performance, many methods focus on learning robust and independent representations by disentangling the intricate factors within interaction data across various modalities in an unsupervised manner. However, such an approach obfuscates the discernment of how specific factors (e.g., category or brand) influence the outcomes, making it challenging to regulate their effects. In response to this challenge, we introduce a novel method called Attribute-Driven Disentangled Representation Learning (short for AD-DRL), which explicitly incorporates attributes from different modalities into the disentangled representation learning process. By assigning a specific attribute to each factor in multimodal features, AD-DRL can disentangle the factors at both attribute and attribute-value levels. To obtain robust and independent representations for each factor associated with a specific attribute, we first disentangle the representations of features both within and across different modalities. Moreover, we further enhance the robustness of the representations by fusing the multimodal features of the same factor. Empirical evaluations conducted on three public real-world datasets substantiate the effectiveness of AD-DRL, as well as its interpretability and controllability.</description>

      <title>Multi-Tower Multi-Interest Recommendation with User Representation Repel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of information overload, the value of recommender systems has been profoundly recognized in academia and industry alike. Multi-interest sequential recommendation, in particular, is a subfield that has been receiving increasing attention in recent years. By generating multiple-user representations, multi-interest learning models demonstrate superior expressiveness than single-user representation models, both theoretically and empirically. Despite major advancements in the field, three major issues continue to plague the performance and adoptability of multi-interest learning methods, the difference between training and deployment objectives, the inability to access item information, and the difficulty of industrial adoption due to its single-tower architecture. We address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-tower multi-interest framework with user representation repel. Experimental results across multiple large-scale industrial datasets proved the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Context-augmented Retrieval: A Novel Framework for Fast Information Retrieval based Response Generation using Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating high-quality answers consistently by providing contextual information embedded in the prompt passed to the Large Language Model (LLM) is dependent on the quality of information retrieval. As the corpus of contextual information grows, the answer/inference quality of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based Question Answering (QA) systems declines. This work solves this problem by combining classical text classification with the Large Language Model (LLM) to enable quick information retrieval from the vector store and ensure the relevancy of retrieved information. For the same, this work proposes a new approach Context Augmented retrieval (CAR), where partitioning of vector database by real-time classification of information flowing into the corpus is done. CAR demonstrates good quality answer generation along with significant reduction in information retrieval and answer generation time.</description>

      <title>Semantic-aware Representation Learning for Homography Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homography estimation is the task of determining the transformation from an image pair. Our approach focuses on employing detector-free feature matching methods to address this issue. Previous work has underscored the importance of incorporating semantic information, however there still lacks an efficient way to utilize semantic information. Previous methods suffer from treating the semantics as a pre-processing, causing the utilization of semantics overly coarse-grained and lack adaptability when dealing with different tasks. In our work, we seek another way to use the semantic information, that is semantic-aware feature representation learning framework.Based on this, we propose SRMatcher, a new detector-free feature matching method, which encourages the network to learn integrated semantic feature representation.Specifically, to capture precise and rich semantics, we leverage the capabilities of recently popularized vision foundation models (VFMs) trained on extensive datasets. Then, a cross-images Semantic-aware Fusion Block (SFB) is proposed to integrate its fine-grained semantic features into the feature representation space. In this way, by reducing errors stemming from semantic inconsistencies in matching pairs, our proposed SRMatcher is able to deliver more accurate and realistic outcomes. Extensive experiments show that SRMatcher surpasses solid baselines and attains SOTA results on multiple real-world datasets. Compared to the previous SOTA approach GeoFormer, SRMatcher increases the area under the cumulative curve (AUC) by about 11% on HPatches. Additionally, the SRMatcher could serve as a plug-and-play framework for other matching methods like LoFTR, yielding substantial precision improvement.</description>

      <title>DCNv3: Towards Next Generation Deep Cross Network for CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13349v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep &amp; Cross Network and its derivative models have become an important paradigm in click-through rate (CTR) prediction due to their effective balance between computational cost and performance. However, these models face four major limitations: (1) while most models claim to capture high-order feature interactions, they often do so implicitly and non-interpretably through deep neural networks (DNN), which limits the trustworthiness of the model's predictions; (2) the performance of existing explicit feature interaction methods is often weaker than that of implicit DNN, undermining their necessity; (3) many models fail to adaptively filter noise while enhancing the order of feature interactions; (4) the fusion methods of most models cannot provide suitable supervision signals for their different interaction methods.
  To address the identified limitations, this paper proposes the next generation Deep Cross Network (DCNv3) and Shallow &amp; Deep Cross Network (SDCNv3). These models ensure interpretability in feature interaction modeling while exponentially increasing the order of feature interactions to achieve genuine Deep Crossing rather than just Deep &amp; Cross. Additionally, we employ a Self-Mask operation to filter noise and reduce the number of parameters in the cross network by half. In the fusion layer, we use a simple yet effective loss weight calculation method called Tri-BCE to provide appropriate supervision signals. Comprehensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and interpretability of DCNv3 and SDCNv3. The code, running logs, and detailed hyperparameter configurations are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DCNv3-E352.</description>

      <title>Scalable Dynamic Embedding Size Search for Streaming Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems typically represent users and items by learning their embeddings, which are usually set to uniform dimensions and dominate the model parameters. However, real-world recommender systems often operate in streaming recommendation scenarios, where the number of users and items continues to grow, leading to substantial storage resource consumption for these embeddings. Although a few methods attempt to mitigate this by employing embedding size search strategies to assign different embedding dimensions in streaming recommendations, they assume that the embedding size grows with the frequency of users/items, which eventually still exceeds the predefined memory budget over time. To address this issue, this paper proposes to learn Scalable Lightweight Embeddings for streaming recommendation, called SCALL, which can adaptively adjust the embedding sizes of users/items within a given memory budget over time. Specifically, we propose to sample embedding sizes from a probabilistic distribution, with the guarantee to meet any predefined memory budget. By fixing the memory budget, the proposed embedding size sampling strategy can increase and decrease the embedding sizes in accordance to the frequency of the corresponding users or items. Furthermore, we develop a reinforcement learning-based search paradigm that models each state with mean pooling to keep the length of the state vectors fixed, invariant to the changing number of users and items. As a result, the proposed method can provide embedding sizes to unseen users and items. Comprehensive empirical evaluations on two public datasets affirm the advantageous effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>REAPER: Reasoning based Retrieval Planning for Complex RAG Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex dialog systems often use retrieved evidence to facilitate factual responses. Such RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems retrieve from massive heterogeneous data stores that are usually architected as multiple indexes or APIs instead of a single monolithic source. For a given query, relevant evidence needs to be retrieved from one or a small subset of possible retrieval sources. Complex queries can even require multi-step retrieval. For example, a conversational agent on a retail site answering customer questions about past orders will need to retrieve the appropriate customer order first and then the evidence relevant to the customer's question in the context of the ordered product. Most RAG Agents handle such Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks by interleaving reasoning and retrieval steps. However, each reasoning step directly adds to the latency of the system. For large models this latency cost is significant -- in the order of multiple seconds. Multi-agent systems may classify the query to a single Agent associated with a retrieval source, though this means that a (small) classification model dictates the performance of a large language model. In this work we present REAPER (REAsoning-based PlannER) - an LLM based planner to generate retrieval plans in conversational systems. We show significant gains in latency over Agent-based systems and are able to scale easily to new and unseen use cases as compared to classification-based planning. Though our method can be applied to any RAG system, we show our results in the context of a conversational shopping assistant.</description>

Abstract: In applied mathematics and related disciplines, the modeling-simulation-optimization workflow is a prominent scheme, with mathematical models and numerical algorithms playing a crucial role. For these types of mathematical research data, the Mathematical Research Data Initiative has developed, merged and implemented ontologies and knowledge graphs. This contributes to making mathematical research data FAIR by introducing semantic technology and documenting the mathematical foundations accordingly. Using the concrete example of microfracture analysis of porous media, it is shown how the knowledge of the underlying mathematical model and the corresponding numerical algorithms for its solution can be represented by the ontologies.</description>
