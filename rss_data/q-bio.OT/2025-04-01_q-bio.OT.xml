      <title>DNA and Human Language: Epigenetic Memory and Redundancy in Linear Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA has long been described as the "language of life", but whether it possesses formal linguistic properties remains unresolved. Here, we present the first empirical evidence that DNA sequences exhibit core linguistic features-redundancy-through comprehensive analysis of genomic and epigenetic datasets. By mapping DNA sequences into a linguistic feature space, we demonstrate that fixed-length (41 bp) DNA segments encode information analogously to human language, with redundancy contributing to signal stability in aqueous environments. Moreover, we provide the first evidence of one-dimensional epigenetic memory, revealing how linear DNA sequences can store and maintain epigenetic marks like 6mA methylation, independent of higher-order chromatin structure1. Our approach also resolves persistent challenges in genomic data processing by applying a tailored linguistic mapping strategy that significantly improves data cleaning and analytical accuracy. Together, these findings establish a novel scientific paradigm that connects genomic information encoding with linguistic theory, laying the foundation for future development of large language models (LLMs) specifically designed for DNA.</description>

      <title>Language-Inspired Modeling Reveals Redundant Encoding of N4-acetylcytidine(ac4C) Modifications in mRNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ac4C modification on mRNA has been demonstrated to be associated with various diseases; however, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. The wet lab experiments produced relatively rough data, which lack precise ac4C modification sites, and extracting valuable information from such data remains a challenge. In this study, we integrate linguistics, traditional machine learning, and deep learning, establishing a link between the understanding of mRNA data and natural language processing (NLP). Through our analysis, we successfully revealed key information about ac4C in mRNA and uncovered the information storage mechanism of ac4C redundancy on a single sequence. This redundant information storage method in mRNA facilitates the transmission of ac4C information and promotes the enrichment of ac4C.</description>
