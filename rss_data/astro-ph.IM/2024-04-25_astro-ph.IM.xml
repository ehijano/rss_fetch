      <title>Detecting unresolved lensed SNe Ia in LSST using blended light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong-gravitationally lensed supernovae (LSNe) are promising probes for providing absolute distance measurements using gravitational lens time delays. Spatially unresolved LSNe offer an opportunity to enhance the sample size for precision cosmology. We predict that there will be approximately $3$ times more unresolved than resolved LSNe Ia in the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the Rubin Observatory. In this article, we explore the feasibility of detecting unresolved LSNe Ia from the shape of the observed blended light curves using deep learning techniques, and we find that $\sim 30\%$ can be detected with a simple 1D CNN using well-sampled $rizy$-band light curves (with a false-positive rate of $\sim 3\%$). Even when the light curve is well-observed in only a single band among $r$, $i$, and $z$, detection is still possible with false-positive rates ranging from $\sim 4-7\%$, depending on the band. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these unresolved cases can be detected at an early stage using light curves up to $\sim20$ days from the first observation, with well-controlled false-positive rates, providing ample opportunities for triggering follow-up observations. Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of time-delay estimations using solely LSST-like data of unresolved light curves, particularly for doubles, when excluding systems with low time delay and magnification ratio. However, the abundance of such systems among those unresolved in LSST poses a significant challenge. This approach holds potential utility for upcoming wide-field surveys, and overall results could significantly improve with enhanced cadence and depth in the future surveys.</description>

      <title>High Contrast, High Angular Resolution Optical Speckle Imaging: Uncovering Hidden Stellar Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of detecting very faint, very close-in stellar companions using large aperture ground-based telescopes and the technique of optical speckle imaging. We examine the state of high angular resolution speckle imaging and contrast levels being achieved using current speckle cameras on the Gemini 8-m telescope. We then explore the use of the modern image reconstruction technique - Multi-Frame Blind Deconvolution (MFBD) - applied to speckle imaging from the Gemini 8-m telescope. We show that MFBD allows us to measure the flux ratio of the imaged stars to high accuracy and the reconstructed images yield higher precision astrometry. Both of these advances provide a large refinement in the derived astrophysical parameters compared with current Fourier techniques. MFBD image reconstructions reach contrast levels of $\sim$5$\times$10$^{-3}$, near the diffraction limit, to $\sim$10$^{-4}$ about 1.0 arcsec away. At these deep contrast levels with angular limits starting near the 8-m diffraction limit ($\sim$20 mas), most stellar companions to a solar-like stars can be imaged in the optical to near-IR bandpass (320-1000 nm).</description>

      <title>Jitter Characterization of the HyTI Satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hyperspectral Thermal Imager (HyTI) is a technology demonstration mission that will obtain high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution long-wave infrared images of Earth's surface from a 6U cubesat. HyTI science requires that the pointing accuracy of the optical axis shall not exceed 2.89 arcsec over the 0.5 ms integration time due to microvibration effects (known as jitter). Two sources of vibration are a cryocooler that is added to maintain the detector at 68 K and three orthogonally placed reaction wheels that are a part of the attitude control system. Both of these parts will introduce vibrations that are propagated through to the satellite structure while imaging. Typical methods of characterizing and measuring jitter involve complex finite element methods and specialized equipment and setups. In this paper, we describe a novel method of characterizing jitter for small satellite systems that is low-cost and minimally modifies the subject's mass distribution. The metrology instrument is comprised of a laser source, a small mirror mounted via a 3D printed clamp to a jig, and a lateral effect position-sensing detector. The position-sensing detector samples 1000 Hz and can measure displacements as little as 0.15 arcsec at distances of one meter. This paper provides an experimental procedure that incrementally analyzes vibratory sources to establish causal relationships between sources and the vibratory modes they create. We demonstrate the capabilities of this metrology system and testing procedure on HyTI in the Hawaii Space Flight Lab's clean room. Results include power spectral density plots that show fundamental and higher-order vibratory modal frequencies. Results from metrology show that jitter from reaction wheels meets HyTI system requirements within 3$\sigma$.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical PSF Reconstruction Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstruction of the point spread function (PSF) plays an important role in many areas of astronomy, including photometry, astrometry, galaxy morphology, and shear measurement. The atmospheric and instrumental effects are the two main contributors to the PSF, both of which may exhibit complex spatial features. Current PSF reconstruction schemes typically rely on individual exposures, and its ability of reproducing the complicated features of the PSF distribution is therefore limited by the number of stars. Interestingly, in conventional methods, after stacking the model residuals of the PSF ellipticities and (relative) sizes from a large number of exposures, one can often observe some stable and nontrivial spatial patterns on the entire focal plane, which could be quite detrimental to, e.g., weak lensing measurements. These PSF residual patterns are caused by instrumental effects as they consistently appear in different exposures. Taking this as an advantage, we propose a multi-layer PSF reconstruction method to remove such PSF residuals, the second and third layers of which make use of all available exposures together. We test our method on the i-band data of the second release of Hyper Suprime-Cam. Our method successfully eliminates most of the PSF residuals. Using the Fourier\_Quad shear measurement method, we further test the performance of the resulting PSF fields on shear recovery using the field distortion effect. The PSF residuals have strong correlations with the shear residuals, and our new multi-layer PSF reconstruction method can remove most of such systematic errors related to PSF, leading to much smaller shear biases.</description>

      <title>The Robotic MAAO 0.7m Telescope System: Performance and Standard Photometric System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a 0.7m telescope system at the Miryang Arirang Astronomical Observatory (MAAO), a public observatory in Miryang, Korea. System integration and a scheduling program enable the 0.7m telescope system to operate completely robotically during nighttime, eliminating the need for human intervention. Using the 0.7m telescope system, we obtain atmospheric extinction coefficients and the zero-point magnitudes by observing standard stars. As a result, we find that atmospheric extinctions are moderate but they can sometimes increase depending on the weather conditions. The measured 5-sigma limiting magnitudes reach down to BVRI=19.4-19.6 AB mag for a point source with a total integrated time of 10 minutes under clear weather conditions, demonstrating comparable performance with other observational facilities operating under similar specifications and sky conditions. We expect that the newly established MAAO 0.7m telescope system will contribute significantly to the observational studies of astronomy. Particularly, with its capability for robotic observations, this system, although its primary duty is for public viewing, can be extensively used for the time-series observation of transients.</description>

      <title>Photometry of Saturated Stars with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a deep neural network (DNN) to obtain photometry of saturated stars in the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). The DNN can obtain unbiased photometry for stars from g=4 to 14 mag with a dispersion (15%-85% 1sigma range around median) of 0.12 mag for saturated (g&lt;11.5 mag) stars. More importantly, the light curve of a non-variable saturated star has a median dispersion of only 0.037 mag. The DNN light curves are, in many cases, spectacularly better than provided by the standard ASAS-SN pipelines. While the network was trained on g band data from only one of ASAS-SN's 20 cameras, initial experiments suggest that it can be used for any camera and the older ASAS-SN V band data as well. The dominant problems seem to be associated with correctable issues in the ASAS-SN data reduction pipeline for saturated stars more than the DNN itself. The method is publicly available as a light curve option on ASAS-SN Sky Patrol v1.0.</description>

      <title>A New Parameterization for Finding Solutions for Microlensing Exoplanet Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational microlensing method of discovering exoplanets and multi-star systems can produce degenerate solutions, some of which require in-depth analysis to uncover. We propose a new parameter space that can be used to sample potential solutions more efficiently and is more robust at finding all degenerate solutions. We identified two new parameters, k and h, that can be sampled in place of the mass ratios and separations of the systems under analysis to identify degenerate solutions. The parameter k is related to the size of the central caustic, $\Delta\xi_c$, while h is related to the distance of a point along the k contour from log(s)=0, where s is the projected planet-host separation. In this work, we present the characteristics of these parameters and the tests we conducted to prove their efficacy.</description>

      <title>Cross-Temporal Spectrogram Autoencoder (CTSAE): Unsupervised Dimensionality Reduction for Clustering Gravitational Wave Glitches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) has significantly enhanced the feasibility and reliability of gravitational wave detection. However, LIGO's high sensitivity makes it susceptible to transient noises known as glitches, which necessitate effective differentiation from real gravitational wave signals. Traditional approaches predominantly employ fully supervised or semi-supervised algorithms for the task of glitch classification and clustering. In the future task of identifying and classifying glitches across main and auxiliary channels, it is impractical to build a dataset with manually labeled ground-truth. In addition, the patterns of glitches can vary with time, generating new glitches without manual labels. In response to this challenge, we introduce the Cross-Temporal Spectrogram Autoencoder (CTSAE), a pioneering unsupervised method for the dimensionality reduction and clustering of gravitational wave glitches. CTSAE integrates a novel four-branch autoencoder with a hybrid of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT). To further extract features across multi-branches, we introduce a novel multi-branch fusion method using the CLS (Class) token. Our model, trained and evaluated on the GravitySpy O3 dataset on the main channel, demonstrates superior performance in clustering tasks when compared to state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, CTSAE represents the first unsupervised approach tailored specifically for clustering LIGO data, marking a significant step forward in the field of gravitational wave research.

      <title>Parts-per-billion Trace Element Detection in Anhydrous Minerals by Micro-scale Quantitative NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs) composing Earth's and planetary rocks incorporate microscopic amounts of volatiles. However, volatile distribution in NAMs and their effect on physical properties of rocks remain controversial. Thus, constraining trace volatile concentrations in NAMs is tantamount to our understanding of the evolution of rocky planets and planetesimals. Here, we present a novel approach of trace-element quantification using micro-scale Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This approach employs the principle of enhanced mass-sensitivity in NMR microcoils formerly used in \textit{in-situ} high pressure experiments. We were able to demonstrate that this method is in excellent agreement with standard methods across their respective detection capabilities. We show that by simultaneous detection of internal reference nuclei, the quantification sensitivity can be substantially increased, leading to quantifiable trace volatile element amounts of about $50$ wt-ppb measured in a micro-meter sized single anorthitic mineral grain, greatly enhancing detection capabilities of volatiles in geologically important systems.</description>

      <title>Feature Selection Techniques for CR Isotope Identification with the AMS-02 Experiment in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isotopic composition measurements of singly charged cosmic rays (CR) provide essential insights into CR transport in the Galaxy. The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) can identify singly charged isotopes up to about 10 GeV/n. However, their identification presents challenges due to the small abundance of CR deuterons compared to the proton background. In particular, a high accuracy for the velocity measured by a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH) is needed to achieve a good isotopic mass separation over a wide range of energies. The velocity measurement with the RICH is particularly challenging for $Z=1$ isotopes due to the low number of photons produced in the Cherenkov rings. This faint signal is easily disrupted by noisy hits leading to a misreconstruction of the particles' ring. Hence, an efficient background reduction process is needed to ensure the quality of the reconstructed Cherenkov rings and provide a correct measurement of the particles' velocity. Machine learning methods, particularly boosted decision trees, are well suited for this task, but their performance relies on the choice of the features needed for their training phase. While physics-driven feature selection methods based on the knowledge of the detector are often used, machine learning algorithms for automated feature selection can provide a helpful alternative that optimises the classification method's performance. We compare five algorithms for selecting the feature samples for RICH background reduction, achieving the best results with the Random Forest method. We also test its performance against the physics-driven selection method, obtaining better results.</description>

      <title>Facilitating Advanced Sentinel-2 Analysis Through a Simplified Computation of Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sentinel-2 (S2) mission from the European Space Agency's Copernicus program provides essential data for Earth surface analysis. Its Level-2A products deliver high-to-medium resolution (10-60 m) surface reflectance (SR) data through the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI). To enhance the accuracy and comparability of SR data, adjustments simulating a nadir viewing perspective are essential. These corrections address the anisotropic nature of SR and the variability in sun and observation angles, ensuring consistent image comparisons over time and under different conditions. The $c$-factor method, a simple yet effective algorithm, adjusts observed S2 SR by using the MODIS BRDF model to achieve Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR). Despite the straightforward application of the $c$-factor to individual images, a cohesive Python framework for its application across multiple S2 images and Earth System Data Cubes (ESDCs) from cloud-stored data has been lacking. Here we introduce sen2nbar, a Python package crafted to convert S2 SR data to NBAR, supporting both individual images and ESDCs derived from cloud-stored data. This package simplifies the conversion of S2 SR data to NBAR via a single function, organized into modules for efficient process management. By facilitating NBAR conversion for both SAFE files and ESDCs from SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC), sen2nbar is developed as a flexible tool that can handle diverse data format requirements. We anticipate that sen2nbar will considerably contribute to the standardization and harmonization of S2 data, offering a robust solution for a diverse range of users across various applications. sen2nbar is an open-source tool available at https://github.com/ESDS-Leipzig/sen2nbar.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How many gravitational-wave observations from double compact object mergers have we seen to date? This seemingly simple question surprisingly yields a somewhat ambiguous answer that depends on the chosen data-analysis pipeline, detection threshold and other underlying assumptions. To illustrate this we provide visualizations of the number of existing detections from double compact object mergers by the end of the third observing run (O3) based on recent results from the literature. Additionally, we visualize the expected number of observations from future-generation detectors, highlighting the possibility of up to millions of detections per year by the time next-generation ground-based detectors like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope come online. We present a publicly available code that highlights the exponential growth in gravitational-wave observations in the coming decades and the exciting prospects of gravitational-wave (astro)physics.</description>

      <title>High-volume tunable resonator for axion searches above 7 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results from the first experimental demonstration of a tunable thin-shell axion haloscope. This novel geometry decouples the overall volume of the cavity-based resonator from its resonant frequency, thereby evading the steep sensitivity degradation at high-frequencies. An aluminum $2.6$ L ($41$ $\lambda^3$) prototype which tunes from $7.1$ to $8.0$ GHz was fabricated and characterized at room temperature. An axion-sensitive, straightforwardly tunable $\mathrm{TM}$$_{010}$ mode is clearly identified with a room temperature quality factor, $Q$, of $\sim$$5,000$. The on-resonance $E$-field distribution is mapped and found to agree with numerical calculations. Anticipating future cryogenic operation, we develop an alignment protocol relying only on rf measurements of the cavity, maintaining a form factor of $0.57$ across the full tuning range. These measurements demonstrate the feasibility of cavity-based haloscopes with operating volume $V\gg\lambda^3$. We discuss plans for future development and the parameters required for a thin-shell haloscope exploring the post-inflationary axion parameter space ($\sim$$4$ to $\sim$$30$ GHz) at DFSZ sensitivity.</description>

Abstract: The dynamical evolution of tight star-planet systems is influenced by tidal interactions between the star and the planet, as was shown recently. The rate at which spins and orbits in such a system evolve depends on the stellar and planetary tidal dissipation efficiency. Here, we present a method to constrain the modified tidal quality factor $Q'_*$ of a planet-hosting star whose rotational evolution has been altered by its planet through angular momentum transfer from the planetary orbital motion to the rotation of the stellar convective zone. The altered rotation is estimated from an observed discrepancy of magnetic activity of the planet-hosting star and a coeval companion star, i.e. this method is applicable to star-planet systems with wide stellar companions. We give an example of the planet-hosting wide binary system HD189733 and find that the planet host's modified tidal quality factor is constrained to be $Q'_* \leq 2.33 \times 10^7$.</description>
