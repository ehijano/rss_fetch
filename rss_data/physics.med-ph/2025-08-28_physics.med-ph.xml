      <title>Comparative analysis of corneal and lens doses in nuclear medicine and impact of lead eyeglasses: a Monte Carlo simulation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Research on eye lens dosimetry for radiation workers has increased after the 2012 ICRP118 update on eye lens dose limits. However, corneal dosimetry remains underexplored due to historical focus and measurement challenges. This study uses a high-resolution digital eye phantom in Monte Carlo simulations to estimate corneal and lens doses for nuclear medicine staff, with and without lead glasses. Method: The Monte Carlo code GATE (version 9.0) based on GEANT4 (version 10.6) was used to estimate and compare doses in a digital eye phantom, accounting for primary and scattered radiation from common radionuclides (F18, I131, Tc99m) with varying lead glass shielding (0 to 0.75 mm). Results: Across all radionuclides, the dose to the cornea was consistently higher than the dose to the lens. Notably, the ratio of corneal to lens dose increased with thicker lead glasses, indicating a greater dose reduction to the lens compared to the cornea. Conclusion: The findings show that corneal doses from all studied radionuclides exceeded lens doses. Although increasing lead glass thickness reduced both, the reduction was more significant for the lens, raising the cornea-to-lens dose ratio. This trend suggests that while thicker lead glasses enhance lens protection, their practicality may be limited due to diminishing returns and potential discomfort.

      <title>Shining light on degeneracies and uncertainties in quantifying both exchange and restriction with time-dependent diffusion MRI using Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) biophysical models hold promise for characterizing gray matter tissue microstructure. Yet, the reliability of estimated parameters remains largely under-studied, especially in models that incorporate water exchange. In this study, we investigate the accuracy, precision, and presence of degeneracy of two recently proposed gray matter models, NEXI and SANDIX, using two acquisition protocols from the literature, on both simulated and in vivo data. We employ $\mu$GUIDE, a Bayesian inference framework based on deep learning, to quantify model uncertainty and detect parameter degeneracies, enabling a more interpretable assessment of fitted parameters. Our results show that while some microstructural parameters, such as extra-cellular diffusivity and neurite signal fraction, are robustly estimated, others, such as exchange time and soma radius, are often associated with high uncertainty and estimation bias, especially under realistic noise conditions and reduced acquisition protocols. Comparisons with non-linear least squares fitting underscore the added value of uncertainty-aware methods, which allow for the identification and filtering of unreliable estimates. These findings emphasize the need to report uncertainty and consider model degeneracies when interpreting model-based estimates. Our study advocates for the integration of probabilistic fitting approaches in neuroscience imaging pipelines to improve reproducibility and biological interpretability.</description>

      <title>Functionally-graded drug delivery systems with binding reactions: analytical and stochastic approaches for the fraction of drug released</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical modelling and computer simulation are increasingly being used alongside experiments to help optimise and guide the design of drug delivery systems. Recent drug delivery research has (i) highlighted the advantages of drug delivery systems constructed using functionally graded materials to achieve target release rates and desired dosage levels over time; and (ii) revealed how it is possible for drug to bind to the carrier material and become irreversibly immobilised within the system, reducing the amount of drug delivered. In this paper, we consider the effect of functionally graded materials and binding reactions on drug release from common slab, cylinder and sphere devices. In particular, two key contributions are presented. First, we outline a deterministic-continuum approach that develops exact analytical expressions for calculating the total fraction of drug released from the device based on a partial differential equation model of the release process. Second, we develop a stochastic-discrete approach for calculating the fraction of drug released over time based on a random-walk model that captures the randomness of the release process and resulting variability in the total fraction of drug released. Both approaches are numerically validated and provide tools for exploring how the fraction of drug released depends on system parameters (e.g. diffusivity and reaction rate functions induced by the functionally graded material and binding reactions), insight which may be useful for designers of drug delivery systems.</description>

      <title>4D-Printing Assisted Scaffolds to Form Cardiac Bricks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Myocardial infarction causes myocardium thinning, fibrosis, and progressive heart failure. Engineered human myocardium (EHM) is tested clinically as a first-in-class product for sustainable remuscularization in patients with advanced heart failure. Current EHM production procedure from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and stromal cells, is time consuming and involves thin constructs. Here, I introduce 4D-DLP-printed foldable scaffolds with potential to create modular cylindrical cardiac bricks. This enables self-assembly into thicker and aligned sarcomeres with synchronous contractility mimicking a native myocardium. When optimized and integrated with cryopreservation protocols, the biomanufacturing and biobanking of these cellular building blocks may overcome current EHM limitations and advance translational regenerative therapies for myocardial infarction. The structure-material properties investigations into these new class of life building blocks paves the way for future medical breakthroughs.</description>

      <title>Physically-Based Inverse Rendering Framework for PET Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiable rendering has been widely adopted in computer graphics as a powerful approach to inverse problems, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization by differentiating the image formation process with respect to millions of scene parameters. Inspired by this paradigm, we propose a physically-based inverse rendering (IR) framework, the first ever platform for PET image reconstruction using Dr.Jit, for PET image reconstruction. Our method integrates Monte Carlo sampling with an analytical projector in the forward rendering process to accurately model photon transport and physical process in the PET system. The emission image is iteratively optimized using voxel-wise gradients obtained via automatic differentiation, eliminating the need for manually derived update equations. The proposed framework was evaluated using both phantom studies and clinical brain PET data acquired from a Siemens Biograph mCT scanner. Implementing the Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM) algorithm across both the CASToR toolkit and our IR framework, the IR reconstruction achieved a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and improved image quality compared to CASToR reconstructions. In clinical evaluation compared with the Siemens Biograph mCT platform, the IR reconstruction yielded higher hippocampal standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) and gray-to-white matter ratios (GWR), indicating enhanced tissue contrast and the potential for more accurate tau localization and Braak staging in Alzheimer's disease assessment. The proposed IR framework offers a physically interpretable and extensible platform for high-fidelity PET image reconstruction, demonstrating strong performance in both phantom and real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Reimagining Image Segmentation using Active Contour: From Chan Vese Algorithm into a Proposal Novel Functional Loss Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive study and analysis of the Chan-Vese algorithm for image segmentation. We employ a discretized scheme derived from the empirical study of the Chan-Vese model's functional energy and its partial differential equation based on its level set function. We provide a proof of the results and an implementation using MATLAB. Leveraging modern computer vision methodologies, we propose a functional segmentation loss based on active contours, utilizing pytorch.nn.ModuleLoss and a level set based on the Chan-Vese algorithm. We compare our results with common computer vision segmentation datasets and evaluate the performance of classical loss functions against our proposed method. All code and materials used are available at https://github.com/gguzzy/chan_vese_functional_loss.</description>

      <title>Personalized MR-Informed Diffusion Models for 3D PET Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has shown improved lesion detectability and flexibility to reconstruction hyperparameters (e.g. scanner geometry or dose level) when PET images are reconstructed by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models. Such methods train a diffusion model (without sinogram data) on high-quality, but still noisy, PET images. In this work, we propose a simple method for generating subject-specific PET images from a dataset of multi-subject PET-MR scans, synthesizing "pseudo-PET" images by transforming between different patients' anatomy using image registration. The images we synthesize retain information from the subject's MR scan, leading to higher resolution and the retention of anatomical features compared to the original set of PET images. With simulated and real [$^{18}$F]FDG datasets, we show that pre-training a personalized diffusion model with subject-specific "pseudo-PET" images improves reconstruction accuracy with low-count data. In particular, the method shows promise in combining information from a guidance MR scan without overly imposing anatomical features, demonstrating an improved trade-off between reconstructing PET-unique image features versus features present in both PET and MR. We believe this approach for generating and utilizing synthetic data has further applications to medical imaging tasks, particularly because patient-specific PET images can be generated without resorting to generative deep learning or large training datasets.</description>
