      <title>A Centrality-independent Framework for Revealing Genuine Higher-Order Cumulants in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel centrality definition-independent method for analyzing higher-order proton cumulants, specifically addressing the challenge of volume fluctuations that dominate in low-energy heavy-ion collisions. This method reconstructs particle number distributions using the Edgeworth expansion, with parameters optimized via a combination of differential evolution algorithm and Bayesian inference. Its effectiveness is validated using UrQMD model simulations and benchmarked against traditional approaches, including centrality definitions based on particle multiplicity. Our results show that the proposed framework yields cumulant patterns consistent with those obtained using number of participant nucleon ($N_{\text{part}}$) based centrality observables, while eliminating the conventional reliance on centrality determination. This consistency confirms the method's ability to extract genuine physical signals, thereby paving the way for probing the intrinsic thermodynamic properties of the produced medium through event-by-event fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Mitigating mode collapse in normalizing flows by annealing with an adaptive schedule: Application to parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normalizing flows (NFs) provide uncorrelated samples from complex distributions, making them an appealing tool for parameter estimation. However, the practical utility of NFs remains limited by their tendency to collapse to a single mode of a multimodal distribution. In this study, we show that annealing with an adaptive schedule based on the effective sample size (ESS) can mitigate mode collapse. We demonstrate that our approach can converge the marginal likelihood for a biochemical oscillator model fit to time-series data in ten-fold less computation time than a widely used ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We show that the ESS can also be used to reduce variance by pruning the samples. We expect these developments to be of general use for sampling with NFs and discuss potential opportunities for further improvements.</description>

      <title>Stay Positive: Neural Refinement of Sample Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations are an essential tool for data analysis in particle physics. Simulated events are typically produced alongside weights that redistribute the cross section across the phase space. Latent degrees of freedom introduce a distribution of weights at a given point in the phase space, which can include negative values. Several post-hoc reweighting methods have been developed to eliminate the negative weights. All of these methods share the common strategy of approximating the average weight as a function of phase space. We introduce an alternative approach with a potentially simpler learning task. Instead of reweighting to the average, we refine the initial weights with a scaling transformation, utilizing a phase space-dependent factor. Since this new refinement method does not need to model the full weight distribution, it can be more accurate. High-dimensional and unbinned phase space is processed using neural networks for the refinement. Using both realistic and synthetic examples, we show that the new neural refinement method is able to match or exceed the accuracy of similar weight transformations.</description>
