      <title>Principal Component Copulas for Capital Modelling and Systemic Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of copulas that we call Principal Component Copulas (PCCs). This class combines the strong points of copula-based techniques with principal component-based models, which results in flexibility when modelling tail dependence along the most important directions in high-dimensional data. We obtain theoretical results for PCCs that are important for practical applications. In particular, we derive tractable expressions for the high-dimensional copula density, which can be represented in terms of characteristic functions. We also develop algorithms to perform Maximum Likelihood and Generalized Method of Moment estimation in high-dimensions and show very good performance in simulation experiments. Finally, we apply the copula to the international stock market in order to study systemic risk. We find that PCCs lead to excellent performance on measures of systemic risk due to their ability to distinguish between parallel market movements, which increase systemic risk, and orthogonal movements, which reduce systemic risk. As a result, we consider the PCC promising for internal capital models, which financial institutions use to protect themselves against systemic risk.</description>

      <title>Optimal sharing, equilibria, and welfare without risk aversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze Pareto optimality and competitive equilibria in a risk-exchange economy, where either all agents are risk seeking in an expected utility model, or they exhibit local risk-seeking behaviour in a rank-dependent utility model. A novel mathematical tool, the counter-monotonic improvement theorem, states that for any nonnegative allocation of the aggregate random payoff, there exists a counter-monotonic random vector, called a jackpot allocation, that is componentwise riskier than the original allocation, and thus preferred by risk-seeking agents. This result allows us to characterize Pareto optimality, the utility possibility frontier, and competitive equilibria with risk-seeking expected utility agents, and prove the first and second fundamental theorems of welfare economics in this setting. For rank-dependent utility agents that are neither risk averse or risk seeking, we show that jackpot allocations can be Pareto optimal for small-scale payoffs, but for large-scale payoffs they are dominated by proportional allocations, thus explaining the often-observed small-stake gambling behaviour in a risk sharing context. Such jackpot allocations are also equilibrium allocations for small-scale payoffs when there is no aggregate uncertainty.</description>
