      <title>Sensitivity of quantitative diffusion MRI tractography and microstructure to anisotropic spatial sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Diffusion weighted MRI (dMRI) and its models of neural structure provide insight into human brain organization and variations in white matter. A recent study by McMaster, et al. showed that complex graph measures of the connectome, the graphical representation of a tractogram, vary with spatial sampling changes, but biases introduced by anisotropic voxels in the process have not been well characterized. This study uses microstructural measures (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity) and white matter bundle properties (bundle volume, length, and surface area) to further understand the effect of anisotropic voxels on microstructure and tractography. Methods: The statistical significance of the selected measures derived from dMRI data were assessed by comparing three white matter bundles at different spatial resolutions with 44 subjects from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset scan/rescan data using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. The original isotropic resolution (1.25 mm isotropic) was explored with six anisotropic resolutions with 0.25 mm incremental steps in the z dimension. Then, all generated resolutions were upsampled to 1.25 mm isotropic and 1 mm isotropic. Results: There were statistically significant differences between at least one microstructural and one bundle measure at every resolution (p less than or equal to 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). Cohen's d coefficient evaluated the effect size of anisotropic voxels on microstructure and tractography. Conclusion: Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity cannot be recovered with basic up sampling from low quality data with gold standard data. However, the bundle measures from tractogram become more repeatable when voxels are resampled to 1 mm isotropic.</description>

      <title>Predicting Muscle Thickness Deformation from Muscle Activation Patterns: A Dual-Attention Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between muscle activation and thickness deformation is critical for diagnosing muscle-related diseases and monitoring muscle health. Although ultrasound technique can measure muscle thickness change during muscle movement, its application in portable devices is limited by wiring and data collection challenges. Surface electromyography (sEMG), on the other hand, records muscle bioelectrical signals as the muscle activation. This paper introduced a deep-learning approach to leverage sEMG signals for muscle thickness deformation prediction, eliminating the need for ultrasound measurement. Using a dual-attention framework combining self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, this method predicted muscle deformation directly from sEMG data. Experimental results with six healthy subjects showed that the approach could accurately predict muscle excursion with an average precision of 0.923$\pm$0.900mm, which shows that this method can facilitate real-time portable muscle health monitoring, showing potential for applications in clinical diagnostics, sports science, and rehabilitation.</description>

      <title>The Comparison of Riemannian Geometric Matrix-CFAR Signal Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Essential characteristics of signal data can be captured by the autocovariance matrix, which, in the stationary scenarios, is Toeplitz Hermitian positive definite (HPD). In this paper, several well-known Riemannian geometric structures of HPD matrix manifolds are applied to signal detection, including the affine invariant Riemannian metric, the log-Euclidean metric, and the Bures--Wasserstein (BW) metric, the last of which was recently extended to HPD manifolds. Riemannian gradient descent algorithms are proposed to solve the corresponding geometric means and medians, that play fundamental roles in the detection process. Simulations within the scenario using the ideal steering vector as the target signal provide compelling evidence that the BW detectors outperform the other geometric detectors as well as the conventional adaptive matched filter and adaptive normalized matched filter when observation data are limited. Further simulations demonstrate that the matrix-CFAR is robust in scenarios where the signal is mismatched. In addition to detection performances, robustness of the geometric detectors to outliers and computational complexity of the algorithms are analysed.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Multi-Object Estimation via Labeled Random Finite Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents the Labeled Random Finite Set (LRFS) framework for multi-object systems-systems in which the number of objects and their states are unknown and vary randomly with time. In particular, we focus on state and trajectory estimation via a multi-object State Space Model (SSM) that admits principled tractable multi-object tracking filters/smoothers. Unlike the single-object counterpart, a time sequence of states does not necessarily represent the trajectory of a multi-object system. The LRFS formulation enables a time sequence of multi-object states to represent the multi-object trajectory that accommodates trajectory crossings and fragmentations. We present the basics of LRFS, covering a suite of commonly used models and mathematical apparatus (including the latest results not published elsewhere). Building on this, we outline the fundamentals of multi-object state space modeling and estimation using LRFS, which formally address object identities/trajectories, ancestries for spawning objects, and characterization of the uncertainty on the ensemble of objects (and their trajectories). Numerical solutions to multi-object SSM problems are inherently far more challenging than those in standard SSM. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we discuss state-of-the-art implementations that address key computational bottlenecks in the number of objects, measurements, sensors, and scans.</description>

      <title>MECG-E: Mamba-based ECG Enhancer for Baseline Wander Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important non-invasive method for diagnosing cardiovascular disease. However, ECG signals are susceptible to noise contamination, such as electrical interference or signal wandering, which reduces diagnostic accuracy. Various ECG denoising methods have been proposed, but most existing methods yield suboptimal performance under very noisy conditions or require several steps during inference, leading to latency during online processing. In this paper, we propose a novel ECG denoising model, namely Mamba-based ECG Enhancer (MECG-E), which leverages the Mamba architecture known for its fast inference and outstanding nonlinear mapping capabilities. Experimental results indicate that MECG-E surpasses several well-known existing models across multiple metrics under different noise conditions. Additionally, MECG-E requires less inference time than state-of-the-art diffusion-based ECG denoisers, demonstrating the model's functionality and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Physically Consistent RIS: From Reradiation Mode Optimization to Practical Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a practical framework for designing a physically consistent reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to overcome the inefficiency of the conventional phase gradient approach. For a section of Cape Town and across three different coverage enhancement scenarios, we optimize the amplitude of the RIS reradiation modes using Sionna ray tracing and a gradient-based learning technique. We then determine the required RIS surface/sheet impedance given the desired amplitudes for the reradiation modes, design the corresponding unitcells, and validate the performance through full-wave numerical simulations using CST Microwave Studio. We further validate our approach by fabricating a RIS using the parallel plate waveguide technique and conducting experimental measurements that align with our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Learning Beamforming in Cell-Free Massive MIMO ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beamforming design is critical for the efficient operation of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) MIMO systems. ISAC beamforming design in cell-free massive MIMO systems, compared to colocated MIMO systems, is more challenging due to the additional complexity of the distributed large number of access points (APs). To address this problem, this paper first shows that graph neural networks (GNNs) are a suitable machine learning framework. Then, it develops a novel heterogeneous GNN model inspired by the specific characteristics of the cell-free ISAC MIMO systems. This model enables the low-complexity scaling of the cell-free ISAC system and does not require full retraining when additional APs are added or removed. Our results show that the proposed architecture can achieve near-optimal performance, and applies well to various network structures.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient Beamforming Training in Terahertz Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) enables promising Tbps-level wireless transmission thanks to its prospect of ultra-huge spectrum utilization and narrow beamforming in the next sixth-generation (6G) communication system. Compared to millimeter wave (mmWave), THz intrinsically possesses compellingly severer molecular absorption and high pathloss serving confined coverage area. These defects should be well conquered under the employment of ultra-thin 3D beamforming with enormous deployed antennas with high beam gains. However, pencil-beams require substantially high overhead of time and power to train its optimal THz beamforming direction. We propose an energy efficient (EE) oriented THz beamforming (EETBF) scheme by separating the original complex problem into beamforming training (EETBF-BT) acquirement and learning-enabled training power assignment (EETBF-PA). The historical beam data is employed to update next beam selection policy. The performance results have demonstrated that the proposed EETBF outperforms the existing benchmarks leveraging full beam search, iterative search, linear/binary search as well as non-power-control based mechanism in open literature. Our proposed EETBF scheme results in the lowest training latency and power consumption, achieving the highest effective rate and EE performance.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Data- and Model-Driven Probing Beams and Beam Predictor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical search in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications incurs significant beam training overhead and delay, especially in a dynamic environment. Deep learning-enabled beam prediction is promising to significantly mitigate the overhead and delay, efficiently utilizing the site-specific channel prior. In this work, we propose to jointly optimize a data- and model-driven probe beam module and a cascaded data-driven beam predictor, with limitations in that the probe and communicate beams are restricted within the manifold space of uniform planer array and quantization of the phase modulator. First, The probe beam module senses the mmWave channel with a complex-valued neural network and outputs the counterpart RSRPs of probe beams. Second, the beam predictor estimates the RSRPs in the entire beamspace to minimize the prediction cross entropy and selects the optimal beam with the maximum RSRP value for data transmission. Additionally, we propose to add noise to the phase variables in the probe beam module, against quantization error. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>RIS-Enabled Cellular Systems Operated by Different Service Providers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In realistic cellular communication systems, multiple service providers will operate within different frequency ranges. Each serving cell, which is managed by a distinct service provider, is designed individually due to the orthogonal frequencies. However, when a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed for a certain cell, the RIS still incurs reflective channels for the overall system since the RIS reflects signals across all frequency ranges. This may cause severe undesired performance degradation for the other cells unless the reflection coefficients are properly designed. To tackle this issue, by utilizing the Riemannian manifold optimization method, an RIS reflection coefficients design is proposed in this paper to maximize the performance improvements of the cell that deploys the RIS while minimizing the undesired performance degradation for the other cells simultaneously. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design can effectively balance the two objectives for practical scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a speech enhancement solution tailored for true wireless stereo (TWS) earbuds on-device usage. The solution was specifically designed to support conversations in noisy environments, with active noise cancellation (ANC) activated. The primary challenges for speech enhancement models in this context arise from computational complexity that limits on-device usage and latency that must be less than 3 ms to preserve a live conversation. To address these issues, we evaluated several crucial design elements, including the network architecture and domain, design of loss functions, pruning method, and hardware-specific optimization. Consequently, we demonstrated substantial improvements in speech enhancement quality compared with that in baseline models, while simultaneously reducing the computational complexity and algorithmic latency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of a likelihood ratio test in combination with a polynomial subspace projection approach to detect weak transient signals in broadband array data. Based on previous empirical evidence that a likelihood ratio test is advantageously applied in a lower-dimensional subspace, we present analysis that highlights how the polynomial subspace projection whitens a crucial part of the signals, enabling a detector to operate with a shortened temporal window. This reduction in temporal correlation, together with a spatial compaction of the data, also leads to both computational and numerical advantages over a likelihood ratio test that is directly applied to the array data. The results of our analysis are illustrated by examples and simulations.</description>

      <title>Cluster-BPI: Efficient Fine-Grain Blind Power Identification for Defending against Hardware Thermal Trojans in Multicore SoCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern multicore System-on-Chips (SoCs) feature hardware monitoring mechanisms that measure total power consumption. However, these aggregate measurements are often insufficient for fine-grained thermal and power management. This paper presents an enhanced Clustering Blind Power Identification (ICBPI) approach, designed to improve the sensitivity and robustness of the traditional Blind Power Identification (BPI) method. BPI estimates the power consumption of individual cores and models the thermal behavior of an SoC using only thermal sensor data and total power measurements. The proposed ICBPI approach refines BPI's initialization process, particularly improving the non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) step, which is critical to the accuracy of BPI. ICBPI introduces density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) to better align temperature and power consumption data, thereby providing more accurate power consumption estimates. We validate the ICBPI method through two key tasks. The first task evaluates power estimation accuracy across four different multicore architectures, including a heterogeneous processor. Results show that ICBPI significantly enhances accuracy, reducing error rates by 77.56% compared to the original BPI and by 68.44% compared to the state-of-the-art BPISS method. The second task focuses on improving the detection and localization of malicious thermal sensor attacks in heterogeneous processors. The results demonstrate that ICBPI enhances the security and robustness of multicore SoCs against such attacks.</description>

      <title>Integrated Distributed Semantic Communication and Over-the-air Computation for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is a promising approach to improve the detection of primary users (PUs) using multiple sensors. However, there are several challenges for existing combination methods, i.e., performance degradation and ceiling effect for hard-decision fusion (HDF), as well as significant uploading latency and non-robustness to noise in the reporting channel for soft-data fusion (SDF). To address these issues, an integrated communication and computation (ICC) framework is proposed in this paper. Specifically, distributed semantic communication (DSC) jointly optimizes multiple sensors and the fusion center to minimize the transmitted data without degrading detection performance. Moreover, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is utilized to further reduce spectrum occupation in reporting channel, taking advantage of characteristics of wireless channel to enable data aggregation. Under the ICC framework, a particular system, namely ICC-CSS, is designed and implemented, which is theoretically proved to be equivalent to the optimal estimator-correlator (E-C) detector with equal gain SDF when the PU signal samples are independent and identically distributed. Extensive simulations verify the superiority of ICC-CSS compared with various conventional CSS schemes in terms of detection performance, robustness to SNR variations in both sensing and reporting channels, as well as scalability with respect to the number of samples and sensors.</description>

      <title>Near/Far-Field Channel Estimation For Terahertz Systems With ELAAs: A Block-Sparse-Aware Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millimeter wave/Terahertz (mmWave/THz) communication with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) offers a promising solution to meet the escalating demand for high data rates in next-generation communications. A large array aperture, along with the ever increasing carrier frequency within the mmWave/THz bands, leads to a large Rayleigh distance. As a result, the traditional plane-wave assumption may not hold valid for mmWave/THz systems featuring ELAAs. In this paper, we consider the problem of hybrid near/far-field channel estimation by taking spherical wave propagation into account. By analyzing the coherence properties of any two near-field steering vectors, we prove that the hybrid near/far-field channel admits a block-sparse representation on a specially designed orthogonal dictionary. Specifically, the percentage of nonzero elements of such a block-sparse representation decreases in the order of $1/\sqrt{N}$, which tends to zero as the number of antennas, $N$, grows. Such a block-sparse representation allows to convert channel estimation into a block-sparse signal recovery problem. Simulation results are provided to verify our theoretical results and illustrate the performance of the proposed channel estimation approach in comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Decoupling Capacitor Optimization for Power Distribution Network of 2.5D ICs with Co-Analysis of Frequency and Time Domains Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing need for higher memory bandwidth and computation density, 2.5D design, which involves integrating multiple chiplets onto an interposer, emerges as a promising solution. However, this integration introduces significant challenges due to increasing data rates and a large number of I/Os, necessitating advanced optimization of the power distribution networks (PDNs) both on-chip and on-interposer to mitigate the small signal noise and simultaneous switching noise (SSN). Traditional PDN optimization strategies in 2.5D systems primarily focus on reducing impedance by integrating decoupling capacitors (decaps) to lessen small signal noises. Unfortunately, relying solely on frequency-domain analysis has been proven inadequate for addressing coupled SSN, as indicated by our experimental results. In this work, we introduce a novel two-phase optimization flow using deep reinforcement learning to tackle both the on-chip small signal noise and SSN. Initially, we optimize the impedance in the frequency domain to maintain the small signal noise within acceptable limits while avoiding over-design. Subsequently, in the time domain, we refine the PDN to minimize the voltage violation integral (VVI), a more accurate measure of SSN severity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dual-domain optimization strategy that simultaneously addresses both the small signal noise and SSN propagation through strategic decap placement in on-chip and on-interposer PDNs, offering a significant step forward in the design of robust PDNs for 2.5D integrated systems.</description>

      <title>S-RAN: Semantic-Aware Radio Access Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has been a transformative paradigm, emphasizing the precise exchange of meaningful information over traditional bit-level transmissions. However, existing SemCom research, primarily centered on simplified scenarios like single-pair transmissions with direct wireless links, faces significant challenges when applied to real-world radio access networks (RANs). This article introduces a Semantic-aware Radio Access Network (S-RAN), offering a holistic systematic view of SemCom beyond single-pair transmissions. We begin by outlining the S-RAN architecture, introducing new physical components and logical functions along with key design challenges. We then present transceiver design for end-to-end transmission to overcome conventional SemCom transceiver limitations, including static channel conditions, oversimplified background knowledge models, and hardware constraints. Later, we delve into the discussion on radio resource management for multiple users, covering semantic channel modeling, performance metrics, resource management algorithms, and a case study, to elaborate distinctions from resource management for legacy RANs. Finally, we highlight open research challenges and potential solutions. The objective of this article is to serve as a basis for advancing SemCom research into practical wireless systems.</description>

      <title>A QoS-Aware Uplink Spectrum and Power Allocation with Link Adaptation for Vehicular Communications in 5G networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have proposed link adaptation-based joint spectrum and power allocation algorithms for the uplink communication in 5G Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) systems. In C-V2X, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) users share radio resources with vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) users. Existing works primarily focus on the optimal pairing of V2V and V2I users, assuming that each V2I user needs a single resource block (RB) while minimizing interference through power allocation. In contrast, in this work, we have considered that the number of RBs needed by the users is a function of their channel condition and Quality of Service (QoS) - a method called link adaptation. It effectively compensates for the frequent channel quality fluctuations at the high frequencies of 5G communication.5G uses a multi-numerology frame structure to support diverse QoS requirements, which has also been considered in this work.
  The first algorithm proposed in this article greedily allocates RBs to V2I users using link adaptation. It then uses the Hungarian algorithm to pair V2V with V2I users while minimizing interference through power allocation. The second proposed method groups RBs into resource chunks (RCs) and uses the Hungarian algorithm twice - first to allocate RCs to V2I users and then to pair V2I users with V2V users. Extensive simulations reveal that link adaptation increases the number of satisfied V2I users and their sum rate while also improving the QoS of V2I and V2V users, making it indispensable for 5G C-V2X systems.</description>

      <title>Contaminated Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection with Spatio-Temporal Graph Conditional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mainstream unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms often excel in academic datasets, yet their real-world performance is restricted due to the controlled experimental conditions involving clean training data. Addressing the challenge of training with noise, a prevalent issue in practical anomaly detection, is frequently overlooked. In a pioneering endeavor, this study delves into the realm of label-level noise within sensory time-series anomaly detection (TSAD). This paper presents a novel and practical end-to-end unsupervised TSAD when the training data is contaminated with anomalies. The introduced approach, called TSAD-C, is devoid of access to abnormality labels during the training phase. TSAD-C encompasses three core modules: a Decontaminator to rectify anomalies (aka noise) present during training, a Long-range Variable Dependency Modeling module to capture long-term intra- and inter-variable dependencies within the decontaminated data that is considered as a surrogate of the pure normal data, and an Anomaly Scoring module to detect anomalies from all types. Our extensive experiments conducted on four reliable and diverse datasets conclusively demonstrate that TSAD-C surpasses existing methodologies, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art in the TSAD field.</description>

      <title>Covariance-Based Activity Detection in Cooperative Multi-Cell Massive MIMO: Scaling Law and Efficient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the covariance-based activity detection problem in a multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. In this system, active devices transmit their signature sequences to multiple base stations (BSs), and the BSs cooperatively detect the active devices based on the received signals. While the scaling law for the covariance-based activity detection in the single-cell scenario has been extensively analyzed in the literature, this paper aims to analyze the scaling law for the covariance-based activity detection in the multi-cell massive MIMO system. Specifically, this paper demonstrates a quadratic scaling law in the multi-cell system, under the assumption that the path-loss exponent of the fading channel $\gamma &gt; 2.$ This finding shows that, in the multi-cell massive MIMO system, the maximum number of active devices that can be correctly detected in each cell increases quadratically with the length of the signature sequence and decreases logarithmically with the number of cells (as the number of antennas tends to infinity). Moreover, in addition to analyzing the scaling law for the signature sequences randomly and uniformly distributed on a sphere, the paper also establishes the scaling law for signature sequences based on a finite alphabet, which are easier to generate and store. Finally, this paper proposes two efficient accelerated coordinate descent (CD) algorithms with a convergence guarantee for solving the device activity detection problem. The first algorithm reduces the complexity of CD by using an inexact coordinate update strategy. The second algorithm avoids unnecessary computations of CD by using an active set selection strategy. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms exhibit excellent performance in terms of computational efficiency and detection error probability.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of Intracardiac Electrograms Through Textual Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01115v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the irregular electrical activity of atrial fibrillation (AFib) has been a key challenge in electrocardiography. For serious cases of AFib, catheter ablations are performed to collect intracardiac electrograms (EGMs). EGMs offer intricately detailed and localized electrical activity of the heart and are an ideal modality for interpretable cardiac studies. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) has allowed some works to utilize deep learning frameworks to interpret EGMs during AFib. Additionally, language models (LMs) have shown exceptional performance in being able to generalize to unseen domains, especially in healthcare. In this study, we are the first to leverage pretrained LMs for finetuning of EGM interpolation and AFib classification via masked language modeling. We formulate the EGM as a textual sequence and present competitive performances on AFib classification compared against other representations. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive interpretability study to provide a multi-perspective intuition of the model's behavior, which could greatly benefit the clinical use.</description>

      <title>Proprioception Is All You Need: Terrain Classification for Boreal Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works in field robotics highlighted the importance of resiliency against different types of terrains. Boreal forests, in particular, are home to many mobility-impeding terrains that should be considered for off-road autonomous navigation. Also, being one of the largest land biomes on Earth, boreal forests are an area where autonomous vehicles are expected to become increasingly common. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing BorealTC, a publicly available dataset for proprioceptive-based terrain classification (TC). Recorded with a Husky A200, our dataset contains 116 min of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), motor current, and wheel odometry data, focusing on typical boreal forest terrains, notably snow, ice, and silty loam. Combining our dataset with another dataset from the state-of-the-art, we evaluate both a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the novel state space model (SSM)-based Mamba architecture on a TC task. Interestingly, we show that while CNN outperforms Mamba on each separate dataset, Mamba achieves greater accuracy when trained on a combination of both. In addition, we demonstrate that Mamba's learning capacity is greater than a CNN for increasing amounts of data. We show that the combination of two TC datasets yields a latent space that can be interpreted with the properties of the terrains. We also discuss the implications of merging datasets on classification. Our source code and dataset are publicly available online: https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/BorealTC.</description>

      <title>Sensor Response-Time Reduction using Long-Short Term Memory Network Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The response time of a biosensor is a crucial metric in safety-critical applications such as medical diagnostics where an earlier diagnosis can markedly improve patient outcomes. However, the speed at which a biosensor reaches a final equilibrium state can be limited by poor mass transport and long molecular diffusion times that increase the time it takes target molecules to reach the active sensing region of a biosensor. While optimization of system and sensor design can promote molecules reaching the sensing element faster, a simpler and complementary approach for response time reduction that is widely applicable across all sensor platforms is to use time-series forecasting to predict the ultimate steady-state sensor response. In this work, we show that ensembles of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks can accurately predict equilibrium biosensor response from a small quantity of initial time-dependent biosensor measurements, allowing for significant reduction in response time by a mean and median factor of improvement of 18.6 and 5.1 respectively. The ensemble of models simultaneously estimates uncertainty, which is vital for ensuring confidence in the predictions and subsequent safety-related decisions that are made. This approach is demonstrated on real-time experimental data collected by exposing porous silicon biosensors to buffered protein solutions using a multi-channel fluidic cell that enables the automated measurement of 100 porous silicon biosensors in parallel. The dramatic improvement in sensor response time achieved using LSTM network ensembles and associated uncertainty quantification opens the door to trustworthy and faster responding biosensors, enabling more rapid medical diagnostics for faster clinical decision making that can lead to improved patient outcomes and healthcare access, as well as quicker identification of toxins in food and the environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is concerned with deep learning techniques applied to detection and localization of damage in a thin aluminum plate. We used data collected on a tabletop apparatus by mounting to the plate four piezoelectric transducers, each of which took turn to generate a Lamb wave that then traversed the region of interest before being received by the remaining three sensors. On training a neural network to analyze time-series data of the material response, which displayed damage-reflective features whenever the plate guided waves interacted with a contact load, we achieved a model that detected with greater than $99\%$ accuracy in addition to a model that localized with $2.58 \pm 0.12$ mm mean distance error. For each task, the best-performing model was designed according to the inductive bias that our transducers were both similar and arranged in a square pattern on a nearly uniform plate.</description>

      <title>Sparse Low-Ranked Self-Attention Transformer for Remaining Useful Lifetime Prediction of Optical Fiber Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical fiber amplifiers are key elements in present optical networks. Failures of these components result in high financial loss of income of the network operator as the communication traffic over an affected link is interrupted. Applying Remaining useful lifetime (RUL) prediction in the context of Predictive Maintenance (PdM) to optical fiber amplifiers to predict upcoming system failures at an early stage, so that network outages can be minimized through planning of targeted maintenance actions, ensures reliability and safety. Optical fiber amplifier are complex systems, that work under various operating conditions, which makes correct forecasting a difficult task. Increased monitoring capabilities of systems results in datasets that facilitate the application of data-driven RUL prediction methods. Deep learning models in particular have shown good performance, but generalization based on comparatively small datasets for RUL prediction is difficult. In this paper, we propose Sparse Low-ranked self-Attention Transformer (SLAT) as a novel RUL prediction method. SLAT is based on an encoder-decoder architecture, wherein two parallel working encoders extract features for sensors and time steps. By utilizing the self-attention mechanism, long-term dependencies can be learned from long sequences. The implementation of sparsity in the attention matrix and a low-rank parametrization reduce overfitting and increase generalization. Experimental application to optical fiber amplifiers exemplified on EDFA, as well as a reference dataset from turbofan engines, shows that SLAT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</description>
