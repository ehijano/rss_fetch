      <title>Three-phase equilibria of hydrates from computer simulation. III. Effect of dispersive interactions in the methane and carbon dioxide hydrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the effect of the range of the dispersive interactions in the determination of the three-phase coexistence line of the CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ hydrates has been studied. In particular, the temperature ($T_3$) at which solid hydrate, water, and liquid CO$_2$/gas CH$_4$ coexist has been determined through molecular dynamics simulations using different cut-off values (from 0.9 to 1.6 nm) for the dispersive interactions. The $T_3$ of both hydrates has been determined using the direct coexistence simulation technique. Following this method, the three phases in equilibrium are put together in the same simulation box, the pressure is fixed, and simulations are performed at different temperatures $T$. If the hydrate melts, then $T&gt;T_3$. Contrary, if the hydrate grows, then $T&lt;T_3$. The effect of the cut-off distance on the dissociation temperature has been analyzed at three different pressures for CO$_{2}$ hydrate, namely, $100$, $400$, and $1000\,\text{bar}$. Then, we have changed the guest and studied the effect of the cut-off distance on the dissociation temperature of the CH$_{4}$ hydrate at $400\,\text{bar}$. Also, the effect of long-range corrections for dispersive interactions has been analyzed by running simulations with homo- and inhomogeneous corrections and a cut-off value of 0.9 nm. The results obtained in this work highlight that the cut-off distance for the dispersive interactions affects the stability conditions of these hydrates. This effect is enhanced when the pressure is decreased, displacing the $T_{3}$ about $2-4\,\text{K}$ depending on the system and the pressure.</description>

      <title>Design and Fabrication of Nano-Particles with Customized Properties using Self-Assembly of Block-Copolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional nanoparticles (NPs) have gained significant attention as a promising application in various fields, including sensor, smart coating, drug delivery, and more. Here, we propose a novel mechanism assisted by machine-learning workflow to accurately predict phase diagram of NPs, which elegantly achieves tunability of shapes and internal structures of NPs using self-assembly of block-copolymers (BCP). Unlike most of previous studies, we obtain onion-like and mesoporous NPs in neutral environment and hamburger-like NPs in selective environment. Such novel phenomenon is obtained only by tailoring the topology of a miktoarm star BCP chain architecture without the need for any further treatment. Moreover, we demonstrate that the BCP chain architecture can be used as a new strategy for tuning the lamellar asymmetry of NPs. We show that the asymmetry between A and B lamellae in striped ellipsoidal and onion-like particles increases as the volume fraction of the A-block increases, beyond the level reached by linear BCPs. In addition, we find an extended region of onion-like structure in the phase diagram of A-selective environment, as well as the emergence of an inverse onion-like structure in the B-selective one. Our findings provide a valuable insight into the design and fabrication of nanoscale materials with customized properties, opening up new possibilities for advanced applications in sensing, materials science, and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface layers of water miscible volatile organic solvents (N,N-dimethylacetamide, acetone, ethanol, and tetrahydrofuran) have been formed on water and their properties have been studied. The layers are stable on the water surface and can be transferred to a solid substrate to form a multilayer film. Despite the volatility of the source material, some films can even withstand heating.</description>

      <title>Three-phase equilibria of hydrates from computer simulation. II. Finite-size effects in the carbon dioxide hydrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the effects of finite size on the determination of the three-phase coexistence temperature ($T_3$) of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) hydrate have been studied by molecular dynamic simulations and using the direct coexistence technique. According to this technique, the three phases involved are placed together in the same simulation box. By varying the number of molecules of each phase it is possible to analyze the effect of simulation size and stoichiometry on the $T_3$ determination. In this work, we have determined the $T_3$ value at 8 different pressures and using 6 different simulation boxes with different numbers of molecules and sizes. In 2 of these configurations, the ratio of the number of water and CO$_2$ molecules in the aqueous solution and the liquid CO$_2$ phase is the same as in the hydrate (stoichiometric configuration). In both stoichiometric configurations, the formation of a liquid drop of CO$_2$ in the aqueous phase is observed. This drop, which has a cylindrical geometry, increases the amount of CO$_2$ available in the aqueous solution and can in some cases lead to the crystallization of the hydrate at temperatures above $T_3$, overestimating the $T_3$ value obtained from direct coexistence simulations. The simulation results obtained for the CO$_{2}$ hydrate confirm the sensitivity of $T_{3}$ depending on the size and composition of the system, explaining the discrepancies observed in the original work by M\'iguez \emph{et al.} Non-stoichiometric configurations with larger unit cells show convergence of $T_{3}$ values, suggesting that finite-size effects for these system sizes, regardless of drop formation, can be safely neglected. The results obtained in this work highlight that the choice of a correct initial configuration is essential to accurately estimate the three-phase coexistence temperature of hydrates by direct coexistence simulations.</description>

      <title>Three-phase equilibria of hydrates from computer simulation. I. Finite-size effects in the methane hydrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clathrate hydrates are vital in energy research and environmental applications. Understanding their stability is crucial for harnessing their potential. In this work, we employ direct coexistence simulations to study finite-size effects in the determination of the three-phase equilibrium temperature ($T_3$) for methane hydrates. Two popular water models, TIP4P/Ice and TIP4P/2005, are employed, exploring various system sizes by varying the number of molecules in the hydrate, liquid, and gas phases. The results reveal that finite-size effects play a crucial role in determining $T_3$. The study includes nine configurations with varying system sizes, demonstrating that smaller systems, particularly those leading to stoichiometric conditions and bubble formation, may yield inaccurate $T_3$ values. The emergence of methane bubbles within the liquid phase, observed in smaller configurations, significantly influences the behavior of the system and can lead to erroneous temperature estimations. Our findings reveal finite size effects on the calculation of the $T_3$ by direct coexistence simulations and clarify the system size convergence for both models, shedding light on discrepancies found in the literature. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of the phase equilibrium of gas hydrates and offer valuable information for future research in this field.</description>

      <title>Intermittent Run Motility of Bacteria in Gels Exhibits Power-Law Distributed Dwell Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While bacterial swimming has been well characterized in uniform liquid environments, only little is known about how bacteria propagate through complex environments, such as gel-like matrices or porous media that are typically encountered in tissue or soil. Here, we study swimming motility of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida (P. putida) in polysaccharide matrices formed by different concentrations of agar. P. putida cells display intermittent run-motility in the gel, where run times are exponentially distributed and intermittently occurring dwell times follow a waiting-time distribution with a power-law decay. An analysis of the turn angle distribution suggests that both, flagella mediated turning as well as mechanical trapping in the agar matrix play a role in the overall swimming pattern. Based on the experimentally observed motility pattern and measured waiting-time distributions, we propose a minimal active particle model which correctly describes the observed time dependence of the mean square displacement of the bacterial swimmers.</description>

      <title>Simple and effective mechanical cloaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show theoretically that essentially perfect elastostatic mechanical cloaking of a circular inclusion in a homogeneous surrounding medium can be achieved by means of a simple cloak comprising three concentric annuli, each formed of a homogeneous isotropic linear elastic material of prescribed shear modulus. Importantly, we find that the same combination of annuli will cloak any possible mode of imposed deformation or loading, for any randomly chosen admixture of imposed compression, pure shear and simple shear, without the need to re-design the cloak for different deformation modes. A full range of circular inclusions can be cloaked in this way, from soft to stiff. In consequence, we suggest that an inclusion of any arbitrary shape can also be cloaked, by first enveloping it in a stiff circle, then cloaking the combined structure with three annuli as described. Given that a single inclusion can be fully cloaked in this way, even at near field close to the cloaking perimeter, it also follows that multiple such neutral inclusions arranged with arbitrarily high packing fraction in a surrounding medium can also be cloaked. We confirm this by direct simulation. This indicates a possible route to fabricating composite materials with the same global mechanical response as a counterpart homogeneous material, and with uniform strain and stress fields outwith the cloaked inclusions.</description>

      <title>Role of softness on transition temperatures for pNIPAM microgels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) microgels are renowned for their thermoresponsive behavior, exhibiting a distinct volume phase transition (VPT) upon temperature changes. This study investigates the influence of microgel softness, controlled by varying the crosslinking density during synthesis via free radical polymerization (FRP), on the difference between the volume phase transition temperature (VPTT) and the electrokinetic transition temperature (ETT). These transition temperatures mark the points at which the microgel size and surface charge, respectively, undergo significant alterations in response to temperature. Here, we investigate this phenomenon, employing dynamic light scattering (DLS) and electrophoretic light scattering (ELS) measurements to characterize the size and electrophoretic mobility response of pNIPAM microgels with different crosslinking densities as a function of temperature. By analyzing the observed trends in the difference between the transition temperatures, we aim to develop a hypothesis that provides a deeper physical understanding of the microgel structure and its relationship to transition temperatures. This investigation thus sheds light on the intricate interplay between microgel structure and its thermoresponsive behavior, offering insights for the design and optimization of pNIPAM microgels for future applications.</description>

      <title>Ultimately deformed double-network gels possess positive energetic elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elasticity of rubbery polymer networks has been considered to be entropy-driven. On the other hand, studies on single polymer chain mechanics have revealed that the elasticity of ultimately stretched polymer chains is dominated by the energetic contribution mainly originating from chemical bond deformation. Here, we experimentally found that the elasticity of the double-network gel transits from the entropy-dominated one to the internal energy-driven one with its uniaxial deformation through the thermodynamic analysis. Based on this finding, we developed a simple mechanical model that takes into account the energetic contribution and found that this model approximately reproduces the temperature dependence of the stress-strain curve of the double-network gel. This study demonstrates the importance of the chemical perspective in the mechanical analysis of highly deformed rubbery polymer networks.</description>

      <title>Minimal actuation and control of a soft hydrogel swimmer from flutter instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-organisms propel themselves in viscous environments by the periodic, nonreciprocal beating of slender appendages known as flagella. Active materials have been widely exploited to mimic this form of locomotion. However, the realization of such coordinated beating in biomimetic flagella requires complex actuation modulated in space and time. We prove through experiments on polyelectrolyte hydrogel samples that directed undulatory locomotion of a soft robotic swimmer can be achieved by untethered actuation from a uniform and static electric field. A minimal mathematical model is sufficient to reproduce, and thus explain, the observed behavior. The periodic beating of the swimming hydrogel robot emerges from flutter instability thanks to the interplay between its active and passive reconfigurations in the viscous environment. Interestingly, the flutter-driven soft robot exhibits a form of electrotaxis whereby its swimming trajectory can be controlled by simply reorienting the electric field. Our findings trace the route for the embodiment of mechanical intelligence in soft robotic systems by the exploitation of flutter instability to achieve complex functional responses to simple stimuli. While the experimental study is conducted on millimeter-scale hydrogel swimmers, the design principle we introduce requires simple geometry and is hence amenable for miniaturization via micro-fabrication techniques. We believe it may also be transferred to a wider class of soft active materials.</description>

      <title>MetaParticles: Computationally engineered nanomaterials with tunable and responsive properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In simulations, particles are traditionally treated as rigid platforms with variable sizes, shapes and interaction parameters. While this representation is applicable for rigid core platforms, particles consisting of soft platforms (e.g. micelles, polymers, elastomers, lipids) inevitably deform upon application of external stress. We introduce a generic model for flexible particles which we call MetaParticles (MP). These particles have tunable properties, can respond to applied tension and can deform. A metaparticle is represented as a collection of Lennard-Jones beads interconnected by spring-like potentials. We model a series of metaparticles of variable sizes and symmetries, which we subject to external stress followed by relaxation upon stress release. The positions and the orientations of the individual beads are propagated by Brownian dynamics. The simulations show that the mechanical properties of the metaparticles vary with size, bead arrangement and area of applied stress, and share an elastomer-like response to applied stress. Furthermore, metaparticles deform following different mechanisms, i.e., small MPs change shape in one step, while larger ones follow a multi-step deformation pathway, with internal rearrangements of the beads. This model is the first step towards the development and understanding of particles with adaptable properties with biomedical applications and in the design of bioinspired metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Effective Viscosity of a Suspension of Hot Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active particles with a temperature distribution, "hot particles", have a distinct effect on the fluid that surrounds them. The temperature gradients they create deem the fluid's viscosity spatially dependent, therefore violating the linearity of the problem, making a full description of velocity and pressure fields challenging. Using energy dissipation analysis and Lorentz Reciprocal Theorem, we show that it is still possible to study global properties of such hot suspensions. Namely, we calculate the effective viscosity of a dilute hot suspension, adding a correction that includes contributions from the bulk fluid and the particles themselves. As examples of this method, we derive the effective viscosity of a suspension of spherical particles with different heat distributions. We show that when the particles are non-Brownian and are all oriented in the same direction, the viscosity is no longer isotropic and depends on the direction of the shear relative to the orientation of the particles. If the particles' orientation is fixed due to an external field, the stress tensor is no longer symmetric, and the viscosity has odd components.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity in partial differential equations and critical phenomena: renormalization group theory for interfacial hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-similar dynamics, often described by partial differential equations (PDEs) without noise terms, have been widely observed in nature and have attracted considerable attention from researchers in various fields, including physics, fluid mechanics, applied mathematics, and chemical engineering. The concept of universality class and the renormalization group (RG) theory, emerged from critical phenomena, which also have been widely observed in nature, are pillars of modern physics, with guiding the recent development of physics. While self-similarity appearing in fluid dynamics reminds physicists of critical phenomena, deep connections between them have not been explored. Here, we focus on a variation of a daily phenomenon, a drop falling from a faucet, and demonstrate self-similar dynamics for the shape of liquid-air interface in confined space with a scaling law for a characteristic length scale, which leads to a clear correspondence between the present self-similar dynamics and critical phenomena by identifying critical exponents, which define a universality class. We not only show that the observed master curve describing the self-similar shape is a solution to the Navier-Stokes equations, but also develop a renormalization group (RG) theory for the governing PDE to show the fixed point of RG corresponds to the solution, which becomes stable with time due to a scaling crossover. Our results will impact on our understanding of critical, scaling, and singular behaviors widely observed in nature.</description>

      <title>Computational Self-Assembly of a Six-Fold Chiral Quasicrystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals are unique materials characterized by long-range order without periodicity. They are observed in systems such as metallic alloys, soft matter, and particle simulations. Unlike periodic crystals, which are invariant under real-space symmetry operations, quasicrystals possess symmetry described by a space group in reciprocal space. In this study, we report the self-assembly of a six-fold chiral quasicrystal using molecular dynamics simulations of a two-dimensional particle system. These particles interact via the Lennard-Jones-Gauss pair potential and are subjected to a periodic substrate potential. Our findings confirm the presence of chiral symmetry through diffraction patterns and order parameters, revealing unique local motifs in both real and reciprocal space. We demonstrate that the quasicrystal's properties, including the tiling structure and symmetry and the extent of diffuse scattering, are influenced by substrate potential depth and temperature. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of chiral quasicrystal formation and the role of external fields in tailoring quasicrystal structures.</description>

Abstract: A new microscopic derivation of the elastic constants of amorphous solids is presented within the framework of nonaffine lattice dynamics, which makes use of a perturbative form of the low-frequency eigenvectors of the dynamical matrix introduced in [V. Mazzacurati, G. Ruocco, M. Sampoli EPL 34, 681 (1996)]. The theory correctly recovers the shear modulus at jamming, $\mu \sim (z-2d)$, including prefactors in quantitative agreement with simulations. Furthermore, this framework allows us, for the first time, to include the effect of internal stresses. The theory shows that the Maxwell rigidity criterion $z=2d$ is violated with internal stress. In particular, $\mu \sim (z-2df)$ where $f&lt;1$ if the bonds are, on average, stretched, and the solid is thus rigid below the Maxwell isostatic limit, while $f&gt;1$ if the bonds are, on average, compressed. The coefficient $f$ is derived in analytical form and depends only on $d$ and on the average particle displacement from the interaction energy minimum.</description>

      <title>Broken Symmetries in Quasi-2D Charged Systems via Negative Dielectric Confinement</title>

Abstract: We report spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phenomena in symmetrically charged binary particle systems under planar nanoconfinement with negative dielectric constants.The SSB is triggered $solely$ via the dielectric confinement effect, without any external fields. The mechanism of SSB is found to be caused by the strong polarization field enhanced by nanoconfinement, giving rise to charge/field oscillations in the transverse directions. Interestingly, dielectric contrast can even determine the degree of SSB in transverse and longitudinal dimensions, forming charge-separated interfacial liquids and clusters on square lattices. Furthermore, we analytically show that the formed lattice constant is determined by the dielectric mismatch and the length scale of confinement, which is validated via molecular dynamics simulations. The novel broken symmetry mechanism may provide new insights in the study of quasi-2D systems and the design of future nanodevices.</description>

Abstract: Phase behaviors of two-dimensional (2D) systems constitute a fundamental topic in condensed matter and statistical physics. Although hard polygons and interactive point-like particles are well studied, the phase behaviors of more realistic molecular systems considering intermolecular interaction and molecular shape remain elusive. Here we investigate by molecular dynamics simulation thermal stabilities of 2D ball-stick polygons, serving as simplified models for molecular systems. Below the melting temperature $T_{m}$, we identify a critical edge number $n_{c}$, at which a waving superlattice structure emerges; when n &lt; $n_{c}$,the triangular system stabilizes at a spin-ice-like glassy state; when n &gt; $n_{c}$,the polygons stabilize at crystalline states, and $T_{m}$ is higher for polygons with more edges at higher pressures but exhibits a crossover for hexagon and octagon at low pressures. A theoretical framework taking into account the competition between entropy and enthalpy is proposed to provide a comprehensive understanding of our results, which is anticipated to facilitate the design of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Emergent dynamics due to chemo-hydrodynamic self-interactions in active polymers</title>

Abstract: The field of synthetic active matter has, thus far, been led by efforts to create point-like, isolated (yet interacting) self-propelled objects (\emph{e.g.} colloids, droplets, microrobots) and understanding their collective dynamics. The design of flexible, freely jointed active assemblies from autonomously powered components remains a challenge. Here, we report freely-jointed active polymers created using self-propelled droplets as monomeric units. Our experiments reveal that the self-shaping chemo-hydrodynamic interactions between the monomeric droplets give rise to an emergent rigidity (the acquisition of a stereotypical asymmetric C-shape) and associated ballistic propulsion of the active polymers. The rigidity and propulsion of the chains vary systematically with their lengths. Using simulations of a minimal model, we establish that the emergent polymer dynamics are a generic consequence of quasi two-dimensional confinement and auto-repulsive trail-mediated chemical interactions between the freely jointed active droplets. Finally, we tune the interplay between the chemical and hydrodynamic fields to experimentally demonstrate oscillatory dynamics of the rigid polymer propulsion. Altogether, our work highlights the possible first steps towards synthetic self-morphic active matter.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Debye scaling in the density of states of liquids under nanoconfinement</title>

Abstract: In the realm of nanoscience, the dynamic behaviors of liquids at scales beyond the conventional structural relaxation time, $\tau$, unfold a fascinating blend of solid-like characteristics, including the propagation of collective shear waves and the emergence of elasticity. However, in classical bulk liquids, where $\tau$ is typically of the order of 1 ps or less, this solid-like behavior remains elusive in the low-frequency region of the density of states (DOS). Here, we provide evidence for the emergent solid-like nature of liquids at short distances through inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the low-frequency DOS in liquid water and glycerol confined within graphene oxide membranes. In particular, upon increasing the strength of confinement, we observe a transition from a liquid-like DOS (linear in the frequency $\omega$) to a solid-like behavior (Debye law, $\sim\omega^2$) in the range of $1$-$4$ meV. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm these findings and reveal additional solid-like features, including propagating collective shear waves and a reduction in the self-diffusion constant. Finally, we show that the onset of solid-like dynamics is pushed towards low frequency along with the slowing-down of the relaxation processes upon confinement. This nanoconfinement-induced transition, aligning with k-gap theory, underscores the potential of leveraging liquid nanoconfinement in advancing nanoscale science and technology, building more connections between fluid dynamics and materials engineering.</description>

Abstract: Active matter systems - such as a collection of active colloidal particles - operate far from equilibrium with complex inter-particle interactions that govern their collective dynamics. Predicting the collective dynamics of such systems may aid the design of self-shaping structures comprised of active colloidal units with a prescribed dynamical function. Here, using simulations and theory, we study the collective dynamics of a chain consisting of active Brownian particles with internal interactions via trail-mediated chemicals, connected by harmonic springs in two dimensions to obtain design principles for active colloidal molecules. We show that two-dimensional confinement and chemo-repulsive interactions between the freely-jointed particles lead to an emergent rigidity of the chain in the steady-state dynamics. In the chemo-attractive regime, the chain collapses into crystals that abruptly halt their motion. Further, in a chain consisting of a binary mixture of monomers, we show that non-reciprocal chemical affinities between distinct species give rise to novel phenomena, such as chiral molecules with tunable dynamics, sustained undulatory gaits and reversal of the direction of motion. Our results suggest a novel interpretation of the role of trail-mediated interactions, in addition to providing active self-assembly principles arising due to non-reciprocal interactions.</description>

Abstract: We give a homotopy classification of the global defects in ordered media, and explain it via the example of biaxial nematic liquid crystals, i.e., systems where the order parameter space is the quotient of the $3$-sphere $S^3$ by the quaternion group $Q$. As our mathematical model we consider continuous maps from complements of spatial graphs to the space $S^3/Q$ modulo a certain equivalence relation, and find that the equivalence classes are enumerated by the six subgroups of $Q$. Through monodromy around meridional loops, the edges of our spatial graphs are marked by conjugacy classes of $Q$; once we pass to planar diagrams, these labels can be refined to elements of $Q$ associated to each arc. The same classification scheme applies not only in the case of $Q$ but also to arbitrary groups.</description>

Abstract: Odd viscosity is a property of chiral active fluids with broken time-reversal and parity symmetries. We show that the flow of such a fluid around a rotating axisymmetric body is exactly solvable and use this solution to determine the orientational dynamics of surface-driven microswimmers. Swimmers with a force-dipole moment exhibit precession around the axis of the odd viscosity. In addition, pushers show bimodal chirotaxis, i.e., alignment parallel or antiparallel to the axis, while pullers orbit in a plane perpendicular to it. A chiral swimmer that itself has a broken parity symmetry can exhibit unimodal chirotaxis and always align in the same direction.</description>

Abstract: Disordered hyperuniform structures are an exotic state of matter having suppressed density fluctuations at large length-scale similar to perfect crystals and quasicrystals but without any long range orientational order. In the past decade, an increasing number of non-equilibrium systems were found to have dynamic hyperuniform states, which have emerged as a new research direction coupling both non-equilibrium physics and hyperuniformity. Here we review the recent progress in understanding dynamic hyperuniform states found in various non-equilibrium systems, including the critical hyperuniformity in absorbing phase transitions, non-equilibrium hyperuniform fluids and the hyperuniform structures in phase separating systems via spinodal decomposition.</description>

Abstract: Polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes have ubiquitous applications as surface modifiers which regulate various structural and dynamic properties. Here, we apply a continuous-space self-consistent field theory to study the structural heterogeneity in PE brushes induced by competing electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. For brushes with high grafting densities, we find a series of microphase-segregated morphologies with alternating polymer-rich and polymer-poor layers in the direction normal to the substrate. The transitions between multi-layer morphologies with consecutive numbers of condensed layers as well as the melting transition to the fully swollen brush are all discontinuous. We also elucidate that the segregated layers are formed by different subpopulations of all chains, significantly different from the scenario of the pearl-necklace structure formed by a single PE in poor solvents. Furthermore, we bridge the microstructure of multi-layer brushes to experimentally measurable reflectivity spectra, where the oscillation period and amplitude in the spectra are shown to be very sensitive to the number of layers and the sharpness of the polymer-solvent interface. The multi-layer morphology predicted by our theory is in good agreement with the lamellae structure experimentally observed at hydrated Nafion film interfaces.</description>

Abstract: Linear mechanical systems with time-modulated parameters can harbor oscillations with amplitudes that grow or decay exponentially with time due to the phenomenon of parametric resonance. While the resonance properties of individual oscillators are well understood, those of systems of coupled oscillators remain challenging to characterize. Here, we determine the parametric resonance conditions for time-modulated mechanical systems by exploiting the internal symmetries arising from the real-valued and symplectic nature of classical mechanics. We also determine how these conditions are further constrained when the system exhibits external symmetries. In particular, we analyze systems with space-time symmetry where the system remains invariant after a combination of discrete translation in both space and time. For such systems, we identify a combined space-time translation operator that provides more information about the dynamics of the system than the Floquet operator does, and use it to derive conditions for one-way amplification of traveling waves. Our exact theoretical framework based on symmetries enables the design of exotic responses such as nonreciprocal transport and one-way amplification in dynamic mechanical metamaterials, and is generalizable to all physical systems that obey space-time symmetry.</description>

      <title>Change Point Detection of Events in Molecular Simulations using dupin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15090v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle tracking is commonly used to study time-dependent behavior in many different types of physical and chemical systems involving constituents that span many length scales, including atoms, molecules, nanoparticles, granular particles, etc. Behaviors of interest studied using particle tracking information include disorder-order transitions, thermodynamic phase transitions, structural transitions, protein folding, crystallization, gelation, swarming, avalanches and fracture. A common challenge in studies of these systems involves change detection. Change point detection discerns when a temporal signal undergoes a change in distribution. These changes can be local or global, instantaneous or prolonged, obvious or subtle. Moreover, system-wide changes marking an interesting physical or chemical phenomenon (e.g. crystallization) are often preceded by events (e.g. pre-nucleation clusters) that are localized and can occur anywhere at anytime in the system. For these reasons, detecting events in particle trajectories generated by molecular simulation is challenging and typically accomplished via ad hoc solutions unique to the behavior and system under study. Consequently, methods for event detection lack generality, and those used in one field are not easily used by scientists in other fields. Here we present a new Python-based tool, dupin, that allows for event detection from particle trajectory data irrespective of the system details. dupin works by creating a signal representing the simulation and partitioning the signal based on events (changes within the trajectory). This approach allows for studies where manual annotating of event boundaries would require a prohibitive amount of time. Furthermore, dupin can serve as a tool in automated and reproducible workflows. We demonstrate the application of dupin using two examples and discuss its applicability to a wider class of problems.</description>

Abstract: Biomolecular condensates help organize the cell cytoplasm and nucleoplasm into spatial compartments with different chemical compositions. A key feature of such compositional patterning is the local enrichment of enzymatically active biomolecules which, after transient binding via molecular interactions, catalyze reactions among their substrates. Thereby, biomolecular condensates provide a spatial template for non-uniform concentration profiles of substrates. In turn, the concentration profiles of substrates, and their molecular interactions with enzymes, drive enzyme fluxes which can enable novel non-equilibrium dynamics. To analyze this generic class of systems, with a current focus on self-propelled droplet motion, we here develop a self-consistent sharp interface theory. In our theory, we diverge from the usual bottom-up approach, which involves calculating the dynamics of concentration profiles based on a given chemical potential gradient. Instead, reminiscent of control theory, we take the reverse approach by deriving the chemical potential profile and enzyme fluxes required to maintain a desired condensate form and dynamics. The chemical potential profile and currents of enzymes come with a corresponding power dissipation rate, which allows us to derive a thermodynamic consistency criterion for the passive part of the system (here, reciprocal enzyme-enzyme interactions). As a first use case of our theory, we study the role of reciprocal interactions, where the transport of substrates due to reactions and diffusion is, in part, compensated by redistribution due to molecular interactions. More generally, our theory applies to mass-conserved active matter systems with moving phase boundaries.</description>

Abstract: Motility coupled to responsive behavior is essential for many microorganisms to seek and establish appropriate habitats. One of the simplest possible responses, reversing the direction of motion, is believed to enable filamentous cyanobacteria to form stable aggregates or accumulate in suitable light conditions. Here, we demonstrate that filamentous morphology in combination with responding to light gradients by reversals has consequences far beyond simple accumulation: Entangled aggregates form at the boundaries of illuminated regions, harnessing the boundary to establish local order. We explore how the light pattern, in particular its boundary curvature, impacts aggregation. A minimal mechanistic model of active flexible filaments resembles the experimental findings, thereby revealing the emergent and generic character of these structures. This phenomenon may enable elongated microorganisms to generate adaptive colony architectures in limited habitats, or guide the assembly of biomimetic fibrous materials.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the stochastic thermodynamics of micro-magnetic systems. We first formulate the stochastic dynamics of micro-magnetic systems by incorporating noises into Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation, which describes the irreversible and deterministic dynamics of magnetic moments. The resulting stochastic Landau-Lifshitz (sLL) equation obeys detailed balance, which guarantees that, with the external field fixed, the system converges to thermodynamic equilibrium with vanishing entropy production and with non-vanishing probability current. We then discuss various thermodynamic variables both at the trajectory level and at the ensemble level, and further establish both the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. Finally, we establish fluctuation theorems, and verify them using numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the stochastic dynamics of micro-magnetics interacting with a spin-current torque. We extend the previously constructed stochastic Landau-Lifshitz equation to the case with spin-current torque, and verify the conditions of detailed balance. Then we construct various thermodynamics quantities such as work and heat, and prove the second law of thermodynamics. Due to the existence of spin-torque and the asymmetry of the kinetic matrix, a novel effect of entropy pumping shows up. As a consequence, the system may behave as a heat engine which constantly transforms heat into magnetic work. Finally, we derive a fluctuation theorem for the joint probability density function of the pumped entropy and the total work, and verify it using numerical simulations.</description>
