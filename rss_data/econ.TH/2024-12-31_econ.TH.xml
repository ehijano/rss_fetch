      <title>Incentive-Compatible Collusion-Resistance via Posted Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a refinement to the notions of collusion-resistance in transaction fee mechanisms. In particular, we require that the collusion is by itself incentive-compatible and individually rational to all of its participants. We then study the structural properties of these notions, and importantly, characterize the class of collusion-resistant and incentive-compatible transaction fee mechanisms in the single bidder case, and show that this is exactly the class of posted-price where the price is not too prohibitive. We analyze welfare and revenue implications, as well as the shape of the solution space, for both regular and non-regular distributions.</description>

      <title>Intensinist Social Welfare and Ordinal Intensity-Efficient Allocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.04306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study social welfare and allocation efficiency in situations where, in addition to having ordinal preferences, agents also have `ordinal intensities': they can make comparisons such as `I prefer a to b more than I prefer c to d' without necessarily being able to quantify them. In this new informational environment for social choice we first introduce a rank-based criterion for interpersonal comparisons of such ordinal intensities. Building on it, we introduce the `intensinist' social welfare function. This maps intensity profiles to weak orders over social alternatives using a scoring criterion that generalizes the one in the classic Borda method in a way that allows for differences in agents' intensities to be reflected in preference aggregation more accurately and in a much richer class of situations. Building on the same comparability postulate we also study the classic assignment problem by defining an allocation to be `intensity-efficient' if it is Pareto efficient with respect to the preferences induced by the agents' intensities and also such that, when another allocation assigns the same pairs of items to the same pairs of agents but in a `flipped' way, the former allocation assigns the commonly preferred item in every such pair to the agent who prefers it more. We present some first results on the (non-)existence of such allocations without imposing restrictions on preferences or intensities other than strictness, and also study the relation -- or lack thereof -- between intensity-efficient and classical utilitarian allocations.</description>

      <title>Recursive Preferences, Correlation Aversion, and the Temporal Resolution of Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel behavioral feature of recursive preferences: aversion to risks that persist over time, or simply correlation aversion. Greater persistence provides information about future consumption but reduces opportunities to hedge consumption risk. I show that, for recursive preferences, correlation aversion is equivalent to increasing relative risk aversion. To quantify correlation aversion, I develop the concept of the persistence premium, which measures how much an individual is willing to pay to eliminate persistence in consumption. I provide an approximation of the persistence premium in the spirit of Arrow-Pratt, which provides a quantitative representation of the trade-off between information and hedging. I present several applications. The persistence premium helps create more realistic calibrations for macro-finance models. In an optimal taxation model, I show that recursive preferences unlike standard preferences-lead to more progressive taxation when human capital persistence is greater. Finally, I show that correlation-averse preferences have a variational representation, linking correlation aversion to concerns about model misspecification</description>

      <title>Informational Puts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze how dynamic information should be provided to uniquely implement the largest equilibrium in binary-action coordination games. The designer offers an informational put: she stays silent if players choose her preferred action, but injects asymmetric and inconclusive public information if they lose faith. There is (i) no multiplicity gap: the largest (partially) implementable equilibrium can be implemented uniquely; and (ii) no commitment gap: the policy is sequentially optimal. Our results have sharp implications for the design of policy in coordination environments.</description>

      <title>Competition, Persuasion, and Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An agent engages in sequential search. He does not directly observe the quality of the goods he samples, but he can purchase signals designed by profit maximizing principal(s). We formulate the principal-agent relationship as a repeated contracting problem within a stopping game and characterize the set of equilibrium payoffs. We show that when the agent's search cost falls below a given threshold, competition does not impact how much surplus is generated in equilibrium nor how the surplus is divided. In contrast, competition benefits the agent at the expense of total surplus when the search cost exceeds that threshold. Our results challenge the view that monopoly decreases market efficiency, and moreover, suggest that it generates the highest value of information for the agent.</description>

      <title>The reference interval in higher-order stochastic dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two random variables taking values in a bounded interval, we study whether one dominates the other in higher-order stochastic dominance depends on the reference interval in the model setting. We obtain two results. First, the stochastic dominance relations get strictly stronger when the reference interval shrinks if and only if the order of stochastic dominance is larger than three. Second, for mean-preserving stochastic dominance relations, the reference interval is irrelevant if and only if the difference between the degree of the stochastic dominance and the number of moments is no larger than three. These results highlight complications arising from using higher-order stochastic dominance in economic applications.</description>
