      <title>Monitoring the daily variation of Sun-Earth magnetic fields using galactic cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) between the Sun and Earth is an extension of the solar magnetic field carried by the solar wind into interplanetary space. Monitoring variations in the IMF upstream of the Earth would provide very important information for the prediction of space weather effects, such as effects of solar storms and the solar wind, on human activity. In this study, the IMF between the Sun and Earth was measured daily for the first time using a cosmic-ray observatory. Cosmic rays mainly consist of charged particles that are deflected as they pass through a magnetic field.Therefore, the cosmic-ray Sun shadow, caused by high-energy charged cosmic rays blocked by the Sun and deflected by the magnetic field, can be used to explore the transverse IMF between the Sun and Earth. By employing the powerful kilometer-square array at the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory, the cosmic-ray Sun shadows were observed daily with high significance for the first time. The displacement of the Sun shadow measured in 2021 correlates well with the transverse IMF component measured in situ by spacecraft near the Earth, with a time lag of 3:31 $\pm$ 0:12 days. The displacement of the Sun shadow was also simulated using Parker's classic IMF model, yielding a time lag of 2:06 $\pm$ 0:04 days. This deviation may provide valuable insights into the magnetic field structure, which can improve space weather research.</description>

      <title>On the Low-Latitude Ionospheric Irregularities under Geomagnetically Active and Quiet Conditions using NavIC observables: A Spectral Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionospheric irregularities and associated scintillations under geomagnetically active/quiet conditions have detrimental effects on the reliability and performance of space- and ground-based navigation satellite systems, especially over the low-latitude region. The current work investigates the low-latitude ionospheric irregularities using the phase screen theory and the corresponding temporal Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis to present an estimate of the outer irregularity scale sizes over these locations. The study uses simultaneous L5 signal C/N$_o$ observations of NavIC (a set of GEO and GSO navigation satellite systems) near the northern crest of EIA (Indore: 22.52$^\circ$N, 75.92$^\circ$E, dip: 32.23$^\circ$N) and in between the crest and the dip equator (Hyderabad: 17.42$^\circ$N, 78.55$^\circ$E, dip: 21.69$^\circ$N). The study period (2017-2018) covers disturbed and quiet-time conditions in the declining phase of the solar cycle 24. The PSD analysis brings forward the presence of irregularities, of the order of a few hundred meters during weak-to-moderate and quiet-time conditions and up to a few km during the strong event, over both locations. The ROTI values validate the presence of such structures in the Indian region. Furthermore, only for the strong event, a time delay of scintillation occurrence over Indore, with values of 36 minutes and 50 minutes for NavIC satellites (PRNs) 5 and 6, respectively, from scintillation occurrence at Hyderabad is observed, suggesting a poleward evolution of irregularity structures. Further observations show a westward propagation of these structures on this day. This study brings forward the advantage of utilizing continuous data from the GEO and GSO satellite systems in understanding the evolution and propagation of the ionospheric irregularities over the low-latitude region.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI Observations of Newly Formed Dust in the Cold, Dense Shell of the Type IIn SN 2005ip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), specifically Type IIP SNe, has been suggested to be a significant source of the dust observed in high-redshift galaxies. CCSNe eject large amounts of newly formed heavy elements, which can condense into dust grains in the cooling ejecta. However, infrared (IR) observations of typical CCSNe generally measure dust masses that are too small to account for the dust production needed at high redshifts. Type IIn SNe, classified by their dense circumstellar medium (CSM), are also known to exhibit strong IR emission from warm dust, but the dust origin and heating mechanism have generally remained unconstrained because of limited observational capabilities in the mid-IR. Here, we present a JWST/MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) spectrum of the Type IIn SN 2005ip nearly 17 years post-explosion. The Type IIn SN 2005ip is one of the longest-lasting and most well-studied SNe observed to date. Combined with a Spitzer mid-IR spectrum of SN 2005ip obtained in 2008, this data set provides a rare 15-year baseline, allowing for a unique investigation of the evolution of dust. The JWST spectrum shows a new high-mass dust component ($\gtrsim0.08$ M$_{\odot}$) that is not present in the earlier Spitzer spectrum. Our analysis shows dust likely formed over the past 15 years in the cold, dense shell (CDS), between the forward and reverse shocks. There is also a smaller mass of carbonaceous dust ($\gtrsim0.005$ M$_{\odot}$) in the ejecta. These observations provide new insights into the role of SN dust production, particularly within the CDS, and its potential contribution to the rapid dust enrichment of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>A Study on the Nested Rings CME Structure Observed by the WISPR Imager Onboard Parker Solar Probe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the significance of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in space weather, a comprehensive understanding of their interior morphology remains a scientific challenge, particularly with the advent of many state-of-the-art solar missions such as Parker Solar Probe (Parker) and Solar Orbiter (SO). In this study, we present an analysis of a complex CME as observed by the Wide-Field Imager for Solar PRobe (WISPR) heliospheric imager during Parker's seventh solar encounter. The CME morphology does not fully conform with the general three-part density structure, exhibiting a front and core not significantly bright, with a highly structured overall configuration. In particular, its morphology reveals non-concentric nested rings, which we argue are a signature of the embedded helical magnetic flux rope (MFR) of the CME. For that, we analyze the morphological and kinematical properties of the nested density structures and demonstrate that they outline the projection of the three-dimensional structure of the flux rope as it crosses the lines of sight of the WISPR imager, thereby revealing the magnetic field geometry. Comparison of observations from various viewpoints suggests that the CME substructures can be discerned owing to the ideal viewing perspective, close proximity, and spatial resolution of the observing instrument.</description>

      <title>Solar Plasma Noise in TianQin Laser Propagation: An Extreme Case and Statistical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TianQin proposes to detect gravitational wave signals by using laser interferometry. However, laser propagation effect introduces a potential noise factor for TianQin. In this work, we used MHD simulations to obtain the space magnetic field and plasma distributions during an extremely strong solar eruption, and based on the magnetohydrodynamic simulation result, we investigate laser propagation noise for TianQin. For the extremely strong solar eruption event, we find that the laser propagation noise closely approaches 100\% of TianQin's displacement noise requirement for Michelson combination; While the laser propagation noise is still about 30\% of TianQin's displacement noise requirement for time-delay interferometry X combination. In addition, we investigate the laser propagation noise for 12 cases with different solar wind conditions. Our finding reveals a linear correlation between the laser propagation noise and several space weather parameters, e.g., solar wind dynamic pressure, Sym-H, and $D$st, where the correlation coefficients for solar wind dynamic pressure is strongest. Combining the cumulative distribution of solar wind dynamic pressure from 1999 to 2021 with the linear correlation between solar wind dynamic pressure and laser propagation noise, we have determined that the occurrence rate of the laser propagation noise to be greater than 30\% of TianQin's displacement noise requirement for Michelson combination over the entire solar activity week is about 15\%. In addition, we find that time-delay interferometry can suppress the laser propagation noise, and reduce the occurrence rate of the laser propagation noise exceeding 30\% of TianQin's requirement to less than 1\%.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Sparse Galaxy Simulations via Out-of-Distribution Detection and Amortized Bayesian Model Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations are a powerful tool to advance our understanding of galaxy formation and many simulations model key properties of real galaxies. A question that naturally arises for such simulations in light of high-quality observational data is: How close are the models to reality? Due to the high-dimensionality of the problem, many previous studies evaluate galaxy simulations using simplified summary statistics of physical properties. In this work, we combine simulation-based Bayesian model comparison with a novel misspecification detection technique to compare simulated galaxy images of 6 hydrodynamical models observations. Since cosmological simulations are computationally costly, we address the problem of low simulation budgets by first training a $k$-sparse variational autoencoder (VAE) on the abundant dataset of SDSS images. The VAE learns to extract informative latent embeddings and delineates the typical set of real images. To reveal simulation gaps, we then perform out-of-distribution detection (OOD) based on the logits of classifiers trained on the embeddings of simulated images. Finally, we perform amortized Bayesian model comparison using probabilistic classification, identifying the relatively best-performing model along with partial explanations through SHAP values.</description>

      <title>A New Monte-Carlo Model for the Space Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Monte Carlo (MC) method to simulate the evolution of the low-earth orbit environment, enhancing the MIT Orbital Capacity Analysis Tool (MOCAT). In recent decades, numerous space environment models have been developed by government agencies and research groups to understand and predict the dynamics of space debris. Our MC approach advances this by simulating the trajectories of space objects and modeling their interactions, such as collisions and explosions. This aids in analyzing the trends of space-object and debris populations. A key innovation of our method is the computational efficiency in orbit propagation, which is crucial for handling potentially large numbers of objects over centuries. We present validation results against the IADC (Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee) study and explore various scenarios, including ones without future launches and those involving the launch of proposed megaconstellations with over 80,000 active payloads. With the improvement in computational efficiencies provided by this work, we can run these new scenarios that predict millions of trackable objects over a 200-year period. The previous state-of-the-art was 400,000 objects over the same period of time. Notably, while fewer megaconstellations are planned for altitudes above 800 km, even minimal failures in post-mission disposal or collision avoidance maneuvers can significantly impact orbital debris accumulation.</description>
