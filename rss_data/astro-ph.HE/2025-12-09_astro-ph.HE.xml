      <title>Revealing the accelerating wind in the inner region of the colliding-wind binary WR 112</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colliding winds in massive binaries generate X-ray-bright shocks, synchrotron radio emission, and sometimes even dusty "pinwheel" spirals. We report the first X-ray detections of the dusty WC+O binary system WR 112 from Chandra and Swift, alongside 27 years of VLA/ATCA radio monitoring and new diffraction-limited Keck images. Because we view the nearly circular orbit almost edge-on, the colliding-wind zone alternates between heavy Wolf-Rayet wind self-absorption and a near-transparent O-star wind foreground each 20-yr orbit, producing phase-locked radio and X-ray variability. This scenario leads to a prediction that the radio spectral index is flatter from a larger non-thermal contribution around the radio intensity maximum, which is indeed observed. Existing models that assume a single dust-expansion speed fail to reproduce the combined infrared geometry and radio light curve. Instead, we require an accelerating post-shock flow that climbs from near-stationary to ~1350 km/s in about one orbital cycle, naturally matching the infrared spiral from about 5" down to within 0.1", while also fitting the phase of the radio brightening. These kinematic constraints supply critical boundary conditions for future hydrodynamic simulations, which can link hot-plasma cooling, non-thermal radio emission, X-ray spectra, and dust formation in a self-consistent framework. WR 112 thus joins WR 140, WR 104, and WR 70-16 (Apep) as a benchmark system for testing colliding-wind physics under an increasingly diverse range of orbital architectures and physical conditions.</description>

      <title>A Song of Lines and Winds: Tracing the Signatures of AGN Outflows in X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) are highly ionized, mildly relativistic winds seen in the X-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and are thought to contribute to AGN feedback and galaxy evolution. We investigate UFO signatures by analyzing a broad collection of published detections. Our final sample comprises 122 robust (&gt; 2$\sigma$) UFO detections in 57 AGN, spanning wide ranges in redshift, luminosity, black hole mass, and Eddington ratio. By combining phenomenological and photoionization modeling of the absorption features, we characterize empirical correlations among UFO properties. We find that line width, equivalent width, and outflow velocity are positively correlated, indicating that the broadest and strongest absorption lines trace the fastest winds, although the $\upsilon_\mathrm{out} - \sigma$ trend is comparatively weak. The large inferred velocity dispersions, often exceeding the uncertainty on the centroid velocity, must be included when estimating wind energetics and scaling relations. From the velocity constraints we derive lower limits on the launching radii, finding a minimum distance consistent with the innermost stable circular orbit of a weakly or non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole. We also assess for the first time how UFO properties depend on AGN class: differences between Seyferts and quasars, bridged by narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, appear to be driven mainly by black hole mass and luminosity. The observed co-variation of velocity, width, and equivalent width supports a picture of clumpy, multi-component winds propagating through a thermally unstable multiphase medium within the chaotic cold accretion (CCA) cycle, and is consistent with both magnetically and line-driven acceleration. High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with missions such as XRISM and NewAthena will be crucial to resolve the structure, kinematics, and physical origin of these flows.</description>

      <title>Revealing Hidden Repeaters in the CHIME/FRB Catalog: Semi-Supervised Insights into the Fast Radio Burst Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic transients, observationally classified as repeaters or nonrepeaters. This classification may be biased, as some apparently non-repeating sources could simply have undetected subsequent bursts. To address this, we develop a semi-supervised learning framework to identify distinguishing features of repeaters using primary observational parameters from the Blinkverse database, which draws from the CHIME/FRB Catalogs. The framework combines labeled data (known repeaters and confidently classified non-repeaters) with unlabeled sources previously flagged as non-repeaters but exhibiting repeater-like characteristics. We employ uniform manifold approximation and projection with a nearest-neighbor scheme to select potential candidates, followed by semi-supervised classification using five base estimators, including random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression, AdaBoost, and Gradient boost. Each model is fine-tuned through cross-validation, and a voting strategy among the five models is employed to enhance robustness. All models achieve consistently high performance, identifying dispersion measure, peak frequency, and fluence as the most discriminative features. Repeaters tend to show lower dispersion measures, higher peak frequencies, and higher fluences than non-repeaters. We also identify a set of candidate repeaters, several of which are consistent with prior independent studies. Our approach can identify 36 additional repeater candidates that conventional methods may have missed. Finally, the results highlight dispersion measure as a key discriminator between repeaters and non-repeaters, revealing a tension between physical and instrumental origins-either environmental effects, if the two populations arise from distinct progenitors, or detection bias, as nearby sources are more easily observed.</description>

      <title>Rebrightenings of gamma-ray burst afterglows from an increasing magnetic inclination angle of a nascent magnetar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nascent magnetar, accompanying a gamma-ray burst (GRB) explosion, releases enormous rotational energy via magnetic dipole radiation. The energy loss rate of the magnetar is determined by the strength of the magnetic field at the pole. We investigated the effect of the magnetic inclination angle on the energy loss rate. The released energy is injected into the GRB jet and shapes the light curves of GRB afterglow. Different evolutionary approaches lead to different curves shapes.A shallow decay phase in GRB X-ray afterglow may result from energy injection from a magnetar with a fixed inclination angle. A two-plateau phase may result from a decreasing inclination angle scenario. In this study, we considered an increasing inclination angle scenario. The energy loss rate of the magnetar increases as the magnetic inclination angle grows. Our analysis reveals that as the lost rotational energy injected into the GRB jet increases, rebrightening phases occur in the GRB afterglows. The rebrightening features are slight and short-lived. The observed afterglow rebrightening of GRB 170822A and GRB 230414B can be well explained within our framework. Some GRB X-ray afterglows that exhibit slight and early rebrightenings may result from an increasing magnetic inclination angle of a nascent magnetar.</description>

      <title>Optical Study of TRAPUM Pulsars and Modelling of the Redbacks: PSR J1036$-$4353 and PSR J1803$-$6707</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transients and Pulsars with MeerKAT (TRAPUM) project discovered eight binary millisecond pulsars in its first shallow \textit{L}-band survey of unidentified \textit{Fermi} $\gamma$-ray sources using the MeerKAT radio telescope. We conducted follow-up observations using ULTRACAM on the New Technology Telescope at the La Silla Observatory to search for the optical counterpart to the pulsar companions. We found two redback companions, in PSRs J1803$-$6707 and J1036$-$4353, and provided upper limits for the other pulsar binaries. We used the \texttt{Icarus} code to fit the redback's light curves using various irradiation models. The asymmetric double-peak light curves of PSR~J1036$-$4353 are best fit with diffusion and convection models. Comparing the two prescriptions of irradiation and gravity darkening, models with post-irradiation gravity darkening provide superior fits (particularly for lower gravity-darkening exponents), suggesting that the irradiation energy is deposited deep in the stellar photosphere. PSR~J1803$-$6707, on the other hand, displayed variability in the amplitude of its irradiation-dominated light curves over a time scale of a few months. This effect can be modelled only if the companion's filling, irradiation temperature, and convection coefficients are allowed to vary over time. Had the star been closer to filling its Roche lobe, like in the cases of the known transitional millisecond pulsars J1023+0038 and J1227$-$4853, this 4.1 per~cent variation in the volume-averaged filling of the star would have caused it to experience a state change to form an active accretion disc.</description>

      <title>Fast X-ray Variability from the Coronae of Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first systematic study of short-timescale X-ray variability in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGN), utilizing archival Chandra observations of approximately 3,000 broad-line AGN selected from the SDSS and DESI spectroscopic surveys. We identify 14 AGN exhibiting rapid (on timescales of tens of kiloseconds) X-ray flux variations by factors of two or more that are statistically significant ($p\le6\times10^{-4}$), indicative of fast coronal variability. By converting minimum variability timescales to light-crossing times, we place upper limits on the sizes of the variable coronal regions, finding typical scales of $\lesssim10^{-4}$~pc. The coronal variable region size upper limits of an AGN in our sample are found to be much smaller than the typical coronal sizes inferred from microlensing, suggesting that its corona is composed of localized, transient structures rather than smooth, homogeneous plasmas. Such efficient magnetic energy dissipation in compact volumes is consistent with expectations for magnetically dominated coronae and is supported by recent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Future high-throughput X-ray observatories will enable the detection of even faster coronal variability, providing direct constraints on the physical mechanisms driving plasma energization and flux fluctuation near supermassive black holes. Our results suggest that luminous AGN hosting massive black holes are prime targets for probing the small-scale structure and dynamics of AGN coronae.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal Synchrotron Emission and Polarization Signatures during Black Hole Flux Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate synchrotron emission and the observational signatures of anisotropic non-thermal electrons during magnetic-flux eruptions in a magnetically arrested disk, using 3D GRMHD simulations. Non-thermal electrons are assumed to be energized from the thermal background through magnetic reconnection, with pitch-angle distributions modeled as beamed or loss-cone types, alongside an isotropic case for comparison. The results show that non-thermal emission can produce pronounced flux outbursts and localized brightening during eruptions, while the associated increase in optical depth can suppress the linear polarization fraction. Introducing pitch-angle anisotropy further reshapes the angular distribution of the intrinsic emissivity and modulates its contribution to various observable signatures. Our results demonstrate that anisotropic non-thermal electrons are essential for a physically complete interpretation of black hole image variability.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Diffusion Modeling of Cosmic-Ray Lepton Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze DAMPE and H.E.S.S. measurements of the total cosmic-ray electron-positron spectrum, together with the AMS-02 positron fraction, using an anisotropic, spatially varying diffusion framework. The diffusion-tensor components are computed via numerical integration of test-particle trajectories in a prescribed Galactic magnetic-field model. We show that accounting simultaneously for the spatial dependence and anisotropy of the diffusion tensor yields an accurate description of the local electron and positron data up to TeV energies. The inferred injection spectral index, $\Gamma=-2.169$, is fully consistent with expectations from diffusive shock-acceleration theory. Within this framework, the observed spectral softening arises naturally from enhanced energy losses experienced by leptons propagating over larger distances along the regular magnetic field.</description>

      <title>SS433 PeV neutron jet feeding the far TeV gamma beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SS433 is a well-known binary system with an internal black hole, which is stripping mass from an orbiting companion of ten solar masses, at a hundred of light-seconds away. The black hole and its accretion disk fuel a thin precessing jet, whose spirals are well-observed. Surprisingly, disconnected gamma-ray tails have recently been discovered by H.E.S.S., HAWC and LHAASO, hundreds of light-years away and with energies of tens of TeV. We suggest that tens PeV neutron burst jets were ejected from the SS433 system over the past century. These beams of ultra high-energy PeVatron neutrons, by their in-flight beta decay and Inverse Compton scattering, could be the source of the enigmatic, distant and disconnected tens of TeV gamma-ray beams. These ultra-relativistic PeV neutron jets could have been formed during one of the system's rare and intense tidal eruptions, when tens of PeV protons collide CV October 2025 with thermal ultraviolet photons, creating delta resonances. Their decay into secondary neutron beams of tens of PeV is well consistent with observations. Alternative models appear uncompetitive.</description>

      <title>Paucity of downward UHE neutrino tracks in IceCube versus unexpected huge KM3-230213A event: solving the puzzles?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently the ARCA array detector published the down-ward-horizontal event: the KM3-230213A. It appeared as the most energetic neutrino ever observed: about 200 PeV (2 10^17 eV) up to EeV (10^18 eV) energy. This huge value, is puzzling. It is not statistically consistent with several upper bound derived by two greater and longer life detectors: by IceCube and in particular by AUGER array. Asymmetry in recent IceCube neutrino alert tracks upward and downward at same horizontal angles as ARCA one, suggest that they are mostly polluted atmospheric muon bundles. This paucity also disfavor the skimming neutrino interpretation by ARCA. We suggest that the array floating and bending in the deep sea may lead, sometime, to a misleading geometry that is pointing to a wrong arrival angle direction: a much less horizontal muon (neutrino) track respect to a much real one, more inclined and vertical, due to atmospheric muon bundle or charmed single event. Contrary to present argument, if such a rare event would be soon rediscovered in data or re-observed, it would open the road to a new guaranteed Tau neutrino Astronomy. At EeV energy such upward tau air-showers should shine AUGER telescopes or blaze future satellite in Space. A previous model in astrophysics considered energetic neutrino E&gt;&gt;100 EeV, neutrino scattering, onto cosmic, relic, light mass ones. Their ultra-relativistic Z boson resonance formation and its decay in flight would produce hadron UHECR relics around tens-hundred EeV energy. Explaining how sources located at far distances, above the usual GZK hundred Mpc, cut off ones, may shine and cluster in AUGER or TA data.</description>

      <title>Trends in gravitational wave emission in axisymmetric simulations of rotating core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantitative impact of strong rotation on the amplitudes and frequencies of the post-bounce gravitational wave (GW) signal from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is still not fully understood. To study trends in frequencies and amplitudes, and possibly spectacular phenomena like resonant amplification, we perform a series of axisymmetric long-duration magnetohydrodynamic CCSN simulations of a 17 $M_\odot$ progenitor using a finely spaced grid in initial rotation rate from 0.29 rad/s to 3.48 rad/s. We find that these rotating models produce GWs at frequencies of up to 3 kHz, higher than in typical non-rotating models in the literature. The high frequencies arise due to small polar radii of rapidly rotating proto-neutron stars and stabilization by angular momentum gradients at lower latitude. GW frequencies and amplitudes tend to decrease with faster rotation. Different from two complementary simulations without magnetic fields, the magnetohydrodynamic models are characterized by an absence of p-modes above the dominant high-frequency emission band. We find no indication of resonant mode amplification for any rotation rate, although a temporo-spatial and space-frequency analysis reveals some interesting couplings of quadrupolar motions across the proto-neutron star and the gain region. We find that linear mode analysis based on the spherically averaged structure becomes unsuitable in this regime of rapid rotation. More advanced perturbative techniques need to be developed to study the mode structure and mode interaction in the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars.</description>

      <title>Universal relation involving fundamental modes in two-fluid dark matter admixed neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the fundamental oscillation frequencies of dark matter admixed neutron stars, focusing on models with self-interacting fermionic dark matter that couples to normal matter solely through gravity. The analysis is carried out within a two-fluid formalism under the relativistic Cowling approximation, where the perturbation equations follow from the linearized energy-momentum conservation laws of both components. We find that the mass-scaled fundamental frequencies of the nuclear (dark) fluid in dark core (halo) configurations exhibit a remarkably tight correlation with the total stellar compactness. This universality persists across the dark matter parameter space explored in this study and is largely insensitive to the choice of nuclear equation of state. In contrast, we also find the breakdown of such universality with the tidal deformability, i.e, the same frequencies show substantial deviations from universality when expressed in terms of the tidal deformability. These contrasting behaviors highlight possible observational imprints of dark matter in neutron star interiors.</description>

      <title>Evidence of young magnetars in massive binary embedded in a supernova remnant as sources of active fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are intense pulses with unknown origins. A subclass of repeating FRBs show some common features, such as associated compact persistent radio sources (PRSs), high burst rates, and large host-galaxy dispersion measures (DMs). Meanwhile, they show diverse DM and rotation measure (RM) variations, which cannot be explained by current models. A unified model urgently needs to be established. Here we show the first evidence for a supernova remnant surrounding the FRB 20190520B source. We then demonstrate that the five active repeating FRB sources associated with PRSs can be understood within a single model in which central objects are young magnetars in massive binary systems embedded in supernova remnants. This model naturally predicts distinct variations of DM and RM for repeating FRBs. Crucially, young magnetar wind nebulae can generate bright PRSs. As a magnetar becomes older, the luminosity of a PRS will fade, which can naturally explain less-luminous PRSs for some active FRBs. Our results support a unified population of active FRBs in dynamic magnetized environments.</description>

      <title>Simulation Study of Binary Mergers of Galaxy Clusters I: Properties of Merger Shocks and Radio Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate binary mergers of galaxy clusters and the resulting radio relics using three-dimensional simulations. The initial setup consists of two idealized, spherical subclusters with a mass ratio below three, each permeated by turbulent magnetic fields, and we follow their mergers with a high-order accurate magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code. In parallel, we track the acceleration of cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) at merger-driven shocks, together with radiative cooling and Fermi-II (turbulent) acceleration in the postshock region, employing a high-order Fokker-Planck solver. Synchrotron emission is computed from the simulated CRe distribution and magnetic fields. In this paper, we detail these numerical approaches and present the first results obtained with them. Two prominent axial shocks emerge along the merger axis; the shock ahead of the heavier subcluster systematically attains a higher Mach number, although it is more compact, than that ahead of the lighter subcluster. Turbulent magnetic fields--both inherited from the initial condition and amplified during the merger--produce patchy, fine-scale structures in the radio surface brightness. Because of the combined effects of turbulent acceleration, spatially nonuniform magnetic fields, and the curved geometry of merger shocks, the volume-integrated radio spectra show deviations from the canonical power-law steepening expected for a planar shock with a uniform field. Reacceleration of preexisting fossil CRe enhances the surface brightness. Our results highlight the coupled roles of merger dynamics, MHD turbulence, and CRe physics in shaping up the observed properties of radio relics in cluster outskirts.</description>

      <title>EP241217a: a likely Type II GRB with an achromatic bump at z = 4.59</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EP241217a is an X-ray transient detected by the Einstein Probe (EP) lasting for about 100 seconds and without accompanying $\gamma$-ray detection. The optical spectroscopy reveals the redshift of EP241217a is 4.59. By combining the $\gamma$-ray upper limit provided by GECAM-C, there is a considerable possibility that EP241217a is a typical Type II gamma-ray burst (GRB), but it is fainter than the detection threshold of any available $\gamma$-ray monitors (i.e., $E_{\gamma,{\rm iso}}\lesssim10^{53}$ erg). The X-ray light curve exhibits a plateau lasting for $\sim5\times10^4$ seconds. However, the joint analysis with optical data suggests the presence of an achromatic bump peaking at $\sim3\times10^4$ s after the trigger, indicating the actual duration of the X-ray plateau may be significantly shorter than it appears. To interpret the achromatic bump, we adopt the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in a wind-like medium and encountering a rapid density enhancement of the circumburst medium, which is likely induced by the the interaction of the progenitor's stellar wind and the interstellar medium. However, this model cannot fully explain observed data, and some issues do exist, e.g., the observed spectrum is harder than the model prediction. Consequently, we conclude that the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in the wind-like medium cannot explain all observed features of EP241217a. In addition, some alternative models commonly invoked to explain X-ray plateaus are discussed, but there are more or less issues when they are applied to EP241217a. Therefore, further theoretical modeling is encouraged to explore the origin of EP241217a.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Escaping Cosmic Rays and Interstellar Medium: Driving of Galactic Winds and Shaping the Local Proton Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of escaping cosmic rays (CRs) on the interstellar medium (ISM) around their source with spherically symmetric CR-hydrodynamical simulations taking into account the evolution of the CR energy spectrum, radiative cooling, and thermal conduction. We show how the escaping CRs accelerate and heat the ISM fluid depending on the CR diffusion coefficient. The CR heating effects are potentially responsible for the recent observations of the unexpected H$\alpha$ and [OIII]$\lambda$5007 lines in old supernova remnants. The implied gas outflow by CRs can be comparable to the Galactic star formation rate, compatible with the Galactic wind required for the metal-polluted halo gas and the production of eROSITA bubbles. Assuming a locally suppressed CR diffusion and a few nearby CR sources in the Local Bubble, we also propose alternative interpretations for the Galactic CR proton spectrum around the Earth measured with CALET, AMS02, and Voyager I.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Interstellar Magnetic Turbulence with TeV Pulsar Halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar magnetic field is essential in various astrophysical phenomena and processes. Pulsar halos are a recently discovered class of TeV gamma-ray sources formed by escaping electrons/positrons from pulsars. The morphology of the halo is regulated by the diffusion of those escaping particles, and hence carries information of the interstellar magnetic field. We suggest that the morphology of TeV pulsar halos can be used as a novel probe of the properties of interstellar magnetic field around the pulsar, such as the Alfv\'{e}nic Mach number and the mean direction. We establish a theoretical relation between these quantities and the observational features of the halo's morphology based on the anisotropic diffusion model, and show how X-ray observations of the pulsar halos can further improve the diagnosis of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Revisiting PBH Accretion, Evaporation and Their Cosmological Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a unique probe of the early Universe. Their cosmological evolution is governed by the competition between mass accretion and Hawking evaporation. In this paper we look into the details impact of accretion. Most of the earlier analysis relied on non-relativistic accretion models. In this work, we reinvestigate this in a fully relativistic framework for Kerr PBHs in the radiation-dominated era. We derive relativistic accretion rate and compute spin-dependent efficiency $\lambda_{\text{Kerr}}(a_*)$. Using this result, we construct coupled evolution equations for the PBH mass and spin that include both relativistic accretion and spin-dependent evaporation. Our analysis shows that relativistic accretion significantly increases PBH masses and consequently suppresses their spins, causing all PBHs to become effectively Schwarzschild well before evaporation. These effects strengthen the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the initial PBH mass by a factor of $\sim 4$--$5$, reduce the mass required for survival to the present epoch to $\sim 2.7\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{g}$, and shift the viable particle like DM parameter space. Notably the early accretion induced spin-down effect further washes out the well known high-frequency, spin-induced feature in the high frequency stochastic gravitational-wave background, modifying predictions for future detectors.</description>

      <title>Surface temperature of an accretion disk around a wormhole Kerr-mimicker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested that spinning wormholes may mimic Kerr black holes in astronomical sources such as X-ray binaries and supermassive compact objects in centers of galaxies. With recent advances in instrumentation this could be tested if clear differences between wormhole and black hole accretion were identified. We aim to quantitatively determine the extent to which the orbital properties of test particles in the gravity of a spinning wormhole may differ from those of a Kerr black hole. We seek to find an observable related to disk accretion that would be clearly different for Kerr black holes and Kerr-like wormholes. We use the standard Lagrangian approach to derive the orbital properties of test particles from an effective potential. We use standard thin disk theory to infer the disk surface temperature. We find that at a given circumferential radius the physical quantities relating to circular orbits in the equatorial plane are exactly the same for the spinning wormhole and a black hole of the same mass and angular momentum, if only the two space-time metrics differ in the g_rr component alone. However, for a wormhole there are no orbits of radius less than that of its throat. Non-circular orbits, bound or unbound, are affected by the radial distance function; in particular, the angle of apsidal precession in Kerr-like wormholes will differ from that in Kerr black holes. A Kerr-like wormhole is a perfect black hole mimicker in relation to the orbital properties in the equatorial plane. The angular velocity, specific energy, specific angular momentum, and Lense-Thirring precession rate are the same for a Kerr black hole and a Kerr-like wormhole in circular orbits of the same circumference. We find that the area of the (geometrically thin) accretion disk is different, and this yields a visibly suppressed disk temperature for traversable wormholes with a sufficiently wide throat.</description>

      <title>Observability of eccentricity in a population of merging compact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the prospects of observing residual eccentricity in a population of compact binaries by calculating the power in the eccentric harmonics, following the methodology in arXiv:2411.04187. Although most observed compact binary coalescences are expected to circularize before entering the sensitivity band of the ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, dynamical interactions in dense star clusters can lead to a fraction of these binaries with non-negligible eccentricity at the time of detection. To quantify the observability of eccentricity, we simulate a population of merging compact binaries and identify those which have sufficient power in sub-dominant eccentric harmonics to be clearly distinguishable from quasi-circular systems. We consider a binary black hole (BBH) population derived from globular cluster simulations with residual eccentricity distribution obtained from Cluster Monte Carlo (CMC) catalogs as well as a fiducial log-uniform model. Assuming the LIGO-Virgo network of GW detectors with their sensitivities achieved during LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Observing Run (O4), we find that the BBH population with measurable eccentricity will have a significantly higher median eccentricity $e_{\mathrm{10Hz}}\sim 0.3$ (with $90\%$ range: $0.1 - 0.5$) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $\sim 20$ ($90\%$ range: $13 - 57$) compared to the observable population of BBHs. We compare our predictions of the regions of parameter space where eccentricity is detectable with the claimed observations of eccentricity in GW events from third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3).</description>

      <title>Multi-Wavelength Afterglows as Diagnostic Probes of Dense Circumburst Medium in GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07719v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are generally believed to occur in environments where the surrounding medium is either a uniform interstellar medium (ISM) or, in some cases, a dense stellar wind from a massive progenitor. Recently, GRB 191019A has been proposed to originate within the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), suggesting that some GRBs may occur in extremely dense environments, although this interpretation remains under debate. This scenario has drawn considerable attention, as AGN disks are promising sites that can host progenitors of both long and short GRBs, and whose dense, gas-rich environment could significantly influence jet propagation and afterglow emission. Yet, our theoretical understanding of the resulting afterglow signatures in such environments is limited, and further systematic exploration is required. In this study, we investigate how multi-wavelength afterglow light curves can be utilized as diagnostic tools to probe the nature of the circumburst environment. Our results show that in dense environments, GRB afterglows exhibit distinct frequency-dependent behaviors. For jets with large opening angles, the X-ray light curve displays a shallow decay or bump due to a transition from synchrotron to SSC dominance, while the optical and high-energy (GeV) light curves follow typical power-law decays. On the other hand, for small opening angles, the light curves exhibit wavelength-dependent jet breaks: the GeV and optical bands break simultaneously, while the X-ray break is delayed as the SSC component gradually compensates for the fading synchrotron component. These signatures provide potential diagnostics of GRBs occurring in dense media such as AGN disks.</description>

      <title>X-ray Analysis of Gamma-Ray Burst Flares and Underlying Afterglows: Insights into Origin of Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray burst (GRB) X-ray light curves exhibit a variety of complex temporal structures, such as flares and plateaus. The origin of flares seen in many GRB early afterglows is still uncertain. Here, we analyze a sample of 89 GRBs, 61 of them with flares, both with and without a "plateau" phase. We fit the Swift-XRT light curves with synchrotron emission from a forward shock propagating into either a constant-density ISM or a stellar wind, and flares on top of that. We find that the flare light curves are not symmetric, with a decay time that is $\sim$five times longer than the rise time. We do not find any differences in flare properties between GRBs with and without a "plateau" phase. Moreover, additional afterglow properties such as the electron power-law index and the end time of the plateau are consistent between bursts with and without flares. These results strongly indicate that flares originate from a mechanism distinct from that producing the plateau and afterglow. When looking at the prompt emission properties, we do find some tendencies: GRBs with flares tend to be brighter and longer lasting than GRBs without flares. We therefore conclude that, unlike plateaus, flares are unlikely to arise from an external origin and are more plausibly associated with prolonged central engine activity that lasts longer than the main episode that produces the prompt phase. As the plateau cannot have the same origin, this result excludes models of late-time energy injection as the source of the GRB plateau.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) has revealed numerous ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray sources of unknown origin. We propose that a fraction of them can be explained by microquasar remnants, i.e., binary systems where mass transfer has ceased and the central engine is quenched. Cosmic rays injected during the active phase of a microquasar may remain confined within its cocoon and subsequently interact with nearby molecular clouds, producing bright gamma-ray emission through $pp$ collisions. Remnants of former super-Eddington systems can act as dark PeVatrons, releasing particles up to $\sim$10 PeV that illuminate surrounding clouds producing gamma rays reaching hundreds of TeV. This scenario provides a natural explanation for several unidentified Galactic LHAASO sources.</description>

Abstract: We review the current state of knowledge of the phase diagram of QCD through lattice, effective field theories, and chiral models. Several sections through the three dimensional phase diagram are known for $N_f=2+1$ with good precision. Due to technical advances in lattice techniques over the last decade or so, new aspects of the phase diagram can now be explored. We review current lattice results. The newly acquired knowledge can be used to reconstruct the full phase diagram for physical QCD, \ie, $N_f=1+1+1$. We remark on the computations which would help understand this better, and what the current constraints are on matter in neutron star cores. We also remark on the physics of the chiral transition and neutron stars in the 't Hooft large $N_c$ limit.</description>

Abstract: Neutrino self-interaction beyond the Standard Model is well motivated by the nonzero masses of neutrinos, which are the only known particles guaranteed to have new physics. Cosmic messengers, especially neutrinos, play a central role in probing new physics, as they provide experimental conditions far beyond the reach of laboratories and serve as the link between laboratory fundamental-physics discoveries and their roles in the Universe, where many new physics motivations originate. In this work, we propose a novel probe of neutrino self-interactions through ultra-high-energy neutrinos scattering off the cosmic neutrino background when the lightest neutrino species remains relativistic today. This allows us to ``Widen the Resonance'' of such scattering. Meanwhile, we also provide a semi-analytic framework for cosmogenic UHE neutrino production, avoiding computationally intensive simulations and yielding results precise enough for BSM studies. The widened resonance enables future ultrahigh-energy neutrino telescopes, in particular GRAND, to probe mediator masses from MeV to GeV, reaching couplings down to $g \sim 10^{-3}$ -- up to two orders of magnitude beyond current bounds. Our results enhance the discovery potential of $\nu$SI in the high-mass regime, potentially offering crucial insights into the connections between the neutrino sector and dark sector.</description>

      <title>Investigating all-sky Frequency Hough performances for neutron stars</title>

Abstract: Between the estimated population of Neutron Stars (NSs) and the actual number present in the catalogs, there is a huge gap: O(10$^{8-9}$) vs O(10$^3$). Among the different search techniques for Continuous gravitational waves (CWs), the all-sky could help to reduce the discrepancy. We focus on the all-sky CW pipeline Frequency Hough (FH), which operates without prior knowledge of the source parameters ($f,\dot{f}, \lambda, \beta$). Here, we present a Machine Learning strategy, diverging from the standard follow-up(FU) of the FH pipeline. We study the performance with real interferometer data, until reaching $h$ value subthreshold for the standard FU procedure ($CR_{thr}=5$), with encouraging classification results.</description>

      <title>SN 2024afav: A Superluminous Supernova with Multiple Light Curve Bumps and Spectroscopic Signatures of Circumstellar Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive optical and near-infrared spectroscopic study of SN 2024afav - a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) that peaks at $\approx$ -20.7 mag and exhibits an unusual multi-bumped light curve. Our spectroscopic observations, spanning phases of -14 to +160 d, reveal several unusual features: (i) a narrow (1,800 km s$^{-1}$) and blueshifted (11,000 km s$^{-1}$) absorption from H$\alpha$ starting at +20 d; (ii) persistent optical and NIR He I lines at all available phases, showing double absorption structure in NIR spectra at +23 d, with a high velocity component at a similar velocity to H$\alpha$; (iii) early appearance of nebular [O III] emission starting at $\approx$ +50 d; and (iv) strong [O II] + [Ca II] 7300 {\AA} emission complex starting at $\approx$ +110 d. These unusual features, and their onset at the time of the light curve bumps, provide compelling evidence of circumstellar interaction between the SN ejecta and a nearby hydrogen-rich shell, as well as the presence of helium in both the outer layers of the progenitor star and in the circumstellar medium. A comparison of SN 2024afav to other SLSNe-I showing bumpy light curves and similar spectral properties (PTF10hgi, SN 2017egm, SN 2019hge), points to a rare sub-group of SLSNe-I in which CSM interaction provides an important modulation to the energy input.</description>

      <title>Constraining meV Axion Dark Matter with ALMA Observations of the Galactic Center Magnetar SGR 1745-2900</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a mm-wave search for axions from the magnetar SGR 1745-2900, based on 4.8 h of ALMA observations. No statistically significant features are detected between 133.99-135.78, 135.91-137.70, 145.99-147.78, and 147.99-149.78 GHz. Interpreting this null result via resonant conversion with a state-of-the-art star model and the dark-matter density expected at the Galactic Center, we constrain the axion-photon coupling at the level of $g_{\gamma}\gtrsim 2\times10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ within 0.55-0.62 meV, accessing for the first time the QCD axion parameter space near the meV scale.</description>

      <title>A XRISM/Resolve view of the dynamics in the hot gaseous atmosphere of M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The XRISM/Resolve microcalorimeter directly measured the gas velocities in the core of the Virgo Cluster, the closest example of AGN feedback in a cluster. This proximity allows us to resolve the kinematic impact of feedback on scales down to 5 kpc. Our spectral analysis reveals a high velocity dispersion of $\sigma_v$=262 (+45 / -38) km/s near the AGN, which steeply declines to ~60 km/s between 5 and 25 kpc in the northwest direction. The observed line-of-sight bulk velocity in all regions is broadly consistent with the central galaxy, M87, with a mild trend toward blueshifted motions at larger radii. Systematic uncertainties have been carefully assessed and do not affect the measurements. The central velocities, if attributed entirely to isotropic turbulence, correspond to a transonic ICM at sub-6 kpc scales with three-dimensional Mach number 0.69 (+0.14 / -0.11) and a non-thermal pressure fraction of 21 (+7 / -5)%. Simple models of weak shocks and sound waves and calculations assuming isotropic turbulence both support the hypothesis that the velocity field reflects a mix of shock-driven expansion and turbulence. Compared to other clusters observed by XRISM to date, M87's central region stands out as the most kinematically disturbed, exhibiting both the highest velocity dispersion and the largest 3D Mach number, concentrated at the smallest physical scales.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals in the cold vector dark matter environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With regard to the observed dark matter density profile in galaxies and clusters, the scalar dark matter scenario has been previously studied for potential detectability through gravitational wave observations at measurable signal-to-noise ratios. In the present study, we consider the case of dark matter described by a massive vector field, also referred to as the Proca field. The density profile in the vicinity of the black hole is explicitly constructed for a broad range of dark matter mass, $\mu\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-15}{\mathrm eV}$, which allows it to exhibit both particle and wave-like characteristics. While in the particle regime, the computation of the DM density distribution is analytically tractable, we find it convenient to compute the same numerically in the wave regime. Nevertheless, in the outer region, the surrounding dark matter is assumed to follow a broken power-law distribution, represented by a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with a central spike. For the purpose of investigating the detectability of the vector dark matter in the gravitational wave spectrum, we have modelled a stellar-mass black hole ($1M_{\odot}$) inspiralling into a Schwarzschild black hole of mass $10^4M_{\odot}$ within such a vector dark matter environment. With this setup, we analyzed the dephasing in the gravitational wave strain induced by vector dark matter and performed a Fisher forecast for upcoming LISA observations, with particular emphasis on the distinctive features in both the particle and wave regimes of the dark matter. Additionally, most of the important results have been compared with the scalar dark matter case.</description>

      <title>Giant outbursts of clumpy material preceding Type II supernova 2024qiw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of core-collapse supernovae suggest that some massive stars undergo intense mass loss shortly before explosion, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we report evidence of giant outbursts of clumpy material from a massive star in the final decades before explosion. Photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric data of SN~2024qiw reveal a bumpy light curve, a broad H$\alpha$ profile, and variable polarization, all consistent with interaction between SN ejecta and clumpy circumstellar material, implying a mass-loss rate of $\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Taken together, the most likely explanation is multiple major eruptions, similar to those of Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs), but occurring shortly before explosion. This challenges standard stellar evolution theory by requiring either that LBVs explode terminally, or that other evolutionary phases produce eruptive episodes. In spite of very high pre-SN mass loss, the resulting SN is of Type~II, rather than Type IIn, highlighting diverse and previously unrecognized late-stage mass-loss processes.</description>

      <title>Genesis of Axion Dark Matter via Black Hole and Cosmic String Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global $U_{PQ}(1)$ Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry, proposed to resolve the strong CP problem, predicts the existence of the axion, a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson and a leading dark matter candidate. The spontaneous breaking of this symmetry generates global strings that decay predominantly via the emission of massive axions and gravitational waves. In this work, we investigate the decay of cosmic axion strings in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole and estimate the corresponding energy losses and decay timescales of the resulting string loops. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses as small as $10^{-16} M_\odot$, the total energy radiated by the contracting strings is found to be on the order of $10^{27} \, \mathrm{GeV}$, accounting for both axion and gravitational radiation. Our analysis shows that the presence of a central black hole considerably accelerates string loop decay, leading to significantly reduced lifetimes. These results constitute an initial exploration of whether axion radiation from PBH-cosmic string systems could provide a non-negligible contribution to the dark matter content of galactic halos. The study also identifies the decay time as a potentially valuable observational signature. Further detailed modeling will be necessary to assess the cosmological implications of this mechanism more precisely.</description>

      <title>Micro-Tidal Disruption Events at Galactic Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores a scenario for micro-tidal disruption events (TDEs) triggered by close encounters between high-speed white dwarfs (WDs) and stellar-mass black holes (sBHs) in galactic centers. In this model, a WD orbiting the central massive black hole (MBH) is scattered by an sBH during the sBH's early extreme mass-ratio inspiral phase. We conservatively estimate these events occur a few times per year within $z\leq 3$. Significant disruption of the WD occurs when the impact parameter is comparable to the WD's radius. We derive a mathematical criterion and confirm numerically by hydrodynamical simulations. With the increase of the impact parameter and the collision speed, the WD material captured by the sBH decreases while the material remain self-gravitating increases. A part of the WD material becomes unbound from the sBH-WD system, and its mass ranges from nearly zero to $\ge 50\%$, reaching the peak value when the impact parameter is comparable to the WD's radius. We expect the subsequent capture of WD material by the sBH to produce a prompt X-ray burst (a micro-TDE), and the accretion of unbound debris onto the MBH can power a fainter, delayed optical flare. The properties of certain transient X-ray bursts observed by Einstein Probe are consistent with this micro-TDE picture.</description>

      <title>Seasonal Variations of the Atmospheric Muon Neutrino Spectrum measured with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents an energy-dependent analysis of seasonal variations in the atmospheric muon neutrino spectrum, using 11.3 years of data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. By leveraging a novel spectral unfolding method, we explore the energy range from 125 GeV to 10 TeV for zenith angles between 90{\deg} to 110{\deg}, corresponding to the Antarctic atmosphere. Our findings reveal that the seasonal variation amplitude decreases with energy reaching ($-4.6 \pm 1.1$)\% during Austral winter and increases ($+3.9 \pm 1.2$)\% during Austral summer relative to the annual average at 10TeV. While the unfolded flux exceeds the model predictions by up to 30\%, the differential measurement of seasonal variations remains unaffected. The measured seasonal variations of the muon neutrino spectrum are consistent with theoretical predictions using the MCEq code and the NRLMSISE-00 atmospheric model.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray Burst Empirical Correlation between Peak Luminosity and Peak Energy in The ICMART Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Internal-Collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model is a widely accepted model for explaining how high-magnetization jets produce gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emissions.
  In previous works, we show that this model can produce:
  1) light curves with a superposition of fast and slow components;
  2) a Band-shaped spectrum whose parameters could follow the typical distribution of GRB observations;
  3) both ``hard to soft" and ``intensity tracking" patterns of spectral evolution.
  In this work, through simulations of a large sample with methods established in previous work, we show that the ICMART model can also explain the observed empirical relationships (here we focus on the Yonetoku and Liang relations), as long as the magnetic field strength in the magnetic reconnection radiation region is proportional to the mass of the bulk shell, and inversely proportional to the initial magnetization factor of the bulk shell.
  Our results suggest that during extreme relativistic magnetic reconnection events, an increase in magnetic field strength leads to more intense dissipation, ultimately resulting in a weaker residual magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Using Wavelet Decomposition to Determine the Dimension of Structures from Projected Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mesoscale structures can often be described as fractional dimensional across a wide range of scales. We consider a $\gamma$ dimensional measure embedded in an $N$ dimensional space and discuss how to determine its dimension, both in $N$ dimensions and projected into $D$ dimensions.
  It is a highly non-trivial problem to decode the original geometry from lower dimensional projection of a high-dimensional measure. The projections are space-feeling, the popular box-counting techniques do not apply, and the Fourier methods are contaminated by aliasing effects. In the present paper we demonstrate that under the "Copernican hypothesis'' that we are not observing objects from a special direction, projection in a wavelet basis is remarkably simple: the wavelet power spectrum of a projected $\gamma$ dimensional measure is $P_j \propto 2^{-j\gamma}$. This holds regardless of the embedded dimension, $N$, and the projected dimension, $D$. This approach could have potentially broad applications in data sciences where a typically sparse matrix encodes lower dimensional information embedded in an extremely high dimensional field and often measured in projection to a low dimensional space.
  Here, we apply this method to JWST and Chandra observations of the nearby supernova Cas A. We find that the emissions can be represented by projections of mesoscale substructures with fractal dimensions varying from $\gamma = 1.7$ for the warm CO layer observed by JWST, up to $\gamma = 2.5$ for the hot X-ray emitting gas layer in the supernova remnant. The resulting power law indicates that the emission is coming from a fractal dimensional mesoscale structure likely produced by magneto-hydrodynamical instabilities in the expanding supernova shell.</description>

      <title>Probing the peak of star formation with the stochastic background of binary black hole mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration detects many individually resolvable gravitational-wave events from binary black hole mergers, those that are too weak to be identified individually contribute to a stochastic gravitational-wave background. Unlike the standard cross-correlation search for excess correlated power, a Bayesian search method that models the background as a superposition of an unknown number of mergers enables simultaneous inference of the properties of high-redshift binary black hole populations and accelerated detection of the background. In this work, we apply this templated background search method to one day of simulated data at current LIGO Hanford-Livingston detector network sensitivity to determine whether the weakest mergers contribute information to the detection of the background and to the constraint on the merger redshift distribution at high redshifts. We find that the dominant source of information for the detection of the stochastic background comes from mergers with signal-to-noise ratios just below the individual detection threshold. However, we demonstrate that the weakest mergers do contribute to the constraint on the shape of the redshift distribution not only beyond the peak of star formation, but also beyond the redshifts accessible with individually detectable sources.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays Masquerading as Cool Cores: An Inverse-Compton Origin for Cool Core Cluster Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray bright cool-core (CC) clusters contain luminous radio sources accelerating cosmic ray (CR) leptons at prodigious rates. Near the acceleration region, high-energy leptons produce synchrotron (mini)halos and sometimes observable gamma rays, but these leptons have short lifetimes and so cannot propagate far from sources without some rejuvenation. However, low-energy (~0.1-1 GeV) CRs should survive for &gt;Gyr, potentially reaching ~100 kpc before losing energy via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons to keV X-ray energies, with remarkably thermal X-ray spectra. In groups/clusters, this will appear similar to relatively 'cool' gas in cluster cores (i.e. CCs). In lower-mass (e.g. Milky Way/M31) halos, analogous CR IC emission will appear as hot (super-virial) gas at outer CGM radii, explaining recent diffuse X-ray observations. We show that for plausible (radio/gamma-ray observed) lepton injection rates, the CR-IC emission could contribute significantly to the X-ray surface brightness (SB) in CCs, implying that CC gas densities may have been overestimated and alleviating the cooling flow problem. A significant IC contribution to diffuse X-ray emission in CC clusters also explains the tight correlation between the X-ray 'cooling luminosity' and AGN/cavity/jet power, because the apparent CC emission is itself driven by the radio source. Comparing observed Sunyaev Zeldovich to X-ray inferred pressures at $\ll 100$ kpc in CCs represents a clean test of this scenario, and existing data appears to favor significant CR-IC. A significant IC contribution also implies that X-ray inferred gas-phase metallicities have been underestimated in CCs, potentially explaining the discrepancy between X-ray (sub-Solar) and optical/UV (super-Solar) observed metallicities in the central ~10 kpc of nearby CCs. We also discuss the model's connection to observations of multiphase gas in clusters.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15-year Data Set: Search for Gravitational Scattering of Pulsars by Free-Floating Objects in Interstellar Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free-floating objects (FFOs) in interstellar space$-$rogue planets, brown dwarfs, and large asteroids that are not gravitationally bound to any star$-$are expected to be ubiquitous throughout the Milky Way. Recent microlensing surveys have discovered several free-floating planets that are not bound to any known stellar systems. Additionally, three interstellar objects, namely 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov, and 3I/ATLAS, have been detected passing through our solar system on hyperbolic trajectories. In this work, we search for FFOs on hyperbolic orbits that pass near millisecond pulsars (MSPs), where their gravitational influence can induce detectable perturbations in pulse arrival times. Using the NANOGrav 15-year narrowband dataset, which contains high-precision timing data for 68 MSPs, we conduct a search for such hyperbolic scattering events between FFOs and pulsars. Although no statistically significant events were detected, this non-detection enables us to place upper limits on the number density of FFOs as a function of their mass within our local region of the Galaxy. For example, the upper limit on the number density for Jupiter-mass FFOs ($\sim 10^{-2.5} - 10^{-3.5}~M_{\odot}$) obtained from different pulsars ranges from $5.25\times10^{6}~\text{pc}^{-3}$ to $5.37\times10^{9}~\text{pc}^{-3}$, while the upper limit calculated by combining results from all the pulsars is $6.03\times10^{5}~\text{pc}^{-3}$. These results represent the first constraints on FFO population derived from pulsar timing data.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Periodic Eruptions as a Probe of Accretion Disk in Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are X-ray transients characterized by nearly regular recurring flares from galactic nuclei. Recent observations have confirmed that some QPEs occur in galactic centers that experienced a tidal disruption event (TDE) a few years earlier. This may be reasonably explained if QPEs are produced when a star orbiting a supermassive black hole passes through an accretion disk formed by the TDE. Based on this scenario, we investigate the expected QPE signatures in the early stages of TDEs, taking into account the time evolution of the accretion disk. In the early phase, the disk is in a super-Eddington accretion state. The interaction between the star and such a slim disk results in QPEs with durations of $\sim 100-1000\,{\rm s}$ and temperatures of $\sim 1-100\,{\rm keV}$, which are significantly shorter and hotter than those of the currently detected QPE population. These events are detectable with current X-ray telescopes, but their small duty cycle ($\lesssim1\,\%$) and the potential presence of a massive disk wind may make detection challenging. We encourage early-time and long-term monitoring TDEs showing X-rays to capture these QPEs, as such detections would provide valuable insights into the disk formation process in TDEs.</description>

      <title>Magnetic White Dwarf - M Dwarf Binaries in Pre-mCV Phase as Special Population of Long-Period Radio Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a new class of coherent radio sources with periods ranging from minutes to hours. Recently, two LPT sources, ILT J1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704-37, with periods of 2-3 hours has been confirmed to originate from white dwarf (WD) -- M dwarf (MD) binaries. In this work, we propose that at least some LPTs originate from the magnetic WD -- MD binaries in the pre-magnetic cataclysmic variables (pre-mCV) phase. The asynchronism between the WD's rotation and the binary's orbital motion allows for the unipolar-inductor mechanism or magnetosphere interaction to operate and accelerate radiating particles, with the dominant process depending on the magnetic moment ratio of the two stars. Under asynchronism condition, both the peak flux and the polarization of radio pulses will be modulated by the beat period. The pre-mCV phase characterized by an extremely low accretion rate provides the relatively clean magnetospheric environment necessary for a loss-cone-driven maser (LCDM) mechanism to operate, producing the LPT emission. The observed pulse duty cycle of $10^{-3}-10^{-1}$ is attributed to a beaming effect modulated by the binary's magnetic geometry. Furthermore, the magnetized environment of a WD--MD binary is conducive to Faraday conversion with weak coupling, which implies that the polarization state of LPTs should vary significantly at different periods. Finally, we predict that LPTs from WD--MD binaries should exhibit a period distribution following $f_P(P)dP \propto P^{(1.67-2.33)}dP$ and a luminosity function described by $f_L(L)dL \propto L^{-(1.80-2.67)}dL$, which can be tested by the future large sample.</description>

      <title>Rare Transients in Nearby Galaxies Explain Ultra-high-energy Cosmic Rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays remains one of the central open questions in astroparticle physics. Recent measurements reveal anisotropies in arrival directions, a rigidity-dependent composition dominated by intermediate-mass nuclei, and striking hemispheric differences in the energy spectra. Here we show that \emph{rare transients in nearby galaxies} can naturally account for these features. In our fiducial neutron-star merger model, the cosmic ray flux above $25$~EeV is dominated by ten nearby galaxies within $8\,$Mpc. This accounts for the observed hotspots: seven of the ten brightest galaxies coincide with reported excess regions, a chance probability of $p\sim0.001$. Nearby transients can also explain the spectral excess of TA over Auger and modify the rigidity--aligned succession of isotopes.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae provide a unique probe of the equation of state (EOS) of high density matter. In this work, we focus on the bounce signal from numerical simulations of rotating supernovae and explore its potential for EOS inference. We employ a support vector machine, previously shown to perform best among tested methods, to classify GW signals simulated for 18 EOS models. For optimally oriented sources, we estimate that the Advanced LIGO A+ detector can probe the EOS for Galactic events, while third-generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer can reach substantially farther. For randomly oriented sources, only these next-generation detectors are expected to have sufficient sensitivity. These results represent the potential observational range for probing the nuclear EOS, although, due to the simplifying assumptions adopted, they should be regarded as approximate upper limits.</description>

      <title>A Mass-Independent Damping Timescale in Black Hole Accretion Systems</title>

Abstract: The scaling laws reveal the underlying structural similarities shared by astrophysical systems across vastly different scales. In black hole accretion systems, the scaling relations between the characteristic damping timescales (CDTs) of light curves and black hole mass offer valuable insights into the underlying physical structure of accretion disks. Here, we investigate the long-term hard X-ray CDTs of 106 black hole and neutron star accretion systems using light curves from the \textit{Swift} Burst Alert Telescope 157-month catalog. Unexpectedly, for the first time, we discover a mass-independent CDT in these black hole accretion systems, in contrast to well-established scaling laws. This puzzling phenomenon can be attributed to conductive timescales arising from disk--corona interactions, instead of the intrinsic accretion disk processes characterized by scaling laws, and it may further modulate jet emission in blazars. This result demonstrates thermal conduction as a key mechanism driving hard X-ray variability and offers new observational evidence for the disk--corona--jet connection.</description>

Abstract: Neutron stars, which are composed of extremely dense nuclear matter, serve as natural laboratories to study nuclear interactions beyond the terrestrial experiments. Recent researches have actively explored how the equation of state (EoS) can be constrained by observed neutron star masses and radii, and how nuclear interactions affect their macroscopic properties. Most of these studies, however, rely on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, which assumed static, spherically symmetric neutron stars. Since neutron stars are rotating objects and thus axisymmetrically deformed, the TOV calculation may be insufficient to capture their realistic structure. In this work, we investigate the influence of nuclear matter properties on the physical quantities of rotating neutron stars using two approaches: the perturbative Hartle-Thorne (HT) method and fully general relativistic Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu (KEH) method. For nuclear EoS parameter sets, we emamine the OMEG series, in which the slope of the symmetry energy $L$ is systematically varied. We find that rotational effects lead to a noticeable increase in the stellar radius, which depends sensitively on values of $L$. Additionally, focusing on the rotational deformation, we show that the results obtained by these two methods deviate each other even for the slowly rotating case such as $\Omega=200$ Hz. These results reveal that, for detailed discussions on the internal structure and stability of rotating neutron stars, the fully general relativistic method such as KEH is indispensable.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Massive Black Hole Merger Host Galaxies from Cosmological Simulations II: Unique Stellar Kinematics in Integral Field Unit Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14061</link>

Abstract: Secure methods for identifying the host galaxies of individual massive black hole (MBH) binaries and mergers detected by gravitational wave experiments such as LISA and Pulsar Timing Arrays are currently lacking, but will be critical to a variety of science goals. Recently in Bardati et al. (2024, Paper I), we used the Romulus25 cosmological simulation to show that MBH merger host galaxies have unique morphologies in imaging, due to their stronger bulges. Here, we use the same sample of simulated MBH merger host galaxies to investigate their stellar kinematics, as probed by optical integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy. We perform stellar population synthesis and dust radiative transfer to generate synthetic 3D optical spectral datacubes of each simulated galaxy, and produce mock stellar kinematic maps. Based on a linear discriminant analysis of a combination of kinematic parameters derived from these maps, we show that this approach can identify MBH binary and merger host galaxies with accuracies that increase with chirp mass and mass ratio. For mergers with high chirp masses (&gt;10^8.2 Msun) and high mass ratios (&gt;0.5), the accuracies reach &gt;85%, and their host galaxies are uniquely characterized by slower rotation and stronger stellar kinematic misalignments. These kinematic properties are commonly associated with massive early-type galaxies that have experienced major mergers, and naturally act as signposts for MBH binaries and mergers with high chirp masses and mass ratios. These results suggest that IFU spectroscopy should also play a role in telescope follow-up of future MBH binaries and mergers detected in gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Constraining the competition between the deconfinement and chiral phase transitions in light of the multimessenger era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05687v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the parity doublet model for hadronic matter and study the possible presence of quark matter inside the cores of neutron stars with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Considering the uncertainties of the QCD phase diagram and the location of the critical endpoint, we aim to explore the competition between the chiral phase transition and the deconfinement phase transition systematically, regulated by the vacuum pressure $-B$ in the NJL model. Employing a Maxwell construction, a sharp first-order deconfinement phase transition is implemented combining the parity doublet model for the hadronic phase and the NJL model for the high-energy quark phase. The position of the chiral phase transition is obtained from the NJL model self-consistently. We find stable neutron stars with a quark core within a specific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. The observations suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600$ MeV in the parity doublet model and a larger split between the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions while assuming the first-order deconfinement phase transition. The maximum mass of the hybrid star that we obtain is $\sim 2.2 M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Production and Analytic Attenuation of Energetic MeV Solar Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a solar production mechanism of MeV dark matter to overcome the energy threshold in direct detection experiments. In particular, the proton and deuteron fussion to ${}^3 \mathrm{He}$ of the $pp$ chain that produces energetic neutrino and gamma photon with 5.5$\,$MeV of energy release can also produce a pair of dark matter particles. Besides, we establish an analytical formalism of using the Boltzmann equation to study the solar attenuation effect on the produced dark matter flux. The projected sensitivity is illustrated with Argon target at the DarkSide-LowMass experiment.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing by non-self-intersecting vortons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational lensing signatures of vorton configurations, considering the circular vorton, the Kibble-Turok vorton, and a newly proposed class that incorporates simultaneous excitations of the first, second, and third harmonic modes. Working within the weak-field and thin-lens approximations, we demonstrate that circular vortons produce a sharp lensing discontinuity that separates two regions with qualitatively distinct distortions. The corresponding Einstein ring co-exists alongside an almost undistorted source image. This effect is significantly amplified in the case of non-circular vortons, where asymmetries and higher-harmonic deformations amplify the discontinuity and lead to complex image structures. These distinctive lensing patterns offer potential discriminants between different vorton configurations, suggesting that future high-resolution surveys may provide a novel window into the microphysics of current-carrying cosmic strings.</description>

      <title>The Tantalizing Case of the Quasar J0950+5128 -- I. Presentation of the Data and Detailed Exploration of the Binary Supermassive Black Hole Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic observations of the quasar J0950$+$5128 spanning 22 years reveal monotonic radial velocity variations in its broad H$\beta$ emission line. Moreover, the line profile becomes broader over time, necessitating careful measurements. We present robust H$\beta$ velocity shift measurements obtained via cross correlation, applied to both the full spectra and to isolated broad H$\beta$ components derived from spectral decomposition. We also examine the light curves for variability consistent with the spectroscopic trends. Using Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis we find no significant periodic signal. We consider several interpretations for the observed changes, including a binary supermassive black hole, dust-cloud obscuration, outflows, a recoiling black hole, and a single perturbed, disk-like broad-line region. We disfavor all but the binary and perturbed broad-line region scenarios. The binary interpretation is the only one for which we can immediately compare a physical model to the available data. Thus, we incorporate radial velocity ''jitter'' to emulate typical quasar variability and fit the radial velocity curve with a Keplerian model to examine whether it can reproduce the observations. In this context, the available observations trace only a segment of the putative orbit. The fit yields a period of 33 years (observed frame) and an eccentricity of 0.65, with lower limits on the semi-major axis and black hole mass of $10^{-2}\;$pc and $10^7\;{\rm M}_\odot$, respectively. Thus, J0950$+$5128 is a compelling supermassive binary candidate. The single, perturbed broad-line region interpretation remains viable but requires additional observations and modeling for further evaluation. Continued monitoring is, therefore, essential.</description>

      <title>Black Hole - Neutron Star and Binary Neutron Star Mergers from Population III and II stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Population III (Pop.$~$III) stars are expected to be massive and to undergo minimal mass loss due to their lack of metals, making them ideal progenitors of black holes and neutron stars. Here, we investigate the formation and properties of binary neutron star (BNS) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers originating from Pop.$~$III stars, and compare them to their metal-enriched Population II (Pop.$~$II) counterparts, focusing on their merger rate densities (MRDs), primary masses and delay times. We find that, despite the high merger efficiency of Pop.$~$III BNSs and BHNSs, their low star formation rate results in a MRD at least one order of magnitude lower than that of Pop.$~$II stars. The MRD of Pop.$~$III BNSs peaks at redshift $z\sim15$, attaining a value $\mathcal{R}_{\rm BNS}(z\sim15) \sim 15\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$, while the MRD of Pop.$~$III BHNSs is maximum at $z\sim13$, reaching a value $\mathcal{R}_{\rm BHNS}(z\sim13) \sim 2\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$. Finally, we observe that the black hole masses of Pop.$~$III BHNS mergers have a nearly flat distribution with a peak at $\sim 20\,\rm M_{\odot}$ and extending up to $\sim 50\,\rm M_{\odot}$. Black holes in Pop.$~$II BHNS mergers show instead a peak at $\lesssim 15\,\rm M_{\odot}$. We consider these predictions in light of recent gravitational-wave observations in the local Universe, finding that a Pop.$~$III origin is preferred relative to Pop.$~$II for some events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors improve in sensitivity, gravitational-wave background (GWB) signals will progressively become detectable. Currently, searches for the GWB model the signal as a power law; however, deviations from this model will be relevant at increased sensitivity. Therefore, to prepare for the range of potentially detectable GWB signals, we propose an interpolation model implemented through a transdimensional reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. This interpolation model foregoes a specific physics-informed model (of which there are a great many) in favor of a flexible model that can accurately recover a broad range of potential signals. In this paper, we employ this framework for an array of GWB applications. We present three dimensionless fractional GW energy density injections and recoveries as examples of the capabilities of this spline interpolation model. We further demonstrate how our model can be implemented for hierarchical GW analysis on $\Omega_{\rm GW}$.</description>

      <title>Binary black hole population inference combining confident and marginal events from the $\tt{IAS\text{-}HM}$ search pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the population properties of binary black hole mergers identified by the $\tt{IAS\text{-}HM}$ pipeline (which incorporates higher-order modes in the search templates) during the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) detectors. In our population inference analysis, instead of only using events above a sharp cut based on a particular detection threshold (e.g., false alarm rate), we use a Bayesian framework to consistently include both marginal and confident events. We find that our inference based solely on highly significant events ($p_{\mathrm{astro}} \sim 1$) is broadly consistent with the GWTC-3 population analysis performed by the LVK collaboration. However, incorporating marginal events into the analysis leads to a preference for stronger redshift evolution in the merger rate and an increased density of asymmetric mass-ratio mergers relative to the GWTC-3 analysis, while remaining within its allowed parameter ranges. Using simple parametric models to describe the binary black hole population, we estimate a merger rate density of $32.4^{+18.5}_{-12.2}\ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at redshift $z = 0.2$, and a redshift evolution parameter of $\kappa = 4.4^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$. Assuming a power-law form for the mass ratio distribution ($\propto q^{\beta}$), we infer $\beta = 0.1^{+1.9}_{-1.4}$, indicating a relatively flat distribution. These results highlight the potential impact of marginal events on population inferences and motivate future analyses with data from upcoming observing runs.</description>

      <title>Early Stages of Dusty Tori: The First Infrared Spectra from a Highly Multiscale Quasar Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first infrared spectral predictions from a self-consistent simulation of the formation of a quasar in a starburst galaxy, spanning the cosmological environment to scales well below the dust sublimation region. The infrared (IR) emission is dominated by a torus-like dust structure composed of the highly magnetized, turbulence-supported outer accretion disk and of accreting gas tidally torn from the interstellar medium (ISM). At these early stages, the active galactic nuclei (AGN) is buried and Compton-thick. The near- to mid-IR escaping luminosity varies by almost an order of magnitude across sightlines, largely due to extinction from the inflowing stream of cold dust. Self-absorption within the torus suppresses silicate emission features, and further reprocessing by the ambient ISM leads to prominent silicate absorption and colder IR emission. The sublimation structure is stratified by composition and size, producing sightline-dependent extinction curves that intrinsically vary in shape. However, after repeated scattering in the optically thick dusty medium, these curves emerge substantially grayed. We also demonstrate that bipolar outflows from the central black hole that carve biconical cavities and reveal the central engine in later stages can preserve IR anisotropy and silicate features. These results suggest that dusty starburst quasars can undergo a buried, IR-bright phase early in their evolution.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis of the Complex Singlet Model with Phase Transition Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the prospects of probing the Complex Singlet Extension of the Standard Model (CxSM) with gravitational waves from the Electroweak phase transition. The study establishes a connection of the scalar potential parameters, the thermodynamic properties of the phase transition, with the directly measured stochastic gravitational-wave background in the presence of astrophysical background and foreground. Considering the space-based gravitational wave detector Taiji, we construct a frequency-domain likelihood that incorporates instrumental and astrophysical noises, and perform both Fisher-matrix forecasts and Bayesian Nested Sampling analysis. The comparison of these two approaches demonstrates consistent parameter recovery and highlights the sensitivity of Taiji to millihertz gravitational-wave signals. We further propagate the inferred constraints on the gravitational-wave spectrum back to the underlying CxSM parameters, obtaining meaningful limits on the Higgs self-couplings. The results emphasize the complementarity between gravitational-wave observations and collider measurements, showing that future missions such as Taiji can serve as a powerful probe of electroweak-scale new physics and the dynamical origin of the Higgs sector.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of a static black hole in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the axial electromagnetic quasinormal modes of a static, asymptotically Anti--de Sitter (AdS) black hole sourced by a nonlinear electrodynamics model of Pleba\'{n}ski type. Starting from the master equation governing axial perturbations, we impose ingoing boundary conditions at the event horizon and normalizable (Dirichlet) behavior at the AdS boundary. Following the approach of Jansen, we recast the radial equation into a linear generalized eigenvalue problem by using an ingoing Eddington--Finkelstein formulation, compactifying the radial domain, and regularizing the asymptotic coefficients. The resulting problem is solved using a Chebyshev--Lobatto pseudospectral discretization. We compute the fundamental quasinormal mode frequencies for both the purely electric ($Q_m=0$) and purely magnetic ($Q_e=0$) sectors, emphasizing the role of the nonlinearity parameter $\beta$ and the effective charge magnitude $Q$. Our results show that increasing either $\beta$ or $Q$ raises both the oscillation frequency $\omega_R$ and the damping rate $-\omega_I$, leading to faster but more rapidly decaying ringdown profiles. Nonlinear electrodynamics breaks the isospectrality between electric and magnetic configurations: magnetic modes are systematically less oscillatory and more weakly damped than their electric counterparts. For sufficiently large $\beta$ and small $Q_m$, the fundamental mode becomes purely imaginary ($\omega_R \approx 0$), in agreement with the absence of a trapping potential barrier in this regime. These findings reveal qualitative signatures of nonlinear electromagnetic effects on black hole perturbations and may have implications for high-field or high-charge astrophysical environments.</description>
