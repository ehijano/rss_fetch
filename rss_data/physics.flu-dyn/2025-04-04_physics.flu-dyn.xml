      <title>Droplet-on-demand using a positive pressure pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplet generation under steady conditions is a common microfluidic method for producing biphasic systems. However, this process works only over a limited range of imposed pressure: beyond a critical value, a stable liquid jet can instead form. Furthermore, for a given geometry the pressure conditions set both the generation rate of droplets and their volume. Here, we report on-demand droplet production using a positive pressure pulse to the dispersed-phase inlet of a flow-focusing geometry. This strategy enables confined droplet generation within and beyond the pressure range observed under steady conditions, and decouples volume and production rate. In particular, elongated plugs not possible under steady conditions may be formed when the maximal pressure during the pulse reaches the jet regime. The measured volume of droplets-on-demand, as well as the onset of droplet generation are both captured with a simple model that considers hydraulic resistances. This work provides a strategy and design rules for processes that require individual droplets or elongated plugs in a simple microfluidic chip design.</description>

      <title>Optimal and suboptimal spatiotemporal dynamics of multi-shear-layers in rectangular jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the perturbation dynamics of a complex supersonic multi-stream rectangular jet. The dynamics are examined through application of spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) to elicit coherent structure and linear resolvent analysis to reveal forcing-response characteristics. SPOD of a large-eddy simulation identifies Kelvin--Helmholtz coherent structures at the dominating frequency in the splitter plate shear layer region, formed by mixing core Mach $1.6$ and bypass Mach $1.0$ streams. Resolvent analysis leverages the time-averaged flowfield on the center plane with discounting to capture flow response over a finite time window, addressing base flow instabilities. The optimal and first sub-optimal resolvent energy amplifications peak near the dominant frequency for a wide range of frequencies and spanwise wavenumbers. Comparing the resolvent and SPOD results, we find that the linear operator over-optimizes the optimal mechanism, and the sub-optimal mode instead is more aligned with the leading SPOD mode. An intriguing shift phenomenon where the optimal and sub-optimal gain distributions crossover is observed; these events are associated with receptive regions in the different shear layers. Subsequent input-output analyses with state-variable and spatial restrictions provide insights into componentwise amplification of the jet flow response, thus providing direction for tailored practical flow control.</description>

      <title>Improving turbulence control through explainable deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent-flow control aims to develop strategies that effectively manipulate fluid systems, such as the reduction of drag in transportation and enhancing energy efficiency, both critical steps towards reducing global CO$_2$ emissions. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers novel tools to discover flow-control strategies, which we combine with our knowledge of the physics of turbulence. We integrate explainable deep learning (XDL) to objectively identify the coherent structures containing the most informative regions in the flow, with a DRL model trained to reduce them. The trained model targets the most relevant regions in the flow to sustain turbulence and produces a drag reduction which is higher than that of a model specifically trained to reduce the drag, while using only half its power consumption. Moreover, the XDL model results in a better drag reduction than other models focusing on specific classically identified coherent structures. This demonstrates that combining DRL with XDL can produce causal control strategies that precisely target the most influential features of turbulence. By directly addressing the core mechanisms that sustain turbulence, our approach offers a powerful pathway towards its efficient control, which is a long-standing challenge in physics with profound implications for energy systems, climate modeling and aerodynamics.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of the pressure-driven flow of pairs of rigid spheres in elastoviscoplastic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate through numerical simulations the hydrodynamic interactions between two rigid spherical particles suspended on the axis of a cylindrical tube filled with an elastoviscoplastic fluid subjected to pressure-driven flow. The simulations are performed by the finite element method with the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation. We carry out a parametric analysis to examine the impact of the yield stress and relaxation time of the fluid and of particle confinement on the dynamics of the system. We identify master curves of the particle relative velocity as a function of the inter-particle distance. When the yield stress of the suspending phase is much lower than the viscous stress, those curves highlight short-range attractive interactions and long-range repulsive interactions between particles, with the latter specifically promoting their alignment. As the yield stress increases, the attractive interaction is replaced by stasis at short distance, characterized by a vanishing relative velocity and the formation of an unyielded region that connects the two spheres, where the fluid behaves like a viscoelastic solid. Additionally, the combined effects of plasticity and elasticity enhance the repulsion between the particles, promoting their ordering. Also increasing the confinement of the particles enhances repulsion, thus allowing to achieve ordering within shorter lengths in the flow direction. Reducing shear thinning amplifies peak relative velocities and expands the attractive region due to increased viscoelastic stresses and stress gradients. While a stable equilibrium may appear at larger separations, its impact is limited by low relative velocities.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Permeability Estimation in Microporous Rocks Using a Hybrid Macropore-Darcy Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel workflow for constructing hybrid macropore-Darcy models from micro-CT images of microporous rocks. In our approach, macropore networks are extracted using established methods, while the microporosity is characterised through segmented phase classification and incorporated into the model as Darcy cells. Effectively, Darcy cells capture the micro scale connectivity variations that are missing in the macroscopic networks. This dual entity model thus incorporates both the conventional macroscopic pore structure and the critical flow pathways present in the under-resolved microporous regions. The proposed workflow is rigorously validated by comparing the permeability estimates with direct numerical simulation (DNS) results and experimental measurements. Our findings demonstrate that this hybrid approach reliably reproduces fluid flow behaviour in complex porous media while significantly reducing computational demands, offering a promising tool for advanced groundwater modelling and water resource management.</description>

      <title>Stability of acoustic streaming jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of a steady Eckart streaming jet that is acoustically forced at one end of a closed cylindrical cavity and impinges the wall at the other end, where a recirculation forms. This configuration generically represents industrial processes where acoustic forcing offers a contactless means of stirring or controlling confined flows. Successfully doing so, however, requires sufficient insight into the topology of the acoustically forced flow. This raises the question of whether the base acoustic streaming jet is stable and, when not, of which alternative states emerge. Using Linear Stability Analysis (LSA) and three-dimensional nonlinear simulations, we identify the instability mechanisms and determine the nature of the bifurcations that ensue. We show that the ratio $C_R$ between the cavity and the maximum beam radii determines the dominant unstable mode. For $4 \leq C_R \leq 6$, a non-oscillatory perturbation rooted in the jet impingement triggers a supercritical bifurcation. For $C_R = 3$, the flow destabilises through a subcritical non-oscillatory bifurcation. Further reducing $C_R$ increases the shear within the flow, and gradually relocates the instability in the shear layer between impingement-induced vortices: for $C_R = 2$, an unstable travelling wave grows out of a subcritical bifurcation, which becomes supercritical for $C_R=1$. For each geometry, the nonlinear 3D simulations validate the LSA, identify the saturated nonlinear state and its stability. This study offers fundamental insight into the stability of acoustically-driven flows in general, but also opens possible pathways to either induce turbulence acoustically, or to avoid it in realistic configurations.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of flow instability control by metamaterial subsurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow instabilities within a fluid flow can cause laminar-to-turbulent transition over surfaces. These instabilities can result from upstream, wake-generating disturbances, leading to increased drag and turbulence-induced energy losses. Flow control strategies can address these issues through active methods, requiring energy input, or passive systems, which operate without added input. Here, we present a passive approach to flow control using embedded phononic metamaterials to alter vortex instability development, without changing the outer-surface's texture, roughness or compliance. Experiments confirm that our subsurface can suppress vortex growth at target frequencies, demonstrating the potential for energy-efficient flow management with phononic subsurfaces.</description>

      <title>Response of magnetic particle to rotating magnetic field in viscoelastic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rotational dynamics of a freely suspended ferromagnetic particle in viscoelastic fluid subjected to a rotating magnetic field is studied by experiments and theory. Our result reveals that when the characteristic relaxation time of the fluid is much smaller than the inverse critical field frequency, the particle's rotation behavior aligns with that in Newtonian fluids. Increasing the relaxation time enhances the time-averaged rotation frequency of the particle that undergo asynchronous rotation. Moreover, the critical frequency is shown to scale linearly with the magnetic field intensity and inversely with the fluid's zero-shear viscosity. Our work is expected to guide precise manipulation of ferromagnetic particles in biomedical systems where viscoelastic environments dominate.</description>

      <title>A novel microfluidic method to produce monodisperse micrometer bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel microfluidic method to produce quasi-monodisperse bubbles with diameters from tens to very few microns. A gaseous rivulet flows over the shallow groove printed on a T-junction exit channel. The triple contact line delimiting the rivulet is pinned to the groove edges. The rivulet breaks up into bubbles much smaller than the exit channel. When operating under adequate conditions, the flow transitions toward a singular mode where the rivulet remains quasi-static and emits bubbles smaller than the groove width. This allows the production of bubbles with diameters in the 3-5 $\mu$m range, which is preferable for relevant therapeutical applications.</description>

      <title>Vector Laplacian in Spherical Coordinates: An Unnoticed Typo in Landau and Lifshitz's Fluid Mechanics Course</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A previously unaccounted fundamental typo has been discovered in Course of Theoretical Physics, vol. 6, by Landau and Lifshitz Fluid Mechanics, 1987, Pergamon, which corresponds to the same typo in the Russian original of this book. This concerns the first of the Navier-Stokes equations in spherical coordinates (15.21), which includes the radial component of the vector Laplacian, namely, an extra square in the denominator of the sine. This error migrates to secondary publications and can complicate theoretical studies related to the application of the Navier-Stokes equations, which the author of this note has encountered first-hand. This typo is not present in An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics by Batchelor. The present short article makes a detailed derivation of the radial component of the vector Laplacian from general principles to show what the corresponding Navier-Stokes equation should look like, and that the typo is indeed present. In addition, more compact equivalent forms of the Navier-Stokes equations in spherical coordinates are proposed.</description>

Abstract: The phenomenon of Taylor or shear-induced dispersion of a non-passive scalar field in a pulsatile pipe flow is investigated, accounting for the scalar field's influence on fluid density and transport coefficients. By employing multiple scale analysis, an effective one-dimensional, unsteady mixing problem for the scalar field is obtained, which includes the diffusion coefficient for shear-induced dispersion. The resulting governing equations are applicable to a range of scalar transport problems in pulsatile pipe flows.</description>

      <title>Moving mesh FSI approach for VIV simulation based on DG method with AMR technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vortex-induced vibration (VIV) remains a fundamental yet computationally
  challenging problem in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This study develops a moving mesh Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) algorithm within a Runge-Kutta
  Discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework. The viscous term in the compressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations is discretized using
  the high-order Interior Penalty Discontinuous Galerkin (IPDG)
  method. In addition to the above, key numerical advancements encompass
  the rigorous derivation of the Lax-Friedrichs (L-F) numerical flux formulation
  tailored for moving meshes, an enhanced AMR-driven nodal correction
  methodology designed for curved surface geometries,
  and the implementation of a ghost-node boundary condition treatment scheme
  to address dynamic mesh motion. Numerical validation proceeds through three phases:
  First, Couette flow simulations confirm the IPDG method's spatial
  convergence order. Subsequent analysis of unsteady flow past a cylinder
  demonstrate the AMR framework's efficacy in resolving vortex-dominated flow.
  Finally, six VIV benchmark cases are simulated using third-order IPDG discretization,
  establishing the proposed FSI algorithm's accuracy. Furthermore, synthetic jets (SJs) flow control is investigated through
  four frequency-variant SJs configurations. The results reveal that SJs can achieve completely
  VIV suppression at a low actuation frequency, while higher actuation
  frequencies reduce suppression efficiency due
  to the energy of the SJs is more in the form of acoustic wave.</description>
