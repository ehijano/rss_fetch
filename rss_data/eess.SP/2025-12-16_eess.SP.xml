      <title>Modeling and Analysis of VOC-based Interplant Molecular Communication Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) enables information transfer using particles inspired by biological systems. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are one of the most abundant and diverse classes of signaling molecules used by living or non-living objects. VOC-based MC holds great promise in developing long-range, bio-compatible communication systems capable of interfacing nano- and micro-scale devices. In this paper, we present a comprehensive end-to-end framework for VOC-based interplant MC from an ICT perspective. The communication process is divided into three stages: transmission (VOC biosynthesis and emission from leaves), channel propagation (advection-diffusion in turbulent wind via Gaussian puff for stress-induced VOC release and Gaussian plume for constitutive VOC release), and reception (VOC uptake and physiological response in the receiver plant). Each stage is analyzed by its attenuation and delay. Numerical results demonstrate that VOC-based channels exhibit low-pass behavior, with bandwidth and capacity heavily influenced by distance, wind velocity, and noise. Though the physical channel supports moderate frequencies, biological constraints at the transmitter restrict the end-to-end channel to slow-varying signals.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Deep Learning for Joint Turbulence and PE Estimation in Multi-Aperture FSO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of free-space optical (FSO) channels requires joint estimation of transmitter pointing errors, receiver angle-of-arrival (AoA) fluctuations, and turbulence-induced fading. However, existing literature addresses these impairments in isolation, since their multiplicative coupling in the received signal severely limits conventional estimators and prevents simultaneous recovery. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-aperture FSO receiver architecture that leverages spatial diversity across a lens array to decouple these intertwined effects. Building on this hardware design, we propose a hierarchical deep learning framework that sequentially estimates AoA, transmitter pointing error, and turbulence coefficients. This decomposition significantly reduces learning complexity and enables robust inference even under strong atmospheric fading. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near-MAP accuracy with orders-of-magnitude lower computational cost, and substantially outperforms end-to-end learning baselines in terms of estimation accuracy and generalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate practical joint estimation of these three key parameters, paving the way for reliable, turbulence-resilient multi-aperture FSO systems.</description>

      <title>A Sensing Dataset Protocol for Benchmarking and Multi-Task Wireless Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless sensing has become a fundamental enabler for intelligent environments, supporting applications such as human detection, activity recognition, localization, and vital sign monitoring. Despite rapid advances, existing datasets and pipelines remain fragmented across sensing modalities, hindering fair comparison, transfer, and reproducibility. We propose the Sensing Dataset Protocol (SDP), a protocol-level specification and benchmark framework for large-scale wireless sensing. SDP defines how heterogeneous wireless signals are mapped into a unified perception data-block schema through lightweight synchronization, frequency-time alignment, and resampling, while a Canonical Polyadic-Alternating Least Squares (CP-ALS) pooling stage provides a task-agnostic representation that preserves multipath, spectral, and temporal structures. Built upon this protocol, a unified benchmark is established for detection, recognition, and vital-sign estimation with consistent preprocessing, training, and evaluation. Experiments under the cross-user split demonstrate that SDP significantly reduces variance (approximately 88%) across seeds while maintaining competitive accuracy and latency, confirming its value as a reproducible foundation for multi-modal and multitask sensing research.</description>

      <title>Learning-Driven Dual-Line Laser Scanning for Fast and Accurate LEO Satellite Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and low-latency positioning is a key enabler for optical links with Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, where millisecond-level beam alignment is required to maintain reliable high-data-rate communication. This paper presents a learning-driven dual-line laser scanning framework for fast and precise satellite positioning. Unlike conventional Gaussian-beam acquisition systems that rely on multiple sequential beams or mechanical steering, the proposed approach employs two orthogonal line-shaped laser beams to perform structured optical scanning over the ambiguity region without any moving parts. A physics-based model incorporating atmospheric attenuation, turbulence, and MRR-based reflection is developed, and a data-driven neural estimator is trained to map received optical energy patterns to the satellite's two-dimensional position. Simulation results demonstrate that the learning-driven method achieves near-MAP accuracy with typical errors of 7-10 m and deterministic scanning time of 1-2 ms, while conventional two-stage Gaussian-beam schemes exhibit comparable errors but random sensing durations of up to 5 ms. The proposed framework therefore offers a favorable trade-off between positioning accuracy, computational complexity, and sensing latency, making it a practical candidate for next-generation optical LEO tracking systems.</description>

      <title>MRR-Based Line-Laser Scanning for Reliable Vehicular Positioning and Optical Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed vehicular environments require optical systems capable of joint sensing, positioning, and communication (JSPC) without mechanical tracking. Existing optical and integrated sensing-communication approaches often rely on point-source emitters or camera-based receivers, limiting spatial coverage and update rate under highway dynamics. This work introduces a new class of tracking-free optical JSPC systems that combine structured line-laser illumination with modulating retroreflector (MRR) arrays on vehicles. Two orthogonal line lasers perform synchronized longitudinal and transverse scanning to provide continuous, wide-area coverage across the roadway. A coverage-driven analytical framework models the coupling between beam divergence, scan geometry, and dwell-time allocation, enabling joint evaluation of sensing reliability and communication quality. An optimization scheme is developed to adapt scanning and divergence parameters for uniform coverage and power efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in spatial coverage uniformity, link stability, and reliability within a fixed scan period. These results establish a practical pathway toward scalable, turbulence-resilient optical architectures for next-generation vehicular JSPC networks.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna Array-Enhanced Null Steering: Performance Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional fixed-orientation antenna (FOA) arrays offer limited degrees of freedom (DoF) for flexible beamforming such as null steering. To address this limitation, we propose a new rotatable antenna array (RAA) architecture in this paper, which enables three-dimensional (3D) rotational control of an antenna array to provide enhanced spatial flexibility for null steering. To characterize its performance, we aim to jointly optimize the 3D rotational angles of the RAA, to maximize the beam gain over a given desired direction, while nulling those over multiple interference directions under zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming. However, this problem is non-convex and challenging to tackle due to the highly nonlinear expression of the beam gain in terms of the rotational angles. To gain insights, we first examine several special cases including both isotropic and directional antenna radiation patterns, deriving the conditions under which full beam gain can be achieved over the desired direction while meeting the nulling constraints for interference directions. These conditions clearly indicate that compared with FOA arrays, RAAs can significantly relax the angular separation requirement for achieving effective null steering. For other general cases, we propose a sequential update algorithm, that iteratively refines the 3D rotational angles by discretizing the 3D angular search space. To avoid undesired local optimum, a Gibbs sampling (GS) procedure is also employed between two consecutive rounds of sequential update for solution exploration. Simulation results verify our analytical results and show superior null-steering performance of RAAs to FOA arrays.</description>

      <title>Movable Access Points in Visible Light Communications: Opportunities, Challenges and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visible light communication (VLC) is expected to be a key component of future wireless networks due to its abundant license-free spectrum, inherent high-level security, and the already deployed lighting infrastructure. VLC performance, however, depends on device orientation and the availability of an unobstructed line-of-sight (LoS) link, with transmitter semi-angle and receiver field-of-view (FoV) further affecting alignment, coverage, and reliability. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can mitigate blockages, orientation issues, and mobility challenges, but their data rates remain far below those of direct LoS links. This article introduces the novel concept of movable access points (MAPs)-aided VLC systems, where dynamically repositioned APs provide new degrees of freedom to ensure LoS connectivity, and transmitter-receiver alignment while providing ultra-high data rates for mobile users. Simulation results show MAPs outperform RIS-aided, fixed-AP, and RIS-only VLC systems in dynamic environments. The article also outlines key challenges and future research directions, including integration with emerging wireless technologies.</description>

      <title>Robust Energy-Efficient Sleep-Mode Strategy for Multi-RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the explosive growth of data traffic and the ubiquitous connectivity of wireless devices, the energy demands of wireless networks have inevitably escalated. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising solution for 6G networks due to its energy efficiency (EE) and low cost, while cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) was proposed as an innovative network architecture without fixed cell boundaries to enhance these measures even further. However, existing studies often assume consistently high traffic loads, neglecting the dynamic nature of user demand. This can result in underutilized access points (APs) and unnecessary energy expenditure during low-demand periods. To tackle the challenge of EE in CF-mMIMO systems during low load periods, this paper proposes a novel energy-efficient transmission scheme that jointly coordinates active APs and multiple passive RISs. Specifically, a dynamic AP sleep-mode strategy is designed, where certain APs are selectively deactivated while nearby RISs assist in maintaining coverage. We formulate the EE maximization objective as a fractional programming problem and adopt the Dinkelbach method in conjunction with alternating optimization (AO) to iteratively solve the three coupled subproblems: (i) AP selection via a hybrid branch-and-bound (BnB) and greedy algorithm, (ii) transmit power optimization using a sequential convex approximation (SCA) method, initialized by a heuristic zero-forcing strategy, and (iii) RIS phase shift optimization using gradient projection. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves significantly higher EE than existing methods in both low and moderate user scenarios.</description>

      <title>WATOS: Efficient LLM Training Strategies and Architecture Co-exploration for Wafer-scale Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) imposes extreme demands on computation, memory capacity, and interconnect bandwidth, driven by their ever-increasing parameter scales and intensive data movement. Wafer-scale integration offers a promising solution by densely integrating multiple single-die chips with high-speed die-to-die (D2D) interconnects. However, the limited wafer area necessitates trade-offs among compute, memory, and communication resources. Fully harnessing the potential of wafer-scale integration while mitigating its architectural constraints is essential for maximizing LLM training performance. This imposes significant challenges for the co-optimization of architecture and training strategies. Unfortunately, existing approaches all fall short in addressing these challenges.
  To bridge the gap, we propose WATOS, a co-exploration framework for LLM training strategy and wafer-scale architecture. We first define a highly configurable hardware template designed to explore optimal architectural parameters for wafer-scale chips. Based on it, we capitalize on the high D2D bandwidth and fine-grained operation advantages inherent to wafer-scale chips to explore optimal parallelism and resource allocation strategies, effectively addressing the memory underutilization issues during LLM training. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM training framework Megatron and Cerebras' weight streaming wafer training strategy, WATOS can achieve an average overall throughput improvement of 2.74x and 1.53x across various LLM models, respectively. In addition, we leverage WATOS to reveal intriguing insights about wafer-scale architecture design with the training of LLM workloads.</description>

      <title>XR Capacity Enhancement through Multi-Connected XR Tethering Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended Reality (XR) applications have limited capacity in 5th generation-advanced (5G-A) cellular networks due to high throughput requirements coupled with strict latency and high reliability constraints. To enhance XR capacity in the downlink (DL), this paper investigates multi-connected XR tethering groups (TGrs), comprising an XR device and a cooperating 5G-A device. This paper presents investigations for two types of cooperation within XR TGr, i.e., selection combining (SC) and soft combining and their impact on the XR capacity of the network. These investigations consider joint hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) feedback processing algorithm and also propose enhanced joint Outer Loop Link Adaptation (OLLA) algorithm to leverage the benefits of multi-connectivity. These enhancements aim to improve the spectral efficiency of the network by limiting HARQ retransmissions and enabling the use of higher modulation and coding scheme (MCS) indices for given signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), all while maintaining or operating below than the target block error rate (BLER). Dynamic system-level simulation demonstrate that XR TGrs with soft combining achieve performance improvements of 23 - 42% in XR capacity with only XR users and 38-173% in the coexistence scenarios consisting of XR users and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) user. Furthermore, the enhanced joint OLLA algorithm enables similar performance gains even when only one device per XR TGr provides channel state information (CSI) reports, compared to scenarios where both devices report CSI. Notably, XR TGrs with soft combining also enhance eMBB throughput in coexistence scenarios.</description>

      <title>Comparing Stochastic and Ray-tracing Datasets in Machine Learning for Wireless Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning for wireless systems is commonly studied using standardized stochastic channel models (e.g., TDL/CDL/UMa) because of their legacy in wireless communication standardization and their ability to generate data at scale. However, some of their structural assumptions may diverge from real-world propagation. This paper asks when these models are sufficient and when ray-traced (RT) data - a proxy for the real world - provides tangible benefits. To answer these questions, we conduct an empirical study on two representative tasks: CSI compression and temporal channel prediction. Models are trained and evaluated using in-domain, cross-domain, and small-data fine-tuning protocols. Across settings, we observe that stochastic-only evaluation may over- or under-estimate performance relative to RT. These findings support a task-aware recipe where stochastic models can be leveraged for scalable pre-training and for tasks that do not rely on strong spatiotemporal coupling. When that coupling matters, pre-training and evaluation should be grounded in spatially consistent or geometrically similar RT scenarios. This study provides initial guidance to inform future discussions on benchmarking and standardization.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Packet-based Noise Signatures With Higher-Order Statistics for Anomaly Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note develops the first-ever noise-centric anomaly prediction method for a fused discrete-time signal. A Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) provides a time--frequency expansion in which structure and residual can be separated via orthogonal projection. Higher-Order Statistics (HOS), particularly the third-order cumulant (and its bispectral interpretation), quantify non-Gaussianity and nonlinear coupling in the extracted residual. Compact noise signatures are constructed and an analytically calibrated Mahalanobis detector yields a closed-form decision rule with non-central chi-square performance under mean-shift alternatives. Propositions and proofs establish orthonormality, energy preservation, Gaussian-null behavior of cumulants, and the resulting test statistics.</description>

      <title>Power Consumption and Energy Efficiency of Mid-Band XL-MIMO: Modeling, Scaling Laws, and Performance Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-band extra-large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO), emerging as a critical enabler for future communication systems, is expected to deliver significantly higher throughput by leveraging the extended bandwidth and enlarged antenna aperture. However, power consumption remains a significant concern due to the enlarged system dimension, underscoring the need for thorough investigations into efficient system design and deployment. To this end, an in-depth study is conducted on mid-band XL-MIMO systems. Specifically, a comprehensive power consumption model is proposed, encompassing the power consumption of major hardware components and signal processing procedures, while capturing the influence of key system parameters. Considering typical near-field propagation characteristics, closed-form approximations of throughput are derived, providing an analytical framework for assessing energy efficiency (EE). Based on the proposed framework, the scaling law of EE with respect to key system configurations is derived, offering valuable insights for system design. Subsequently, extensions and comparisons are conducted among representative multi-antenna technologies, demonstrating the superiority of mid-band XL-MIMO in EE. Extensive numerical results not only verify the tightness of the throughput analysis but also validate the EE evaluations, unveiling the potential of energy-efficient mid-band XL-MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Full-duplex Multi-tag Ambient Backscatter Communication Systems with I/Q Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) has emerged as a highly attractive paradigm for energy-efficient communication. Full-duplex multi-tag AmBC systems provide the scalability and efficient spectrum utilization essential for next generation Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. However, the presence of multiple tags, self-interference and hardware impairments such as inphase/quadrature (I/Q) imbalance, makes accurate channel estimation indispensable for efficient interference management. The large number of channel parameters and the presence of mirror images of each signal component necessitate careful design of the channel estimation phase to prevent performance degradation. In this work, we propose a novel three-stage training protocol and pilot-based estimation scheme that ensure signal orthogonality and successfully avoid error floors. We also propose two semi-blind estimators, one based on decision-directed (DD) criterion and the other on the expectation conditional maximization (ECM) framework. By exploiting both pilots and data symbols, these two estimators achieve higher estimation accuracy than pilot-based estimation, at the cost of additional complexity. Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for both types of estimation are also derived. The pilot-based estimator and the ECM estimator approach their respective CRBs, while the DD estimator performs mid-way between them.

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey of Channel Estimation Techniques for OTFS in 6G and Beyond Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a powerful wireless communication technology that is specifically designed to address the challenges of high-mobility scenarios and significant Doppler effects. Unlike conventional modulation schemes that operate in the time-frequency (TF) domain, OTFS projects signals to the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where wireless channels exhibit sparse and quasi-static characteristics. This fundamental transformation enables superior channel estimation (CE) performance in challenging propagation environments characterized by high-mobility, severe multipath effects, and rapidly time-varying channel conditions. This article provides a systematic examination of CE techniques for OTFS systems, covering the extensive research landscape from foundational methods to cutting-edge approaches. We present a detailed analysis of DD and TF domain CE techniques presented in the literature, including separate pilot, embedded pilot, and superimposed pilot approaches. The article encompasses various algorithmic frameworks including Bayesian learning, matching pursuit-based techniques, message passing algorithms, deep learning (DL)-based methods, and recent CE approaches. Additionally, we explore joint CE and signal detection (SD) strategies, the integration of OTFS with next-generation wireless systems including massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Critical implementation challenges are presented, including leakage suppression, inter-Doppler interference mitigation, impulsive noise handling, signaling overhead reduction, guard space requirements, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) management, beam squint effects, and hardware impairments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, several studies have explored the potential of magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) for the quantification of brain hemodynamics, oxygenation, and perfusion. Recent advances in simulation models and reconstruction frameworks have also significantly enhanced the accuracy of vascular parameter estimation. This review provides an overview of key vascular MRF studies, emphasizing advancements in geometrical models for vascular simulations, novel sequences, and state-of-the-art reconstruction techniques incorporating machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

      <title>Interference-Free RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Physical Layer Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted cell free massive MIMO (CFmMIMO) framework is designed to enhance physical layer security (PLS) and mitigate multi user (MU) interference in next generation wireless networks. A channel state information (CSI) based precoder is designed at the access point (AP) to suppress MU interference, enabling interference free reception for the legitimate users. To further enhance secrecy performance, we formulate a joint optimization problem that maximizes the secrecy sum rate using an alternating optimization (AO) framework, which iteratively updates the active beamforming at the AP, user power allocation, and the RIS phase shift matrix. The highly nonconvex problem is addressed under the Riemannian manifold optimization (RMO) framework and solved using a Riemannian Conjugate Gradient (RCG) algorithm for RIS phase shift design. Simulation results verify that the proposed framework effectively enhances the secrecy sum rate and eliminates interference, demonstrating its potential for secure and scalable CFmMIMO networks in dense wireless environments.</description>

      <title>From Nodes to Edges: Edge-Based Laplacians for Brain Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional graph signal processing (GSP) methods applied to brain networks focus on signals defined on the nodes. Thus, they are unable to capture potentially important dynamics occurring on the edges. In this work, we adopt an edge-centric GSP approach to analyze edge signals constructed from 100 unrelated subjects of the Human Connectome Project. Specifically, we describe structural connectivity through the lens of the 1-dimensional Hodge Laplacian, processing signals defined on edges to capture co-fluctuation information between brain regions. We demonstrate that edge-based approaches achieve superior task decoding accuracy in static and dynamic scenarios compared to conventional node-based techniques, thereby unveiling unique aspects of brain functional organization. These findings underscore the promise of edge-focused GSP strategies for deepening our understanding of brain connectivity and functional dynamics.</description>

      <title>Interference Mitigation Recommender System using U-Net Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the previous work on interference mitigation, this paper introduces a modular recommender system that automatically selects the most effective interference mitigation strategy based on the interference characteristics present in the received signal. The system integrates three key stages: an SPS classifier module, a SIR predictor, and a bank of specialized U-Net autoencoders designed for different interference conditions. The classification block identifies the parameters required for cancellation. The recommender then directs the signal to the appropriate mitigation model, optionally incorporating SIR-based decisions for scenarios where successive interference cancellation may be advantageous. Experiments conducted across diverse SIR levels and modulation environments show that the recommender strategy improves robustness and reduces BER compared to using any single mitigation method alone. The results demonstrate the potential of adaptive, model-selective architectures to enhance interference resilience in dynamic communication environments.</description>

      <title>On the Ability of Deep Learning to Detect Signals with Unknown Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many signal processing applications, including communications, sonar, radar, and localization, a fundamental problem is the detection of a signal of interest in background noise, known as signal detection [1] [2]. A simple version of this problem is the detection of a signal of interest with unknown parameters in Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). When the parameters defining the signal are not known, an optimal detector (in the Neyman-Pearson sense) does not exist. An upper bound on the performance of any detector is the matched filter, which implies perfect sample by sample knowledge of the signal of interest. In recent years Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have proven to be very effective at hypothesis testing problems such as object detection and image classification. This paper examines the application of DNN-based approaches to the signal detection problem at the raw I/Q level and compares them to statistically based approaches as well as the Matched Filter. These methods aim to maximize the Probability of Detection Pd while maintaining a constant Probability of False Alarm PF A. Two Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are trained and assessed on this signal detection problem, across three signal of interest models. A model was also trained on a unified dataset and assessed across all signals of interest.</description>

      <title>A new data weighted averaging algorithm to reduce tones in the signal band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital/Analog converters based on sigma-delta modulation are simple and unexpensive circuits featuring a signal bandwidth limited by speed constraints. Multi-bit modulators allow balancing complexity and speed by reducing the clock frequency and increasing the number of levels in the quantizer. In this case, the multi-bit digital to analog block (DAC) can reduce the performance of the entire system. Data Weighted Averaging (DWA) methods have been proposed to reduce the vulnerability to DAC errors at the cost of spurious tones in the signal band. This work analyzes the tone producing mechanism and proposes a modification of the DWA to remove spurious tones.</description>

      <title>Performance Limits of Hardware-Constrained THz Inter-Satellite MIMO-ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz inter-satellite links (THz-ISL) offer unprecedented bandwidth for future space networks but face fundamental constraints from onboard power and thermal budgets. This paper establishes theoretical performance limits for MIMO Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems under per-element constant-envelope (CE) transmission constraints. We demonstrate that hardware distortions -- specifically power amplifier nonlinearity, ADC quantization, and oscillator phase noise -- impose a capacity ceiling that cannot be overcome by increasing transmit power. A unified link budget framework integrates wideband beam squint, aperture pointing errors, and colored noise sources through a spectral consistency principle that ensures residual phase noise is counted exactly once across communication and sensing analyses. The sensing bounds are derived via the Whittle-Fisher Information Matrix under a Constant Acceleration kinematic model with jerk noise, yielding closed-form scaling laws: residual phase noise variance scales as $\alpha^{-1}$ while dynamic state-estimation error (DSE) variance scales as $\alpha^{-5}$ with pilot overhead $\alpha$. Numerical results show divergent MIMO scaling: sensing precision improves with array size ($\mathrm{RMSE} \propto 1/\sqrt{N_t N_r}$), while the critical SNR exhibits scale invariance regarding array size, implying that the distortion-limited transition point stabilizes regardless of the array scale. The steep $\alpha^{-5}$ DSE scaling creates an operationally infeasible region at $\alpha &lt; \alpha^* \approx 0.16$, where $\alpha^* = (C_{\mathrm{DSE}}/C_{\mathrm{PN}})^{1/4}$ -- a constraint-driven threshold under the adopted baseline for LEO operation. These findings provide design guidelines for hardware-efficient THz-ISL constellations.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Classification Algorithms for COVID19 Detection using Cough Acoustic Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.04872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The epidemic disease, called the new coronavirus (COVID19), firstly occurred in Wuhan, China in December 2019. COVID19 was announced as an epidemic by World Health Organization soon after. Some of the symptoms of this disease are fever, cough, shortness of breath and difficulty in breathing. In more severe cases, death may occur as a result of infection. The most significant question in fighting the pandemic and controlling the epidemic is the early diagnosis of COVID19(+) patients and the follow-up of these patients. Therefore, various diagnostic mechanisms are used. Additionally to the RT-PCR test, medical imaging methods have been utilized, especially in the detection of COVID19(+) patients. In this study, an alternative approach was proposed by using cough data, which is one of the most prominent symptoms of COVID19(+) patients. The cough acoustic public dataset on the Virufy website was used. The entire data was normalized using z-normalization technique. The performance of the features obtained via the 5-layer empirical mode decomposition method and the performances of different classifiers has been compared. As the classifier algorithm, 5 different algorithms were used. The highest accuracy and F1-score performances were obtained by using Ensemble-Bagged-Trees algorithm as 90.6% and 90.5%, respectively. On the other hand, other classification algorithms used in the study are Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis and k-Nearest Neigbors, respectively. According to the results obtained, choosing the right classifier algorithm provides high results. Thus, it is clear that using cough acoustic data, those with COVID19(+) can be detected easily and effectively.</description>

      <title>Car-following Models and Congestion Control with Followerstopper on a Ring-Road under Known Delay -- Examining Limit Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the IDM microscopic car-following model from a dynamical systems perspective, analyzing the effects of delay on congestion formation. Further, a case of mixed-autonomy is considered by controlling one car with Followerstopper in a ring road setting containing IDM vehicles as human drivers. Specifically, the stop-and-go waves phenomenon in idealized traffic from a dynamical systems perspective is examined. We show that Followerstopper-controlled vehicle is effective at eliminating emergent stop-and-go waves in the IDM traffic simulation. We show through simulation that the uniform flow manifold is unstable for the ring road simulation with IDM vehicles, and that replacing a single car with Followerstopper induces stability, allowing the cars to drive safely at a uniform speed. Additionally, the case of known delay is considered in a mixed-autonomy scenario. Our simulation result shows that while considering a known time delay, traffic waves emerge earlier than in the no-delay case. At the same time, a single-vehicle controlled using Followerstopper controller is able to prevent the emergence of traffic waves even in the presence of delay.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Community Detection in $h$-uniform Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the exact recovery threshold subject to preserving the privacy of connections in $h$-uniform hypergraphs. Privacy is characterized by the $(\epsilon, \delta)$-hyperedge differential privacy (DP), an extension of the notion of $(\epsilon, \delta)$-edge DP in the literature. The hypergraph observations are modeled through a $h$-uniform stochastic block model ($h$-HSBM) in the dense regime. We investigate three differentially private mechanisms: stability-based, sampling-based, and perturbation-based mechanisms. We calculate the exact recovery threshold for each mechanism and study the contraction of the exact recovery region due to the privacy budget, $(\epsilon, \delta)$. Sampling-based mechanisms and randomized response mechanisms guarantee pure $\epsilon$-hyperedge DP where $\delta=0$, while the stability-based mechanisms cannot achieve this level of privacy. The dependence of the limits of the privacy budget on the parameters of the $h$-uniform hypergraph is studied. More precisely, it is proven rigorously that the minimum privacy budget scales logarithmically with the ratio between the density of in-cluster hyperedges and the cross-cluster hyperedges for stability-based and Bayesian sampling-based mechanisms, while this budget depends only on the size of the hypergraph for the randomized response mechanism.</description>

      <title>Temporal parallelisation of continuous-time maximum-a-posteriori trajectory estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a parallel-in-time method for computing continuous-time maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) trajectory estimates of the states of partially observed stochastic differential equations (SDEs), with the goal of improving computational speed on parallel architectures. The MAP estimation problem is reformulated as a continuous-time optimal control problem based on the Onsager-Machlup functional. This reformulation enables the use of a previously proposed parallel-in-time solution for optimal control problems, which we adapt to the current problem. The structure of the resulting optimal control problem admits a parallel solution based on parallel associative scan algorithms. In the linear Gaussian special case, it yields a parallel Kalman-Bucy filter and a parallel continuous-time Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. These linear computational methods are further extended to nonlinear continuous-time state-space models through Taylor expansions. We also present the corresponding parallel two-filter smoother. The graphics processing unit (GPU) experiments on linear and nonlinear models demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a significant speedup in computations while maintaining the accuracy of sequential algorithms.</description>

      <title>SSAS: Cross-subject EEG-based Emotion Recognition through Source Selection with Adversarial Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals have long been applied in the field of affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs). Cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition has demonstrated significant potential in practical applications due to its suitability across diverse people. However, most studies on cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition neglect the presence of inter-individual variability and negative transfer phenomena during model training. To address this issue, a cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition through source selection with adversarial strategy is introduced in this paper. The proposed method comprises two modules: the source selection network (SS) and the adversarial strategies network (AS). The SS uses domain labels to reverse-engineer the training process of domain adaptation. Its key idea is to disrupt class separability and magnify inter-domain differences, thereby raising the classification difficulty and forcing the model to learn domain-invariant yet emotion-relevant representations. The AS gets the source domain selection results and the pretrained domain discriminators from SS. The pretrained domain discriminators compute a novel loss aimed at enhancing the performance of domain classification during adversarial training, ensuring the balance of adversarial strategies. This paper provides theoretical insights into the proposed method and achieves outstanding performance on two EEG-based emotion datasets, SEED and SEED-IV.

      <title>Impact analysis of hidden faults in nonlinear control systems using output-to-output gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networked control systems (NCSs) are vulnerable to faults and hidden malfunctions in communication channels that can degrade performance or even destabilize the closed loop. Classical metrics in robust control and fault detection typically treat impact and detectability separately, whereas the output-to-output gain (OOG) provides a unified measure of both. While existing results have been limited to linear systems, this paper extends the OOG framework to nonlinear NCSs with quadratically constrained nonlinearities, considering false-injection attacks that can also manipulate sensor measurements through nonlinear transformations. Specifically, we provide computationally efficient linear matrix inequality conditions and complementary frequency-domain tests that yield explicit upper bounds on the OOG of this class of nonlinear systems. Furthermore, we derive frequency-domain conditions for absolute stability of closed-loop systems, generalizing the Yakubovich quadratic criterion.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of networked control systems subject to multiplicative routing transformations that alter measurement pathways without directly injecting signals. Such transformations, arising from faults or adversarial actions, modify the feedback structure and can degrade performance while remaining stealthy. An $H_2$-norm framework is proposed to quantify the impact of these transformations by evaluating the ratio between the steady-state energies of performance and residual outputs. Equivalent linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulations are derived for computational assessment, and analytical upper bounds are established to estimate the worst-case degradation. The results provide structural insight into how routing manipulations influence closed-loop behavior and reveal conditions for stealthy multiplicative attacks.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in head-mounted wearable technology are revolutionizing the field of biopotential measurement, but the integration of these technologies into practical, user-friendly devices remains challenging due to issues with design intrusiveness, comfort, and data privacy. To address these challenges, this paper presents GAPses, a novel smart glasses platform designed for unobtrusive, comfortable, and secure acquisition and processing of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals. We introduce a direct electrode-electronics interface with custom dry soft electrodes to enhance comfort for long wear. An integrated parallel ultra-low-power RISC-V processor (GAP9, Greenwaves Technologies) processes data at the edge, thereby eliminating the need for continuous data streaming through a wireless link, enhancing privacy, and increasing system reliability in adverse channel conditions. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the designed prototype through validation in a number of EEG-based interaction tasks, including alpha waves, steady-state visual evoked potential analysis, and motor movement classification. Furthermore, we demonstrate an EEG-based biometric subject recognition task, where we reach a sensitivity and specificity of 98.87% and 99.86% respectively, with only 8 EEG channels and an energy consumption per inference on the edge as low as 121 $\mu J$. Moreover, in an EOG-based eye movement classification task, we reach an accuracy of 96.68% on 11 classes, resulting in an information transfer rate of 94.78 bit/min, which can be further increased to 161.43 bit/min by reducing the accuracy to 81.43%. The deployed implementation has an energy consumption of 40 $\mu J$ per inference and a total system power of only 12.4 mW, of which only 1.61% is used for classification, allowing for continuous operation of more than 22 h with a small 75 mAh battery.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayesian Inference for Multiple Extended Targets or Unresolved Group Targets Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15226v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a method for tracking multiple extended targets or unresolvable group targets in a clutter environment. Firstly, based on the Random Matrix Model (RMM), the joint state of the target is modeled as the Gamma Gaussian Inverse Wishart (GGIW) distribution. Considering the uncertainty of measurement origin caused by the clutters, we adopt the idea of probabilistic data association and describe the joint association event as an unknown parameter in the joint prior distribution. Then the Variational Bayesian Inference (VBI) is employed to approximately solve the non-analytical posterior distribution. Furthermore, to ensure the practicability of the proposed method, we further provide two potential lightweight schemes to reduce its computational complexity. One of them is based on clustering, which effectively prunes the joint association events. The other is a simplification of the variational posterior through marginal association probabilities. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulation and real data experiments, and we show that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and adaptability.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the use of adaptive kernel-based Cohen's class time-frequency distributions (CCTFDs) for cross-term suppression, this paper aims to explore novel adaptive kernel functions for denoising. We integrate Wiener filter principle and the time-frequency filtering mechanism of CCTFD to design the least-squares adaptive filter method in the Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) domain, giving birth to the least-squares adaptive filter-based CCTFD whose kernel function can be adjusted with the input signal automatically to achieve the minimum mean-square error denoising in the WVD domain. Some examples are also carried out to demonstrate that the proposed adaptive CCTFD outperforms some state-of-the-arts in noise suppression.</description>

      <title>Multiframe Detection via Graph Neural Networks: A Link Prediction Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13436v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-frame detection algorithms can effectively utilize the correlation between consecutive echoes to improve the detection performance of weak targets. Existing efficient multi-frame detection algorithms are typically based on three sequential steps: plot extraction via a relative low primary threshold, track search and track detection. However, these three-stage processing algorithms may result in a notable loss of detection performance and do not fully leverage the available echo information across frames. As to applying graph neural networks in multi-frame detection, the algorithms are primarily based on node classification tasks, which cannot directly output target tracks. In this paper, we reformulate the multi-frame detection problem as a link prediction task in graphs. First, we perform a rough association of multi-frame observations that exceed the low threshold to construct observation association graphs. Subsequently, a multi-feature link prediction network is designed based on graph neural networks, which integrates multi-dimensional information, including echo structure, Doppler information, and spatio-temporal coupling of plots. By leveraging the principle of link prediction, we unifies the processes of track search and track detection into one step to reduce performance loss and directly output target tracks. Experimental results indicate that, compared with traditional single-frame and multi-frame detection algorithms, the proposed algorithm improves the detection performance of weak targets while suppressing false alarms. Additionally, interpretable analysis shows that the designed network effectively integrates the utilized features, allowing for accurate associations between targets and false alarms.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Physically-Consistent Modeling of Reconfigurable Electromagnetic Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable electromagnetic structures (REMSs), such as reconfigurable reflectarrays (RRAs) or reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), hold significant potential to improve the spectral efficiency of wireless communication systems and the accuracy of wireless sensing systems. Even though several REMS modeling approaches have been proposed in recent years, the literature lacks models that are both computationally efficient and physically consistent. As a result, algorithms that control the reconfigurable elements of REMSs (e.g., the phase shifts of a RIS) are often built on simplistic and thus inaccurate models. To enable physically accurate REMS-parameter tuning, we present a new framework for efficient and physically consistent modeling of general REMSs. Our modeling method combines a circuit-theoretic approach with a new formalism that describes a REMS's interaction with the electromagnetic (EM) waves in its far-field region. Our modeling method enables efficient computation of the entire far-field radiation pattern for arbitrary configurations of the REMS reconfigurable elements once a single full-wave EM simulation of the non-reconfigurable parts of the REMS has been performed. The predictions made by our framework align with the physical laws of classical electrodynamics and model effects caused by inter-antenna coupling, non-reciprocal materials, polarization, ohmic losses, matching losses, influence of metallic housings, noise from low-noise amplifiers, and noise arising in or received by antennas. In order to validate the efficiency and accuracy of our modeling approach, we (i) compare our modeling method to EM simulations and (ii) conduct a case study involving an RRA that enables simultaneous multiuser beam- and null-forming using a new, computationally efficient, and physically accurate parameter tuning algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Embedded Dual-Learning Imaging Framework for Electrical Impedance Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a promising noninvasive imaging technique that reconstructs the spatial conductivity distribution from boundary voltage measurements. However, it poses a highly nonlinear and ill-posed inverse problem. Traditional regularization-based methods are sensitive to noise and often produce significant artifacts. Physics-Embedded learning frameworks, particularly Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), have shown success in solving such inverse problems under ideal conditions with abundant internal data. Yet in practical EIT applications, only sparse and noisy boundary measurements are available. Moreover, changing boundary excitations require the simultaneous training of multiple forward networks and one inverse network, which significantly increases computational complexity and hampers convergence. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Physics-Embedded Dual-Learning Imaging Framework for EIT. The dual-learning strategy is composed of a supervised CNN-based forward network, which learns to predict a discrete internal potential distribution under fixed Neumann-to-Dirichlet boundary conditions, and an unsupervised PINN-based inverse network, which reconstructs the conductivity by enforcing the governing PDE through discrete numerical differentiation of the predicted potentials. This decoupled architecture removes the need for smooth conductivity assumptions, reduces the number of forward networks required from $K$ to 1, and improves reconstruction robustness and efficiency under realistic measurement constraints.(https://github.com/XuanxuanYang/CNN-PINNframework.git)</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a powerful, compact electrocardiogram (ECG) classification algorithm for cardiac arrhythmia diagnosis that addresses the current reliance on deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in ECG analysis. This work aims to reduce the demand for deep learning, which often requires extensive computational resources and large labeled datasets. Our approach introduces an artificial neural network (ANN) with a simple architecture combined with advanced feature engineering techniques. A key contribution of this work is the incorporation of 17 engineered features that enable the extraction of critical patterns from raw ECG signals. By integrating mathematical transformations, signal processing methods, and data extraction algorithms, our model captures the morphological and physiological characteristics of ECG signals with high efficiency, without requiring deep learning. Our method demonstrates a similar performance to other state-of-the-art models in classifying 4 types of arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, sinus tachycardia, sinus bradycardia, and ventricular flutter. Our algorithm achieved an accuracy of 97.36% on the MIT-BIH and St. Petersburg INCART arrhythmia databases. Our approach offers a practical and feasible solution for real-time diagnosis of cardiac disorders in medical applications, particularly in resource-limited environments.</description>

Abstract: Intelligent spectrum management is crucial for improving spectrum efficiency and achieving secure utilization of spectrum resources. However, existing intelligent spectrum management methods, typically based on small-scale models, suffer from notable limitations in recognition accuracy, convergence speed, and generalization, particularly in the complex and dynamic spectrum environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel spectrum foundation model, termed SpectrumFM, establishing a new paradigm for spectrum management. SpectrumFM features an innovative encoder architecture that synergistically exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self-attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and enable robust representation learning. The model is pre-trained via two novel self-supervised learning tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, which leverage large-scale in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data to achieve comprehensive and transferable spectrum representations. Furthermore, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy is proposed to enable SpectrumFM to adapt to various downstream spectrum management tasks, including automatic modulation classification (AMC), wireless technology classification (WTC), spectrum sensing (SS), and anomaly detection (AD). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpectrumFM achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, adaptability, few-shot learning efficiency, and convergence speed, consistently outperforming conventional methods across multiple benchmarks. Specifically, SpectrumFM improves AMC accuracy by up to 12.1% and WTC accuracy by 9.3%, achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 in SS at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and enhances AD performance by over 10%.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Nonseparable Fractional Fourier Transform: Theory and Application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) generalizes the 1D Fourier transform, offering significant advantages in time-frequency analysis of non-stationary signals. To extend the benefits of the 1D FRFT to higher-dimensional signals, 2D FRFTs have been developed. However, existing 2D FRFTs, including the 2D separable FRFT (SFRFT), gyrator transform (GT), and coupled FRFT (CFRFT), face limitations such as lack of theoretical uniformity, inability to process nonseparable terms in 2D non-stationary signals, and failure to maintain a consistent 4D rotational relationship with the 2D Wigner distribution (WD). These shortcomings limit their performance in practical applications like radar, communications, and optical imaging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a more general 2D nonseparable FRFT (NSFRFT) with four degrees of freedom. The 2D NSFRFT incorporates the 2D SFRFT, GT, and CFRFT as special cases and maintains a generalized 4D rotational relationship with the 2D WD, ensuring geometric consistency in time-frequency analysis. We derive its essential properties and develop three discrete algorithms, including two fast algorithms with computational complexity $O(N^2 \log N)$. Numerical simulations and experiments validate the superior performance of the proposed NSFRFT in applications such as image encryption, decryption, filtering, and denoising.</description>

Abstract: Smart agriculture applications, integrating technologies like the Internet of Things and machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) into agriculture, hold promise to address modern challenges of rising food demand, environmental pollution, and water scarcity. Alongside the concept of the phytobiome, which defines the area including the plant, its environment, and associated organisms, and the recent emergence of molecular communication (MC), there exists an important opportunity to advance agricultural science and practice using communication theory. In this article, we motivate to use the communication engineering perspective for developing a holistic understanding of the phytobiome communication and bridge the gap between the phytobiome communication and smart agriculture. Firstly, an overview of phytobiome communication via molecular and electrophysiological signals is presented and a multi-scale framework modeling the phytobiome as a communication network is conceptualized. Then, how this framework is used to model electrophysiological signals is demonstrated with plant experiments. Furthermore, possible smart agriculture applications, such as smart irrigation and targeted delivery of agrochemicals, through engineering the phytobiome communication are proposed. These applications merge ML/AI methods with the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things enabled by MC and pave the way towards more efficient, sustainable, and eco-friendly agricultural production. Finally, the implementation challenges, open research issues, and industrial outlook for these applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Importance-Aware Robust Semantic Transmission for LEO Satellite-Ground Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite-ground semantic communication is anticipated to serve a critical role in the forthcoming 6G era. Nonetheless, task-oriented data transmission in such systems remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the dynamic nature of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) fluctuations and the stringent bandwidth limitations inherent to low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite channels. In response to these constraints, we propose an importance-aware robust semantic transmission (IRST) framework, specifically designed for scenarios characterized by bandwidth scarcity and channel variability. The IRST scheme begins by applying a segmentation model enhancement algorithm to improve the granularity and accuracy of semantic segmentation. Subsequently, a task-driven semantic selection method is employed to prioritize the transmission of semantically vital content based on real-time channel state information. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a stack-based, SNR-aware channel codec capable of executing adaptive channel coding in alignment with SNR variations. Comparative evaluations across diverse operating conditions demonstrate the superior performance and resilience of the IRST model relative to existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Distributed Deep Learning with RIS Grouping for Accurate Cascaded Channel Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) panels are envisioned as a key technology for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, providing a cost-effective means to enhance coverage and spectral efficiency. A critical challenge is the estimation of the cascaded base station (BS)-RIS-user channel, since the passive nature of RIS elements prevents direct channel acquisition, incurring prohibitive pilot overhead, computational complexity, and energy consumption. To address this, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based channel estimation framework that reduces pilot overhead by grouping RIS elements and reconstructing the cascaded channel from partial pilot observations. Furthermore, conventional DL models trained under single-user settings suffer from poor generalization across new user locations and propagation scenarios. We develop a distributed machine learning (DML) strategy in which the BS and users collaboratively train a shared neural network using diverse channel datasets collected across the network, thereby achieving robust generalization. Building on this foundation, we design a hierarchical DML neural architecture that first classifies propagation conditions and then employs scenario-specific feature extraction to further improve estimation accuracy. Simulation results confirm that the proposed framework substantially reduces pilot overhead and complexity while outperforming conventional methods and single-user models in channel estimation accuracy. These results demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach for 6G RIS-assisted systems.</description>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerges as a key enabler for next-generation applications such as smart cities and autonomous systems. Its integration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) unlocks new potentials for reliable communication and precise sensing in dynamic aerial environments. However, existing research predominantly treats UAVs as aerial base stations, overlooking their role as ISAC users, and fails to leverage large-scale antenna arrays at terrestrial base stations to enhance security and spectral efficiency. This paper propose a secure and spectral efficient ISAC framework for multi-UAV networks, and a two-stage optimization approach is developed to jointly design hybrid beamforming (HBF), artificial noise (AN) injection, and UAV trajectories. Aiming at maximizing the sum secrecy rate, the first stage employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize digital beamformers and trajectories, and the second stage decomposes the digital solution into analog and digital components via low-complexity matrix factorization. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity Analysis of Multi-Target Detection via Markovian and Hard-Core Multi-Reference Alignment</title>

Abstract: Motivated by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we study the sample complexity of the multi-target detection (MTD) problem, in which an unknown signal appears multiple times at unknown locations within a long, noisy observation. We propose a patching scheme that reduces MTD to a non-i.i.d. multi-reference alignment (MRA) model. In the one-dimensional setting, the latent group elements form a Markov chain, and we show that the convergence rate of any estimator matches that of the corresponding i.i.d. MRA model, up to a logarithmic factor in the number of patches. Moreover, for estimators based on empirical averaging, such as the method of moments, the convergence rates are identical in both settings. We further establish an analogous result in two dimensions, where the latent structure arises from an exponentially mixing random field generated by a hard-core placement model. As a consequence, if the signal in the corresponding i.i.d. MRA model is determined by moments up to order $n_{\min}$, then in the low-SNR regime the number of patches required to estimate the signal in the MTD model scales as $\sigma^{2n_{\min}}$, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the noise variance.</description>

      <title>A Review of Machine Learning for Cavitation Intensity Recognition in Complex Industrial Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavitation intensity recognition (CIR) is a critical technology for detecting and evaluating cavitation phenomena in hydraulic machinery, with significant implications for operational safety, performance optimization, and maintenance cost reduction in complex industrial systems. Despite substantial research progress, a comprehensive review that systematically traces the development trajectory and provides explicit guidance for future research is still lacking. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a thorough review and analysis of hundreds of publications on intelligent CIR across various types of mechanical equipment from 2002 to 2025, summarizing its technological evolution and offering insights for future development. The early stages are dominated by traditional machine learning approaches that relied on manually engineered features under the guidance of domain expert knowledge. The advent of deep learning has driven the development of end-to-end models capable of automatically extracting features from multi-source signals, thereby significantly improving recognition performance and robustness. Recently, physical informed diagnostic models have been proposed to embed domain knowledge into deep learning models, which can enhance interpretability and cross-condition generalization. In the future, transfer learning, multi-modal fusion, lightweight network architectures, and the deployment of industrial agents are expected to propel CIR technology into a new stage, addressing challenges in multi-source data acquisition, standardized evaluation, and industrial implementation. The paper aims to systematically outline the evolution of CIR technology and highlight the emerging trend of integrating deep learning with physical knowledge. This provides a significant reference for researchers and practitioners in the field of intelligent cavitation diagnosis in complex industrial systems.</description>

      <title>Aliasing in Near-Field Array Ambiguity Functions: a Spatial Frequency-Domain Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation communication and localization systems increasingly rely on extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays), which promise unprecedented spatial resolution and new functionalities. These gains arise from their inherent operation in the near field (NF) regime, where the spherical nature of the wavefront can no longer be ignored; consequently, characterizing the ambiguity function -- which amounts to the matched beam pattern -- is considerably more challenging. Implementing very wide apertures with half-wavelength element spacing is costly and complex. This motivates thinning the array (removing elements), which introduces intricate aliasing structures, i.e., grating lobes. Whereas prior work has addressed this challenge using approximations tailored to specific array geometries, this paper develops a general framework that reveals the fundamental origins and geometric behavior of grating lobes in near-field ambiguity functions. Using a local spatial-frequency analysis of steering signals, we derive a systematic methodology to model NF grating lobes as aliasing artifacts, quantifying their structure on the AF, and providing design guidelines for XL-arrays that operate within aliasing-safe regions. We further connect our framework to established far-field principles. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of the approach by deriving closed-form expressions for aliasing-free regions in canonical uniform linear arrays and uniform circular arrays.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Photonic Computing with an Electro-Optic Analog Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16515v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In neuromorphic photonic systems, device operations are typically governed by analog signals, necessitating digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC). However, data movement between memory and these converters in conventional von Neumann architectures incur significant energy costs. We propose an analog electronic memory co-located with photonic computing units to eliminate repeated long-distance data movement. Here, we demonstrate a monolithically integrated neuromorphic photonic circuit with on-chip capacitive analog memory and evaluate its performance in machine learning for in situ training and inference using the MNIST dataset. Our analysis shows that integrating analog memory into a neuromorphic photonic architecture can achieve over 26x power savings compared to conventional SRAM-DAC architectures. Furthermore, maintaining a minimum analog memory retention-to-network-latency ratio of 100 maintains &gt;90% inference accuracy, enabling leaky analog memories without substantial performance degradation. This approach reduces reliance on DACs, minimizes data movement, and offers a scalable pathway toward energy-efficient, high-speed neuromorphic photonic computing.</description>

      <title>Robust Simultaneous Multislice MRI Reconstruction Using Slice-Wise Learned Generative Diffusion Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging is a powerful technique for accelerating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions. However, SMS reconstruction remains challenging due to complex signal interactions between and within the excited slices. In this study, we introduce ROGER, a robust SMS MRI reconstruction method based on deep generative priors. Utilizing denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), ROGER begins with Gaussian noise and gradually recovers individual slices through reverse diffusion iterations while enforcing data consistency from measured k-space data within the readout concatenation framework. The posterior sampling procedure is designed such that the DDPM training can be performed on single-slice images without requiring modifications for SMS tasks. Additionally, our method incorporates a low-frequency enhancement (LFE) module to address the practical issue that SMS-accelerated fast spin echo (FSE) and echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences cannot easily embed fully-sampled autocalibration signals. Extensive experiments on both retrospectively and prospectively accelerated datasets demonstrate that ROGER consistently outperforms existing methods, enhancing both anatomical and functional imaging with strong out-of-distribution generalization. The source code and sample data for ROGER are available at https://github.com/Solor-pikachu/ROGER.</description>

      <title>KNN-MMD: Cross Domain Wireless Sensing via Local Distribution Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04783v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless sensing has recently found widespread applications in diverse environments, including homes, offices, and public spaces. By analyzing patterns in channel state information (CSI), it is possible to infer human actions for tasks such as person identification, gesture recognition, and fall detection. However, CSI is highly sensitive to environmental changes, where even minor alterations can significantly distort the CSI patterns. This sensitivity often leads to performance degradation or outright failure when applying wireless sensing models trained in one environment to another. To address this challenge, Domain Alignment (DAL) has been widely adopted for cross-domain classification tasks, as it focuses on aligning the global distributions of the source and target domains in feature space. Despite its popularity, DAL often neglects inter-category relationships, which can lead to misalignment between categories across domains, even when global alignment is achieved. To overcome these limitations, we propose K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD), a novel few-shot method for cross-domain wireless sensing. Our approach begins by constructing a help set using KNN from the target domain, enabling local alignment between the source and target domains within each category using MMD. Additionally, we address a key instability issue commonly observed in cross-domain methods, where model performance fluctuates sharply between epochs. Further, most existing methods struggle to determine an optimal stopping point during training due to the absence of labeled data from the target domain. Our method resolves this by excluding the support set from the target domain during training and employing it as a validation set to determine the stopping criterion. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/KNN-MMD .</description>

      <title>Score-Based Turbo Message Passing for Plug-and-Play Compressive Image Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Message passing algorithms have been tailored for compressive imaging applications by plugging in different types of off-the-shelf image denoisers. These off-the-shelf denoisers mostly rely on some generic or hand-crafted priors for denoising. Due to their insufficient accuracy in capturing the true image prior, these methods often fail to produce satisfactory results, especially in highly underdetermined scenarios. On the other hand, score-based generative modeling offers a promising way to accurately characterize the sophisticated image distribution. In this paper, by exploiting the close relation between score-based modeling and empirical Bayes-optimal denoising, we devise a message passing framework that integrates a score-based minimum mean squared error (MMSE) denoiser for compressive image recovery. Experiments on the FFHQ dataset demonstrate that our method strikes a significantly better performance-complexity tradeoff than conventional message passing, regularized linear regression, and score-based posterior sampling baselines. Remarkably, our method typically converges in fewer than 20 neural function evaluations (NFEs).</description>

      <title>RC-Gossip: Information Freshness in Clustered Networks with Rate-Changing Gossip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A clustered gossip network is considered in which a source updates its information over time, and end-nodes, organized in clusters through clusterheads, are keeping track of it. The goal for the nodes is to remain as fresh as possible, i.e., have the same information as the source, which we assess by the long-term average binary freshness metric. We introduce a smart mechanism of information dissemination which we coin rate-changing gossip (RC-Gossip). Its main idea is that gossiping is directed towards nodes that need it the most, and hence the rate of gossiping changes based on the number of fresh nodes in the network at a given time. While Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) analysis has been the norm in studying freshness of gossip networks, we present an equivalent way to analyze freshness using a renewal-reward-based approach. Using that, we show that RC-gossip significantly increases freshness of nodes in different clustered networks, with optimal cluster sizes, compared to traditional gossiping techniques.</description>

      <title>Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement: Architectural Design and Deployment Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new AI-based Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement (AVSE) system and presents a comparative performance analysis of different deployment architectures. The proposed AVSE system employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spectral feature extraction and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for temporal modeling, enabling robust speech enhancement through multimodal fusion of audio and visual cues. Multiple deployment scenarios are investigated, including cloud-based, edge-assisted, and standalone device implementations. Their performance is evaluated in terms of speech quality improvement, latency, and computational overhead. Real-world experiments are conducted across various network conditions, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, 4G, and 5G, to analyze the trade-offs between processing delay, communication latency, and perceptual speech quality. The results show that while cloud deployment achieves the highest enhancement quality, edge-assisted architectures offer the best balance between latency and intelligibility, meeting real-time requirements under 5G and Wi-Fi 6 conditions. These findings provide practical guidelines for selecting and optimizing AVSE deployment architectures in diverse applications, including assistive hearing devices, telepresence, and industrial communications.</description>

      <title>BioGAP-Ultra: A Modular Edge-AI Platform for Wearable Multimodal Biosignal Acquisition and Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for continuous physiological monitoring and human-machine interaction in real-world settings calls for wearable platforms that are flexible, low-power, and capable of on-device intelligence. This work presents BioGAP-Ultra, an advanced multimodal biosensing platform that supports synchronized acquisition of diverse electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals such as EEG, EMG, ECG, and PPG while enabling embedded AI processing at state-of-the-art energy efficiency. BioGAP-Ultra is a major extension of our previous BioGAP design aimed at meeting the rapidly growing requirements of wearable biosensing applications. It features (i) increased on-device storage (x2 SRAM, x4 FLASH), (ii) improved wireless connectivity (supporting up to 1.4 Mbit/s bandwidth, x4 higher than BioGAP), (iii) enhanced number of signal modalities (from 3 to 5) and analog input channels (x2). Further, it is accompanied by a real-time visualization and analysis software suite that supports the hardware design, providing access to raw data and real-time configurability on a mobile phone. Finally, we demonstrate the system's versatility through integration into various wearable form factors: an EEG-PPG headband consuming 32.8 mW, an EMG sleeve at 26.7 mW, and an ECG-PPG chestband requiring only 9.3 mW for continuous acquisition and streaming, tailored for diverse biosignal applications. To showcase its edge-AI capabilities, we further deploy two representative on-device applications: (1) ECG-PPG-based PAT estimation at 8.6 mW, and (2) EMG-ACC-based classification of reach-and-grasp motion phases, achieving 79.9 % $\pm$ 5.7 % accuracy at 23.6 mW. All hardware and software design files are also released open-source with a permissive license.</description>
