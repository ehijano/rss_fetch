      <title>Identifying Instabilities with Quantum Geometry in Flat Band Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absence of a well-defined Fermi surface in flat-band systems challenges the conventional understanding of instabilities toward Landau order based on nesting. We investigate the existence of an intrinsic nesting structure encoded in the band geometry (i.e. the wavefunctions of the flat band(s)), which leads to a maximal susceptibility at the mean-field level and thus determines the instability towards ordered phases. More generally, we show that for a given band structure and observable, we can define two vector fields: one which corresponds to the Bloch vector of the projection operator onto the manifold of flat bands, and another which is "dressed" by the observable. The overlap between the two vector fields, possibly shifted by a momentum vector $\boldsymbol{Q}$, fully determines the mean field susceptibility of the corresponding order parameter. When the overlap is maximized, so is the susceptibility, and this geometrically corresponds to "perfect nesting" of the band structure. In that case, we show that the correlation length of this order parameter, even for $\boldsymbol{Q}\neq \boldsymbol{0}$, is entirely characterized by a generalized quantum metric in an intuitive manner, and is therefore lower-bounded in topologically non-trivial bands. As an example, we demonstrate hidden nesting for staggered antiferromagnetic spin order in an exactly flat-band model, which is notably different from the general intuition that flat bands are closely associated with ferromagnetism. We check the actual emergence of this long-range order using the determinantal quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. Additionally, we demonstrate that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov-like state (pairing with non-zero center of mass momentum) can arise in flat bands upon breaking time-reversal symmetry, even if Zeeman splitting is absent.</description>

      <title>Quantum Otto engine mimicking Carnot near pseudotransitions in the 1D extended Hubbard model in the atomic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-dimensional extended Hubbard model (EHM) in the atomic limit has recently been found to exhibit a curious thermal pseudo-transition behavior, which closely resembles first and second-order thermal phase transitions. This phenomenon, occurring at half-filling, is influenced by the quantum phase transition between the alternating pair (AP) and paramagnetic (PM) phases at zero temperature. In this study, we leverage this anomalous behavior to investigate the performance of quantum many-body machines, using the EHM as the working substance. Our analysis reveals that the quantum Otto engine, when operating in the anomalous region, closely mimics the ideal Carnot engine. In this region, both the work output and thermal efficiency of the Otto engine increase, approaching the performance of a Carnot engine. This highlights the potential of many-body systems, such as the EHM, in enhancing quantum thermodynamic performance. Our findings demonstrate that, although the second law of thermodynamics prevents engines from surpassing Carnot efficiency, the Otto engine can operate remarkably close to this limit in the anomalous region, offering insights into new directions for future research on quantum thermodynamic cycles and working substances.</description>

      <title>Construction of Hopfion Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hopfions, three-dimensional topological solitons characterized by nontrivial Hopf indices, represent a fundamental class of field configurations that emerge across diverse areas of physics. Despite extensive studies of isolated hopfions, a framework for constructing spatially ordered arrays of hopfions, i.e., hopfion crystals, has been lacking. Here, we present a systematic approach for generating hopfion crystals with cubic symmetry by combining the Hopf map with rational mapping techniques. By superposing helical waves in $\mathbb{R}^4$, we construct hopfion crystals with tunable Hopf indices and controllable topology. We demonstrate simple cubic, facecentered cubic, and body-centered cubic hopfion crystals, and extend our framework to create crystals of more complex topological structures, including axially symmetric tori, torus links, and torus knots with higher Hopf indices. Our results provide a foundation for searching hopfions in real materials and studying their collective phenomena.</description>

      <title>Orbital-selective band modifications in a charge-ordered kagome metal LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the charge order in kagome lattice materials has attracted great interest due to the unique electronic structure features connected to kagome networks and the interplay between electron and lattice degrees of freedom. Recently, compounds with composition $Ln$Nb$_6$Sn$_6$ ($Ln$ = Ce-Nd, Sm, Gd-Tm, Lu, Y) appear as a new family of kagome metals, structurally analogous to $R$V$_6$Sn$_6$ ($R$ = Sc, Y, or rare earth) systems. Among them, LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$ emerges as a novel material hosting charge density wave (CDW) with a $\sqrt{3}$ $\times$ $\sqrt{3}$ $\times$ $3$ wave vector, akin to that in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$. Here, we employ high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and density functional theory calculations to systematically investigate the electronic properties of LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$. Our observation reveals the characteristic band structures of the "166" kagome system. A charge instability driven by Fermi surface nesting is decisively ruled out through an analysis of the interactions between van Hove singularities. Across the CDW transition, we observe orbital-selective band modifications, with noticeable evolutions of Lu 5$d$ and Sn 5$p$ electrons, while Nb 4$d$ electrons exhibit minimal change, suggesting that the Lu and Sn sites other than the Nb kagome lattice play a key role in the formation of CDW. Our findings substantiate a universal lattice-driven CDW mechanism rather than a charge-instability-driven one in the "166" kagome compounds, making it a distinct material class compared to other charge-ordered kagome systems, such as $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) and FeGe.</description>

      <title>Symmetrizing the Constraints -- Density Matrix Renormalization Group for Constrained Lattice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for constrained quantum lattice models that successfully implements the local constraints as symmetries in the contraction of the matrix product states and matrix product operators. Such an implementation allows us to investigate a quantum dimer model in DMRG with substantial circumference on cylindrical geometry for the first time in the literature. We have thence computed the ground state phase diagram of the quantum dimer model on triangular lattice, with the symmetry-breaking characteristics of the columnar solid phase and $\sqrt{12}\times\sqrt{12}$ valence bond solid phase fully captured, as well as the topological entanglement entropy of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid phase that extends to the RK point on non-bipartite lattice accurately revealed. Our DMRG algorithm on constrained quantum lattice models opens new opportunities for matrix and tensor-based algorithms for these systems that have immediate relevance towards the frustrated quantum magnets and synthetic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic ground state degeneracy of the ferro-antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on diamond-decorated lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions on diamond-decorated lattices. Tuning the exchange interactions to the boundary of the ferromagnetic phase, we analyze the models with two types of diamond units: distorted and ideal diamonds. In the distorted diamond model, flat bands in the magnon spectra indicate the localized states confined to small regions (`trapping cells') of the lattice. Remarkably, these trapping cells can host up to five and seven localized states for square and cubic lattices, respectively, leading to the macroscopic ground state degeneracy and high value of residual entropy. The problem of calculating ground state degeneracy reduces to that of non-interacting spins, whose spin value equal to half the number of localized magnons in the trapping cell. In contrast, ideal diamond models feature ground states composed of randomly distributed isolated diamond diagonal singlets immersed in a ferromagnetic background. Counting the ground state degeneracies here maps onto the percolation problem in 2D and 3D lattices. Our analysis shows that ideal diamond models possess even greater ground state degeneracy than their distorted counterparts. These findings suggest that synthesizing diamond-decorated-type compounds holds great promise for low-temperature cooling applications.</description>

      <title>Kondo effect in a two-dimensional electron gas in the Persistent Spin Helix regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kondo effect arises from many-body interactions between localized magnetic impurities and conduction electrons, affecting electronic properties at low temperatures. In this study, we investigate the Kondo effect within a two-dimensional electron gas subjected to strong spin-orbit coupling in and out of the persistent spin helix regime, a state characterized by a long spin lifetime due to SU(2) symmetry recovery. Using the numerical renormalization group approach, we systematically analyze the influence of spin-orbit coupling strength and the orientation of an external magnetic field on the spectral properties of the impurity. Our findings reveal an entrancing interplay between spin-orbit coupling and the magnetic field, leading to key phenomena such as splitting of the hybridization function, asymmetry in the spectral function of the impurity, and significant tunability of the Kondo temperature due to spin orbit. These results provide valuable insights into the delicate balance between spin-orbit and external magnetic field effects in quantum impurity systems, contributing to a deeper understanding of spintronics and quantum manipulation in low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Intertwined geometries in collective modes of two dimensional Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the time-dependent response of a correlated system can be inferred from its spectral correlation functions. As a textbook example, the zero sound collective modes of a Fermi liquid appear as poles of its particle-hole susceptibilities. However, the Fermi liquid's interactions endow these response functions with a complex analytic structure, so that this time/frequency relationship is no longer straightforward. We study how the geometry of this structure is modified by a nontrivial band geometry, via a calculation of the zero sound spectrum of a Dirac cone in two dimensions. We find that the chiral wavefunctions fundamentally change the analytic structure of the response functions. As a result, isotropic interactions can give rise to a variety of unconventional zero sound modes, that, due to the geometry of the functions in frequency space, can only be identified via time-resolved probes. These modes are absent in a conventional Fermi liquid with similar interactions, so that these modes can be used as a sensitive probe for the existence of Dirac points in a band-structure.</description>

      <title>Elementary Excitations, Melting Temperature and Correlation Energy in Wigner Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully quantum-mechanical study of the energy-momentum dispersion of running waves, spin-conserving neutral excitations, and spin-reversal neutral excitations in a spin-polarized two-dimensional Wigner crystal (WC). Our results show that the collective modes - plasmon and transverse sound - closely follow classical predictions even at surprisingly low values of $r_s \sim 8$. Furthermore, by extracting the shear modulus from the transverse sound speed, we find that quantum mechanical effects enhance the shear modulus at high densities, leading to a (Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young) melting temperature that exceeds the classical prediction. In addition, we apply the quasi-boson approximation to compute the correlation energy of the 2D WC based on its neutral excitation spectrum. While this approach underestimates the absolute correlation energy compared to quantum Monte Carlo results, it successfully captures the overall trend. These findings establish a robust quantum-mechanical foundation for understanding elementary excitations in Wigner crystals within low-dimensional electron systems and provide valuable theoretical insights for future experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Raman spectroscopic evidence for linearly dispersed nodes and magnetic ordering in the topological semimetal V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals are characterized by an electronic structure with linearly dispersed nodes and distinguished chirality, protected by broken inversion or time reversal symmetry. The intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ is proposed as a Weyl semimetal. In this study, we report polarization-resolved magnetic and electronic Raman scattering of this material, probing both the magnetic order and the electronic structure. The electronic scattering reveals a linear with frequency continuum of excitations, as the signature of electronic transitions within the proposed Weyl nodes in a two-dimensional electronic structure. Additionally, two-magnon excitations of V moments are observed near 15 meV in the magnetically ordered phase below 50 K. These excitations are well reproduced by calculations based on the Fleury-Loudon theory using spin wave exchange parameters derived from the neutron scattering data of this material and confirm the antiferromagnetic character of the order. These magnetic and electronic scattering, observed in the same spectra, provide independent spectroscopic evidence for a collinear antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal state in V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$.</description>

      <title>Spin bond order driven by extended repulsive interactions in doped graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the truncated-unity functional renormalization group (TUFRG) to study the many-body instabilities of correlated electrons in graphene doped near the van Hove singularity (VHS). The system is described by an extended Hubbard model including several Coulomb repulsions between neighboring sites. With the repulsion parameters, which have been proven to be suitable for low-energy consideration of graphene, we find a spin bond-ordered phase in the vicinity of the VHS. This phase gives way to a spin-density wave phase when involving a weak additional screening. The ground-state phase diagram is presented in the space of the doping level and the screening parameter. We describe in detail both of these spin-ordered states by using recently developed TUFRG + MF scheme, i.e., a combined approach of TUFRG and mean-field (MF) theory. The collinear states are energetically preferable in both cases of the spin bond order and the spin-density wave. But if the third-nearest neighbor hopping is absent, these spin orders become chiral. The band structures of two collinear spin-ordered states are presented, revealing the metallic behavior of the system.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic imaginary-time evolution in state-vector-based and shot-based simulations and on quantum devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaginary-time evolution, an important technique in tensor network and quantum Monte Carlo algorithms on classical computers, has recently been adapted to quantum computing. In this study, we focus on probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) algorithm and derive its formulation in the context of state-vector-based simulations, where quantum state vectors are directly used to compute observables without statistical errors. We compare the results with those of shot-based simulations, which estimate observables through repeated projective measurements. Applying the PITE algorithm to the Heisenberg chain, we investigate optimal initial conditions for convergence. We further demonstrate the method on the transverse-field Ising model using a state-of-the-art trapped-ion quantum device. Finally, we explore the potential of error mitigation in this framework, highlighting practical considerations for near-term digital quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Effective spin model with anisotropic exchange interactions for the spin-orbit coupled Hubbard model at half-filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in noncentrosymmetric materials is the source of incommensurate magnetic structures. In semiconductors, it drives the Rashba spin splitting and spin momentum locking, while in magnetic insulators based on transition metals, it induces anisotropic spin exchange interactions, like Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction which drive chiral magnetism and skyrmion formation. Here, we establish a direct connection between SOC and spin exchange interactions by deriving an effective spin model from the SOC Hubbard model at half-filling. Using a strong-coupling expansion up to fourth order, we identify Heisenberg, Ising-like, and ring exchange interactions, as well as a variety of four-body terms for realistic Hubbard parameters. These parameters constrain the relative strengths of spin interactions, providing a natural interpolation between metallic and insulating phases that host complex magnetic textures.</description>

      <title>Chiral magnetic excitations and domain textures of $g$-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) constitute a novel class of spin-compensated materials in which opposite-spin sublattices are connected by a crystal rotation, causing their electronic iso-energy surfaces to be spin-split. While cubic and tetragonal crystal symmetries tend to produce AMs in which the splitting of electronic iso-energy surfaces has $d$-wave symmetry, hexagonal AMs, such as CrSb and MnTe, are $g$-wave AMs. Here we investigate the purely magnetic modes and spin-textures of $g$-wave AMs and show that they are drastically different for easy-axial (CrSb) and easy-planar (MnTe) materials. We show that in CrSb the splitting of the chiral magnon branches possesses $g$-wave symmetry, with each branch carrying a fixed momentum-independent magnetic moment. The altermagnetic splitting is not affected by the easy-axial anisotropy and is the same as that in the nonrelativistic limit. The magnon splitting of MnTe, however, does not strictly possess $g$-wave symmetry due to its easy-planar anisotropy. Instead the magnetic moment of each branch becomes momentum-dependent, with a distribution that is of $g$-wave symmetry. To generalize the concept of the altermagnetic splitting beyond the nonrelativistic limit, we introduce alternative, directly observable splitting parameter which comprises both the magnon eigenenergy and its magnetic moment and possesses the $g$-wave symmetry in both easy-axial and easy-planar cases. The associated altermagnetic domain walls in easy-axial CrSb possess a net magnetization with an amplitude that depends on their orientation.</description>

      <title>Tunable Topological Phases in Multilayer Graphene Coupled to a Chiral Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupling photonic cavity fields to electronic degrees of freedom in 2D materials introduces an additional control knob to the toolbox of solid-state engineering. Here we demonstrate a subtle competition between cavity frequency and interlayer tunneling in graphene stacks that is responsible for topological phase transitions in light-matter Hilbert space and that cannot be captured by mean-field theory in vacuum. A systematic exploration of multilayer graphene heterostructures and stacking configurations in a chiral tHz cavity reveals that linear dispersion enhances the low-energy cavity-induced topological gap. In bilayer graphene, a displacement field drives the low-energy vacuum band from valley-Chern to Chern insulator, comprising a gate-tunable topological phase transition. Furthermore, we show that a chiral cavity breaks not only the time-reversal symmetry of bilayer graphene but also the inversion symmetry, which impacts its edge spectrum. Our findings pave the way for future control and engineering of graphene heterostructures with chiral cavity fields.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast switchable polar and magnetic orders by nonlinear light-matter interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An outstanding challenge in materials science and physics is the harnessing of light for switching charge order in e.g., ferroelectrics. Here we propose a mechanism through which electrons in ferroelectric bilayers excited with light cause ionic structural transitions. Using perturbation theory within a many-body formalism, we show that the ionic coupling is mediated by a resonant change in electronic occupation functions, ultimately governed by the quantum geometric tensor (QGT) of the ground state. Furthermore, we show that such transitions are generally accompanied by multiferroic order switching. We demonstrate two examples of light-induced structural and polarization switching under this mechanism using first-principle calculations on bilayer CrI$_{3}$ and MoTe$_{2}$. We show that the two materials can switch between atomic stackings with a light intensity threshold of only 10-100 GW/cm$^2$, a value 1-3 orders of magnitude lower than that required by direct light-ion coupling thanks to the superior efficiency of resonant light-electron coupling. Since such switching is fast, highly controllable, contactless, and reversible, it is promising for use in optically controlled nonvolatile memory, nanophotonics and polar electronics.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Rydberg Atom Arrays Meet Cavity-QED: Emergence of the Superradiant Clock Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom triangular arrays in an optical cavity serve as an ideal platform for understanding the interplay between geometric frustration and quantized photons. Using a large-scale quantum Monte Carlo method, we obtain a rich ground state phase diagram. Around half-filling, the infinite long-range light-matter interaction lifts the ground state degeneracy, resulting in a novel order-coexisted superradiant clock (SRC) phase that completely destroys the fragile order-by-disorder (OBD) phase observed in classical light fields. According to the Ginzburg-Landau theory, this replacement may result from the competition between threefold and sixfold clock terms. Similar to the spin supersolid, the clear first-order phase transition at the $Z_2$ symmetry line is attributed to the nonzero photon density, which couples to the threefold clock term. Finally, we discuss the low-energy physics in the dimer language and propose that cavity-mediated nonlocal ring exchange interactions may play a critical role in the rich physics induced by the attachment of cavity-QED. Our work opens a new arena of research on the emergent phenomena of quantum phase transitions in many-body quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity, Anomalous Hall Effect, and Stripe Order in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a unique superconducting phase in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene characterized by its simultaneous emergence with both the anomalous Hall effect and stripe charge order. The onset of stripe charge order is revealed through angle-resolved transport measurements, which show thermally activated insulating behavior along one axis and highly conductive transport along the orthogonal direction. Superconductivity develops exclusively along the high-conductivity axis, giving rise to a one-dimensional-like superconducting channel. This superconducting state exhibits first-order transitions under an out-of-plane magnetic field, consistent with a chiral order parameter that breaks time-reversal symmetry. Most remarkably, thermally driven superconducting transitions display pronounced hysteresis-an uncommon phenomenon that reflects the complex interplay among stripe formation, broken time-reversal symmetry, and superconductivity. Together, these results uncover a previously unidentified quantum phase: a chiral superconductor embedded within an anomalous Hall crystal.</description>

      <title>Landau-Lifshitz damping from Lindbladian dissipation in quantum magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As of now, the phenomenological classical Landau-Lifshitz (LL) damping of magnetic order is not conceptually linked to the quantum theory of dissipation of the Lindbladian formalism which is unsatisfactory for the booming research on magnetic dynamics. Here, it is shown that LL dynamics can be systematically derived from Lindbladian dynamics in a local mean-field theory for weak external fields. The derivation also extends the LL dynamics beyond the orientation $\vec{m}/|\vec{m}|$ to the length $|\vec{m}|$ of the magnetization. A key assumption is that the Lindbladian dissipation adapts to the non-equilibrium $H(t)$ instantaneously to lower its expectation value.</description>

      <title>Theory of excitonic order in kagome metals ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ and LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that kagome metals can feature an excitonic condensate of unconventional nature. Studying the recently discovered variants ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ and LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$ we identify electron and hole pockets due to a pair of van Hove singularities (vHS) close to the Fermi level, with an approximate spectral particle-hole symmetry. A significant fraction of the Fermi level density of states away from the vHS is removed by the onset of high temperature charge density wave order, and makes the bands more two-dimensional, setting the stage for the formation of excitons. We develop a two-orbital minimal tight-binding model of these materials which captures these features along with the sublattice support of the wavefunctions, and find $s$- or $d$-wave excitons depending on interaction parameters -- the latter of which exhibits either charge nematicity or time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) depending on strain, offering an explanation of recent STM and transport experiments. The presence of particle- and hole-type vHS, and the associated excitonic resonance, may be a common thread to understanding nematicity and TRSB in kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Solving fractional electron states in twisted MoTe$_2$ with deep neural network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of moir\'e materials, such as twisted transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), has created a fertile ground for discovering novel quantum phases of matter. However, solving many-electron problems in moir\'e systems presents significant challenges due to strong electron correlation and strong moir\'e band mixing. Recent advancements in neural quantum states hold the promise for accurate and unbiased variational solutions. Here, we introduce a powerful neural wavefunction to solve ground states of twisted MoTe2 across various fractional fillings, reaching unprecedented accuracy and system size. From the full structure factor and quantum weight, we conclude that our neural wavefunction accurately captures both the electron crystal at $\nu = 1/3$ and various fractional quantum liquids in a unified manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetism and spin physics are true quantum mechanical effects and their description usually requires multi reference methods and is often hidden in the standard description of molecules in quantum chemistry. In this work we present a twofold approach to the description of spin physics in molecules and solids. First, we present a method that identifies the single-particle basis in which a given subset of the orbitals is equivalent to spin degrees of freedom for models and materials which feature significant spin physics at low energies. We introduce a metric for the spin-like character of a basis orbital, of which the optimization yields the basis containing the optimum spin-like basis orbitals. Second, we demonstrate an extended Schrieffer-Wolff transformation method to derive the effective Hamiltonian acting on the subspace of the Hilbert space in which the charge degree of freedom of electron densities in the spin-like orbitals is integrated out. The method then yields an effective spin-bath Hamiltonian description for the system. This extended Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is applicable to a wide range of Hamiltonians and has been utilized in this work for model Hamiltonians as well as the active space Hamiltonian of molecular chromium bromide.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Ground State in Distorted Kagome Metal CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits superconductivity in close proximity to a density-wave (DW) like ground state at ambient pressure\cite{Liu:2024aa}, however details of the DW is still elusive. Using first-principles density-functional calculations, we found its ground state to be a $4\times2$ altermagnetic spin-density-wave (SDW) at ambient pressure, with an averaged effective moment of $\sim$1.7$\mu_B$/Cr. The magnetic long range order is coupled to the lattice, generating 4$a_0$ structural modulation. Multiple competing SDW phases are present and energetically close, suggesting strong magnetic fluctuation at finite temperature. The electronic states near Fermi level are dominated by Cr-3$d$ orbitals, and the kagome flat bands are closer to the Fermi level than those in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family in paramagnetic state. When external pressure is applied, the energy differences between competing orders and structural modulations are suppressed. Yet, the magnetic fluctuation remains present and important even at high pressure because the high-symmetry kagome lattice is unstable in nonmagnetic phase up to 30 GPa. Our results suggest the crucial role of magnetism to stabilize the crystal structure, under both ambient and high pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02105v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of interacting and disordered topological phases of coupled Kitaev wires, which may support further realistic applications of Majorana fermions. We develop a variety of analytical, mathematical and numerical methods for one and two-coupled wires, associated with a topological marker accessible from real-space correlation functions on the wire(s). We verify the stability of the topological superconducting phase and quantify disorder effects close to the quantum phase transitions, e.g. through two-point correlation functions or using a renormalization group (RG) analysis of disorder. We show for the first time that the double critical Ising (DCI) phase -- a fractional Majorana liquid characterized by a pair of half central charges and topological numbers -- is stabilized by strong interactions against disorder which respects the inversion symmetry between the wires (ie. parity conservation on each wire). In the presence of an inter-wire hopping term, the DCI phase turns into a protected topological phase with a bulk gap. We study the localization physics developing along the critical line for weaker interactions.</description>

      <title>Full distribution and large deviations of local observables in an exactly solvable current carrying steady state of a strongly driven XXZ chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10458v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current carrying steady states of interacting spin chains exhibit rich structures generated through an interplay of constraints from the Hamiltonian dynamics and those induced by the current. The XXZ spin chain when coupled to maximally polarizing Lindblad terms (with opposite signs on either ends) admits an exact solution for the steady state in a matrix product state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations and distributions of local spin observables in the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy per site and scaled cumulant generating functions (SCGF) for distributions of local observables in the XX limit (Ising anisotropy $\Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS solution in $\Delta&gt;0$ regime, to calculate numerically exact entropy, correlations, as well as full distributions of spin observables in large systems. In systems where $\Delta$ is a cosine of rational multiple of $\pi$, we can numerically exactly estimate the large system limit of the SCGF and the large deviation/rate functions of local-$z$ magnetization. For these, we show that the deviations of the SCGF, calculated in finite systems, from the asymptotic large system size limit decay exponentially with system size, however the decay rate is a discontinuous function of $\Delta$. The $x$ magnetization density shows a double peak structure at $\Delta\lesssim 1$ suggesting short-range ferromagnetic ordering in the $x$ direction similar to what was reported for the ground state of XXZ chain.</description>

      <title>Exploring entanglement in finite-size quantum systems with degenerate ground state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an approach for characterizing non-local quantum correlations in spin systems with exactly or nearly degenerate ground states. Starting with linearly independent degenerate eigenfunctions calculated with exact diagonalization we generate a finite set of their random linear combinations with Haar measure, which guarantees that these combinations are uniformly distributed in the space spanned by the initial eigenstates. Estimating the von Neumann entropy of the random wave functions helps to reveal previously unknown features of the quantum correlations in the phases with degeneracy of the ground state. For instance, spin spiral phase of the quantum magnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is characterized by the enhancement of the entanglement entropy, which can be qualitatively explained by the changes in behaviour of two- and three-spin correlation functions. To establish the connection between our theoretical findings and real experiments we elaborate on the problem of estimating observables on the basis of the single-shot measurements of numerous degenerate eigenstates. By the example of solving a simple Ising model it is shown that digital quantum simulations performed with quantum computers can provide accurate description of the entanglement of the degenerate systems even in the presence of noise. We also discuss the ground state properties of degenerate fermionic and bosonic models, which can be useful for theoretical analysis of the experiments with ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Exact spectral properties of Fermi polarons in one-dimensional lattices: Anomalous Fermi singularities and polaron quasiparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the exact spectral function of a single impurity repulsively interacting with a bath of fermions in one-dimensional lattices, by deriving the explicit expression of the form factor for both regular Bethe states and the irregular spin-flip state and $\eta$-pairing state, based on the exactly solvable Lieb-Wu model. While at low impurity momentum $Q\sim0$ the spectral function is dominated by two power-law Fermi singularities, at large momentum we observe that the two singularities develop into two-sided distributions and eventually become anomalous Fermi singularities at the boundary of the Brillouin zone (i.e., $Q=\pm\pi$), with the power-law tails extending towards low energy. Near the quarter filling of the Fermi bath, we also find two broad polaron peaks at large impurity momentum, collectively contributed by many excited many-body states with non-negligible form factors. Our exact results of those distinct features in one-dimensional Fermi polarons, which have no correspondences in two and three dimensions, could be readily probed in cold-atom laboratories by trapping highly imbalanced two-component fermionic atoms into one-dimensional optical lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on our recent study [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c02052, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</description>

      <title>A controllable theory of superconductivity due to strong repulsion in a polarized band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can strong repulsive interactions be shown to give rise to pairing in a controllable way? We find that for a single flavor polarized band, there is a small expansion parameter in the low density limit, once the Bloch wavefunction form factor is taken into account. A perturbative expansion is possible, even if the interaction is much stronger than the Fermi energy $\epsilon_F$. We illustrate our method with a two-band model that is often used to describe multi-layer rhombohedral graphene and comment on the relationship with experiments.</description>

      <title>Strain tuning of charge density wave and Mott-insulating states in monolayer VTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monolayer vanadium ditelluride (VTe2) exhibits a 2\sqrt{3}*2\sqrt{3} charge density wave (CDW) order intertwined with a Mott-insulating state. However, the physical mechanisms driving the emergence of CDW order and Mott-insulating state are still not well understood. In this study, we systematically investigate the electronic band structure, phonon dispersion, and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) of monolayer VTe2 under applied biaxial strain. Our results reveal that the CDW phase is metastable in free-standing monolayer VTe2 and becomes stabilized under compressive strain below {\epsilon} = -2%. The formation of CDW order originates dominantly from strong EPC effect, rather than Fermi surface nesting. The narrowing of the bandwidth due to the CDW order, combined with the correlation effect of the V-3d orbital, collectively drives the system into a Mott-insulating state. Furthermore, we find that tensile strain suppresses CDW order and induces a superconducting state above a critical strain threshold ({\epsilon} = 2%). These findings enhance our understanding of correlation physics in monolayer VTe2 and provide a pathway for strain-engineered manipulation of quantum phases in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Driven Transition of Particles from Dispersive to Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) play a crucial role in condensed matter physics, offering an ideal platform to study strong correlation effects and enabling applications in diffraction-free photonics and quantum devices. However, the study and application of FB properties are susceptible to interference from dispersive bands. Here, we explore the impact of bond dissipation on systems hosting both flat and dispersive bands by calculating the steady-state density matrix. We demonstrate that bond dissipation can drive particles from dispersive bands into FBs and establish the general conditions for this phenomenon to occur. Our results demonstrate that dissipation can facilitate FB preparation, property measurement, and utilization. This opens a new avenue for exploring FB physics in open quantum systems, with potential implications for strongly correlated physics.</description>
