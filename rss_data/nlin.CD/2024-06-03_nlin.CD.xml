      <title>Synchronization of two coupled phase oscillators in the time-delayed second-order Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the impact of time delay on two coupled phase oscillators within the second-order Kuramoto model, which is relevant to the operations of real-world networks that rely on signal transmission speed constraints. Our analytical and numerical exploration shows that time delay can cause multi-stability within phase-locked solutions, and the stability of these solutions decreases as inertia increases. In addition to phase-locked solutions, we discovered non-phase-locked solutions that exhibit periodic and chaotic behaviors, depending on the amount of inertia and time delay. Our results suggest that this system has the potential to create patterns similar to epileptic seizures.</description>

      <title>Chaotic fields behave universally out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chaotic dynamics is always characterized by swarms of unstable trajectories, unpredictable individually, and thus generally studied statistically. It is often the case that such phase-space densities relax exponentially fast to a limiting distribution, that rules the long-time average of every observable of interest. Before that asymptotic timescale, the statistics of chaos is generally believed to depend on both the initial conditions and the chosen observable. I show that this is not the case for a widely applicable class of models, that feature a phase-space (`field') distribution common to all pushed-forward or integrated observables, while the system is still relaxing towards statistical equilibrium or a steady state. This universal profile is determined by both leading and first subleading eigenfunctions of the transport operator (Koopman or Perron-Frobenius) that maps phase-space densities forward or backward in time.</description>

      <title>Attractor Memory for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting: A Chaos Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) tasks, an increasing number of models have acknowledged that discrete time series originate from continuous dynamic systems and have attempted to model their dynamical structures. Recognizing the chaotic nature of real-world data, our model, \textbf{\textit{Attraos}}, incorporates chaos theory into LTSF, perceiving real-world time series as observations from unknown high-dimensional chaotic dynamic systems. Under the concept of attractor invariance, Attraos utilizes non-parametric Phase Space Reconstruction embedding and the proposed multi-scale dynamic memory unit to memorize historical dynamics structure and predicts by a frequency-enhanced local evolution strategy. Detailed theoretical analysis and abundant empirical evidence consistently show that Attraos outperforms various LTSF methods on mainstream LTSF datasets and chaotic datasets with only one-twelfth of the parameters compared to PatchTST.</description>

      <title>Active particle motion in Poiseuille flow through rectangular channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a point-like active particle suspended in fluid flow through a straight channel. For this particle-fluid system, we derive a constant of motion for a general unidirectional fluid flow, and apply it to an approximation of Poiseuille flow through channels with rectangular cross-sections. We obtain a $4$D nonlinear conservative dynamical system with one constant of motion and a dimensionless parameter describing the ratio of maximum flow speed to intrinsic active particle speed. Applied to square channels, we observe a diverse set of active particle trajectories with variations in system parameters and initial conditions which we classify into different types of swinging, trapping, tumbling and wandering motion. Regular (periodic/quasiperiodic) motion as well as chaotic active particle motion are observed for these trajectories and quantified using largest Lyapunov exponents. We explore the transition to chaotic motion using Poincar\'e maps and show ``sticky" chaotic tumbling trajectories that have long transients near a periodic state. We briefly illustrate how these results extend to rectangular cross-sections with width/height ratio larger than one. Outcomes of this work may have implications for dynamics of natural and artificial microswimmers in experimental microfluidic channels that typically have rectangular cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Faster entanglement driven by quantum resonance in many-body kicked rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum resonance in the paradigmatic kicked rotor system is a purely quantum effect that ignores the state of underlying classical chaos. In this work, it is shown that quantum resonance leads to superlinear entanglement production. In $N$-interacting kicked rotors set to be at quantum resonance, entanglement growth is super-linear until a crossover timescale $t^*$, beyond which growth slows down to a logarithmic form with superimposed oscillations. By mapping positional interaction to momentum space and analytically assessing the linear entropy, we unravel the mechanism driving these two distinct growth profiles. The analytical results agree with the numerical simulations performed for two- and three-interacting kicked rotors. The late time entanglement oscillation is sensitive to changes in scaled Planck's constant with a high quality factor suitable for high precision measurements. These results are amenable to an experimental realization on atom optics setup.</description>

      <title>Spread and Spectral Complexity in Quantum Spin Chains: from Integrability to Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore spread and spectral complexity in quantum systems that exhibit a transition from integrability to chaos, namely the mixed-field Ising model and the next-to-nearest-neighbor deformation of the Heisenberg XXZ spin chain. We corroborate the observation that the presence of a peak in spread complexity before its saturation, is a characteristic feature in chaotic systems. We find that, in general, the saturation value of spread complexity post-peak depends not only on the spectral statistics of the Hamiltonian, but also on the specific state. However, there appears to be a maximal universal bound determined by the symmetries and dimension of the Hamiltonian, which is realized by the thermofield double state (TFD) at infinite temperature. We also find that the time scales at which the spread complexity and spectral form factor change their behaviour agree with each other and are independent of the chaotic properties of the systems. In the case of spectral complexity, we identify that the key factor determining its saturation value and timescale in chaotic systems is given by minimum energy difference in the theory's spectrum. This explains observations made in the literature regarding its earlier saturation in chaotic systems compared to their integrable counterparts. We conclude by discussing the properties of the TFD which, we conjecture, make it suitable for probing signatures of chaos in quantum many-body systems.</description>
