      <title>Deep-learning mitigation of foregrounds and beam effects in 21-cm intensity mapping using hybrid frequency differencing and PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 21-cm intensity mapping (IM) is a powerful technique to probe the large-scale distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) and extract cosmological information such as the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. A key challenge lies in recovering the faint HI signal from bright foregrounds and frequency-dependent beam effects, which can compromise traditional cleaning methods like principal component analysis (PCA) by removing part of the cosmological signal. Deep-learning approaches have recently been proposed to mitigate these effects by learning mappings between contaminated and true cosmological signals. Building upon our previous work~\citep{2024PhRvD.109f3509S} on the frequency-differencing (FD) method, this study extends the framework to systematically compare FD-based and PCA-based UNet reconstructions using realistic simulations that include foregrounds and beam convolution. We find that both approaches perform comparably without beam or with a Gaussian beam, but under a realistic cosine beam they systematically underestimate the large-scale cross-correlation power spectrum, particularly for $k&lt;0.1 h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. To address this limitation, we explore a hybrid approach in which the UNet is trained with two input channels, one constructed from FD and the other from PCA cleaning, allowing the network to simultaneously exploit the strengths of both inputs. This two-channel strategy achieves superior performance, maintaining the cross-correlation power spectrum close to unity on large scales under a cosine beam, improving by 5-8% relative to either FD-based or PCA-based UNet alone. These results demonstrate that providing complementary FD and PCA information to a single deep network is an effective route to robust HI reconstruction, laying the groundwork for precision BAO measurements with future low-redshift 21 cm IM surveys.</description>

      <title>Implications of the Two-Component Dark Energy Model for Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark energy plays a crucial role in the evolution of cosmic expansion. In most studies, dark energy is considered a single dynamic component. In fact, multi-component dark energy models may theoretically explain the accelerated expansion of the universe as well. In our previous research, we constructed the $w_{\rm{n}}$CDM ($n=2, 3, 5$) models and conducted numerical research, finding strong observational support when the value of n is small. Based on our results, both the $\chi^2$ and Akaike information criterion (AIC) favor the $w_{\rm{2}}$CDM model more than the $w_0w_{\rm{a}}$CDM model. However, previous studies were limited to two equal-component dark energy models, failing to consider the component proportions as variables. Therefore, we will further explore the $w_{\rm{2}}$CDM model. To simplify the model, we fix $w = -1$ in one component and set the other component to $w_{\rm{de2}}$, varying the proportions of both components in the population. Under different $w_{\rm{de2}}$, we obtain the one-dimensional distribution of ${H}_{0}$ with respect to $f_{\rm{de2}}$. Further fitting reveals the evolution of ${H}_{0}$ under varying $w_{\rm{de2}}$ and $f_{\rm{de2}}$. We also perform the same operation on $\chi^2$. To evaluate the error of fitting, we introduce two indicators, $\text{R}^{2}_{\text{adj}}$ and MAPE, to quantify the fitting ability of our models. We find that when $w_{\rm{de2}}$ is less than -1, ${H}_{0}$ increases with the decrease of $w_{\rm{de2}}$ and the increase of $f_{\rm{de2}}$, effectively alleviating ${H}_{0}$ tension. For $\chi^2$, it still prefers the $\Lambda$CDM model, and the $w_{\rm{2}}$CDM model will decrease significantly when it approaches the $\Lambda$CDM model. The excellent performance of $\text{R}^{2}_{\text{adj}}$ and MAPE further proves that our model has an outstanding fitting effect and extremely high reliability.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal processes in standard big bang nucleosynthesis: III. Reactions with slow nuclei and the overall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper completes a series of our works on non-thermal nuclear processes in big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) started in JCAP05(2008)010 (Part I) and 05(2009)001 (Part II). The processes are triggered by non-Maxwellian particles naturally born in the main BBN reactions. Half of these reactions generate fast particles k^+ (= n,p,t,3He,alpha). The other half, being radiative capture processes, produce slow nuclei k^- (= d,t,3He,7Li,7Be) which can undergo (k^-,n) reactions with neutrons having large cross sections. The particle production rate R_k, thermalization time tau_k, and effective number density n_k are determined. It is shown that the values of n_k at the Universe temperatures T &gt; 65 keV can exceed the number densities of Maxwellian 7Li and 7Be ions. To clarify the overall non-Maxwellian effect on BBN, both types of the non-Maxwellian particles are taken into account in the reaction network. Particular attention is paid to two-step sequential processes like p(n,gamma)d^-(n,gamma)t, d(p,gamma)3He^-(n,p)t, t(alpha,gamma)7Li^-(n,gamma)8Li, 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be^-(n,p)7Li, d(t,alpha)n^+(A,n)a_1a_2, and d(3He,alpha)p^+(A,p)a_1a_2 with (A,a_1,a_2) = 7Li,t,alpha) and (7Be,3He,alpha. It is obtained that the non-Maxwellian particles can selectively affect the element abundances, e.g., improve the prediction on 7Li/H by ~1.5% and at the same time leave unchanged the 4He abundance. The main conclusion however is that these particles are unable to significantly change the standard picture of BBN in general, and provide a pathway toward a solution of the cosmological lithium problem in particular.</description>

      <title>Origin of Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Milgromian Dynamics (MOND) has been particularly successful in predicting scaling relations for galactic systems, namely the baryonic Tully-Fisher for spirals, the Faber-Jackson for ellipticals and the Radial Acceleration Relation for late-type galaxies. Its essential tenet is the modification of the gravity law at low accelerations. Nevertheless, despite MOND's passed tests, the puzzle of the missing mass on galaxy clusters' scales still persists. One proposed scenario to complete this deficit and apply it further to cosmology is the so-called $\nu$HDM model. It is composed of a sterile neutrino and the MOND gravity. In this Ph.D. thesis, I have put forward this cosmological idea, conducting hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the $\nu$HDM structure formation. In the debut attempt, the $\nu$HDM model was proven capable of reproducing the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, imitating the same expansion history ($\Omega_m \approx$ 0.3 and $H_0 \approx$ 67.6 km/s/Mpc), reproducing the CMB phenomenology, while the cosmic web is nicely formed. In the next step, I have optimized the $\nu$HDM model using Bayesian statistics, re-branding it to opt-$\nu$HDM. I managed to optimally fit the angular power spectrum of the CMB calculated by \textit{Planck}, except its fourth peak, but the opt-$\nu$HDM cosmological parameters changed significantly with respect to its precursor, resulting in a much heavier cosmos, with $\Omega_m \approx$ 0.5 and $H_0 \approx$ 55.6 km/s/Mpc. Next, I explore the opt-$\nu$HDM expansion history, its structure formation and the resulting mass function. The appearance of the early-time structures, firstly in the $\nu$HDM model, as well as in the opt-$\nu$HDM model occurs quiet late, at $z\approx4$ and at $z\approx 5.5$, respectively. Although the resolution has improved from previous studies, the $\nu$HDM variants cannot explain easily the high-redshift galaxies, observed by JWST.</description>

      <title>Galaxy-Multiplet Clustering from DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient estimator for higher-order galaxy clustering using small groups of nearby galaxies, or multiplets. Using the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2, we identify galaxy multiplets as discrete objects and measure their cross-correlations with the general galaxy field. Our results show that the multiplets exhibit stronger clustering bias as they trace more massive dark matter halos than individual galaxies. When comparing the observed clustering statistics with the mock catalogs generated from the N-body simulation AbacusSummit, we find that the mocks underpredict multiplet clustering despite reproducing the galaxy two-point auto-correlation reasonably well. This discrepancy indicates that the standard Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model is insufficient to describe the properties of galaxy multiplets, revealing the greater constraining power of this higher-order statistic on galaxy-halo connection and the possibility that multiplets are specific to additional assembly bias. We demonstrate that incorporating secondary biases into the HOD model improves agreement with the observed multiplet statistics, specifically by allowing galaxies to preferentially occupy halos in denser environments. Our results highlight the potential of utilizing multiplet clustering, beyond traditional two-point correlation measurements, to break degeneracies in models describing the galaxy-dark matter connection.</description>

      <title>Viscous Dark Energy and Mass-Varying Dark Matter in Lyra Manifold: Cosmological Dynamics and Observational Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of a universe described by Lyra's geometry in the presence of dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM). Dark energy is modeled as a quintessence scalar field with bulk viscosity, while dark matter is allowed to interact with the scalar sector. The displacement vector field, arising naturally in Lyra's manifold, provides an additional geometric contribution. By employing dynamical system techniques, we analyze stability properties and late-time attractors. Our results indicate that viscosity and DE--DM interaction enrich the phase space structure and can help address both the cosmic acceleration and the coincidence problem. Furthermore, by performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis with recent observational datasets, we derive best-fit values for the model parameters that exhibit good consistency with current data.</description>

      <title>21 cm Cosmology Sensitivity to Small-Scale Structure: Warm vs Neutrino-Interacting Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $21\,$cm signal originating from Cosmic Dawn to the Epoch of Reionisation is highly sensitive to the processes governing star formation in the early universe as well as new physics. In this work, we focus on the imprint of non-cold dark matter (DM), which impacts the formation of the smallest halos. Our goal in particular is to clarify whether near-future radio telescopes such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (HERA), will be able to distinguish between free-streaming dark matter, specifically in the form of thermal warm DM (WDM), and collisional damping due to neutrino-DM ($\nu$DM) interactions giving rise to larger overdensities on small scales. For that purpose we first implement a mapping between the two models in terms of a cutoff scale and determine detection thresholds for the two DM models. Using Fisher matrix forecasts, we show that $\nu$DM interaction strengths down to $\sigma_{\nu{\rm DM}}\sim 3\times10^{-35}$ cm$^2$ could be probed by $21\,$cm cosmology when considering two populations of galaxies for a GeV mass DM. This would allow to either confirm or rule out a recent claimed preference for a non-zero $\nu$DM interaction in Lyman-$\alpha$ data. Furthermore, we find that HERA will not be able to distinguish between $\nu$DM and WDM. In the latter context, the threshold for detection of $\nu$DM interactions translates into WDM with mass up to $m_{\rm WDM}\sim 9$ keV that could be detected by HERA.</description>

      <title>Challenging the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM parametrization through rational expansions in view of DESI data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view of the new Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2025 results, we analyze three types of \emph{Pad\'e cosmology}, based on rational series making use of Pad\'e approximants over the equations of state, namely Pad\'e$^{\omega}$ (0,1) and Pad\'e$^{\omega}$ (1,1), plus a Pad\'e$^{q}$ (0,1), i.e., a rational expansion on the dark energy deceleration parameter, in which where the numerator and denominator orders are incorporated into the above brackets. These scenarios appear alternative dark energy parameterizations with respect to the well-known $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM model, claimed as the most viable model by DESI. Accordingly, we perform Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) analyses with the publicly available \texttt{CLASS} Boltzmann code, including the three Pad\'e cosmology, along with the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM standard pictures. To this end, we combine independent probes from high to low redshifts to obtain reliable constraints on the cosmological parameters of these models and compare them using statistical selection criteria. \emph{Our results show that Pad\'e cosmology is neither statistically excluded nor worse than the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM parametrization}. On the contrary, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) identifies Pad\'e$^{q}$ (0,1) as \emph{the best-fit model}, with weak evidence against the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM parameterization, while the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) provides \emph{strong evidence against the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM model, favoring Pad\'e (1,1)}. Based on our bounds, we further investigate the evolution of the squared sound speed, revealing that the Pad\'e$^{q}$ (0,1) and Pad\'e$^{\omega}$ (0,1) parameterizations exhibit enhanced stability compared with the other cases here considered and, therefore, describe robust alternatives for the cosmological background.</description>

      <title>Reporting a Deficit of Intrinsic NV Absorbers in Core-dominated, Radio-loud Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We searched the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph archive for ultraviolet spectra of 428 AGN to identify intrinsic NV absorption systems. We filtered out Type 2 AGN, blazars, and spectra that do not cover at least part of the velocity window from 5000 km/s blueward to 5000 km/s redward (hereafter, the ``associated'' region) of the NV emission line. This yielded 175 Type 1 quasars, 34 radio-loud, 133 radio-quiet, and eight unconstrained. Our survey uncovered 77 associated NV systems in the spectra of 48 of these low-redshift quasars. We consider the incidence of intrinsic absorbers as a function of quasar properties (optical, radio and X-ray). We find a statistically significant dearth of intrinsic NV systems in the spectra of the 34 radio-loud quasars (6%), compared to 29% of the 133 radio-quiet quasars containing at least one intrinsic system. Assuming intrinsic systems are equally likely to occur in radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars and the orientations of the two subsamples are comparable, there is a 0.1% probability of such a deficit occurring by chance in the radio-loud population. We propose that this deficit of systems is caused by orientation effects. FIRST radio images are available for 14 of the 33 radio-loud quasars. These show that only three of the 14 radio-loud quasars have lobe-dominated morphologies, whereas 11 of the 14 radio-loud quasars have compact radio morphologies, implying that these quasars are face on, and suggesting that clouds that produce NV absorption are rarely found along the polar axis.</description>

      <title>Impact of cosmic expansion on gravitational wave spectra from strongly supercooled first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the gravitational wave spectra from strongly supercooled first-order phase transitions, explicitly incorporating the evolution of the background metric across the transition from thermal inflation to radiation domination. We find that the spectral shape remains largely unchanged apart from a causality-induced super-horizon tail. However, in contrast to standard expectations, for slow transitions we show that the peak amplitude and frequency exhibit a weaker dependence on the transition rate $\beta$ than the usual scaling of $\propto \beta^{-2}$ and $\propto\beta$, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Cross-correlation of kSZ and continuity equation velocity reconstruction with photometric DESI LRGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last year, kinematic Sunyaev--Zel'dovich (kSZ) velocity reconstruction -- the measurement of the large-scale velocity field using the anisotropic statistics of the small-scale kSZ-galaxy overdensity correlation -- has emerged as a statistically significant probe of the large-scale Universe. In this work, we perform a 2-dimensional tomographic reconstruction using ACT DR6 CMB data and DESI legacy luminous red galaxies (LRGs). We measure the cross-correlation of the kSZ-reconstructed velocity $v^{\mathrm{kSZ}}$ with the velocity inferred from the continuity equation applied to the DESI LRGs $v^{\mathrm{cont}}$ at the $\sim 10 \sigma$ level, detecting the signal with an amplitude with respect to our theory of $b_v = 0.339\pm 0.034$. We fit a scale-dependent galaxy bias model to our measurement in order to constrain local primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{\mathrm{loc}}$, finding {$f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{\mathrm{loc}}=-180^{+61}_{-86}$} at 67\% confidence, with $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{\mathrm{loc}}$ consistent with zero at 95\% confidence. We also measure an auto spectrum at $2.1\sigma$ significance which provides a constraint on $b_v$ of $b_v=0.26_{-0.05}^{+0.11}$, which is consistent with the measurement from the cross spectrum. Our combined measurement is $b_v=0.33\pm0.03$, an $11\sigma$ measurement. We find a good fit of our model to the data in all cases. Finally, we use different ACT frequency combinations to explore foreground contamination, finding no evidence for foreground contamination in our velocity cross correlation. We compare to a similar measurement where $v^{\mathrm{kSZ}}$ is directly cross correlated with the large-scale galaxy field, and find signs of foreground contamination which is contained in the equal-redshift spectra.</description>

Abstract: We present updated cosmological constraints on axion-lepton interactions based on state-of-the-art computations of the thermal axion abundance. By combining Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI DR2, we derive improved limits on both lepton-flavor-conserving (LFC) and lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) axion couplings. Incorporating finite axion mass effects substantially strengthens the bounds for axion masses above 0.1 eV compared to those inferred from the $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraint alone. The bounds on the LFC axion-tau coupling and LFV axion couplings to tau and muon or electron are improved by several orders of magnitude and the lower bound on the axion decay constant may exceed $10^6$ and $10^8$ GeV, respectively, for axion masses above 1 eV. Our cosmological constraints on LFC axion couplings to muons and taus and LFV axion couplings to tau and muon or electron are stronger than all other constraints for masses above 0.3 eV. In particular, they are stronger than recent collider constraints from Belle-II on $\tau \rightarrow la$ decays, where $l=e$ or $\mu$. The collider constraints on $\mu \rightarrow ea$ decays are weaker than the cosmological constraints for axion masses above 100 eV. Our results are relevant for both the QCD axion and axion-like particles (ALPs).</description>

      <title>The effects of dark energy on the matter-gravity coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark energy perturbations are expected to modify the evolution of cosmological perturbations, producing observable effects on scalar perturbations and gravitational waves. We show that the effects of dark energy for a generic modified gravity model can be encoded in a momentum, space and polarization dependent effective matter-gravity coupling, in agreement with the results obtained in some specific theories, and that this is not just related to the effective Planck mass appearing in the action as a coefficient of the Ricci's scalar. Using appropriately defined effective energy tensors, we show that the method can be extended to include also the effects of higher order perturbations. The generality of this effective description of the effects of dark energy on cosmological perturbations gives a solid theoretical justification for the phenomenological approaches often used in the analysis of cosmological observations, allowing to understand the mapping between the results of phenomenological analysis of observational data and theoretical models. The momentum and polarization dependence of the effective gravitational coupling implies that the gravitational energy emitted by a binary coalescence can have an additional frequency and polarization dependence, due to the effects of dark energy perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We seek power-law Bianchi type I solutions for an inflationary universe in a model with one scalar field non-minimally coupled to three vector fields aligned along the three axes. As a result, we find four types of power-law solutions that are classified according to the number of non-vanishing vector fields. Moreover, we find that all these solutions are stable for certain conditions on the parameters (stability regions), which are described both quantitatively and qualitatively. The attractor property of these solutions is also confirmed by numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Divergence in tracing the flavors of astrophysical neutrinos: can JUNO help IceCube?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the flavor fractions $(\eta^{}_e , \eta^{}_\mu , \eta^{}_\tau)$ for ultrahigh-energy neutrinos originating from a remote astrophysical source by using their flavor ratios $(f^{}_e , f^{}_\mu , f^{}_\tau)$ observed at a neutrino telescope, and find that a potential divergence may appear in inferring the values of $\eta^{}_\mu$ and $\eta^{}_\tau$ as an unavoidable consequence of the approximate $\mu$-$\tau$ interchange symmetry of lepton flavor mixing. We illustrate such an effect by applying our formula to the IceCube all-sky neutrino flux data ranging from 5 TeV to 10 PeV in the naive assumption that the relevant sources have a common flavor composition. We show that only $\eta^{}_e$ and $\eta^{}_\mu + \eta^{}_\tau$ can be extracted from the measurements of $f^{}_e$, $f^{}_\mu$ and $f^{}_\tau$ if the $\mu$-$\tau$ flavor symmetry is exact, and the JUNO and Daya Bay precision antineutrino oscillation data will help a lot in this connection.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Bound State Perturbations Inside Black Holes and Isospectrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the bound state solutions for the polar perturbations in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. It is shown that for a given value of the spherical harmonic index $\ell$, there are a total of $\ell-1$ bound states for polar perturbations. We show both analytically and numerically that the spectrum of $\ell-2$ of these perturbations agrees identically with the spectrum of axial perturbations. Correspondingly, the isospectrality between the bound states of the axial and polar perturbations in the interior of the black hole does hold. This is significant since the effective potential is singular at the center of the black hole, and the existence of the isospectrality is far from obvious. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the additional mode found in the spectrum of polar perturbations is the algebraically special mode, which is the ground state of polar perturbations as well.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Evolution and Graceful Exit in Quartic Warm Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the full nonlinear dynamics of warm inflation driven by the quartic inflaton potential, avoiding any simplifying approximations. The thermal backreaction is incorporated through a dissipation coefficient that depends linearly on the temperature, and the model parameters are chosen to remain consistent with Planck observational constraints. By numerically integrating the complete set of three coupled, nonlinear differential equations that describe the evolution of the inflaton field, radiation energy density, and background expansion, we obtain an exact description of the system's dynamics. Our results reveal that, while transition to radiation domination is suppressed in the weak regime, the strong dissipative regime leads to a smooth and natural transition to a hot, radiation-dominated Universe, thereby confirming graceful-exit within warm inflation in the quartic scenario. The reheating temperature is extracted directly from the nonlinear evolution of warm inflation, yielding a temperature of approximately 10^13 GeV at the end of inflation, which cools to about 10^12 GeV near radiation-inflaton equality, whence the Universe transitions into a radiation-dominated era.</description>

      <title>A New Definition of Horndeski Theory and the Possibility of Multiple Scalar Field Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the single-field case, Horndeski provides the most general scalar-tensor theory with second-order field equations. By contrast, systematic multi-field extensions remain incomplete: while the general field equations for the bi-Horndeski case are known, a general action has not been established, and for cases with three or more fields, neither a general action nor general equations are available. We characterize Horndeski by two mild axioms: closure under invertible pure disformal transformations and the requirement that the theory includes the minimal Horndeski theory. Under this characterization, we recover the standard single-field action up to boundary terms and obtain a practical path to multi-field constructions. In particular, we show that antisymmetric structures, such as those identified by Allys, Akama, and Kobayashi, appear within this framework, and indicate that this viewpoint has the potential to account for features captured by known bi-Horndeski equations.</description>

      <title>Detectability of axion-like dark matter for different time-delay interferometry combinations in space-based gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the space-based gravitational wave detections, the axion-like dark matter would alter the polarization state of the laser link between spacecrafts due to the birefringence effect. However, current designs of space-based laser interferometer are insensitive to variations in the polarization angle. Thus, the additional wave plates are employed to enable the response of the axion-induced birefringence effect. We calculate and compare the sensitivities of different space-based detectors, accounting for three time-delay interferometry combinations, including Monitor, Beacon, and Relay. We find that the Monitor and Beacon combinations have better sensitivity in the high-frequency range, and the optimal sensitivity reaches $g_{a\gamma}\sim 10^{-13}\text{GeV}^{-1}$, while the Sagnac combination is superior in the low-frequency range. We also find that ASTROD-GW can cover the detection range of axion-like dark matter mass down to $10^{-20}\text{eV}$.</description>

      <title>LCS: A Learnlet-Based Sparse Framework for Blind Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blind source separation (BSS) plays a pivotal role in modern astrophysics by enabling the extraction of scientifically meaningful signals from multi-frequency observations. Traditional BSS methods, such as those relying on fixed wavelet dictionaries, enforce sparsity during component separation, but may fall short when faced with the inherent complexity of real astrophysical signals. In this work, we introduce the Learnlet Component Separator (LCS), a novel BSS framework that bridges classical sparsity-based techniques with modern deep learning. LCS utilizes the Learnlet transform: a structured convolutional neural network designed to serve as a learned, wavelet-like multiscale representation. This hybrid design preserves the interpretability and sparsity, promoting properties of wavelets while gaining the adaptability and expressiveness of learned models. The LCS algorithm integrates this learned sparse representation into an iterative source separation process, enabling effective decomposition of multi-channel observations. While conceptually inspired by sparse BSS methods, LCS introduces a learned representation layer that significantly departs from classical fixed-basis assumptions. We evaluate LCS on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating superior separation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods (average gain of about 5 dB on toy model examples). Our results highlight the potential of hybrid approaches that combine signal processing priors with deep learning to address the challenges of next-generation cosmological experiments.</description>

      <title>The Relationship Between Emission Line and Continuum Luminosity and the Baldwin Effect in Blazars. I. The Case of the Mg II {\lambda}2798 {\AA} Emission Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. This study investigates the relationship between the Mg II {\lambda}2798 {\AA} emission line and the 3000 {\AA} continuum luminosity, as well as the Baldwin Effect, in a sample of 40,685 radio-quiet (RQ) quasars and 441 Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs). Methods. We perform a comprehensive re-evaluation of the Mg II-3000 {\AA} correlation, explicitly accounting for dispersion introduced by AGN variability. After excluding &gt;3000 radio-loud sources, we employ a binning technique to mitigate variability effects, yielding a refined empirical relation. We also further examine the Non-Thermal Dominance (NTD) parameter, to investigate the dominant source of the continuum. Results. Our analysis reveals statistically significant differences in the slopes of the line-continuum luminosity relation between RQ quasars and FSRQs, with a parallel discrepancy in the Baldwin Effect. These findings imply either (1) intrinsic differences in the accretion disk spectra of RQ AGNs and FSRQs or (2) jet-induced continuum emission in FSRQs contributing to Broad Line Region (BLR) ionization. We also found that a substantial fraction of both RQ quasars (43.8\%) and blazars (55.5\%) exhibit NTD &lt; 1. For blazars, this suggests that the accretion disk alone cannot fully explain BLR ionization; while we interpret NTD &lt; 1 in radio-quiet quasars as a signature of several physical mechanisms: anomalies in the BLR structure (such as outflow or inflows), time lags between continuum and line variations, and the suppression of the UV continuum by a strong corona that diverts accretion power. Finally, we demonstrate that the Baldwin Effect emerges naturally from the line-continuum luminosity relationship, requiring no additional physical mechanism to explain its origin</description>

      <title>A Novel Density Profile for Isothermal Cores of Dark Matter Halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel analytic density profile for halos in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models, which accurately captures the isothermal-core configuration, i.e. where both the density and velocity dispersion profiles exhibit central plateaus in the halo innermost region. Importantly, the profile retains a simple and tractable functional form. We demonstrate analytically how our density profile satisfies the aforementioned conditions, with comparisons to other contemporary functional choices. We further validate the profile using idealized N-body simulations, showing that it provides excellent representations of both the density and velocity dispersion profiles across a broad range of evolutionary stages, from the early thermalization phase to the late core-collapse regime. As a result of its accuracy and simplicity, the proposed profile offers a robust framework for analyzing halo evolution in a variety of SIDM scenarios. It also holds practical utility in reducing simulation needs and in generating initial conditions for simulations targeting the deep core-collapse regime.</description>

      <title>Halo spin and orientation in Interacting Dark Matter Dark Energy Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the interaction between dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) has become a topic of interest in cosmology. Interacting dark matter-dark energy (IDE) models have a substantial impact on the formation of cosmological large-scale structures, which serve as the background for DM halo evolution. This impact can be examined through the shape and spin orientation of halos in numerical simulations incorporating IDE effects. In our work, we use the N-body simulation pipeline ME-GADGET to simulate and study the halo spin and orientation in IDE models. We found that in models where DM transfers into DE (IDE I), the alignment of halo shapes with the surrounding tidal field is enhanced, while the alignment of halo spins with the tidal field is decreased compared to $\Lambda$CDM. Conversely, in models where DE transfers into DM (IDE II), the opposite occurs. We have provided fitted functions to describe these alignment signals. Our study provides the foundation for more accurate modeling of observations in the future such as China Space Station Telescope.</description>

      <title>Structure Formation with Warm White Noise: Effects of Finite Number Density and Velocity Dispersion in Particle and Wave Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of density perturbations in dark matter, including the new combined effects of finite number density and non-zero velocity dispersion. Using a truncated BBGKY hierarchy, we derive analytical expressions for the dark matter power spectrum during radiation and matter domination. A component of warm white noise emerges in our analysis, which arises due to the finite number density and undergoes scale-dependent evolution because of the velocity dispersion. Although free streaming erases adiabatic initial perturbations on small scales, warm white noise persists below the free-streaming length and grows during matter domination, with growth suppressed below the dark matter Jeans length. Our calculated power spectra agree with $N$-body simulations in the linear regime and accurately predict halo mass functions in the nonlinear regime. Effects of warm white noise can emerge on observable quasi-linear scales for ultralight dark matter produced after inflation with a subhorizon correlation length. Our formalism is applicable to these scenarios (with de Broglie-scale quasi-particles), to cases in which dark matter includes macroscopic structures (such as primordial black holes), and to traditional warm and cold dark matter scenarios.</description>

      <title>Denoising weak lensing mass maps with diffusion model: systematic comparison with generative adversarial network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Removing the shape noise from the observed weak lensing field, i.e., denoising, enhances the potential of WL by accessing information at small scales where the shape noise dominates without denoising. We utilise two machine learning (ML) models for denosing: generative adversarial network (GAN) and diffusion model (DM). We evaluate the performance of denosing with GAN and DM utilising the large suite of mock WL observations, which serve as the training and test data sets. We apply denoising to 1,000 noisy mass maps with GAN and DM models trained with 39,000 mock observations. Both models can fairly well reproduce the true convergence map on large scales. Then, we measure cosmological statistics: power spectrum, bispectrum, one-point probability distribution function, peak and minima counts, and scattering transform coefficients. We find that DM outperforms GAN in almost all considered statistics and recovers the correct statistics down to small scales. For example, the angular power spectrum can be recovered with DM up to multipoles $\ell \lesssim 6000$ while the noise power spectrum dominates from $\ell \simeq 2000$. We also conduct stress tests on the trained model; denoising the maps with different characteristics, e.g., different source redshifts, from the training data. The performance degrades at small scales, but the statistics can still be recovered at large scales. Though the training of DM is more computationally demanding compared with GAN, there are several advantages: numerically stable training, higher performance in the reconstruction of cosmological statistics, and sampling multiple realisations once the model is trained. It has been known that DM can generate higher-quality images in real-world problems than GAN, the superiority has been confirmed as well in the WL denoising problem.</description>

Abstract: Axions are an elegant solution to the strong CP problem for particle physics and a promising dark matter candidate. They can convert into photons under a strong magnetic field, while magnetars with extreme magnetic fields are natural labs for axion detection. Radio telescopes can detect the radio emission from axion-photon conversion near magnetars. In this study, we have refined the calculation of axion-photon conversion and developed the matched filtering integration method to largely improve the signal-to-noise ratio. We validate our method using end-to-end simulation and real observational data from TMRT. A new constraint is set with only 687 seconds of observations with TMRT. Using 10 hours of observation with the high-frequency receiver in FAST or SKA, we can reach the theoretical coupling constant prediction for the axion mass range from 1$\mu$eV to 100$\mu$eV. We validate the possibility of axion detection with radio telescopes and avoid spectrum confusion.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Characterization of redMaPPer Galaxy Clusters with DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical galaxy cluster identification algorithms such as redMaPPer promise to enable an array of astrophysical and cosmological studies, but suffer from biases whereby galaxies in front of and behind a galaxy cluster are mistakenly associated with the primary cluster halo. These projection effects caused by irreducible photometric redshift uncertainty must be quantified to facilitate the use of optical cluster catalogues. We present measurements of galaxy cluster projection effects and velocity dispersion using spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our findings are as follows: we confirm that the fraction of redMaPPer putative member galaxies mistakenly associated with cluster haloes is richness dependent, being more than twice as large at low richness than high richness; we present the first spectroscopic evidence of an increase in projection effects with increasing redshift, by as much as 25 per cent from $z\sim0.1$ to $z\sim0.2$; moreover, we find qualitative evidence for luminosity dependence in projection effects, with fainter galaxies being more commonly far behind clusters than their bright counterparts; finally we fit the scaling relation between measured mean spectroscopic richness and velocity dispersion, finding an implied linear scaling between spectroscopic richness and halo mass. We discuss further directions for the application of spectroscopic datasets to improve use of optically selected clusters to test cosmological models.</description>

Abstract: The 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen is a promising probe of the early Universe, yet extracting astrophysical parameters from its power spectrum remains a major challenge. We present a beginner-friendly PyTorch pipeline for Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (MNRE), a Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) method that bypasses explicit likelihoods. Using 21cmFAST simulations, we show that MNRE can recover key astrophysical parameters such as the ionizing efficiency $\zeta$ and X-ray luminosity $L_X$ directly from power spectra. Our implementation prioritizes transparency and accessibility, offering a practical entry point for new researchers in 21-cm cosmology.</description>

      <title>Detecting Local and Integrated Relativistic Effects by Multi-Tracing a Single Galaxy Population in Harmonic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring relativistic effects on cosmological scales would provide further confirmation of the validity of general relativity in the still poorly tested condition of weak gravity. Despite their relevance, relativistic imprints in the distribution of galaxies on large scales have so far eluded detection, mainly because they are stronger on the largest cosmic scales, which are plagued by cosmic variance. Expanding on previous works, we study galaxy clustering by subdividing a galaxy population into two sub-samples -- bright and faint -- and we here focus on their two-point correlation function in harmonic space, i.e. via the angular power spectrum. Thanks to such a split in magnitude and by exploiting the multi-tracer technique, we are able to boost the impact of the relativistic contributions. We first focus on the leading relativistic contribution given by the Doppler effect and show that, with a carefully tailored luminosity cut, it can be detected. Then, we look at the sub-dominant effects predicted by general relativity and quantify how their statistical significance, as yet undetectable, varies with redshift binning and survey specifications. As case studies, we consider in our forecasts a bright galaxy sample at low redshift, an H$\alpha$ emission-line galaxy survey at intermediate redshifts, and high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Recoil and Suppression of Super Massive Black Hole Seeds in the Early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of gravitational-wave (GW) recoil on the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe. Forming 10^9 Solar Mass SMBHs by z=6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli2007,Lousto2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Population III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by approximately 20-30% by z=6 and creates a population of off-nuclear (``wandering'') BHs amounting to a few percent of the total. Observable consequences include spatial offsets approximately 0.1'' and line-of-sight velocity shifts approximately 10^2-10^3 km\s in a few-percent of high-redshift quasars.

      <title>Dust Attenuation of Lyman-Werner Feedback: Reassessing Early Super Massive Black Holes Seed Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dust shielding on Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation fields and its implications for supermassive black hole (SMBH) seed formation at high redshift. Using a custom-built semi-analytical model developed specifically for this study, we implement a simple dust shielding prescription that accounts for the absorption of LW photons by dust grains. We find that even modest dust enrichment can significantly reduce the effective LW radiation field, allowing H$_2$ cooling to persist in regions previously thought to be affected by LW feedback. This changes the conditions for seed formation, particularly for heavy seeds which require suppression of H$_2$ cooling. Our results suggest that dust shielding extends the redshift range and volume where heavy seeds can form, and significantly alters the relative importance of different seed populations. We discuss the implications for the formation of high-redshift SMBHs and future observations.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on nonphantom dynamical dark energy with DESI Data Release 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations: A 3$\sigma$+ lensing anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a 12-parameter cosmological model with non-phantom dynamical dark energy (NPDDE), where non-phantom implies that the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy (DE), $w(z)\geq-1$ for all redshifts $z$. Thus, the DE EoS covers the parameter space corresponding to the popular single scalar-field dark energy models, i.e., Quintessence. The cosmological model comprises 6 parameters of the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, and additionally the dynamical DE EoS parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$), the scaling of the lensing amplitude ($A_{\rm lens}$), sum of the neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu$), the effective number of non-photon relativistic degrees of freedom ($N_{\rm eff}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_s$). We derive constraints on the parameters by combining the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release (DR) 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements with cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra from Planck Public Release (PR) 4, CMB lensing data from Planck PR4 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6, uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae (SNe) data from the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 5 (DESY5) samples, and Weak Lensing (WL) data from DES Year 1. Our major finding is that with CMB+BAO+WL and CMB+BAO+SNe+WL, we find 3$\sigma$+ evidence for $A_{\rm lens} &gt;1$, indicating a higher than expected CMB lensing amplitude relative to the NPDDE prediction of unity. This implies that for cosmology to accommodate realistic quintessence-like dark energy models (as opposed to unrealistic phantom DE), one would also need to explain a relatively significant presence of the lensing anomaly.</description>

      <title>Efficient analytic approximation for small-scale non-cold relic perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a highly accurate analytic approximation for small-scale non-cold relic perturbations by solving the collisionless Boltzmann equation in the quasi-stationary regime. The approximation is implemented in CLASSIER (CLASS Integral Equation Revision), a modified version of the Boltzmann solver CLASS that replaces the traditional truncated Boltzmann hierarchy of non-cold relic multipoles with a small set of integral equations solved iteratively. Applying it to massive neutrinos yields a factor-of-two reduction in total runtime relative to CLASSIER without the approximation. Compared to standard CLASS runs (with $\ell_{\rm max}^{\rm NCDM}=40$ and no late-time massive neutrino fluid approximation) under the same precision setting, CLASSIER with this approximation is faster by a factor of 3-6. The approximation faithfully reproduces the late-time behavior of massive neutrino perturbations and preserves sub-$0.1\%$ accuracy in the matter power spectrum today up to comoving wavenumber $k=100\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. With this approximation, massive-neutrino perturbations are no longer the computational bottleneck on small scales for linear-theory predictions. The approach can be readily extendable to non-standard dark-matter models, and offers prospects for further efficiency gains in high-precision cosmological analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent analyses of low-redshift supernova and Cepheid data reveal localized shifts in the distance modulus, often interpreted as calibration anomalies or hints of new physics. We propose that these features may emerge naturally from environment-dependent modifications to gravity. In particular, we examine the Starobinsky \(f(R) = R + \lambda R^2\) model, which introduces a scalar degree of freedom that couples to ambient matter density and alters photon propagation in underdense regions. We derive the corresponding corrections to luminosity distance and show that they can reproduce the observed magnitude shifts without invoking discontinuities or empirical step functions. Statistical comparisons using AIC and BIC favor the Starobinsky framework over phenomenological models, supporting its role as a minimal, geometric explanation for emergent calibration transitions.</description>

      <title>Foreground removal in HI 21 cm intensity mapping under frequency-dependent beam distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping with single-dish experiments is a powerful approach for probing cosmology in the post-reionization epoch. However, the presence of bright foregrounds over four orders of magnitude stronger than the HI signal makes its extraction highly challenging. While all methods perform well when assuming a Gaussian beam degraded to the worst resolution, most of them degrade significantly in the presence of a more realistic beam model. In this work, we investigate the performance of SDecGMCA. This method extends DecGMCA to spherical data, combining sparse component separation with beam deconvolution. Our goal is to evaluate this method in comparison with established foreground removal techniques, assessing its ability to recover the cosmological HI signal from single-dish intensity mapping observations under varying beam conditions. We use simulated HI signal and foregrounds, covering the frequency ranges relevant to MeerKAT and SKA-Mid. The foreground removal techniques tested fall into two main categories: model-fitting methods (polynomial and parametric) and blind source separation methods (PCA, ICA, GMCA, and SDecGMCA). Their effectiveness is evaluated based on the recovery of the HI angular and frequency power spectra under progressively more realistic beam conditions. While all methods perform adequately under a uniform degraded beam, SDecGMCA remains robust when frequency-dependent beam distortions are introduced. In the oscillating beam case, SDecGMCA suppresses the spurious spectral peak at $k_\nu \sim 0.3$ and achieves $\lesssim 5\%$ accuracy at intermediate angular scales ($10 &lt; \ell &lt; 200$), outperforming other methods. Beam inversion, however, remains intrinsically unstable beyond $\ell \sim 200$, setting a practical limit on the method.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Fields in the Shapley Supercluster Core with POSSUM: Challenging Model Predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Faraday Rotation Measure (RM) Grids provide a sensitive means to trace magnetized plasma across a wide range of cosmic environments. We study the RM signal from the Shapley Supercluster Core (SSC), in order to constrain the magnetic field properties of the gas. The SSC region consists of two galaxy clusters A3558 and A3562, and two galaxy groups between them, at $z\simeq 0.048$. We combine RM Grid data with thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect data, obtained from the POSSUM pilot survey, and Planck, respectively. To robustly determine the gas density, its magnetic field properties, and their correlation, we study the RM scatter in the SSC region and its behavior as a function of distance to the nearest cluster/group. We compare observational results with semi-analytic Gaussian random field models and more realistic cosmological MHD simulations. With a sky-density of 36 RMs/deg$^{2}$, we detect an excess RM scatter of $30.5\pm 4.6 \, \mathrm{rad/m^2}$ in the SSC region. Comparing with models, we find an average magnetic field strength of 1-3 $\mu$G (in the groups and clusters). The RM scatter profile, derived from data ranging from 0.3-1.8 $r_{500}$ for all objects, is systematically flatter than expected compared to models, with $\eta&lt;0.5$ being favored. Despite this discrepancy, we find that cosmological MHD simulations matched to the SSC structure most closely align with scenarios where the magnetic field is amplified by the turbulent velocity in the intercluster regions on scales $\lesssim 0.8\,r_{500}$. The dense RM grid and precision provided by POSSUM allows us to probe magnetized gas in the SSC clusters and groups on scales within and beyond their $r_{500}$. Flatter-than-expected RM scatter profiles reveal a significant challenge in reconciling observations with even the most realistic predictions from cosmological MHD simulations in the outskirts of interacting clusters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In earlier companion papers, we showed that non-singular primordial black holes (PBHs) could account for all the dark matter (DM) over a significantly wider mass range compared to Schwarzschild PBHs. Those studies, mostly based on phenomenological metrics, are now extended by considering the quantum-corrected space-time recently proposed by Zhang, Lewandowski, Ma and Yang (ZLMY), derived from an effective canonical (loop) quantum gravity approach explicitly enforcing general covariance. Unlike the BHs considered earlier, ZLMY BHs are free from Cauchy horizons, and are hotter than their Schwarzschild counterparts. We show that this higher temperature boosts the evaporation spectra of ZLMY PBHs, tightening limits on their abundance relative to Schwarzschild PBHs and shrinking the asteroid mass window where they can constitute all the DM, a result which reverses the earlier trend, but rests on firmer theoretical ground. While stressing the potential key role of quantum gravity effects in addressing the singularity and DM problems, our study shows that working within a consistent theoretical framework can strongly affect observational predictions.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Variation of the QCD Interaction Scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07266v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laboratory and astrophysical tests of ''constant variation'' have so far concentrated on the dimensionless fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and on the electron or quark mass ratios $X_{e,q}=m_{e,q}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$, treating the QCD scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ as unchangeable. Certain beyond Standard Model frameworks, most notably those with a dark matter or dark energy scalar field $\phi$ coupling with the gluon field, would make $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ itself time dependent while leaving $\alpha$ and the electron mass untouched. Under the minimal assumption that this gluonic channel is the sole $\phi$ interaction, we recast state-of-the-art atomic clock comparisons into $\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}=(3.2 \pm 3.5) \times 10^{-17} \ \text{yr}^{-1}$ limits, translate the isotope yields of the 1.8-Gyr-old Oklo natural reactor into a complementary geophysical limit of $|\delta\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;2\times10^{-9}$ over that time span, corresponding to the linear drift limit $|\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;1\times10^{-18} \text{yr}^{-1}$, and show that the proposed $8.4$ eV $^{229}$Th nuclear clock would amplify a putative $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ drift by four orders of magnitude compared with present atomic clocks. We also obtain constraints from quasar absorption spectra and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis data.</description>

Abstract: The search for gamma-ray counterparts to gravitational-wave events with the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) requires accurate and robust background modeling. Previous CALET observing runs (O3 and O4) relied on averaged pre/post-event baselines or low-order polynomial fits, approaches that neglect correlated noise, temporal non-stationarity, and the propagation of background uncertainty into derived flux upper limits. These simplifications can lead to reduced sensitivity to faint or atypical transients. In this work, we present a novel Bayesian framework for background estimation based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression and change-point modeling. Our approach captures correlated structures in the detector background, quantifies predictive uncertainties, and propagates them into both detection statistics and Bayesian credible upper limits. We demonstrate, using archival CALET time-tagged event data and simulated signal injections, that our method improves sensitivity to weak short-duration bursts by up to an order of magnitude compared to traditional polynomial fits. This probabilistic background treatment enables a more physically robust interpretation of non-detections and offers a scalable, real-time compatible extension for future joint multi-messenger searches.
