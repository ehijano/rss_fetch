      <title>Understanding time-resolved images of AWAKE proton bunches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article details how images of proton microbunch trains obtained from streak camera measurements may differ from actual microbunch trains inside the plasma, at the plasma exit. We use the same procedure as when comparing simulation results with measurements: create a particle distribution at the plasma exit using particle-in-cell simulations, propagate it to the location of the measurement and add diagnostic apertures and instrument resolution. From comparing distributions, we identify that changes in microbunch divergence and/or dimensions along trains result in differences between the charge distribution in reality and in the measurement. Additionally, we observe that instrument resolution reduces the observed modulation depth, with more reduction for shorter microbunches.</description>

      <title>Radiative cooling induced coherent maser emission in relativistic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic plasmas in strong electromagnetic fields exhibit distinct properties compared to classical plasmas. In astrophysical environments, such as neutron stars, white dwarfs, AGNs, and shocks, relativistic plasmas are pervasive and are expected to play a crucial role in the dynamics of these systems. Despite their significance, both experimental and theoretical studies of such plasmas have been limited. Here, we present the first ab initio high-resolution kinetic simulations of relativistic plasmas undergoing synchrotron cooling in a highly magnetized medium. Our results demonstrate that these plasmas spontaneously generate coherent linearly polarised radiation (independently of the electron/positron ratio), in a wide range of parameters, via the electron cyclotron maser instability, with radiative losses altering the saturation of this instability. This enables the plasma to continously amplify coherent radiation for significantly longer durations of time. These findings highlight fundamental differences in the behaviour of relativistic plasmas in strongly magnetized environments and align with astronomical phenomena, such as pulsar emission and Fast Radio Bursts.</description>

      <title>Analytic solutions for the linearized first-order magnetohydrodynamics and implications for causality and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the linear-mode analysis performed near an equilibrium configuration in the fluid rest frame with a dynamical magnetic field perturbed on a constant configuration. We develop a simple and general algorithm for an analytic solution search that works on an order-by-order basis in the derivative expansion. This method can be applied to general sets of hydrodynamic equations. Applying our method to the first-order relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, we demonstrate that the method finds a complete set of solutions. We obtain two sets of analytic solutions for the four and two coupled modes with seven dissipative transport coefficients. The former set has been missing in the literature for a long time due to the difficulties originating from coupled degrees of freedom and strong anisotropy provided by a magnetic field. The newly developed method resolves these difficulties. We also find that the small-momentum expansions of the solutions break down when the momentum direction is nearly perpendicular to an equilibrium magnetic field due to the presence of another small quantity, that is, a trigonometric function representing the anisotropy. We elaborate on the angle dependence of the solutions and provide alternative series representations that work near the right angle. This identifies the origin of a discrepancy found in recent works. Finally, we discuss the issues of causality and stability based on our analytic solutions and recent developments in the literature.</description>

      <title>Material Barriers to the Diffusive Magnetic Flux in Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has identified objective (frame-indifferent) material barriers that inhibit the transport of dynamically active vectorial quantities (such as linear momentum, angular momentum and vorticity) in Navier-Stokes flows. In magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), a similar setting arises: the magnetic field vector impacts the evolution of the velocity field through the Lorentz force and hence is a dynamically active vector field. Here, we extend the theory of active material barriers from Navier-Stokes flows to MHD flows in order to locate frame-indifferent barriers to the diffusive transport of the magnetic field in turbulent two-dimensional and three-dimensional MHD flows. From this approach we obtain an algorithm for the automated extraction of such barriers from MHD turbulence data.</description>

      <title>Experimental Observation of Motion of Ions in a Resonantly Driven Plasma Wakefield Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show experimentally that an effect of motion of ions, observed in a plasma-based accelerator, depends inversely on the plasma ion mass. The effect appears within a single wakefield event and manifests itself as a bunch tail, occurring only when sufficient motion of ions suppresses wakefields. Wakefields are driven resonantly by multiple bunches, and simulation results indicate that the ponderomotive force causes the motion of ions. In this case, the effect is also expected to depend on the amplitude of the wakefields, experimentally confirmed through variations in the drive bunch charge.</description>

      <title>Relaxation model for a homogeneous plasma with spherically symmetric velocity space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the transport equations from the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation when the velocity space is spherically symmetric. The Shkarofsky's form of Fokker-Planck-Rosenbluth collision operator is employed in the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. A closed-form relaxation model for homogeneous plasmas could be presented in terms of Gauss hypergeometric2F1 functions. This has been accomplished based on the Maxwellian mixture model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that classic models such as two-temperature thermal equilibrium model and thermodynamic equilibrium model are special cases of our relaxation model and the zeroth-order Braginskii heat transfer model can also be derived. The present relaxation model is a nonequilibrium model based on the hypothesis that the plasmas system possesses finitely distinguishable independent features, without relying on the conventional near-equilibrium assumption.</description>

      <title>Global Stellarator Coil Optimization with Quadratic Constraints and Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most present stellarator designs are produced by costly two-stage optimization: the first for an optimized equilibrium, and the second for a coil design reproducing its magnetic configuration. Few proxies for coil complexity and forces exist at the equilibrium stage. Rapid initial state finding for both stages is a topic of active research. Most present convex coil optimization codes use the least square winding surface method by Merkel (NESCOIL), with recent improvement in conditioning, regularization , sparsity and physics objectives. While elegant, the method is limited to modeling the norms of linear functions in coil current. We present QUADCOIL, a fast, global coil optimization method that targets combinations of linear and quadratic functions of the current. It can directly constrain and/or minimize a wide range of physics objectives unavailable in NESCOIL and REGCOIL, including the Lorentz force, magnetic energy, curvature, field-current alignment, and the maximum density of a dipole array. QUADCOIL requires no initial guess and runs nearly $10^2\times$ faster than filament optimization. Integrating it in the equilibrium optimization stage can potentially exclude equilibria with difficult-to-design coils, without significantly increasing the computation time per iteration. QUADCOIL finds the exact, global minimum in a large parameter space when possible, and otherwise finds a well-performing approximate global minimum. It supports most regularization techniques developed for NESCOIL and REGCOIL. We demonstrate QUADCOIL's effectiveness in coil topology control, minimizing non-convex penalties, and predicting filament coil complexity with three numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Physics of the low momentum diffusivity regime in tokamaks and its experimental applicability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong $E\times B$ plasma flow shear is beneficial for reducing turbulent transport. However, traditional methods of driving flow shear do not scale well to large devices such as future fusion power plants. In this paper, we use a large number of nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations to study a novel approach to increase flow shear: decreasing the momentum diffusivity to make the plasma ``easier to push''. We first use an idealized circular geometry and find that one can obtain low momentum diffusivity at tight aspect ratio, low safety factor, high magnetic shear and low temperature gradient. This is the so-called Low Momentum Diffusivity (LMD) regime. To drive intrinsic momentum flux, we then tilt the flux surface, making it up-down asymmetric. In the LMD regime, this intrinsic momentum flux drives strong flow shear that can significantly reduce the heat flux and increase the critical temperature gradient. We also consider the actual experimental geometry of the MAST tokamak to illustrate that this strategy can be practical and create experimentally significant flow shear. Lastly, a preliminary prediction for the SMART tokamak is made.</description>

      <title>Dielectronic recombination data for astrophysical applications: Plasma rate-coefficients for Fe^q+ (q=7-10, 13-22) and Ni^25+ ions from storage-ring experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3678</link>
      <description>arXiv:1002.3678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review summarizes the present status of an ongoing experimental effort to provide reliable rate coefficients for dielectronic recombination of highly charged iron ions for the modeling of astrophysical and other plasmas. The experimental work has been carried out over more than a decade at the heavy-ion storage-ring TSR of the Max-Planck-Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany. The experimental and data reduction procedures are outlined. The role of previously disregarded processes such as fine-structure core excitations and trielectronic recombination is highlighted. Plasma rate coefficients for dielectronic recombination of Fe$^{q+}$ ions (q=7-10, 13-22) and Ni$^{25+}$ are presented graphically and in a simple parameterized form allowing for easy use in plasma modeling codes. It is concluded that storage-ring experiments are presently the only source for reliable low-temperature dielectronic recombination rate-coefficients of complex ions.</description>

Abstract: The thermal resistance of a spin-polarized hydrodynamic Dirac plasma in graphene is considered. A mechanism for the coupling of heat and spin flows is discussed, demonstrating that spin diffusion and spin thermocurrent modify viscous dissipation, leading to a significant enhancement of thermal resistance. Practical calculations are then presented for graphene devices in the Corbino geometry.</description>

      <title>Self-organization in collisionless, high-$\beta$ turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The MHD equations, as a collisional fluid model that remains in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), have long been used to describe turbulence in myriad space and astrophysical plasmas. Yet, the vast majority of these plasmas, from the solar wind to the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, are only weakly collisional at best, meaning that significant deviations from LTE are not only possible but common. Recent studies have demonstrated that the kinetic physics inherent to this weakly collisional regime can fundamentally transform the evolution of such plasmas across a wide range of scales. Here we explore the consequences of pressure anisotropy and Larmor-scale instabilities for collisionless, $\beta \gg 1$ turbulence, focusing on the role of a self-organizational effect known as `magneto-immutability'. We describe this self-organization analytically through a high-$\beta$, reduced ordering of the CGL-MHD equations, finding that it is a robust inertial-range effect that dynamically suppresses magnetic-field-strength fluctuations, anisotropic-pressure stresses, and dissipation due to heat fluxes. As a result, the turbulent cascade of Alfv\'enic fluctuations continues below the putative viscous scale to form a robust, nearly conservative, MHD-like inertial range. These findings are confirmed numerically via Landau-fluid CGL-MHD turbulence simulations that employ a collisional closure to mimic the effects of microinstabilities. We find that microinstabilities occupy a small ($\sim 5\%$) volume-filling fraction of the plasma, even when the pressure anisotropy is driven strongly towards its instability thresholds. We discuss these results in the context of recent predictions for ion-versus-electron heating in low-luminosity accretion flows and observations implying suppressed viscosity in ICM turbulence.</description>
