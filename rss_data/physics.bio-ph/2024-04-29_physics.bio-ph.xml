      <title>Bacterial stress granule protects mRNA through ribonucleases exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membraneless droplets formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) play a crucial role in mRNA storage, enabling organisms to swiftly respond to environmental changes. However, the mechanisms underlying mRNA integration and protection within droplets remain unclear. Here, we unravel the role of bacterial aggresomes as stress granules (SGs) in safeguarding mRNA during stress. We discovered that upon stress onset, mobile mRNA molecules selectively incorporate into individual proteinaceous SGs based on length-dependent enthalpic gain over entropic loss. As stress prolongs, SGs undergo compaction facilitated by stronger non-specific RNA-protein interactions, thereby promoting recruitment of shorter RNA chains. Remarkably, mRNA ribonucleases are repelled from bacterial SGs, due to the influence of protein surface charge. This exclusion mechanism ensures the integrity and preservation of mRNA within SGs during stress conditions, explaining how mRNA can be stored and protected from degradation. Following stress removal, SGs facilitate mRNA translation, thereby enhancing cell fitness in changing environments. These droplets maintain mRNA physiological activity during storage, making them an intriguing new candidate for mRNA therapeutics manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Tensor hypercontraction for fully self-consistent imaginary-time GF2 and GWSOX methods: theory, implementation, and role of the Green's function second-order exchange for intermolecular interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply tensor hypercontraction (THC) to reduce the computational scaling of expensive fully self-consistent Green's function methods. We present an efficient MPI-parallel algorithm and its implementation for evaluating the correlated second-order exchange term (SOX). This approach enabled us to conduct the largest fully self-consistent calculations with over 1100 atomic orbitals (AOs), with negligible errors attributed to THC fitting. Utilizing our THC implementation for scGW, scGF2, and scGWSOX (GW plus the SOX term iterated to achieve full Green's function self-consistency), we evaluated energies of intermolecular interactions. This approach allowed us to circumvent issues related to reference dependence and ambiguity in energy evaluation, which are common challenges in non-self-consistent calculations. We demonstrate that scGW exhibits a slight overbinding tendency for large systems, contrary to the underbinding observed with non-self-consistent RPA. Conversely, scGWSOX exhibits a slight underbinding tendency for such systems. This behavior is both physical and systematic and is caused by exclusion-principle violating diagrams or corresponding corrections. Our analysis elucidates the role played by these different diagrams, which is crucial for the construction of rigorous, accurate, and systematic methods. Finally, we explicitly show that all perturbative fully self-consistent Green's function methods are size-extensive.</description>

      <title>A symbolic information approach applied to human intracranial data to characterize and distinguish different congnitive processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How the human brain processes information during different cognitive tasks is one of the greatest questions in contemporary neuroscience. Understanding the statistical properties of brain signals during specific activities is one promising way to address this question. Here we analyze freely available data from implanted electrocorticography (ECoG) in five human subjects during two different cognitive tasks in the light of information theory quantifiers ideas. We employ a symbolic information approach to determine the probability distribution function associated with the time series from different cortical areas. Then we utilize these probabilities to calculate the associated Shannon entropy and a statistical complexity measure based on the disequilibrium between the actual time series and one with a uniform probability distribution function. We show that an Euclidian distance in the complexity-entropy plane and an asymmetry index for complexity are useful for comparing the two conditions. We show that our method can distinguish visual search epochs from blank screen intervals in different electrodes and patients. By using a multi-scale approach and embedding time delays to downsample the data, we find important time scales in which the relevant information is being processed. We also determine cortical regions and time intervals along the 2-second-long trials that present more pronounced differences between the two cognitive tasks. Finally, we show that the method is useful to distinguish cognitive processes using brain activity on a trial-by-trial basis.</description>

      <title>Micro-swimmer collective dynamics in Brinkman flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suspensions of swimming micro-organisms are known to undergo intricate collective dynamics as a result of hydrodynamic and collision interactions. Micro-swimmers, such as bacteria and micro-algae, naturally live and have evolved in complex habitats that include impurities, obstacles and interfaces. To elucidate their dynamics in a heterogeneous environment, we consider a continuum theory where the the micro-swimmers are embedded in a Brinkman wet porous medium, which models viscous flow with an additional resistance or friction due to the presence of smaller stationary obstacles. The conservation equation for the swimmer configurations includes advection and rotation by the immersing fluid, and is coupled to the viscous Brinkman fluid flow with an active stress due to the swimmers' motion in it. Resistance alters individual swimmer locomotion and the way it disturbs the surrounding fluid, and thus it alters its hydrodynamic interactions with others and and such affects collective dynamics.The entropy analysis and the linear stability analysis of the system of equations both reveal that resistance delays and hinders the onset and development of the collective swimming instabilities, and can completely suppress it if sufficiently large. Simulations of the full nonlinear system confirm these. We contrast the results with previous theoretical studies on micro-swimmers in homogeneous viscous flow, and discuss relevant experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Power-Efficiency Constraint for Biological rotary Motor Driven by Chemical Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological motors, as counterpart of heat engines, are driven by a chemical gradient to output mechanical work and play critical roles in biological functions, such as the ATP synthesis. Its thermodynamic efficiency, along with power, are two vital criteria for evaluating the performance of these motors. In this letter, we investigate a model of a microscopic chemical engine and assess the constraint relation between power and efficiency for the cycle with finite operation time. Our model demonstrates a general constraint relation between power and efficiency, and predicts that the efficiency at maximum power in the large friction regime is half of the maximum quasi-static efficiency, i.e., 1/2. These findings shall provide new direction to optimize the operation of microscopic biological motors.</description>

      <title>Enhanced and Robust Contrast in CEST MRI: Saturation Pulse Shape Design via Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To employ optimal control for the numerical design of CEST saturation pulses to maximize contrast and stability against $B_0$ inhomogeneities.
  Theory and Methods: We applied an optimal control framework for the design pulse shapes for CEST saturation pulse trains. The cost functional minimized both the pulse energy and the discrepancy between the corresponding CEST spectrum and the target spectrum based on a continuous RF pulse. The optimization is subject to hardware limitations. In measurements on a 7 T preclinical scanner, the optimal control pulses were compared to continuous-wave and Gaussian saturation methods. We conducted a comparison of the optimal control pulses were compared to with Gaussian, block pulse trains, and adiabatic spin-lock pulses.
  Results: The optimal control pulse train demonstrated saturation levels comparable to continuous-wave saturation and surpassed Gaussian saturation by up to 50 \% in phantom measurements. In phantom measurements at 3 T the optimized pulses not only showcased the highest CEST contrast, but also the highest stability against field inhomogeneities. In contrast, block pulse saturation resulted in severe artifacts. Dynamic Bloch-McConnell simulations were employed to identify the source of these artifacts, and underscore the $B_0$ robustness of the optimized pulses.
  Conclusion: In this work, it was shown that a substantial improvement in pulsed saturation CEST imaging can be achieved by using Optimal Control design principles. It is possible to overcome the sensitivity of saturation to B0 inhomogeneities while achieving CEST contrast close to continuous wave saturation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNA hybridization is a fundamental reaction with wide-ranging applications in biotechnology. The nearest-neighbor (NN) model provides the most reliable description of the energetics of duplex formation. Most DNA thermodynamics studies have been done in melting experiments in bulk, of limited resolution due to ensemble averaging. In contrast, single-molecule methods have reached the maturity to derive DNA thermodynamics with unprecedented accuracy. We combine single-DNA mechanical unzipping experiments using a temperature jump optical trap with machine learning methods and derive the temperature-dependent DNA energy parameters of the NN model. In particular, we measure the previously unknown ten heat-capacity change parameters $\Delta C_p$, relevant for thermodynamical predictions throughout the DNA stability range. Calorimetric force spectroscopy establishes a groundbreaking methodology to accurately study nucleic acids, from chemically modified DNA to RNA and DNA/RNA hybrid structures.</description>

Abstract: Synchronization phenomena are pervasive in coupled nonlinear systems across the natural world and engineering domains. Understanding how to dynamically identify the parameter space (or network structure) of coupled nonlinear systems in a synchronized state is crucial for the study of system synchronization. To address the challenge of achieving stable synchronization in coupled nonlinear systems, we develop a set of mathematical optimization techniques for dynamic learning of synchronization (DLS) inspired by machine learning. This technology captures the state differences between nodes within the system and dynamically adjusts weights, allowing coupled nonlinear systems to maintain a stable state of synchronization after appropriate weight adjustments. We introduce several variants of the DLS technique, including adaptive, supervised, and hybrid methods, effectively promoting synchronization in heterogeneous networks such as small-world, scale-free, and random networks. The efficacy of this technique is validated through its application to simple FitzHugh-Nagumo neural networks and complex Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal networks, examining its impact on both global and local synchronization. The DLS technique proposed in this study offers a new solution to synchronization problems in dynamic network environments, addressing the deficiencies in adaptability and flexibility of existing technologies and providing a fresh perspective for understanding and implementing synchronization phenomena in coupled nonlinear systems.</description>

Abstract: Optical diffraction tomography (ODT) is a powerful non-invasive 3D imaging technique, but its combination with broadband light sources is difficult. In this study, we introduce ultrabroadband ODT, covering over 150 nm of visible spectral bandwidth with a lateral spatial resolution of 150 nm. Our work addresses a critical experimental gap by enabling the measurement of broadband refractive index changes in 3D samples, a crucial information that is difficult to assess with existing methodologies. We present broadband, spectrally resolved ODT images of HeLa cells, obtained via pulse-shaping based Fourier transform spectroscopy. The spectral observations enabled by ultrabroadband ODT, combined with material-dependent refractive index responses, allow for precise three-dimensional identification of the nanoparticles within cellular structures. Our work represents a crucial step towards time and spectrally-resolved tomography of complex 3D structures with implications for life and materials science applications.</description>

      <title>Raman spectra of amino acids and peptides from machine learning polarizabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is an important tool in the study of vibrational properties and composition of molecules, peptides and even proteins. Raman spectra can be simulated based on the change of the electronic polarizability with vibrations, which can nowadays be efficiently obtained via machine learning models trained on first-principles data. However, the transferability of the models trained on small molecules to larger structures is unclear and direct training on large structures in prohibitively expensive. In this work, we first train two machine learning models to predict polarizabilities of all 20 amino acids. Both models are carefully benchmarked and compared to DFT calculations, with neural network method found to offer better transferability. By combining machine learning models with classical force field molecular dynamics, Raman spectra of all amino acids are also obtained and investigated, showing good agreement with experiments. The models are further extended to small peptides. We find that adding structures containing peptide bonds to the training set greatly improves predictions even for peptides not included in training sets.</description>

      <title>Neural Models and Algorithms for Sensorimotor Control of an Octopus Arm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, a biophysically realistic model of a soft octopus arm with internal musculature is presented. The modeling is motivated by experimental observations of sensorimotor control where an arm localizes and reaches a target. Major contributions of this article are: (i) development of models to capture the mechanical properties of arm musculature, the electrical properties of the arm peripheral nervous system (PNS), and the coupling of PNS with muscular contractions; (ii) modeling the arm sensory system, including chemosensing and proprioception; and (iii) algorithms for sensorimotor control, which include a novel feedback neural motor control law for mimicking target-oriented arm reaching motions, and a novel consensus algorithm for solving sensing problems such as locating a food source from local chemical sensory information (exogenous) and arm deformation information (endogenous). Several analytical results, including rest-state characterization and stability properties of the proposed sensing and motor control algorithms, are provided. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Qualitative comparisons against observed arm rest shapes and target-oriented reaching motions are also reported.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Penrose method of instability analysis, we consider the synchronization transition in the Kuramoto model with inertia and noise with all-to-all couplings. Analyzing the Penrose curves, we identify the appearance of cluster and chimera states in the presence of noise. We observe that noise can destroy chimera and biclusters states. The critical coupling describing bifurcation from incoherent to coherent state is found analytically. To confirm our propositions based on the Penrose method, we perform numerical simulations.</description>
