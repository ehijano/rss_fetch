      <title>H\"older maps from Euclidean spaces to Carnot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give alternative proofs of (unsharp) results of Gromov's on his H\''older equivalence problem: for which $\alpha$ does there exist a $C^\alpha$-homeomorphism of an open set of Euclidean space to an open set of a given Carnot group? We indicate a possible route to sharp bounds.</description>

      <title>Filtrations and asymptotic geometry of non-Archimedean norms on section rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the metric study of a construction of G\'erardin of the action of the boundary at infinity of the space of norms on a non-Archimedean vector space, and its generalisation to graded algebras. Namely, given (X,L) a polarised variety over an arbitrary non-Archimedean field, we show that there is a jointly d_1-contracting action of the space of filtrations of the section ring R(X,L) on the space of graded norms on R(X,L). This naturally yields non-Archimedean geodesic rays and infinite-dimensional flats in this setting, generalising previous work of the author and Witt Nystr\"om. It is further shown that relative limit measures converge along geodesic rays, providing a result on the d_p-radial geometry of graded norms, analogous to a recent result of Finski in the Archimedean case.</description>

      <title>A limit theorem for Hausdorff approximation by random inscribed polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximate a smooth convex body $K$ with nonvanishing curvature by the convex hull of $n$ independent random points sampled from its boundary $\partial K$. In case the points are distributed according to the optimal density, we prove that the rescaled approximation error in Hausdorff distance tends to a Gumbel distributed random variable. The proof is based on an asymptotic relation to covering properties of random geodesic balls on $\partial K$ and on a limit theorem due to Janson.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of Delzant polytopes and symplectic toric manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces modern geometric combinatorial technology from the theory of triangulations in order to derive results in toric symplectic geometry. In the main part of the paper we prove a number of properties of the space $\mathcal{D}(n)$ of $n$-dimensional Delzant polytopes. Two highlights are the construction of examples showing that, in contrast with the classical work of Oda in dimension $2$, no classification of combinatorially minimal Delzant polytopes can be expected in dimension $3$ or higher, and a proof that the space of $n$-dimensional Delzant polytopes is path-connected. Our proof of the latter is based on the fact that every rational fan can be refined to a unimodular fan, which is a standard technique used for resolution of singularities of toric varieties. In the last part of the paper, using the Delzant correspondence, these results allow us to answer several open questions concerning the moduli space $\mathcal{M}(n)$ of symplectic toric manifolds of dimension $2n$, since this space is isometric to the space of Delzant polytopes. Our results imply that no classification of minimal models of symplectic toric manifolds is plausible in dimension $6$ or higher, which answers in the negative a long-standing folklore question originating in Oda's work (1978).</description>

      <title>On the Classification of Planar-Rips complexes and their corresponding unit disk graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a metric space $(X,d)$, the Vietoris-Rips complex of $X$ at a scale of $r &gt;0$ is a simplicial complex whose simplices are all those finite subsets of $X$ with diameter less than $r$. In this paper, we classify, up to simplicial isomorphism, all $n$-dimensional pseudomanifolds and weak-pseudomanifolds that can be realized as a Vietoris-Rips complex of planar point sets. We further classify two-dimensional, pure, and closed planar-Rips complexes up to homotopy. Additionally, we explore the hereditary properties and introduce the notion of obstructions in planar-Rips complexes. We also consolidate our findings to describe a class of unit disk graphs, having all maximal cliques of same cardinality. Several structural and geometric properties of planar-Rips complexes have also been derived.</description>
