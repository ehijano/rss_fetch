      <title>Experimental determination of the sodium K-shell atomic fundamental parameters for X-ray spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable fundamental parameters are essential for accurate X-ray fluorescence analysis of sodium. This work presents updated experimental values with reliable uncertainties for sodium K-shell fundamental parameters such as: fluorescence yield, photoionization cross sections, and Auger yields. Using a physically calibrated setup and a thin NaCl layer on a silicon nitride membrane, a holistic determination approach was applied to reduce uncertainties. The new values represent a significant improvement on the ones widely used in databases. All data are available via Zenodo to support precise sodium quantification in scientific and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) cooling is a well-established method for preparing trapped ion systems in their motional ground state. However, isolating a three-level system, as required for EIT cooling, is often challenging or impractical. In this work, we extend the EIT cooling framework to multilevel systems where the number of ground states exceeds the number of excited states, ensuring the presence of at least one dark state. We develop a formalism to accurately determine the cooling rate in the weak sideband coupling regime and provide an approximate estimate for cooling rates beyond this regime, without the need for explicit simulation of the motional degree of freedom. We clarify the connection between the cooling rate and the absorption spectrum, offering a pathway for efficient near-ground-state cooling of ions with complex electronic structures.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity quantum state control of a polar molecular ion in a cryogenic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a quantum-logic spectroscopy (QLS) protocol to control the quantum state of a CaH+ ion in a cryogenic environment, in which reduced thermal radiation extends rotational state lifetimes by an order of magnitude over those at room temperature. By repeatedly and adaptively probing the molecule, detecting the outcome of each probe via an atomic ion, and using a Bayesian update scheme to quantify confidence in the molecular state, we demonstrate state preparation and measurement (SPAM) in a single quantum state with infidelity less than $6\times10^{-3}$ and measure Rabi flopping between two states with greater than 99% contrast. The protocol does not require any molecule-specific lasers and the detection scheme is non-destructive. To our knowledge, this result represents the highest SPAM fidelity of a single molecular quantum state demonstrated to date.</description>

      <title>All-optical convolution utilizing processing in memory based on a cold atomic ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Processing in memory (PIM) has received significant attention due to its high efficiency, low latency, and parallelism. In optical computation, coherent memory is a crucial infrastructure for PIM frameworks. This study presents an all-optical convolution experiment conducted within computational storage based on a cold atomic ensemble. By exploiting the light-atom phase transfer facilitated by the electromagnetically induced transparency, we demonstrated spiral phase contrast processing of photon images in memory, resulting in the edge enhancement of retrieved images recorded using time-correlated photon imaging. In particular, adopting state-of-the-art atomic techniques provides a coherent memory lifetime exceeding 320 us for PIM operations. Our results highlight the significant potential of cold atomic ensembles as computational storage for developing all-optical PIM systems.</description>

      <title>Rotational-hyperfine cooling of $^{205}$TlF in a cryogenic beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of CeNTREX (Cold Molecule Nuclear Time-Reversal Experiment) is to search for time-reversal symmetry violation in the thallium nucleus, by measuring the Schiff moment of $^{205}$Tl in the polar molecule thallium fluoride (TlF). CeNTREX uses a cryogenic beam of TlF with a rotational temperature of 6.3(2) K. This results in population spread over dozens of rotational and hyperfine sublevels of TlF, while only a single level is useful for the Schiff moment measurement. Here we present a protocol for cooling the rotational and hyperfine degrees of freedom in the CeNTREX beam, transferring the majority of the Boltzmann distribution into a single rotational and hyperfine sublevel by using a single ultraviolet laser and a pair of microwave beams. We achieve a factor of $20.1(4)$ gain in the population of the $J=0$, $F=0$ hyperfine sublevel of the TlF ground state.</description>

      <title>Coincidence measurement of two-photon double ionization of argon through an autoionizing resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present coincidence measurements of two-photon double-ionization (TPDI) of argon driven by femtosecond pulses tunable around 26.5 eV photon energy, which are obtained from a high-harmonic generation source. The measured photoelectron spectra are interpreted with regard to three TPDI mechanisms. Theoretical predictions are obtained by an approximate model for direct TPDI and atomic structure calculations, which are implemented into a Monte Carlo simulation. The prevailing mechanism involves the excitation and prompt photoionization of an autoionizing resonance in neutral argon. We provide evidence for pronounced electron-electron interaction in this ultrafast ionization process. Furthermore, we show that the dominant TPDI mechanism can be altered by slight tuning of the photon energy. The present work paves the way for scrutinizing and controlling non-linear photoionization in the extreme ultraviolet using table-top sources.</description>

      <title>Complex pseudo-partition functions in the Configurationally-Resolved Super-Transition-Array approach for radiative opacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A few years ago, Kurzweil and Hazak developed the Configurationally Resolved Super-Transition-Arrays (CRSTA) method for the computation of hot-plasma radiative opacity. Their approach, based on a temporal integration, is an important refinement of the standard Super-Transition-Arrays (STA) approach, which enables one to recover the underlying structure of the STAs, made of unresolved transition arrays. The CRSTA formalism relies on the use of complex pseudo partition functions, depending on the considered one-electron jump. In this article, we find that, despite the imaginary part, the doubly-recursive relation which was introduced in the original STA method to avoid problems due to alternating-sign terms in partition functions, is still applicable, robust, efficient, and exempt of numerical instabilities. This was rather unexpected, in particular because of the occurrence of trigonometric functions, or Chebyshev polynomials, which can be either positive or negative. We also show that, in the complex case, the recursion relation can be presented in a form where the vector of real and imaginary parts at a given iteration is therefore obtained by a sum of the rotated previous ones.</description>

      <title>Prospecting for lunar Helium-3 with a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mining $^3{\rm He}$ from lunar regolith has attracted significant interest in recent years due to the scarcity of $^3{\rm He}$ on Earth and its diverse applications, from cryogenics and medical imaging, to nuclear physics and future nuclear fusion. Given the stringent technical and economic challenges of mining lunar $^3{\rm He}$, precise prospecting is essential. Here we propose a prospecting methodology based on a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer, which can detect the dipolar magnetic field of thermally polarized $^3{\rm He}$ spins. With a 200 g regolith sample and an rf-magnetometer with sensitivity $1~{\rm fT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ we can detect $^3{\rm He}$ with abundance 5 ppb within a measurement time of just 5 min. The associated apparatus is lightweight and significantly more cost-effective than alternative measurement techniques. The proposed prospecting method is readily deployable and could substantially improve the technical and economic feasibility of mining lunar $^3{\rm He}$.</description>

      <title>Proposal for realizing quantum-spin systems on a two-dimensional square lattice with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction by the Floquet engineering using Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a method for implementing the Hamiltonian incorporating Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions within Rydberg atoms arranged in a two-dimensional square lattice, utilizing Floquet engineering. In our scheme, we use both global and local operations of the spins. The global operations can be realized by applying the microwave and the local operations can be realized by the locally addressing lasers, which yields the ac-Stark shift. Since our engineered Hamiltonian contains bond-dependent DM interactions, we expect the emergence of quantum skyrmions in the ground state.</description>

      <title>Toward hybrid quantum simulations with qubits and qumodes on trapped-ion platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of gate-based hybrid quantum computing using both discrete (qubit) and continuous (qumode) variables on trapped-ion platforms. Trapped-ion systems have demonstrated record one- and two-qubit gate fidelities and long qubit coherence times, while qumodes, which can be represented by the collective vibrational modes of the ion chain, have remained relatively unexplored for their use in computing. Using numerical simulations, we show that high-fidelity hybrid gates and measurement operations can be achieved for existing trapped-ion quantum platforms. As an exemplary application, we consider quantum simulations of the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model, which is given by a one-dimensional chain of interacting spin and boson degrees of freedom. Using classical simulations, we study its real-time evolution and develop a suitable variational quantum algorithm for ground state preparation. Our results motivate further studies of hybrid quantum computing in this context, which may lead to direct applications in condensed matter and fundamental particle and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger Astronomy Beyond the Standard Model: New Window from Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic (ULB) fields with mass $m_{\phi} \ll 1$~eV often arise in theories beyond the Standard Model (SM). If such fields exist, violent astrophysical events that result in emission of gravitational wave, photon, or neutrino signals could also produce bursts of high-density relativistic ULB fields. Detection of such ULB fields in terrestrial or space-based laboratories correlated with other signals from transient astrophysical events opens a novel avenue for multimessenger astronomy. We show that quantum sensors are particularly well-suited to observe emitted scalar and pseudoscalar axion-like ULB fields coupled to SM. We demonstrate that multimessenger astronomy with ULB fields is possible even when accounting for matter screening effects.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enabled Rydberg atomic polarimetry of radio-frequency fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms efficiently link photons between the radio-frequency (RF) and optical domains. They furnish a medium in which the presence of an RF field imprints on the transmission of a probe laser beam by altering the coherent coupling between atomic quantum states. The immutable atomic energy structure underpins quantum-metrological RF field measurements and has driven intensive efforts to realize inherently self-calibrated sensing devices. Here we investigate spectroscopic signatures owing to the angular momentum quantization of the atomic states utilized in an electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) sensing scheme for linearly polarized RF fields. Specific combinations of atomic terms are shown to give rise to universal, distinctive fingerprints in the detected optical fields upon rotating the RF field polarization. Using a dressed state picture, we identify two types of atomic angular momentum ladders that display strikingly disparate spectroscopic signatures, including the complementary absence or presence of a central spectral EIT peak. Our study adds important insights into the prospects of Rydberg atomic gases for quantum metrological electric field characterization. In particular, it calls into question prevailing interpretations of SI-traceable Rydberg atom electrometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the wave packet of a massive particle grows linearly under free dynamics, it grows exponentially in an inverted harmonic potential, offering a pathway to rapidly increase quantum fluctuations to macroscopic dimensions. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate this principle by expanding the center-of-mass thermal state of a 125nm silica nanoparticle to a position uncertainty of 43.4nm within 260 $\mu$s. This expansion, achieved using an inverted dark potential to minimize decoherence from photon recoil, represents a 952-fold increase, reaching a scale comparable to the nanoparticle's physical size. This work represents a key advancement toward preparing macroscopic quantum superpositions at unprecedented mass and length scales.</description>

      <title>New Paradigm for Integrated Sensing and Communication with Rydberg Atomic Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The RYDberg Atomic Receiver (RYDAR) has been demonstrated to surmount the limitation on both the sensitivity and operating bandwidth of the classical electronic counterpart, which can theoretically detect indiscernible electric signals below -174 dBm/Hz with optical measurement through Rydberg-state atoms. Such miracle has established a new quantum-based paradigm for communications and sensing, which motivates a revolution of the transceiver design philosophies to fully unleash the potential of RYDAR towards next-generation networks. Against this background, this article provides a thorough investigation of Rydberg atomic communications and sensing from theory to hardware implementations. Specifically, we highlight the great opportunities from the hybridization between the RYDAR and the cutting-edge integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), followed by essential preliminaries of the quantum-based receiver. Then we propose a theoretical framework for broadband ISAC based on RYDAR, demonstrated by the proof-of-concept experiments. Afterwards, the enabling technologies for the ISAC framework are explored ranging from channel characterization, waveform design to array-based receiver configurations, where the open problems are also summarized. Finally, the future applications of RYDAR-based ISAC are envisioned, indicating its significant potential for both civilian and military purposes.</description>
