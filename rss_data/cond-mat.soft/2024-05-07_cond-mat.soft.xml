      <title>Markov State Model Approach to Simulate Self-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational modeling of assembly is challenging for many systems because their timescales vastly exceed those accessible to simulations. This article describes the MultiMSM, which is a general framework that uses Markov state models (MSMs) to enable simulating self-assembly and self-organization on timescales that are orders of magnitude longer than those accessible to brute force dynamics simulations. In contrast to previous MSM approaches to simulating assembly, the framework describes simultaneous assembly of many clusters and the consequent depletion of free subunits or other small oligomers. The algorithm accounts for changes in transition rates as concentrations of monomers and intermediates evolve over the course of the reaction. Using two model systems, we show that the MultiMSM accurately predicts the concentrations of the full ensemble of intermediates on the long timescales required for reactions to reach equilibrium. Importantly, after constructing a MultiMSM for one system concentration, a wide range of other concentrations can be simulated without any further sampling. This capability allows for orders of magnitude additional speed up. In addition, the method enables highly efficient calculation of quantities such as free energy profiles, nucleation timescales, flux along the ensemble of assembly pathways, and entropy production rates. Identifying contributions of individual transitions to entropy production rates reveals sources of kinetic traps. The method is broadly applicable to systems with equilibrium or nonequilibrium dynamics, and is trivially parallelizable and thus highly scalable.</description>

      <title>Role of the constriction angle on the clogging by bridging of suspensions of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confined flows of particles can lead to clogging, and therefore failure, of various fluidic systems across many applications. As a result, design guidelines need to be developed to ensure that clogging is prevented or at least delayed. In this Letter, we investigate the influence of the angle of reduction in the cross-section of the channel on the bridging of semi-dilute and dense non-Brownian suspensions of spherical particles. We observe a decrease of the clogging probability with the reduction of the constriction angle. This effect is more pronounced for dense suspensions close to the maximum packing fraction where particles are in contact in contrast to semi-dilute suspensions. We rationalize this difference in terms of arch selection. We describe the role of the constriction angle and the flow profile, providing insights into the distinct behavior of semi-dilute and dense suspensions.</description>

      <title>Helical close-packing of anisotropic tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helically close-packed states of filaments are common in natural and engineered material systems, ranging from nanoscopic biomolecules to macroscopic structural components. While the simplest models of helical close-packing, described by the ideal rope model, neglect anisotropy perpendicular to the backbone, physical filaments are often quite far from circular in their cross-section. Here, we consider an anisotropic generalization of the ideal rope model and show that cross-section anisotropy has a strongly non-linear impact on the helical close-packing configurations of helical filaments. We show that the topology and composition of the close-packing landscape depends on the cross-sectional aspect ratio and is characterized by several distinct states of self-contact. We characterize the local density of these distinct states based on the notion of confinement within a 'virtual' cylindrical capillary, and show that states of optimal density vary strongly with the degree of anisotropy. While isotropic filaments are densest in a straight configuration, any measure of anisotropy leads to helicity of the maximal density state. We show the maximally dense states exhibit a sequence of transitions in helical geometry and cross-sectional tilt with increasing anisotropy, from spiral tape to spiral screw packings. Furthermore, we show that maximal capillary density saturates in a lower bound for volume fraction of $\pi/4$ in the large-anisotropy, spiral-screw limit. While cross-sectional anisotropy is well-known to impact the mechanical properties of filaments, our study shows its strong effects to shape the configuration space and packing efficiency of this elementary material motif.</description>

      <title>Chain-length-dependent correlated molecular motion in polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how dynamic heterogeneities (DH), a hallmark of glass-forming materials, depend on chain flexibility and chain length in polymers. For highly flexible polymers, a relatively large number of monomers ($N_c\sim500$) undergo correlated motion at the glass transition temperature $T_g$, independent of molecular weight ($M$). In contrast, less flexible polymers show a complex $N_c(M)$ behaviour divided into three regimes, consistent with observation in both $T_g(M)$ and chain conformational structure. For short oligomers ($\lesssim$ 2 Kuhn steps), a transition from mainly $\it{inter}$molecular correlations and $N_c\sim 200$, to strongly $\it{intra}$molecular correlations and $N_c&lt; 50$ (roughly the molecular size) is observed; for longer chains, $N_c$ increases weakly, before saturating. For poly(methyl methacrylate), a remarkable similarity is found between $N_c(M)$ and the $M$-dependent ratio of the activation barriers of the structural ($\alpha$) and secondary ($\beta$) relaxations. Our results suggest a link between the DH length-scale and the number of $\beta$ relaxation events jointly-activated to facilitate the $\alpha$ relaxation.</description>

      <title>Liquid Crystalline Assembly of Collagen for Deterministic Alignment and Spread of Human Schwann Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collagen is a key component of the extracellular matrix and well-oriented domains of collagen are relevant for mimicking the local cell environment in vitro. While there has been significant attention directed towards the alignment of collagen, formation of large-scale oriented domains remains a key challenge. Type I collagen self-assembles to form liquid crystalline (LC) mesophases in acidic conditions at concentrations above 100 mg/ml. The LC mesophase provides an efficient platform for large-scale alignment and patterning of collagen coated substrates. However, there exist challenges related to solubilizing and processing of collagen at such high concentrations in order to replicate the native extra cellular matrix (ECM). In this contribution, we report on centimeter-scale alignment in collagen-coated glass substrates using solutions that are well below the LC-forming concentrations. Importantly, we are also able to extend this method to create a mimic of the native ECM via macroscopic 3-D collagen hydrogels with programmed anisotropy within them. We explain the formation of these uniform domains via shear-induced and magnetically-induced liquid crystallinity of the collagen solutions. We show that the orientation, spreading and aspect ratio of Human Schwann Cells (HSCs) all are strongly coupled with the alignment of the collagen substrate/hydrogel. We use a simple Metroplis-based model to reveal that a critical magnetic field strength exists for a given concentration of collagen, exceeding which, macroscopic alignment is permissible- enabling guidance for future studies on alignment of collagen at high concentrations.</description>

      <title>Verification of Perrin's theory of the motion of dilute spheroidal colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian motion is of central importance for understanding diffusive transport in biology, chemistry, and physics. For spherical particles, the theory was developed by Einstein, whereas a theoretical description of the motion of spheroids was given by F. Perrin. Here, we report the systematic verification of Perrin's theory 90 years after its publication. To this end, we synthesized oblate and prolate core-shell spheroids with different aspect ratios and tracked their three-dimensional diffusive motion in high dilution using confocal fluorescence microscopy. The experimental data for the dependence of translational and rotational diffusion on aspect ratio are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. The crossover dynamics from anisotropic to isotropic diffusion as a hallmark for translation rotation coupling are also found as predicted. This verifies Perrin's theory as a cornerstone for understanding diffusive transport and underlines the excellent suitability of the particle system for testing more detailed theory.</description>

      <title>Exploring anisotropic pressure and spatial correlations in strongly confined hard-disk fluids. Exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the transverse and longitudinal properties of hard disks confined in narrow channels. We employ an exact mapping of the system onto a one-dimensional polydisperse, nonadditive mixture of hard rods with equal chemical potentials. We compute various thermodynamic properties, including the transverse and longitudinal equations of state, along with their behaviors at both low and high densities. Structural properties are analyzed using the two-body correlation function and the radial distribution function, tailored for the highly anisotropic geometry of this system. The results are corroborated by computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Long ranged stress correlations in the hard sphere liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The smooth emergence of shear elasticity is an hallmark of the liquid to glass transition. In a liquid, viscous stresses arise from local structural rearrangements. In the solid, Eshelby has shown that stresses around an inclusion decay as a power law $r^{-D}$, where $D$ is the dimension of the system. We study glass-forming hard sphere fluids by simulation and observe the emergence of the unscreened power-law Eshelby pattern in the stress correlations of the isotropic liquid state. By a detailed tensorial analysis, we show that the fluctuating force field, viz.~the divergence of the stress field, relaxes to zero with time in all states, while the shear stress correlations develop spatial power-law structures inside regions that grow with longitudinal and transverse sound speeds; we observe the predicted exponents $r^{-D}$ and $r^{-D-2}$. In Brownian systems, shear stresses relax diffusively within these regions, with the diffusion coefficient determined by the shear modulus and the friction coefficient.</description>

      <title>Shortest paths govern fracture nucleation in thermoset networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a predictive approach for determining fracture nucleation in thermosets based on shortest paths (SPs) of the network topology. This method enumerates SP sets in networks with periodic boundary conditions, with applications to both all-atom and coarse-grained simulations. We find that network fracture is most likely to nucleate on the first (shortest) SP and the strain at nucleation is linearly correlated with the topological path length. Subsequent fracture events are dictated by the instantaneous SP of partially broken networks. We further quantify the length scale dependence of SP distributions, introducing a means of bridging simulated and experimental fracture profiles.</description>

      <title>Swimming efficiency in viscosity gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study the effect of viscosity gradients on the energy dissipated by the motion of microswimmers and the associated efficiency of that motion. Using spheroidal squirmer model swimmers in weak linearly varying viscosity fields, we find that efficiency depends on whether they generate propulsion from the back (pushers) or the front (pullers). Pushers are faster and more efficient when moving down gradients but slower and less efficient moving up viscosity gradients, and the opposite is true for pullers. However, both pushers and pullers display negative viscotaxis, therefore pushers dynamically tend to the most efficient orientation while pullers the least. We also evaluate the effect of shape on power expenditure and efficiency when swimming in viscosity gradients and find that in general the change in both due to gradients monotonically decreases with increasing slenderness. This work shows how shape and gait play an important role in determining dynamics and efficiency in inhomogeneous environments, and demonstrating that both efficiency minimizing and maximizing stable dynamical states are possible.</description>

      <title>Coat stiffening explains the consensus pathway of clathrin-mediated endocytosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the main pathway used by eukaryotic cells to take up extracellular material, but the dominant physical mechanisms driving this process are still elusive. Recently several high-resolution imaging techniques have been used on different cell lines to measure the geometrical properties of clathrin-coated pits over their whole lifetime. Here we first show that all datasets follow the same consensus pathway, which is well described by the recently introduced cooperative curvature model, which predicts a flat-to curved transition at finite area, followed by linear growth and subsequent saturation of curvature. We then apply an energetic model for the composite of plasma membrane and clathrin coat to the consensus pathway to show that the dominant mechanism for invagination is coat stiffening, which results from cooperative interactions between the different clathrin molecules and progressively drives the system towards its intrinsic curvature. Our theory predicts that two length scales determine the time course of invagination, namely the patch size at which the flat-to-curved transition occurs and the final pit radius.</description>

      <title>A hydrodynamic analog of critical phenomena: an uncountably infinite number of universality classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of universality class has emerged from our understanding of critical phenomena widely observed in nature and has guided the recent development of physics. Accordingly, identifying a rich variety of universality class is a major issue in modern physics. Here, we report that a daily phenomenon, similar to a drop falling from a faucet, possesses a strikingly close analogy with critical phenomena, but this version remarkably reveals the existence of an uncountably infinite number of universality classes. The key for our present findings is the confinement of a system into a thin cell, in which we observe the dynamics of air-liquid interface formed by entrained air into viscous liquid by a solid disk, to find critical exponents that define a universality class depend on continuous numbers characterizing the confinement.</description>

      <title>Beware of CaBER: Filament thinning rheometry doesn't give `the' relaxation time of polymer solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The viscoelastic relaxation time of a polymer solution is often measured using Capillary Breakup Extensional Rheometry (CaBER) where a droplet is placed between two plates which are pulled apart to form a thinning filament. For a slow plate retraction protocol, required to avoid inertio-capillary oscillations for low-viscosity liquids, we show experimentally that the CaBER relaxation time $\tau_e$ inferred from the exponential thinning regime is in fact an apparent relaxation time that increases significantly when increasing the plate diameter and the droplet volume. Similarly, we observe that $\tau_e$ increases with the plate diameter for the classical step-strain plate separation protocol of a commercial (Haake) CaBER device and increases with the nozzle diameter for a Dripping-onto-Substrate (DoS) method. This dependence on the flow history before the formation of the viscoelastic filament is in contradiction with polymer models such as Oldroyd-B that predict a filament thinning rate $1/3\tau$ ($\tau$ being the model's relaxation time) which is a material property independent of geometrical factors. We show that this is not due to artefacts such as solvent evaporation or polymer degradation and that it can only be rationalised by finite extensibility effects (FENE-P model) for a dilute polymer solution in a viscous solvent, but not for semi-dilute solutions in a low-viscosity solvent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Historical monuments, outdoor stone sculptures and artworks made of porous materials are exposed to chemical and physical degradation over time. Presently, the most promising route for consolidation of weakened porous materials is the injection of viscoelastic solutions of polymerizing compounds. Those compounds, after injection, undergo a sol-gel transition inside the porous media through evaporation of the solvent. Finding a suitable gelifying solution as a consolidant calls for understanding the drying kinetics of viscoelastic fluids in porous media. Here, we present a multiscale study of the drying kinetics of solutions during the sol-gel transition. We investigate the drying dynamics and subsequent water uptake of a gel using NMR and X-ray microtomography techniques in porous materials. We find that during drying, a distinct front develops which separates the liquid region from the gelled region. This front advances from the free surface of evaporation towards the inner parts of the stone. We identify different drying periods which appear to be dependent on the intrinsic properties of the porous medium influencing strongly the homogeneity of the final gel distribution within a treated stone. Our findings not only are relevant for the consolidation of porous artworks but also for civil and soil engineering processes where the fluids considered are generally more complex than water.</description>

Abstract: Liquids flowing against solid surfaces experience friction. While solid friction is familiar to anyone with a sense of touch, liquid friction is much more exotic. At macroscopic scales indeed, the assumption of inifinite friction, i.e. that interfacial liquid molecules stick to solid surfaces, is hard to disprove. Still, it has been known for a few decades that some materials exhibit very strong liquid slippage, leading to a dramatic increase in the permeability of nanoscale tubes to liquid flow. Harnessing liquid friction holds the promise of high-efficiency membrane separation processes, heat recovery systems or blue energy harvesting, making it a highly strategic field for reducing carbon emissions and addressing the climate emergency. In this chapter we review the history of liquid-solid friction measurements, mainly driven by the advent of new techniques and materials. We highlight the most established results and point out some directions that seem to us to be particularly dynamic and promising for the field.</description>

      <title>Rheo-SINDy: Finding a Constitutive Model from Rheological Data for Complex Fluids Using Sparse Identification for Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rheology plays a pivotal role in understanding the flow behavior of fluids by discovering governing equations that relate deformation and stress, known as constitutive equations. Despite the importance of these equations, current methods for deriving them lack a systematic methodology, often relying on expert knowledge and incurring substantial costs. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel method named {\it Rheo}-SINDy, which employs the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm for discovering constitutive models from rheological data. Rheo-SINDy was applied to five distinct scenarios, four with well-established constitutive equations and one without predefined equations. Our results demonstrate that Rheo-SINDy successfully identified accurate models for the known constitutive equations and derived physically plausible approximate models for the scenario without established equations. Notably, the identified approximate models can accurately reproduce nonlinear shear rheological properties, including shear thinning. These findings validate the robustness of Rheo-SINDy in handling real-world data complexities and underscore its efficacy as a tool for advancing the development of data-driven approaches in rheology.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the granular temperatures in force-free granular gases under exponential resetting. When a resetting event occurs, the granular temperature attains its initial value, while between the resetting events it cools down. We show that the granular system attains a non-equilibrium steady state value and study the dependence of average granular temperature on the resetting rate. Our theory may help to explain the behavior of non-periodically driven granular systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Poisson effect in affine semiflexible polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stretching an elastic material along one axis typically induces contraction along the transverse axes, a phenomenon known as the Poisson effect. From these strains, one can compute the specific volume, which generally either increases or, in the incompressible limit, remains constant as the material is stretched. However, in networks of semiflexible or stiff polymers, which are typically highly compressible yet stiffen significantly when stretched, one instead sees a significant reduction in specific volume under finite strains. This volume reduction is accompanied by increasing alignment of filaments along the strain axis and a nonlinear elastic response, with stiffening of the apparent Young's modulus. For semiflexible networks, in which entropic bending elasticity governs the linear elastic regime, the nonlinear Poisson effect is caused by the nonlinear force-extension relationship of the constituent filaments, which produces a highly asymmetric response of the constituent polymers to stretching and compression. The details of this relationship depend on the geometric and elastic properties of the underlying filaments, which can vary greatly in experimental systems. Here, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the nonlinear Poisson effect in an affine network model and explore the influence of filament properties on essential features of the macroscopic response, including strain-driven alignment and volume reduction.</description>

      <title>Elastic Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert potentials of dynamical dislocations from tensor gauge theory in 2+1 dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of defect excitations in crystalline solids is necessary to understand the macroscopic low-energy properties of elastic media. We use fracton-elasticity duality to systematically study the defect dynamics and interactions in the linear isotropic medium. We derive the explicit expressions for the dual gauge potentials for moving dislocations and the resulting Jefimenko equations. We also compute stresses and strains. The paper includes two physical situations: when the vacancy number is fixed and when the number is fluctuating. If defects are present we show a constraint that needs to be satisfied by them when they climb perpendicularly to their Burgers vector. Next, we extend the classic result of Peach and Koehler for the force between two dislocations and show that, similarly, to moving charges in electrodynamics, it is non-reciprocal, when one dislocation is moving. We argue that our formalism can be extended beyond Cauchy's elasticity by exploiting the simplifications provided by the dual gauge formulation of elastic stresses.</description>

      <title>Computational Microscopy beyond Perfect Lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in situ coherent diffractive imaging (CDI), which harnesses the coherent interference between a strong and a weak beam illuminating a static and dynamic structure, can be a very dose-efficient imaging method. At low doses, in situ CDI can achieve higher resolution than perfect lenses with the point spread function as a delta function. Both our numerical simulation and experimental results show that the combination of in situ CDI and ptychography can reduce the dose by two orders of magnitude over ptychography. We expect that computational microscopy based on in situ CDI can be implemented in different imaging modalities with photons and electrons for low-dose imaging of radiation-sensitive materials and biological samples.</description>
