      <title>MRDust: Wireless Implant Data Uplink &amp; Localization via Magnetic Resonance Image Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exhibits rich and clinically useful endogenous contrast mechanisms, which can differentiate soft tissues and are sensitive to flow, diffusion, magnetic susceptibility, blood oxygenation level, and more. However, MRI sensitivity is ultimately constrained by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) physics, and its spatiotemporal resolution is limited by SNR and spatial encoding. On the other hand, miniaturized implantable sensors offer highly localized physiological information, yet communication and localization can be challenging when multiple implants are present. This paper introduces the MRDust, an active ``contrast agent" that integrates active sensor implants with MRI, enabling the direct encoding of highly localized physiological data into MR images to augment the anatomical images. MRDust employs a micrometer-scale on-chip coil to actively modulate the local magnetic field, enabling MR signal amplitude and phase modulation for digital data transmission. Since MRI inherently captures the anatomical tissue structure, this method has the potential to enable simultaneous data communication, localization, and image registration with multiple implants. This paper presents the underlying physical principles, design tradeoffs, and design methodology for this approach. To validate the concept, a 900 $\times$ 990 $\mu$m$^2$ chip was designed using TSMC 28 nm technology, with an on-chip coil measuring 630 $\mu$m in diameter. The chip was tested with custom hardware in an MR750W GE3T MRI scanner. Successful voxel amplitude modulation is demonstrated with Spin-Echo Echo-Planar-Imaging (SE-EPI) sequence, achieving a contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of 25.58 with a power consumption of 130 $\mu$W.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Resolution of Process-Based Life Cycle Analysis with Model-Based Systems Engineering \&amp; Hetero-functional Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Life cycle analysis (LCA) has emerged as a vital tool for assessing the environmental impacts of products, processes, and systems throughout their entire lifecycle. It provides a systematic approach to quantifying resource consumption, emissions, and waste, enabling industries, researchers, and policymakers to identify hotspots for sustainability improvements. By providing a comprehensive assessment of systems, from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal, LCA facilitates the development of environmentally sound strategies, thereby contributing significantly to sustainable engineering and informed decision-making. Despite its strengths and ubiquitous use, life cycle analysis has not been reconciled with the broader literature in model-based systems engineering and analysis, thus hindering its integration into the design of complex systems more generally. This lack of reconciliation poses a significant problem, as it hinders the seamless integration of environmental sustainability into the design and optimization of complex systems. Without alignment between life cycle analysis (LCA) and model-based systems engineering (MBSE), sustainability remains an isolated consideration rather than an inherent part of the system's architecture and design. The original contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper reconciles process-based life cycle analysis with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory. It ultimately proves that model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory are a formal generalization of process-based life cycle analysis. Secondly, the paper demonstrates how model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory may be used to enhance the spatio-temporal resolution of process-based life cycle analysis in a manner that aligns with system design objectives.</description>

      <title>Sensor Fusion Methods for Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consensus is a popular technique for distributed state estimation. This formulation allows networks of connected agents or sensors to exchange information about the distribution of a set of targets with their immediate neighbors without the need of a centralized node or layer. We present decentralized consensus-based fusion techniques for a system whose target prior estimates are a weighted mixture of Gaussian probability density functions (PDFs) for the following cases: 1) in which all agents have the same a priori Gaussian mixture estimate of the target, and 2) in which agents have different a priori Gaussian mixture estimates of the target. For the second case, we present a formulation that fuses each agent's a priori estimate without using local observations such that each agent's posterior estimate is the same across the network.</description>

      <title>Integrative, Scalable Modeling of Hydrological Systems with MBSE and HFGT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Worsening global challenges in the Anthropocene demand complex, adaptive solutions grounded in a systems-level understanding of coupled social and environmental dynamics. However, existing modeling approaches often fall short due to disciplinary silos, limited scalability, and the absence of shared ontological frameworks. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), when integrated with Hetero-functional Graph Theory (HFGT), offers a powerful methodology for modeling systems of systems while preserving subsystem heterogeneity and enabling cross-disciplinary integration. This paper presents the first application of the MBSE-HFGT methodology to environmental systems, using a series of worked examples involving flow through lake and land segments. These examples demonstrate how the approach enables consistent, scalable, and integrative modeling of complex environmental processes.</description>

      <title>Bi-Level optimization for parameter estimation of differential equations using interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse problem or parameter estimation of ordinary differential equations is a process of obtaining the best parameters using experimental measurements of the states. Single (Multiple)-shooting is a type of sequential optimization method that minimizes the error in the measured and numerically integrated states. However, this requires computing sensitivities i.e. the derivatives of states with respect to the parameters over the numerical integrator, which can get computationally expensive. To address this challenge, many interpolation-based approaches have been proposed to either reduce the computational cost of sensitivity calculations or eliminate their need. In this paper, we use a bi-level optimization framework that leverages interpolation and exploits the structure of the differential equation to solve an inner convex optimization problem. We apply this method to two different problem formulations. First, parameter estimation for differential equations, and delayed differential equations, where the model structure is known but the parameters are unknown. Second, model discovery problems, where both the model structure and parameters are unknown.</description>

      <title>Conceal Truth while Show Fake: T/F Frequency Multiplexing based Anti-Intercepting Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wireless communication adversarial scenarios, signals are easily intercepted by non-cooperative parties, exposing the transmission of confidential information. This paper proposes a true-and-false (T/F) frequency multiplexing based anti-intercepting transmission scheme capable of concealing truth while showing fake (CTSF), integrating both offensive and defensive strategies. Specifically, through multi-source cooperation, true and false signals are transmitted over multiple frequency bands using non-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. The decoy signals are used to deceive non-cooperative eavesdropper, while the true signals are hidden to counter interception threats. Definitions for the interception and deception probabilities are provided, and the mechanism of CTSF is discussed. To improve the secrecy performance of true signals while ensuring decoy signals achieve their deceptive purpose, we model the problem as maximizing the sum secrecy rate of true signals, with constraint on the decoy effect. Furthermore, we propose a bi-stage alternating dual-domain optimization approach for joint optimization of both power allocation and correlation coefficients among multiple sources, and a Newton's method is proposed for fitting the T/F frequency multiplexing factor. In addition, simulation results verify the efficiency of anti-intercepting performance of our proposed CTSF scheme.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Spatio-Temporal Features Extraction based Industrial Process Modeling and Monitoring by Soft Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven soft sensors have been widely applied in complex industrial processes. However, the interpretable spatio-temporal features extraction by soft sensors remains a challenge. In this light, this work introduces a novel method termed spatio-temporal consistent and interpretable model (STCIM). First, temporal and spatial features are captured and aligned by a far topological spatio-temporal consistency extraction block. Then, the features are mapped into an interpretable latent space for further prediction by explicitly giving physical meanings to latent variables. The efficacy of the proposed STCIM is demonstrated through the modeling of two generated datasets and a real-life dataset of coal-fired power plants. The corresponding experiments show: 1) The generalization of STCIM outperforms other methods, especially in different operation situations. 2) The far topological spatio-temporal consistency is vital for feature alignment. 3) The hyper-parameters of physics-informed interpretable latent space loss decide the performance of STCIM.</description>

      <title>HMPC-assisted Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Smart Home Energy Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes an Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL)-based energy management method for a smart home, which incorporates an implicit thermal dynamics model. In the proposed method, historical optimal decisions are first generated using a neural network-assisted Hierarchical Model Predictive Control (HMPC) framework. These decisions are then used as expert demonstrations in the AIRL module, which aims to train a discriminator to distinguish expert demonstrations from transitions generated by a reinforcement learning agent policy, while simultaneously updating the agent policy that can produce transitions to confuse the discriminator. The proposed HMPC-AIRL method eliminates the need for explicit thermal dynamics models, prior or predictive knowledge of uncertain parameters, or manually designed reward functions. Simulation results based on real-world traces demonstrate the effectiveness and data efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>IAE Optimized PID Tuning with Phase Margin and Crossover Frequency Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents PMwc-Tune, a novel PID tuning method that uniquely combines frequency-domain robustness constraints with time-domain performance optimization through constrained nonlinear programming. The key contribution is a unified formulation that simultaneously enforces phase margin and crossover frequency requirements (via nonlinear equality constraints) while minimizing the Integral Absolute Error (IAE) of the closed-loop response. The algorithm employs Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) to solve this constrained optimization problem, guaranteeing specification attainment within numerical tolerances while optimizing transient performance. Numerical validation on benchmark systems demonstrates precise convergence to design targets (phase margin and crossover frequency errors &lt;1%) with a 4.6% IAE reduction compared to MATLAB's pidtune. The open-source implementation provides both methodological transparency and practical design flexibility, enabling PID controllers that rigorously balance frequency-domain robustness and time-domain performance.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Noncoherent SWIPT in Multi-Functional RIS-Aided Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the design of chaotic signal-based transmit waveforms in a multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS)-aided set-up for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. We propose a differential chaos shift keying-based MF-RIS-aided set-up, where the MF-RIS is partitioned into three non-overlapping surfaces. The elements of the first sub-surface perform energy harvesting (EH), which in turn, provide the required power to the other two sub-surfaces responsible for transmission and reflection of the incident signal. By considering a frequency selective scenario and a realistic EH model, we characterize the chaotic MF-RIS-aided system in terms of its EH performance and the associated bit error rate. Thereafter, we characterize the harvested energy-bit error rate trade-off and derive a lower bound on the number of elements required to operate in the EH mode. Accordingly, we propose novel transmit waveform designs to demonstrate the importance of the choice of appropriate system parameters in the context of achieving self-sustainability.</description>

      <title>Distributed perception of social power in influence networks with stubborn individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social power quantifies the ability of individuals to influence others and plays a central role in social influence networks. Yet computing social power typically requires global knowledge and significant computational or storage capability, especially in large-scale networks with stubborn individuals. This paper develops distributed algorithms for social power perception in groups with stubborn individuals. We propose two dynamical models for distributed perception of social power based on the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics: one without and one with reflected appraisals. In both scenarios, our perception mechanism begins with independent initial perceptions and relies primarily on local information: each individual only needs to know its neighbors' stubbornness or self-appraisals, the influence weights they accord and the group size. We provide rigorous dynamical system analysis to characterize the properties of equilibria, invariant sets and convergence. Conditions under which individuals' perceived social power converges to the actual social power are established. The proposed perception mechanism demonstrates strong robustness to reflected appraisals, irrational perceptions, and timescale variations. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>React to Surprises: Stable-by-Design Neural Feedback Control and the Youla-REN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study parameterizations of stabilizing nonlinear policies for learning-based control. We propose a structure based on a nonlinear version of the Youla-Ku\v{c}era parameterization combined with robust neural networks such as the recurrent equilibrium network (REN). The resulting parameterizations are unconstrained, and hence can be searched over with first-order optimization methods, while always ensuring closed-loop stability by construction. We study the combination of (a) nonlinear dynamics, (b) partial observation, and (c) incremental closed-loop stability requirements (contraction and Lipschitzness). We find that with any two of these three difficulties, a contracting and Lipschitz Youla parameter always leads to contracting and Lipschitz closed loops. However, if all three hold, then incremental stability can be lost with exogenous disturbances. Instead, a weaker condition is maintained, which we call d-tube contraction and Lipschitzness. We further obtain converse results showing that the proposed parameterization covers all contracting and Lipschitz closed loops for certain classes of nonlinear systems. Numerical experiments illustrate the utility of our parameterization when learning controllers with built-in stability certificates for: i) ``economic'' rewards without stabilizing effects; ii) short training horizons; and iii) uncertain systems.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the Conditional Probability Densities of Time Interval Extrema for Risk-Sensitive Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planning and scheduling activities in the electrical power system, such as the commitment of reserve generation, often involve statistical characterization of peak demand. Extreme Value Analysis (EVA)-based probabilistic assessments of annual peaks are widely adopted by energy regulatory and oversight agencies to determine the likelihood and severity of potential energy shortfalls. Due to the inability of classical EVA to account for peak distributions that change with annual extreme temperatures, popular existing approaches apply EVA on simulated annual peaks created by weather-dependent surrogate models using Mont\'e-Carlo simulations on a per-scenario basis. In higher time resolutions such as day-ahead scheduling, the daily peak demand changes upon various factors besides temperature, Mont\'e-Carlo experiments become intractable, and EVA-based modeling manifests as a methodological vacuum. This article explores uncharted territories and pioneers an unparalleled nonstationary EVA estimator that predicts the probable peaks of high-resolution time intervals and their corresponding conditional probability densities based on calendar information and weather conditions where historical peaks are observed. We present a case study on the determination of day-ahead scheduling capacity and demonstrate that compared to the industry approach, our approach results in a $38\%$ reduction in the yearly total committed capacity while maintaining the given risk requirement.</description>

      <title>Captivity-Escape Games as a Means for Safety in Online Motion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method that addresses the conservatism, computational effort, and limited numerical accuracy of existing frameworks and methods that ensure safety in online model-based motion generation, commonly referred to as fast and safe tracking. Computational limitations restrict online motion planning to low-fidelity models. However, planning with low-fidelity models compromises safety, as the dynamic feasibility of resulting reference trajectories is not ensured. This potentially leads to unavoidable tracking errors that may cause safety-critical constraint violations. Existing frameworks mitigate this safety risk by augmenting safety-critical constraints in motion planning by a safety margin that prevents constraint violations under worst-case tracking errors. However, the methods employed in these frameworks determine the safety margin based on a heuristically selected performance of the planning model, which likely results in overly conservative reference trajectories. Furthermore, these methods are computationally intensive, and the state-of-the-art method is limited in numerical accuracy. We adopt a different perspective and address these limitations with a method that mitigates conservatism in existing frameworks by adapting the planning model performance to a given safety margin. Our method achieves numerical accuracy and requires significantly less computation time than existing methods by leveraging a captivity-escape game, which is a specific zero-sum differential game formulated in this paper. We demonstrate our method using a numerical example and compare it to the state of the art.</description>

Abstract: The major challenges to battery electric truck adoption are their high cost and grid congestion.In this context, stationary energy storage systems can help mitigate both issues. Since their design and operation are strongly coupled, to make the best out of them, they should be jointly optimized. This paper presents a co-design framework for hybrid energy storage systems where their technology and sizing are optimized jointly with their operational strategies. Specifically, we consider a microgrid supporting truck chargers that consists of utility grid, solar panels, and energy storage systems including batteries, supercapacitors and flywheels. We frame the co-design problem as a mixed-integer linear program that can be solved with global optimality guarantees. We showcase our framework in a case-study of a distribution center in the Netherlands. Our results show that although the battery-only configuration is already competitive, adding supercapacitors or flywheel storage decrease total cost and increase energy sold back to the grid. Overall, the fully hybrid solution (Battery+Supercapacitors+Flywheel) offers the best outcomes, achieving the lowest overall cost (1.96\% lower compared to battery-only) and reduced grid dependency, but at a higher (2.6\%) initial investment.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Left- and Right-Invariant Extended Kalman Filters on Matrix Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper derives the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for continuous-time systems on matrix Lie groups observed through discrete-time measurements. By modeling the system noise on the Lie algebra and adopting a Stratonovich interpretation for the stochastic differential equation (SDE), we ensure that solutions remain on the manifold. The derivation of the filter follows classical EKF principles, naturally integrating a necessary full-order covariance reset post-measurement update. A key contribution is proving that this full-order covariance reset guarantees that the Lie-group-valued state estimate is invariant to whether a left- or right-invariant error definition is used in the EKF. Monte Carlo simulations of the aided inertial navigation problem validate the invariance property and confirm its absence when employing reduced-order covariance resets.</description>

      <title>Interpretable reinforcement learning for heat pump control through asymmetric differentiable decision trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have gained traction in home energy management systems. However, their adoption by energy management companies remains limited due to the black-box nature of DRL, which fails to provide transparent decision-making feedback. To address this, explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) techniques have emerged, aiming to make DRL decisions more transparent. Among these, soft differential decision tree (DDT) distillation provides a promising approach due to the clear decision rules they are based on, which can be efficiently computed. However, achieving high performance often requires deep, and completely full, trees, which reduces interpretability. To overcome this, we propose a novel asymmetric soft DDT construction method. Unlike traditional soft DDTs, our approach adaptively constructs trees by expanding nodes only when necessary. This improves the efficient use of decision nodes, which require a predetermined depth to construct full symmetric trees, enhancing both interpretability and performance. We demonstrate the potential of asymmetric DDTs to provide transparent, efficient, and high-performing decision-making in home energy management systems.</description>

      <title>A Vertical Approach to Designing and Managing Sustainable Heterogeneous Edge Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) computing poses significant environmental challenges, with both operational and embodied carbon emissions becoming major contributors. This paper presents a carbon-aware holistic methodology for designing and managing sustainable Edge Data Centers (EDCs), based on three design principles that challenge the state-of-the-art optimization paradigms. Our approach employs vertical integration across the architecture, system, and runtime layers, balances operational and embodied carbon emissions while considering EDC performance as a co-optimization objective, rather than a constraint. At the architecture level, we propose carbon-aware and approximate accelerator designs to reduce embodied carbon. At the system level, we enhance resource utilization and adapt to real-time carbon intensity variations to minimize operational emissions. Finally, at the runtime level, we develop dynamic scheduling frameworks that adjust execution, based on energy constraints and carbon intensity.</description>

      <title>Update-Aware Robust Optimal Model Predictive Control for Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust optimal or min-max model predictive control (MPC) approaches aim to guarantee constraint satisfaction over a known, bounded uncertainty set while minimizing a worst-case performance bound. Traditionally, these methods compute a trajectory that meets the desired properties over a fixed prediction horizon, apply a portion of the resulting input, and then re-solve the MPC problem using newly obtained measurements at the next time step. However, this approach fails to account for the fact that the control trajectory will be updated in the future, potentially leading to conservative designs. In this paper, we present a novel update-aware robust optimal MPC algorithm for decreasing horizon problems on nonlinear systems that explicitly accounts for future control trajectory updates. This additional insight allows our method to provably expand the feasible solution set and guarantee improved worst-case performance bounds compared to existing techniques. Our approach formulates the trajectory generation problem as a sequence of nested existence-constrained semi-infinite programs (SIPs), which can be efficiently solved using local reduction techniques. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluate our approach on a planar quadrotor problem, where it clearly outperforms an equivalent method that does not account for future updates at the cost of increased computation time.</description>

      <title>Smooth Logic Constraints in Nonlinear Optimization and Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In some optimal control problems, complex relationships between states and inputs cannot be easily represented using continuous constraints, necessitating the use of discrete logic instead. This paper presents a method for incorporating such logic constraints directly within continuous optimization frameworks, eliminating the need for binary variables or specialized solvers. Our approach reformulates arbitrary logic constraints under minimal assumptions as max-min constraints, which are then smoothed by introducing auxiliary variables into the optimization problem. When these reformulated constraints are satisfied, they guarantee that the original logical conditions hold, ensuring correctness in the optimization process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on two planar quadrotor control tasks with complex logic constraints. Compared to existing techniques for encoding logic in continuous optimization, our approach achieves faster computational performance and improved convergence to feasible solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Generalized Super-Twisting Observer (GSTO) is extended for a strongly observable class of nonlinearly interconnected systems with bounded uncertainties/perturbations. A nonsmooth strong Lyapunov function is used to prove the finite-time convergence of the proposed observer to the true system's trajectories, in the presence of the uncertainties. A case study on the interaction between two food production systems is presented, comparing the proposed observer with the High Gain observer. The results emphasize the critical role of the GSTO's discontinuous term in achieving exact estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01755v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of spatio-temporally chaos is challenging because of high dimensionality and unpredictability. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) discovers optimal control policies by interacting with the system, typically requiring observations of the full physical state. In practice, sensors often provide only partial and noisy measurements (observations) of the system. The objective of this paper is to develop a framework that enables the control of chaotic systems with partial and noisy observability. The proposed method, data-assimilated model-informed reinforcement learning (DA-MIRL), integrates (i) low-order models to approximate high-dimensional dynamics; (ii) sequential data assimilation to correct the model prediction when observations become available; and (iii) an off-policy actor-critic RL algorithm to adaptively learn an optimal control strategy based on the corrected state estimates. We test DA-MIRL on the spatiotemporally chaotic solutions of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. We estimate the full state of the environment with (i) a physics-based model, here, a coarse-grained model; and (ii) a data-driven model, here, the control-aware echo state network, which is proposed in this paper. We show that DA-MIRL successfully estimates and suppresses the chaotic dynamics of the environment in real time from partial observations and approximate models. This work opens opportunities for the control of partially observable chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid SIS Dynamics for Demand Modeling of Frequently Updated Products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid spreading process model to capture the dynamics of demand for software-based products. We introduce discontinuous jumps in the state to model sudden surges in demand that can be seen immediately after a product update is released. After each update, the modeled demand evolves according to a continuous-time susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model. We identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for estimating the hybrid model's parameters for an arbitrary finite number of sequential updates. We verify the parameter estimation conditions in simulation, and evaluate how the estimation of these parameters is impacted by the presence of observation and process noise. We then validate our model by applying our estimation method to daily user engagement data for a regularly updating software product, the live-service video game `Apex Legends.'</description>

      <title>Federated learning framework for collaborative remaining useful life prognostics: an aircraft engine case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex systems such as aircraft engines are continuously monitored by sensors. In predictive aircraft maintenance, the collected sensor measurements are used to estimate the health condition and the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of such systems. However, a major challenge when developing prognostics is the limited number of run-to-failure data samples. This challenge could be overcome if multiple airlines would share their run-to-failure data samples such that sufficient learning can be achieved. Due to privacy concerns, however, airlines are reluctant to share their data in a centralized setting. In this paper, a collaborative federated learning framework is therefore developed instead. Here, several airlines cooperate to train a collective RUL prognostic machine learning model, without the need to centrally share their data. For this, a decentralized validation procedure is proposed to validate the prognostics model without sharing any data. Moreover, sensor data is often noisy and of low quality. This paper therefore proposes four novel methods to aggregate the parameters of the global prognostic model. These methods enhance the robustness of the FL framework against noisy data. The proposed framework is illustrated for training a collaborative RUL prognostic model for aircraft engines, using the N-CMAPSS dataset. Here, six airlines are considered, that collaborate in the FL framework to train a collective RUL prognostic model for their aircraft's engines. When comparing the proposed FL framework with the case where each airline independently develops their own prognostic model, the results show that FL leads to more accurate RUL prognostics for five out of the six airlines. Moreover, the novel robust aggregation methods render the FL framework robust to noisy data samples.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Traffic-Following Scheme for Orderly Distributed Control of Multi-Vehicle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an adaptive control scheme to enable the emergence of order within distributed, autonomous multi-agent systems. Past studies showed that under high-density conditions, order generated from traffic-following behavior reduces travel times, while under low densities, choosing direct paths is more beneficial. In this paper, we leveraged those findings to allow aircraft to independently and dynamically adjust their degree of traffic-following behavior based on the current state of the airspace. This enables aircraft to follow other traffic only when beneficial. Quantitative analyses revealed that dynamic traffic-following behavior results in lower aircraft travel times at the cost of minimal levels of additional disorder to the airspace. The sensitivity of these benefits to temporal and spatial horizons was also investigated. Overall, this work highlights the benefits, and potential necessity, of incorporating self-organizing behavior in making distributed, autonomous multi-agent systems scalable.</description>

      <title>Action Dependency Graphs for Globally Optimal Coordinated Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Action-dependent individual policies, which incorporate both environmental states and the actions of other agents in decision-making, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving global optimality in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, the existing literature often adopts auto-regressive action-dependent policies, where each agent's policy depends on the actions of all preceding agents. This formulation incurs substantial computational complexity as the number of agents increases, thereby limiting scalability. In this work, we consider a more generalized class of action-dependent policies, which do not necessarily follow the auto-regressive form. We propose to use the `action dependency graph (ADG)' to model the inter-agent action dependencies. Within the context of MARL problems structured by coordination graphs, we prove that an action-dependent policy with a sparse ADG can achieve global optimality, provided the ADG satisfies specific conditions specified by the coordination graph. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop a tabular policy iteration algorithm with guaranteed global optimality. Furthermore, we integrate our framework into several SOTA algorithms and conduct experiments in complex environments. The empirical results affirm the robustness and applicability of our approach in more general scenarios, underscoring its potential for broader MARL challenges.</description>

      <title>RoboTwin: A Robotic Teleoperation Framework Using Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic surgery imposes a significant cognitive burden on the surgeon. This cognitive burden increases in the case of remote robotic surgeries due to latency between entities and thus might affect the quality of surgery. Here, the patient side and the surgeon side are geographically separated by hundreds to thousands of kilometres. Real-time teleoperation of robots requires strict latency bounds for control and feedback. We propose a dual digital twin (DT) framework and explain the simulation environment and teleoperation framework. Here, the doctor visually controls the locally available DT of the patient side and thus experiences minimum latency. The second digital twin serves two purposes. Firstly, it provides a layer of safety for operator-related mishaps, and secondly, it conveys the coordinates of known and unknown objects back to the operator's side digital twin. We show that teleoperation accuracy and user experience are enhanced with our approach. Experimental results using the NASA-TLX metric show that the quality of surgery is vastly improved with DT, perhaps due to reduced cognitive burden. The network data rate for identifying objects at the operator side is 25x lower than normal.</description>

      <title>AEQUAM: Accelerating Quantum Algorithm Validation through FPGA-Based Emulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents AEQUAM (Area Efficient QUAntum eMulation), a toolchain that enables faster and more accessible quantum circuit verification. It consists of a compiler that translates OpenQASM 2.0 into RISC-like instructions, Cython software models for selecting number representations and simulating circuits, and a VHDL generator that produces RTL descriptions for FPGA-based hardware emulators. The architecture leverages a SIMD approach to parallelize computation and reduces complexity by exploiting the sparsity of quantum gate matrices. The VHDL generator allows customization of the number of emulated qubits and parallelization levels to meet user requirements. Synthesized on an Altera Cyclone 10LP FPGA with a 20-bit fixed-point representation and nearest-type approximation, the architecture demonstrates better scalability than other state-of-the-art emulators. Specifically, the emulator has been validated by exploiting the well consolidated benchmark of mqt bench framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods have recently shown successful results for conditional sampling of generative diffusion models. In this paper we propose a new diffusion posterior SMC sampler achieving improved statistical efficiencies, particularly under outlier conditions or highly informative likelihoods. The key idea is to construct an observation path that correlates with the diffusion model and to design the sampler to leverage this correlation for more efficient sampling. Empirical results conclude the efficiency.</description>

Abstract: We consider iterative gradient-based optimization algorithms applied to functions that are smooth and strongly convex. The fastest globally convergent algorithm for this class of functions is the Triple Momentum (TM) method. We show that if the objective function is also twice continuously differentiable, a new, faster algorithm emerges, which we call $C^2$-Momentum (C2M). We prove that C2M is globally convergent and that its worst-case convergence rate is strictly faster than that of TM, with no additional computational cost. We validate our theoretical findings with numerical examples, demonstrating that C2M outperforms TM when the objective function is twice continuously differentiable.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Learning of Stabilizing Neural Controllers via Zubov Sampling and Iterative Domain Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based neural network (NN) control policies have shown impressive empirical performance. However, obtaining stability guarantees and estimations of the region of attraction of these learned neural controllers is challenging due to the lack of stable and scalable training and verification algorithms. Although previous works in this area have achieved great success, much conservatism remains in their framework. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage training framework to jointly synthesize the controller and Lyapunov function for continuous-time systems. By leveraging a Zubov-inspired region of attraction characterization to directly estimate stability boundaries, we propose a novel training data sampling strategy and a domain updating mechanism that significantly reduces the conservatism in training. Moreover, unlike existing works on continuous-time systems that rely on an SMT solver to formally verify the Lyapunov condition, we extend state-of-the-art neural network verifier $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN with the capability of performing automatic bound propagation through the Jacobian of dynamical systems and a novel verification scheme that avoids expensive bisection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct numerical experiments by synthesizing and verifying controllers on several challenging nonlinear systems across multiple dimensions. We show that our training can yield region of attractions with volume $5 - 1.5\cdot 10^{5}$ times larger compared to the baselines, and our verification on continuous systems can be up to $40-10000$ times faster compared to the traditional SMT solver dReal.

      <title>Quantitative Error Feedback for Quantization Noise Reduction of Filtering over Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative error feedback framework designed to mitigate quantization noise in distributed graph filtering, where communications are constrained to quantized messages. It comes from error spectrum shaping techniques from state-space digital filters, and therefore establishes connections between quantized filtering processes over different domains. In contrast to existing error compensation methods, our framework quantitatively feeds back the quantization noise for exact compensation. We examine the framework under three key scenarios: (i) deterministic graph filtering, (ii) graph filtering over random graphs, and (iii) graph filtering with random node-asynchronous updates. Rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed framework significantly reduces the effect of quantization noise, and we provide closed-form solutions for the optimal error feedback coefficients. Moreover, this quantitative error feedback mechanism can be seamlessly integrated into communication-efficient decentralized optimization frameworks, enabling lower error floors. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, consistently showing that our method outperforms conventional quantization strategies in terms of both accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <title>A State of the Art on Recent Progress and Emerging Challenges on Energy Transfer Between Vibrating Modes Under an External Mechanical Force With Time-Varying Frequency From 2020 to 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss an example of current importance with a future perspective in engineering, in which excitation sources always have limited power, limited inertia, and their frequencies vary according to the instantaneous state of the vibrating system. Practical examples of non-ideal systems are considered. The most common phenomenon for this kind of system is discussed. The period considered is from 2020 to 2025. The specific properties of various models are also discussed. Directions for future investigations are provided. In this paper, the authors revisited some publications based on the assumption that the external excitations are produced by non-ideal sources (RNIS), that is, with limited power supply. Among these applications, nonlinear phenomena such as the Sommerfeld effect and saturation phenomenon were observed, considering fractional damping. Energy harvesters and the Jacobi-Anger expansion were used in the governing equations of motion. We also used the Jacobi-Anger expansion in the case of energy transfer between vibrating modes under an external force with time-varying frequency, which represents one of the future directions of research on non-ideal vibrating systems (RNIS).</description>

      <title>ADEPT: Adaptive Diffusion Environment for Policy Transfer Sim-to-Real</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful method for developing robust robot control policies capable of navigating through complex and unstructured environments. The effectiveness of these methods hinges on two essential elements: (1) the use of massively parallel physics simulations to expedite policy training, and (2) an environment generator tasked with crafting sufficiently challenging yet attainable environments to facilitate continuous policy improvement. Existing methods of outdoor environment generation often rely on heuristics constrained by a set of parameters, limiting the diversity and realism. In this work, we introduce ADEPT, a novel \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{E}nvironment for \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{T}ransfer in the zero-shot sim-to-real fashion that leverages Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models to dynamically expand existing training environments by adding more diverse and complex environments adaptive to the current policy. ADEPT guides the diffusion model's generation process through initial noise optimization, blending noise-corrupted environments from existing training environments weighted by the policy's performance in each corresponding environment. By manipulating the noise corruption level, ADEPT seamlessly transitions between generating similar environments for policy fine-tuning and novel ones to expand training diversity. To benchmark ADEPT in off-road navigation, we propose a fast and effective multi-layer map representation for wild environment generation. Our experiments show that the policy trained by ADEPT outperforms both procedural generated and natural environments, along with popular navigation methods.</description>

      <title>Systematic Hazard Analysis for Frontier AI using STPA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All of the frontier AI companies have published safety frameworks where they define capability thresholds and risk mitigations that determine how they will safely develop and deploy their models. Adoption of systematic approaches to risk modelling, based on established practices used in safety-critical industries, has been recommended, however frontier AI companies currently do not describe in detail any structured approach to identifying and analysing hazards. STPA (Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis) is a systematic methodology for identifying how complex systems can become unsafe, leading to hazards. It achieves this by mapping out controllers and controlled processes then analysing their interactions and feedback loops to understand how harmful outcomes could occur (Leveson &amp; Thomas, 2018). We evaluate STPA's ability to broaden the scope, improve traceability and strengthen the robustness of safety assurance for frontier AI systems. Applying STPA to the threat model and scenario described in 'A Sketch of an AI Control Safety Case' (Korbak et al., 2025), we derive a list of Unsafe Control Actions. From these we select a subset and explore the Loss Scenarios that lead to them if left unmitigated. We find that STPA is able to identify causal factors that may be missed by unstructured hazard analysis methodologies thereby improving robustness. We suggest STPA could increase the safety assurance of frontier AI when used to complement or check coverage of existing AI governance techniques including capability thresholds, model evaluations and emergency procedures. The application of a systematic methodology supports scalability by increasing the proportion of the analysis that could be conducted by LLMs, reducing the burden on human domain experts.</description>

Abstract: This paper discusses reduction by symmetries for autonomous and non-autonomous forced mechanical systems with inelastic collisions. In particular, we introduce the notion of generalized hybrid momentum map and hybrid constants of the motion to give general conditions on whether it is possible to perform symmetry reduction for Hamiltonian and Lagrangian systems subject to non-conservative external forces and non-elastic impacts, as well as its extension to time-dependent mechanical systems subject to time-dependent external forces and time-dependent inelastic collisions. We illustrate the applicability of the method with examples and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Extended Set-based Tasks for Multi-task Execution and Prioritization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability of executing multiple tasks simultaneously is an important feature of redundant robotic systems. As a matter of fact, complex behaviors can often be obtained as a result of the execution of several tasks. Moreover, in safety-critical applications, tasks designed to ensure the safety of the robot and its surroundings have to be executed along with other nominal tasks. In such cases, it is also important to prioritize the former over the latter. In this paper, we formalize the definition of extended set-based tasks, i.e., tasks which can be executed by rendering subsets of the task space asymptotically stable or forward invariant using control barrier functions. We propose a formal mathematical representation of such tasks that allows for the execution of more complex and time-varying prioritized stacks of tasks using kinematic and dynamic robot models alike. We present an optimization-based framework which is computationally efficient, accounts for input bounds, and allows for the stable execution of time-varying prioritized stacks of extended set-based tasks. The proposed framework is validated using extensive simulations, quantitative comparisons to the state-of-the-art hierarchical quadratic programming, and experiments with robotic manipulators.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of controlling a linear system under possibly unbounded stochastic noise with unknown convex cost functions, known as an online control problem. In contrast to the existing work, which assumes the boundedness of noise, we show that an $ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ high-probability regret can be achieved under unbounded noise, where $ T $ denotes the time horizon. Notably, the noise is only required to have a finite fourth moment. Moreover, when the costs are strongly convex and the noise is sub-Gaussian, we establish an $ O({\rm poly} (\log T)) $ regret bound.</description>

      <title>A Tunable Universal Formula for Safety-Critical Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sontag's universal formula is a widely used technique for stabilizing control through control Lyapunov functions. Recently, it has been extended to address safety-critical control by incorporating control barrier functions (CBFs). However, deriving a universal formula that satisfies requirements on essential properties, including safety, smoothness, and robustness against input disturbances, is still an open problem. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel solution - a tunable universal formula - by incorporating a (state-dependent) tunable term into Sontag's formula. This tunable term enables the regulation of safety-critical control performances, allowing the attainment of desired properties through a proper selection of tunable terms. Generally, the tunable universal formula can be seen as a controller that improves the quadratic program (QP)-synthesized controllers in terms of robustness and smoothness, while also reducing the conservatism (corresponding to robustness) in Sontag's formula. Furthermore, we extend the tunable universal formula to address safety-critical control problems with norm-bounded input constraints, showcasing its applicability across diverse control scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method through a two-link manipulator safe tracking example, investigating the essential properties including safety, smoothness, and robustness against input disturbances under various tunable terms.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning for Adaptive Control with Automated Mirror Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive control achieves concurrent parameter learning and stable control under uncertainties that are linearly parameterized with known nonlinear features. Nonetheless, it is often difficult to obtain such nonlinear features. To address this difficulty, recent progress has been made in integrating meta-learning with adaptive control to learn such nonlinear features from data. However, these meta-learning-based control methods rely on classical adaptation laws using gradient descent, which is confined to the Euclidean geometry. In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines meta-learning and adaptation laws based on mirror descent, a popular generalization of gradient descent, which takes advantage of the potentially non-Euclidean geometry of the parameter space. In our approach, meta-learning not only learns the nonlinear features but also searches for a suitable mirror-descent potential function that optimizes control performance. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in learning efficient representations and real-time tracking control performance under uncertain dynamics.</description>

      <title>End-to-end guarantees for indirect data-driven control of bilinear systems with finite stochastic data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose an end-to-end algorithm for indirect data-driven control for bilinear systems with stability guarantees. We consider the case where the collected i.i.d. data is affected by probabilistic noise with possibly unbounded support and leverage tools from statistical learning theory to derive finite sample identification error bounds. To this end, we solve the bilinear identification problem by solving a set of linear and affine identification problems, by a particular choice of a control input during the data collection phase. We provide a priori as well as data-dependent finite sample identification error bounds on the individual matrices as well as ellipsoidal bounds, both of which are structurally suitable for control. Further, we integrate the structure of the derived identification error bounds in a robust controller design to obtain an exponentially stable closed-loop. By means of an extensive numerical study we showcase the interplay between the controller design and the derived identification error bounds. Moreover, we note appealing connections of our results to indirect data-driven control of general nonlinear systems through Koopman operator theory and discuss how our results may be applied in this setup.</description>

Abstract: There is increasing interest in developing the theoretical foundations of networked control systems that illuminate how brain networks function so as to enable sensory perception, control of movement, memory and all the operations that are needed for animals to survive. The present paper proposes a biologically inspired network model featuring dynamic connections regulated by Hebbian learning. Drawing on the machinery of graph theory and classical control we show that our novel nonlinear model exhibits such biologically plausible features as bounded evolution, stability, resilience, and a kind of structural stability -- meaning that perturbations of the model parameters leave the essential properties of the model in tact. The proposed network model involves generalized cactus graphs with multiple control input nodes, and it is shown that the properties of the network are resilient to various changes in network topology provided these changes preserve the generalized cactus structure. A particular example described in what follows is an idealized network model of the visual system of a macaque monkey. The model displays resilience to network disruptions such as might occur in a living organism due to disease or injury. A different model of the same type provides an example of a system that can perform data classification.</description>

      <title>Minimum Radiative Heat and Propellant Aerocapture Guidance with Attitude Kinematics Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aerocapture leverages atmospheric drag to convert a spacecraft's hyperbolic trajectory into a bound orbit. For some aerocapture missions, heating due to the radiation of high temperature gases in the shock-layer can be much larger than the heat due to convection. This paper provides analytical proof and numerical validation that radiative heat load is minimized by the same trajectory that minimizes the final {\Delta} V: a single switch bang-bang trajectory, starting with lift up. The proof is very general and is valid for several formulations of radiative heat flux; further, the same proof can be used to conclude that convective heat load, computed according to many of the available formulations, is instead maximized by that trajectory. Further, a novel guidance that plans a bang-bang trajectory with constraints in the attitude kinematics is introduced. While achieving performance similar to that of the current state-of-the-art, the inclusion of constraints in attitude kinematics allows for much less tuning. Finally, a lateral guidance that makes use of information on the final inclination of the predicted trajectory is introduced. Such guidance allows for very high accuracy in the inclination requirements with only two reversals, by requiring a single parameter to be tuned.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators for Predictor Feedback Control of Nonlinear Delay Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictor feedback designs are critical for delay-compensating controllers in nonlinear systems. However, these designs are limited in practical applications as predictors cannot be directly implemented, but require numerical approximation schemes, which become computationally prohibitive when system dynamics are expensive to compute. To address this challenge, we recast the predictor design as an operator learning problem, and learn the predictor mapping via a neural operator. We prove the existence of an arbitrarily accurate neural operator approximation of the predictor operator. Under the approximated predictor, we achieve semiglobal practical stability of the closed-loop nonlinear delay system. The estimate is semiglobal in a unique sense - one can enlarge the set of initial states as desired, though this increases the difficulty of training a neural operator, which appears practically in the stability estimate. Furthermore, our analysis holds for any black-box predictor satisfying the universal approximation error bound. We demonstrate the approach by controlling a 5-link robotic manipulator with different neural operator models, achieving significant speedups compared to classic predictor feedback schemes while maintaining closed-loop stability.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Analysis of Tensor Decomposition for Learning Mixtures of Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MLDS) from input-output data. The mixture setting allows us to leverage observations from related dynamical systems to improve the estimation of individual models. Building on spectral methods for mixtures of linear regressions, we propose a moment-based estimator that uses tensor decomposition to estimate the impulse response parameters of the mixture models. The estimator improves upon existing tensor decomposition approaches for MLDS by utilizing the entire length of the observed trajectories. We provide sample complexity bounds for estimating MLDS in the presence of noise, in terms of both the number of trajectories $N$ and the trajectory length $T$, and demonstrate the performance of the estimator through simulations.</description>

      <title>Comparative Performance Analysis of Numerical Discretization Methods for Electrochemical Models of Lithium-ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study evaluates numerical discretization methods for the Single Particle Model (SPM) used in electrochemical modeling. The methods include the Finite Difference Method (FDM), spectral methods, Pad\'e approximation, and parabolic approximation. Evaluation criteria are accuracy, execution time, and memory usage, aiming to guide method selection for electrochemical models. Under constant current conditions, the FDM explicit Euler and Runge-Kutta methods show significant errors, while the FDM implicit Euler method improves accuracy with more nodes. The spectral method achieves the best accuracy and convergence with as few as five nodes. The Pad\'e approximation exhibits increasing errors with higher current, and the parabolic approximation shows higher errors than the converged spectral and FDM implicit Euler methods. Under dynamic conditions, frequency domain analysis indicates that the FDM, spectral, and Pad\'e approximation methods improve high-frequency response by increasing node count or method order. In terms of execution time, the parabolic method is fastest, followed by the Pad\'e approximation. The spectral method is faster than FDM, while the FDM implicit Euler method is the slowest. Memory usage is lowest for the parabolic and Pad\'e methods, moderate for FDM, and highest for the spectral method. These findings provide practical guidance for selecting discretization methods under different operating scenarios.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Multirate Systems: A Direct Frequency-Domain Identification Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequency-domain performance analysis of intersample behavior in sampled-data and multirate systems is challenging due to the lack of a frequency-separation principle, and systematic identification techniques are lacking. The aim of this \manuscript is to develop an efficient technique for identifying the full intersample performance in the frequency-domain for closed-loop multirate systems, in particular the Performance Frequency Gain (PFG). Through local modeling techniques, aliased frequency components are effectively disentangled when identifying the PFG, which is directly facilitated by frequency-lifting the multirate system to a multivariable time-invariant representation. The developed method accurately and directly identifies the PFG in a single identification experiment. Finally, the developed method is experimentally validated on a prototype motion system, showing accurate identification of frequency-domain representations for the multirate system, including the PFG.</description>

      <title>Prioritized Planning for Continuous-time Lifelong Multi-agent Pathfinding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning collision-free movements of agents so that they get from where they are to where they need to be. Commonly, agents are located on a graph and can traverse edges. This problem has many variations and has been studied for decades. Two such variations are the continuous-time and the lifelong MAPF problems. In the former, edges have non-unit lengths and volumetric agents can traverse them at any real-valued time. In the latter, agents must attend to a continuous stream of incoming tasks. Much work has been devoted to designing solution methods within these two areas. To our knowledge, however, the combined problem of continuous-time lifelong MAPF has yet to be addressed. This work addresses continuous-time lifelong MAPF with volumetric agents by presenting the fast and sub-optimal Continuous-time Prioritized Lifelong Planner (CPLP). CPLP continuously assigns agents to tasks and computes plans using a combination of two path planners; one based on CCBS and the other based on SIPP. Experimental results with up to 800 agents on graphs with up to 12 000 vertices demonstrate practical performance, where maximum planning times fall within the available time budget. Additionally, CPLP ensures collision-free movement even when failing to meet this budget. Therefore, the robustness of CPLP highlights its potential for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>The value of hedging against energy storage uncertainties when designing energy parks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy storage is needed to match renewable generation to industrial loads in energy parks. However, the future performance of bulk storage technologies is currently highly uncertain. Due to the urgency of decarbonization targets, energy park projects must be designed and begun now. But, as uncertainty in storage performance reduces, a different technology than identified during initial design may turn out cheaper. Enabling flexibility so that design adaptations can be made as better information becomes available would lower the cost of decarbonizing industry. But having this flexibility is itself costly. This raises the question, "Is it worth it?"
  This study quantifies the benefit of retaining flexibility to adapt energy park designs and optionality over storage technology choice as uncertainty reduces, to determine whether it is economically worthwhile. It applies the Value of Information analysis framework to the sizing of wind, solar, and storage in an illustrative energy park model based on a real-world proposal near Rotterdam, considering uncertainty in storage efficiency, lifetime, and capital cost.
  Updating asset sizings after storage uncertainty reduced is found to reduce total costs by 18% on average. Having the option to switch storage technology choice as well reduces costs by a further 13%, which is substantially greater than the cost of providing storage optionality. Using two storage technologies in the energy park reduces costs by 14%, and in this case storage optionality is not worthwhile. These results are robust to the level of uncertainty reduction in storage performance, and the risk aversion of the system designer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As space missions become more complex, planning methods must maximize mission performance while rigorously enforcing safety. We develop a probabilistic approach based on a finite-horizon Markov decision process to optimize spacecraft operations planning with safety guarantees. In the model, states capture essential mission parameters, and actions represent the operational adjustments needed to meet mission objectives. By directly incorporating uncertainties from environmental conditions and spacecraft dynamics, an optimal sequence of actions is computed that maximizes expected rewards and strictly enforces safety constraints. Numerical experiments on the GRACE-FO mission demonstrate robust performance under uncertainties while providing probabilistic safety guarantees, offering a reliable solution for autonomous spacecraft operations.</description>

      <title>Application based Evaluation of an Efficient Spike-Encoder, "Spiketrum"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15927v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spike-based encoders represent information as sequences of spikes or pulses, which are transmitted between neurons. A prevailing consensus suggests that spike-based approaches demonstrate exceptional capabilities in capturing the temporal dynamics of neural activity and have the potential to provide energy-efficient solutions for low-power applications. The Spiketrum encoder efficiently compresses input data using spike trains or code sets (for non-spiking applications) and is adaptable to both hardware and software implementations, with lossless signal reconstruction capability. The paper proposes and assesses Spiketrum's hardware, evaluating its output under varying spike rates and its classification performance with popular spiking and non-spiking classifiers, and also assessing the quality of information compression and hardware resource utilization. The paper extensively benchmarks both Spiketrum hardware and its software counterpart against state-of-the-art, biologically-plausible encoders. The evaluations encompass benchmarking criteria, including classification accuracy, training speed, and sparsity when using encoder outputs in pattern recognition and classification with both spiking and non-spiking classifiers. Additionally, they consider encoded output entropy and hardware resource utilization and power consumption of the hardware version of the encoders. Results demonstrate Spiketrum's superiority in most benchmarking criteria, making it a promising choice for various applications. It efficiently utilizes hardware resources with low power consumption, achieving high classification accuracy. This work also emphasizes the potential of encoders in spike-based processing to improve the efficiency and performance of neural computing systems.</description>

      <title>On zero-shot learning in neural state estimation of power distribution systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of neural state estimation in power distribution systems. We identified a research gap in the current state of the art, which lies in the inability of models to adapt to changes in the power grid, such as loss of sensors and branch switching, in a zero-shot fashion. Based on the literature, we identified graph neural networks as the most promising class of models for this use case. Our experiments confirm their robustness to some grid changes and also show that a deeper network does not always perform better. We propose data augmentations to improve performance and conduct a comprehensive grid search of different model configurations for common zero-shot learning scenarios.</description>

      <title>Agile Decision-Making and Safety-Critical Motion Planning for Emergency Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08665v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiency is critical for autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially for emergency AVs. However, most existing methods focus on regular vehicles, overlooking the distinct strategies required by emergency vehicles to address the challenge of maximizing efficiency while ensuring safety. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Agile Decision-Making with Active and Safety-Critical Motion Planning System (IDEAM). IDEAM focuses on enabling emergency AVs, such as ambulances, to actively attain efficiency in dense traffic scenarios with safety in mind. Firstly, the speed-centric decision-making algorithm named the long short-term spatio-temporal graph-centric decision-making (LSGM) is given. LSGM comprises conditional depth-first search (C-DFS) for multiple paths generation as well as methods for speed gains and risk evaluation for path selection, which presents a robust algorithm for high efficiency and safety consideration. Secondly, with an output path from LSGM, the motion planner reconsiders environmental conditions to decide constraints states for the final planning stage, among which the lane-probing state is designed for actively attaining spatial and speed advantage. Thirdly, under the Frenet-based model predictive control (MPC) framework with final constraints state and selected path, the safety-critical motion planner employs decoupled discrete control barrier functions (DCBFs) and linearized discrete-time high-order control barrier functions (DHOCBFs) to model the constraints associated with different driving behaviors, making the optimal optimization problem convex. Finally, we extensively validate our system using scenarios from a randomly synthetic dataset, demonstrating its capability to achieve speed benefits and assure safety simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Learning to Drift in Extreme Turning with Active Exploration and Gaussian Process Based MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme cornering in racing often leads to large sideslip angles, presenting a significant challenge for vehicle control. Conventional vehicle controllers struggle to manage this scenario, necessitating the use of a drifting controller. However, the large sideslip angle in drift conditions introduces model mismatch, which in turn affects control precision. To address this issue, we propose a model correction drift controller that integrates Model Predictive Control (MPC) with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). GPR is employed to correct vehicle model mismatches during both drift equilibrium solving and the MPC optimization process. Additionally, the variance from GPR is utilized to actively explore different cornering drifting velocities, aiming to minimize trajectory tracking errors. The proposed algorithm is validated through simulations on the Simulink-Carsim platform and experiments with a 1:10 scale RC vehicle. In the simulation, the average lateral error with GPR is reduced by 52.8% compared to the non-GPR case. Incorporating exploration further decreases this error by 27.1%. The velocity tracking Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) also decreases by 10.6% with exploration. In the RC car experiment, the average lateral error with GPR is 36.7% lower, and exploration further leads to a 29.0% reduction. Moreover, the velocity tracking RMSE decreases by 7.2% with the inclusion of exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically inspired computational paradigm, enabling energy-efficient data processing through spike-based information transmission. Despite notable advancements in hardware for SNNs, spike encoding has largely remained software-dependent, limiting efficiency. This paper addresses the need for adaptable and resource-efficient spike encoding hardware by presenting an area-optimized hardware implementation of the Spiketrum algorithm, which encodes time-varying analogue signals into spatiotemporal spike patterns. Unlike earlier performance-optimized designs, which prioritize speed, our approach focuses on reducing hardware footprint, achieving a 52% reduction in Block RAMs (BRAMs), 31% fewer Digital Signal Processing (DSP) slices, and a 6% decrease in Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The proposed implementation has been verified on an FPGA and successfully integrated into an IC using TSMC180 technology. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in real-world applications, including sound and ECG classification. This work highlights the trade-offs between performance and resource efficiency, offering a flexible, scalable solution for neuromorphic systems in power-sensitive applications like cochlear implants and neural devices.</description>

      <title>Distances between finite-horizon linear behaviors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces a class of distances for linear behaviors over finite time horizons. These distances allow for comparisons between finite-horizon linear behaviors represented by matrices of possibly different dimensions. They remain invariant under coordinate changes, rotations, and permutations, ensuring independence from input-output partitions. Moreover, they naturally encode complexity-misfit trade-offs for Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) behaviors, providing a principled solution to a longstanding puzzle in behavioral systems theory. The resulting framework characterizes modeling as a minimum distance problem, identifying the Most Powerful Unfalsified Model (MPUM) as optimal among all systems unfalsified by a given dataset. Finally, we illustrate the value of these metrics in a time series anomaly detection task, where their finer resolution yields superior performance over existing distances.</description>

      <title>OODTE: A Differential Testing Engine for the ONNX Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With over 700 stars on GitHub and being part of the official ONNX repository, the ONNX Optimizer is the default tool for applying graph-based optimizations to ONNX models. Despite its widespread use, its ability to maintain model accuracy during optimization has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present OODTE, a utility designed to automatically and comprehensively evaluate the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer. OODTE adopts a straightforward yet powerful differential testing and evaluation methodology, which can be readily adapted for use with other compiler optimizers. Specifically, OODTE takes a collection of ONNX models, applies optimizations, and executes both the original and optimized versions across a user-defined input set, automatically capturing any issues encountered during optimization. When discrepancies in accuracy arise, OODTE iteratively isolates the responsible optimization pass by repeating the process at a finer granularity. We applied OODTE to 130 well-known models from the official ONNX Model Hub, spanning diverse tasks including classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question answering, and sentiment analysis. Our evaluation revealed that 9.2% of the model instances either caused the optimizer to crash or led to the generation of invalid models using default optimization strategies. Additionally, 30% of classification models and 16.6% of object detection and segmentation models exhibited differing outputs across original and optimized versions, whereas models focused on text-related tasks were generally robust to optimization. OODTE uncovered 15 issues-14 previously unknown-affecting 9 of 47 optimization passes and the optimizer overall. All issues were reported to the ONNX Optimizer team. OODTE offers a simple but effective framework for validating AI model optimizers, applicable beyond the ONNX ecosystem.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of SMT and MILP for the Nurse Rostering Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of personnel scheduling on the quality of care and working conditions for healthcare personnel have been thoroughly documented. However, the ever-present demand and large variation of constraints make healthcare scheduling particularly challenging. This problem has been studied for decades, with limited research aimed at applying Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). SMT has gained momentum within the formal verification community in the last decades, leading to the advancement of SMT solvers that have been shown to outperform standard mathematical programming techniques. In this work, we propose generic constraint formulations that can model a wide range of real-world scheduling constraints. Then, the generic constraints are formulated as SMT and MILP problems and used to compare the respective state-of-the-art solvers, Z3 and Gurobi, on academic and real-world inspired rostering problems. Experimental results show how each solver excels for certain types of problems; the MILP solver generally performs better when the problem is highly constrained or infeasible, while the SMT solver performs better otherwise. On real-world inspired problems containing a more varied set of shifts and personnel, the SMT solver excels. Additionally, it was noted during experimentation that the SMT solver was more sensitive to the way the generic constraints were formulated, requiring careful consideration and experimentation to achieve better performance. We conclude that SMT-based methods present a promising avenue for future research within the domain of personnel scheduling.</description>

      <title>From Structural Design to Dynamics Modeling: Control-Oriented Development of a 3-RRR Parallel Ankle Rehabilitation Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a wearable ankle rehabilitation robot based on a 3-RRR spherical parallel mechanism (SPM) to support multi-DOF recovery through pitch, roll, and yaw motions. The system features a compact, ergonomic structure designed for comfort, safety, and compatibility with ankle biomechanics. A complete design-to-dynamics pipeline has been implemented, including structural design, kinematic modeling for motion planning, and Lagrangian-based dynamic modeling for torque estimation and simulation analysis. Preliminary simulations verify stable joint coordination and smooth motion tracking under representative rehabilitation trajectories. The control framework is currently being developed to enhance responsiveness across the workspace. Future work will focus on integrating personalized modeling and adaptive strategies to address kinematic singularities through model based control. This work establishes a foundational platform for intelligent, personalized ankle rehabilitation, enabling both static training and potential extension to gait-phase-timed assistance.</description>

      <title>A generalized global Hartman-Grobman theorem for asymptotically stable semiflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Kvalheim and Sontag provided a generalized global Hartman-Grobman theorem for equilibria under asymptotically stable continuous vector fields. By leveraging topological properties of Lyapunov functions, their theorem works without assuming hyperbolicity. We extend their theorem to a class of possibly discontinuous vector fields, in particular, to vector fields generating asymptotically stable semiflows.</description>

      <title>Split the Yield, Share the Risk: Pricing, Hedging and Fixed rates in DeFi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first formal treatment of \emph{yield tokenization}, a mechanism that decomposes yield-bearing assets into principal and yield components to facilitate risk transfer and price discovery in decentralized finance (DeFi). We propose a model that characterizes yield token dynamics using stochastic differential equations. We derive a no-arbitrage pricing framework for yield tokens, enabling their use in hedging future yield volatility and managing interest rate risk in decentralized lending pools. Taking DeFi lending as our focus, we show how both borrowers and lenders can use yield tokens to achieve optimal hedging outcomes and mitigate exposure to adversarial interest rate manipulation. Furthermore, we design automated market makers (AMMs) that incorporate a menu of bonding curves to aggregate liquidity from participants with heterogeneous risk preferences. This leads to an efficient and incentive-compatible mechanism for trading yield tokens and yield futures. Building on these foundations, we propose a modular \textit{fixed-rate} lending protocol that synthesizes on-chain yield token markets and lending pools, enabling robust interest rate discovery and enhancing capital efficiency. Our work provides the theoretical underpinnings for risk management and fixed-income infrastructure in DeFi, offering practical mechanisms for stable and sustainable yield markets.</description>
