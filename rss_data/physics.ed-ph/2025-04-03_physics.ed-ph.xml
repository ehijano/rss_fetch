      <title>Einstein's elevator and the principle of equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outlines here the design, execution, and educational outcomes of an intervention inspired by Einstein's elevator thought experiment, intended to introduce secondary school students to the principle of equivalence, which is at the basis of the theory of General Relativity. We build an experimental version of Einstein's elevator, which simulated the effects of free-fall in an accelerated reference frame: a detailed description of the experimental apparatus and its construction is provided, highlighting the challenges and innovations in creating a simple yet functional setup using everyday materials.</description>

      <title>How to write competitive proposals and job applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Writing proposals and job applications is arguably one of the most important tasks in the career of a scientist. The proposed ideas must be scientifically compelling, but how a proposal is planned, written, and presented can make an enormous difference. This Perspective is the third in a series aimed at training the writing skills of professional astronomers. In the first two papers we concentrated on the writing of papers, here we concentrate on how proposals and job applications can be optimally written and presented. We discuss how to select where to propose or apply, how to optimise your writing, and add notes on the potential use of artificial intelligence tools. This guide is aimed primarily at more junior researchers, but we hope that our observations and suggestions may also be helpful for more experienced applicants, as well as for reviewers and funding agencies.</description>

      <title>Using Artificial Neural Networks to Optimize Acceleration Due to Gravity g Measurement in a Compound Pendulum Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a novel approach of implementing the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to validate a traditional experiment performed in the undergraduate physics laboratory, e.g. measurement of acceleration due to gravity g using compound pendulum. The input layer for the ANN model comprises of different parameters of the compound pendulum experiment such as its effective length, time period of oscillation and initial angular displacement. The model is first trained by using 70 percent of the experimental data. Then the trained model is validated and tested on the rest 30 percent of the experimental data which are treated as unseen data to predict the value of g. The ANN-predicted values are compared with the experimental value of g to assess precision. The average value of g was determined to be 1009.029797cm/s^2 with a random error of $\pm$6.817633 cm/s^2 through traditional experiment. However, the ANN-predicted value of g was 1009.029858 with a mean absolute error of 0.000592 cm/s^2. The authors propose that ANN-based methodologies could bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application by introducing students to cutting-edge computational techniques. Such integration allows for a deeper engagement with the subject matter, encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving skills in experimental physics. This innovative approach underscores the transformative role of machine learning in modern physics education. The model's performance demonstrates high accuracy and robustness in predicting g, outperforming traditional empirical approaches. Our results indicate that ANN-based optimization can significantly improve the precision of gravitational measurements, offering a reliable and efficient tool for applications that require high-accuracy determination of gravitational acceleration.</description>
