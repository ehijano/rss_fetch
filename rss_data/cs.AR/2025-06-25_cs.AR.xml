      <title>Development of an Open-Source Spacecraft Bus for the PULSE-A CubeSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The undergraduate-led Polarization-modUlated Laser Satellite Experiment (PULSE-A) at the University of Chicago seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of circular polarization shift keyed satellite-to-ground laser communication. PULSE-A's low-cost open-source bus serves as the backbone of the mission and has been designed in tandem with the Payload, with design driven by strict requirements for pointing accuracy, component alignment, power demand, and thermal stability. This work presents the design and testing of the PULSE-A bus.
  The spacecraft bus was designed to fill two major needs: (1) to meet the requirements of the PULSE-A mission, and (2) to be easily configurable for future missions that desire enhanced capabilities over other low-cost open-source designs. At its core, the bus features dual BeagleBone Black Industrial compute units, selected for their flight heritage, integrated via a PC/104 header standard. PULSE-A implements Goddard Space Flight Center's core Flight System (cFS), which takes a modular software architecture approach and is built in C. The use of C as the primary language aligns with the expertise of the University of Chicago's Computer Science department, allowing for ease of development by PULSE-A's undergraduate flight software team.
  The CubeSat structure utilizes Gran Systems' 3U frame, modified to accommodate openings for various ports and deployable components. Inside, the avionics stack uses the PC/104 standard quad rails, which terminate in PULSE-A's custom-designed Payload Box that houses all of the Payload components and optical fiber runs. This work also covers the techniques and iterative engineering processes used to develop the thermal control and dissipation mechanisms for the specific requirements, under volume, mass, and temperature-range constraints.</description>

      <title>Achieving Trustworthy Real-Time Decision Support Systems with Low-Latency Interpretable AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates real-time decision support systems that leverage low-latency AI models, bringing together recent progress in holistic AI-driven decision tools, integration with Edge-IoT technologies, and approaches for effective human-AI teamwork. It looks into how large language models can assist decision-making, especially when resources are limited. The research also examines the effects of technical developments such as DeLLMa, methods for compressing models, and improvements for analytics on edge devices, while also addressing issues like limited resources and the need for adaptable frameworks. Through a detailed review, the paper offers practical perspectives on development strategies and areas of application, adding to the field by pointing out opportunities for more efficient and flexible AI-supported systems. The conclusions set the stage for future breakthroughs in this fast-changing area, highlighting how AI can reshape real-time decision support.</description>

      <title>GainSight: Application-Guided Profiling for Composing Heterogeneous On-Chip Memories in AI Hardware Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14866v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As AI workloads drive soaring memory requirements, higher-density on-chip memory is needed for domain-specific accelerators beyond what current SRAM technology can provide. We motivate that algorithms and application behavior should guide the composition of heterogeneous on-chip memories. However, little work has incorporated dynamic application profiles into these design decisions, and no existing tools are expressly designed for this purpose. We present GainSight, a profiling framework that analyzes fine-grained memory access patterns and data lifetimes in domain-specific accelerators. By instrumenting retargetable architectural simulator backends with application- and device-agnostic analytical frontends, GainSight aligns workload-specific traffic and lifetime metrics with mockups of emerging memory devices, informing system-level heterogeneous memory design. We also present a set of case studies on MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads using simulated GPU and systolic array architectures, highlighting the utility of GainSight and the insights it provides: (1) 64% of L1 and 18% of L2 GPU cache accesses, and 79% of systolic array scratchpad accesses across profiled workloads are short-lived and suitable for silicon-based gain cell RAM (Si-GCRAM); (2) Heterogeneous memory arrays that augment SRAM with GCRAM can reduce active energy consumption by up to 66.8%. To facilitate further research in this domain, GainSight is open source at https://gainsight.stanford.edu/.</description>

      <title>Microcanonical simulated annealing: Massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations with sporadic random-number generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of models and theories that describe complex experimental systems $\unicode{x2014}$in fields like high-energy and condensed-matter physics$\unicode{x2014}$ are becoming increasingly important. Examples include lattice gauge theories, which can describe, among others, quantum chromodynamics (the Standard Model description of strong interactions between elementary particles), and spin-glass systems. Beyond fundamental research, these computational methods also find practical applications, among many others, in optimization, finance, and complex biological problems. However, Monte Carlo simulations, an important subcategory of these methods, are plagued by a major drawback: they are extremely greedy for (pseudo) random numbers. The total fraction of computer time dedicated to random-number generation increases as the hardware grows more sophisticated, and can get prohibitive for special-purpose computing platforms. We propose here a general-purpose microcanonical simulated annealing (MicSA) formalism that dramatically reduces such a burden. The algorithm is fully adapted to a massively parallel computation, as we show in the particularly demanding benchmark of the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. We carry out very stringent numerical tests of the new algorithm by comparing our results, obtained on GPUs, with high-precision standard (i.e., random-number-greedy) simulations performed on the Janus II custom-built supercomputer. In those cases where thermal equilibrium is reachable (i.e., in the paramagnetic phase), both simulations reach compatible values. More significantly, barring short-time corrections, a simple time rescaling suffices to map the MicSA off-equilibrium dynamics onto the results obtained with standard simulations.</description>
