      <title>Giant Outer Transiting Exoplanet Mass (GOT `EM) Survey. V. Two Giant Planets in Kepler-511 but Only One Ran Away</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems hosting multiple giant planets are important laboratories for understanding planetary formation and migration processes. We present a nearly decade-long Doppler spectroscopy campaign from the Keck-I telescope to characterize the two transiting giant planets orbiting Kepler-511 on orbits of 27 days and 297 days. The radial velocity measurements yield precise masses for both planets, which we use to infer their bulk heavy element content. Both planets contain approximately 30 Earth masses of heavy elements, but their bulk metallicities (i.e., the ratio between metal mass and total mass) are drastically different ($0.86 \pm 0.04$ and $0.22 \pm 0.04$ respectively). Envelope mass loss cannot account for this difference due to the relatively large orbital distance and mass of the inner planet. We conclude that the outer planet underwent runaway gas accretion while the inner planet did not. This bifurcation in accretion histories is likely a result of the accretion of gas with very different metallicities by the two planets or the late formation of the inner planet from a merger of sub-Neptunes. Kepler-511 uniquely demonstrates how giant planet formation can produce strikingly different outcomes even for planets in the same system.</description>

      <title>A High Internal Heat Flux and Large Core in a Warm Neptune Exoplanet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between exoplanetary atmospheres and internal properties have long been hypothesized to be drivers of the inflation mechanisms of gaseous planets and apparent atmospheric chemical disequilibrium conditions. However, transmission spectra of exoplanets has been limited in its ability to observational confirm these theories due to the limited wavelength coverage of HST and inferences of single molecules, mostly H$_2$O. In this work, we present the panchromatic transmission spectrum of the approximately 750 K, low-density, Neptune-sized exoplanet WASP-107b using a combination of HST WFC3, JWST NIRCam and MIRI. From this spectrum, we detect spectroscopic features due to H$_2$O (21$\sigma$), CH$_4$ (5$\sigma$), CO (7$\sigma$), CO$_2$ (29$\sigma$), SO$_2$ (9$\sigma$), and NH$_3$ (6$\sigma$). The presence of these molecules enable constraints on the atmospheric metal enrichment (M/H is 10--18$\times$ Solar), vertical mixing strength (log$_{10}$K$_{zz}$=8.4--9.0 cm$^2$s$^{-1}$), and internal temperature ($&gt;$345 K). The high internal temperature is suggestive of tidally-driven inflation acting upon a Neptune-like internal structure, which can naturally explain the planet's large radius and low density. These findings suggest that eccentricity driven tidal heating is a critical process governing atmospheric chemistry and interior structure inferences for a majority of the cool ($&lt;$1,000K) super-Earth-to-Saturn mass exoplanet population.</description>

      <title>A warm Neptune's methane reveals core mass and vigorous atmospheric mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of transiting gas giant exoplanets have revealed a pervasive depletion of methane, which has only recently been identified atmospherically. The depletion is thought to be maintained by disequilibrium processes such as photochemistry or mixing from a hotter interior. However, the interiors are largely unconstrained along with the vertical mixing strength and only upper limits on the CH$_4$ depletion have been available. The warm Neptune WASP-107 b stands out among exoplanets with an unusually low density, reported low core mass, and temperatures amenable to CH$_4$ though previous observations have yet to find the molecule. Here we present a JWST NIRSpec transmission spectrum of WASP-107 b which shows features from both SO$_2$ and CH$_4$ along with H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and CO. We detect methane with 4.2$\sigma$ significance at an abundance of 1.0$\pm$0.5 ppm, which is depleted by 3 orders of magnitude relative to equilibrium expectations. Our results are highly constraining for the atmosphere and interior, which indicate the envelope has a super-solar metallicity of 43$\pm$8$\times$ solar, a hot interior with an intrinsic temperature of T$_{\rm int}$=460$\pm$40 K, and vigorous vertical mixing which depletes CH4 with a diffusion coefficient of Kzz = 10$^{11.6\pm0.1}$ cm$^2$/s. Photochemistry has a negligible effect on the CH$_4$ abundance, but is needed to account for the SO$_2$. We infer a core mass of 11.5$_{-3.6}^{+3.0}$ M$_{\odot}$, which is much higher than previous upper limits, releasing a tension with core-accretion models.</description>

      <title>The Empirical and Radiative Transfer Hybrid (EaRTH) Disk Model: Merging Analyses of Protoplanetary Dust Disk Mineralogy and Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of how exoplanets form and evolve relies on analyses of both the mineralogy of protoplanetary disks and their detailed structures; however, these key complementary aspects of disks are usually studied separately. We present initial results from a hybrid model that combines the empirical characterization of the mineralogy of a disk, as determined from its mid-infrared spectral features, with the MCFOST radiative transfer disk model, a combination we call the EaRTH Disk Model. With the results of the mineralogy detection serving as input to the radiative transfer model, we generate mid-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that reflect both the mineralogical and structural parameters of the corresponding disk. Initial fits of the SED output by the resulting integrated model to Spitzer Space T elescope mid-infrared (IRS) spectra of the protoplanetary disk orbiting the nearby T Tauri star MP Mus demonstrate the potential advantages of this approach by revealing details like the dominance of micron-sized olivine and micron-sized forsterite in this dusty disk. The simultaneous insight into disk composition and structure provided by the EaRTH Disk methodology should be directly applicable to the interpretation of mid-infrared spectra of protoplanetary disks that will be produced by the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Artificial Greenhouse Gases as Exoplanet Technosignatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric pollutants such as CFCs and NO$_{2}$ have been proposed as potential remotely detectable atmospheric technosignature gases. Here we investigate the potential for artificial greenhouse gases including CF$_{4}$, C$_{2}$F$_{6}$, C$_{3}$F$_{8}$, SF$_{6}$, and NF$_{3}$ to generate detectable atmospheric signatures. In contrast to passive incidental byproducts of industrial processes, artificial greenhouse gases would represent an intentional effort to change the climate of a planet with long-lived, low toxicity gases and would possess low false positive potential. An extraterrestrial civilization may be motivated to undertake such an effort to arrest a predicted snowball state on their home world or to terraform an otherwise uninhabitable terrestrial planet within their system. Because artificial greenhouse gases strongly absorb in the thermal mid-infrared window of temperate atmospheres, a terraformed planet will logically possess strong absorption features from these gases at mid-IR wavelengths ($\sim$8-12 $\mu$m), possibly accompanied by diagnostic features in the near-IR. As a proof of concept, we calculate the needed observation time to detect 1 [10](100) ppm of C$_{2}$F$_{6}$/C$_{3}$F$_{8}$/SF$_{6}$ on TRAPPIST-1f with JWST MIRI/LRS and NIRSpec. We find that a combination of 1[10](100) ppm each of C$_{2}$F$_{6}$, C$_{3}$F$_{8}$, and SF$_{6}$ can be detected with an S/N $\geq$ 5 in as few as 25[10](5) transits with MIRI/LRS. We further explore mid-infrared direct-imaging scenarios with the LIFE mission concept and find these gases are more detectable than standard biosignatures at these concentrations. Consequently, artificial greenhouse gases can be readily detected (or excluded) during normal planetary characterization observations with no additional overhead.</description>

      <title>Bioverse: GMT and ELT Direct Imaging and High-Resolution Spectroscopy Assessment $\unicode{x2013}$ Surveying Exo-Earth O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ and Testing the Habitable Zone Oxygen Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biosignature detection in the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets is one of the most significant and ambitious goals for astronomy, astrobiology, and humanity. Molecular oxygen is among the strongest indicators of life on Earth, but it will be extremely difficult to detect via transmission spectroscopy. We used the Bioverse statistical framework to assess the ability to probe Earth-like O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ levels on hypothetical nearby habitable zone exoplanets (EECs) using direct imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy on the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) and the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). We found that O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ could be probed on up to $\sim$5 and $\sim$15 EECs orbiting bright M dwarfs within 20 pc in a 10-year survey on the GMT and ELT, respectively. Earth-like O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ levels could be probed on four known super-Earth candidates, including Proxima Centauri b, within about one week on the ELT and a few months on the GMT. We also assessed the ability of the ELT to test the habitable zone oxygen hypothesis $\unicode{x2013}$ that habitable zone Earth-sized planets are more likely to have O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ $\unicode{x2013}$ within a 10-year survey using Bioverse. Testing this hypothesis requires either $\sim$1/2 of the EECs to have O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ or $\sim$1/3 if $\eta_{\oplus}$ is large. A northern hemisphere large-aperture telescope, such as the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), would expand the target star pool by about 25%, reduce the time to probe biosignatures on individual targets, and provide an additional independent check on potential biosignature detections.</description>

      <title>Constraining the formation of WASP-39b using JWST transit spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the formation history of planets is one of the goals of studying exoplanet atmospheres. The atmospheric composition of planets can provide insights into the formation pathways of planets. Even though the mapping of the atmospheric composition onto a formation pathway is not unambiguous, with the increasing sensitivity of modern instruments, we can derive promising constraints. In this work, we aim to understand the formation pathway of WASP-39b. We discuss whether the detection of SO2 in its atmosphere would impact our understanding of the formation of the planet and whether it enables us to determine the formation pathway of the planet with greater accuracy. We used the JWST transit observation of the planet together with the available HST and Spitzer observations. We used a formation model coupled with a radiative transfer retrieval model to derive the planet's atmospheric characteristics and formation history. Furthermore, we used a photochemical model to derive the impact of photochemistry on the atmosphere of the planet. In this work, we show that the planet is most likely to have initiated beyond the CO2 ice line of its natal disk. Furthermore, the planet is likely to have have accreted some planetesimals during its formation. We show that the sulfur abundance in the atmosphere of the planet is probably lower than $2.27 \times 10^{-4}$. This abundance indicates that the planet is likely to exhibit a lower metallicity than suggested by the retrievals. Furthermore, such an abundance for sulfur is more likely if WASP-39b had been formed beyond the CO ice line of its natal disk.</description>

      <title>Investigating stellar activity through eight years of Sun-as-a-star observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar magnetic activity induces both distortions and Doppler-shifts in the absorption line profiles of Sun-like stars. Those effects produce apparent radial velocity (RV) signals which greatly hamper the search for potentially habitable, Earth-like planets. In this work, we investigate these distortions in the Sun using cross-correlation functions (CCFs), derived from intensive monitoring with the high-precision spectrograph HARPS-N. We show that the RV signal arising from line-shape variations on time-scales associated with the solar rotation and activity cycle can be robustly extracted from the data, reducing the RV dispersion by half. Once these have been corrected, activity-induced Doppler-shifts remain, that are modulated at the solar rotation period, and that are most effectively modelled in the time domain, using Gaussian Processes (GPs). Planet signatures are still best retrieved with multi-dimensonal GPs, when activity is jointly modelled from the raw RVs and indicators of the line width or of the Ca II H and K emission. After GP modelling, the residual RVs exhibit a dispersion of 0.6-0.8 m/s, likely to be dominated by signals induced by super-granulation. Finally, we find that the statistical properties of the RVs evolve significantly over time, and that this evolution is primarily driven by sunspots, which control the smoothness of the signal. Such evolution, which reduces the sensitivity to long-period planet signatures, is no longer seen in the activity-induced Doppler-shifts, which is promising for long term RV monitoring surveys such as the Terra Hunting Experiment or the PLATO follow-up campaign.</description>

      <title>Run-away transition to turbulent strong-field dynamo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets and stars are able to generate coherent large-scale magnetic fields by helical convective motions in their interiors. This process, known as hydromagnetic dynamo, involves nonlinear interaction between the flow and magnetic field. Nonlinearity facilitates existence of bi-stable dynamo branches: a weak field branch where the magnetic field is not strong enough to enter into the leading order force balance in the momentum equation at large flow scales, and a strong field branch where the field enters into this balance. The transition between the two with enhancement of convection can be either subcritical or supercritical, depending on the strength of magnetic induction. In both cases, it is accompanied by topological changes in velocity field across the system; however, it is yet unclear how these changes are produced. In this work, we analyse transitions between the weak and strong dynamo regimes using a data-driven approach, separating different physical effects induced by dynamically active flow scales. Using Dynamic Mode Decomposition, we decompose the dynamo data from direct numerical simulations into different components (modes), identify the ones relevant for transition, and estimate relative magnitudes of their contributions Lorentz force and induction term. Our results suggest that subcritical transition to a strong dynamo is facilitated by a subharmonic instability, allowing for a more efficient mode of convection, and provide a modal basis for reduced-order models of this transition.</description>

      <title>Using physics-based simulation towards eliminating empiricism in extraterrestrial terramechanics applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of international interest in extraterrestrial exploration targeting the Moon, Mars, the moons of Mars, and various asteroids. This contribution discusses how current state-of-the-art Earth-based testing for designing rovers and landers for these missions currently leads to overly optimistic conclusions about the behavior of these devices upon deployment on the targeted celestial bodies. The key misconception is that gravitational offset is necessary during the \textit{terramechanics} testing of rover and lander prototypes on Earth. The body of evidence supporting our argument is tied to a small number of studies conducted during parabolic flights and insights derived from newly revised scaling laws. We argue that what has prevented the community from fully diagnosing the problem at hand is the absence of effective physics-based models capable of simulating terramechanics under low gravity conditions. We developed such a physics-based simulator and utilized it to gauge the mobility of early prototypes of the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER), which is slated to depart for the Moon in November 2024. This contribution discusses the results generated by this simulator, how they correlate with physical test results from the NASA-Glenn SLOPE lab, and the fallacy of the gravitational offset in rover and lander testing. The simulator developed is open sourced and made publicly available for unfettered use; it can support principled studies that extend beyond trafficability analysis to provide insights into in-situ resource utilization activities, e.g., digging, bulldozing, and berming in low gravity.</description>

Abstract: We synthesize JWST NIRCam photometry for the F164N, F187N, F212N narrow filters, F140M, F162M, F182M, F210M medium filters, and F115W, F150W, F200W wide filters, Euclid Near Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) photometry for the $Y_E J_E H_E$ filters, and Roman Wide Field Instrument (WFI) photometry for the F106, F129, F146, F158, F184 and F213 filters using SpeX prism spectra and parallaxes of 688 field-age and 151 young ($\lesssim$ 200 Myr) ultracool dwarfs (spectral types M6-T9). We derive absolute magnitude-spectral type polynomial relations that enable the calculation of photometric distances for ultracool dwarfs observed with JWST, and to be observed with Euclid and Roman, in the absence of parallax measurements. Additionally, using the synthesized photometry to generate color-color figures can help distinguish high-redshift galaxies from brown dwarf interlopers in survey datasets. In particular, anticipating the upcoming Euclid Early Release Observations, we provide synthetic Euclid colors for ultracool dwarfs in our sample.</description>

      <title>The global structure of astrospheres: effect of Knudsen number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between stellar winds and the partially ionized local interstellar medium (LISM) is quite common in astrophysics. However, the main difficulty in describing the neutral components lies in the fact that the mean free path of an interstellar atom, l, can be comparable to the characteristic size of an astrosphere, L (i.e., the Knudsen number, which is equal to l/L, is approximately equal to 1, as in the case of the heliosphere). In such cases, a single-fluid approximation becomes invalid, and a kinetic description must be used for the neutral component. In this study, we consider a general astrosphere and use a kinetic-gas dynamics model to investigate how the global structure of the astrosphere depends on the Knudsen number. We present numerical results covering an extremely wide range of Knudsen numbers (from 0.0001 to 100). Additionally, we explore the applicability of single-fluid approaches for modeling astrospheres of various sizes. We have excluded the influence of interstellar and stellar magnetic fields in our model to make parametric study of the kinetic effects feasible. The main conclusion of this work is that, for large astrospheres (with a distance to the bow shock greater than 600 AU) a heated rarefied plasma layer forms in the outer shock layer near the astropause. The formation of this layer is linked to localized heating of the plasma by atoms (specifically, ENAs) that undergo charge exchange again behind the astropause. This process significantly alters the flow structure in the outer shock layer and the location of the bow shock, and it cannot be described by a single-fluid model. Additionally, this paper discusses how atoms weaken the bow shocks at near-heliospheric conditions.</description>

      <title>Naming the SMD Bridge Program--A White Paper</title>

Abstract: NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) has initiated a program to enhance the participation of historically underrepresented institutions and communities in NASA's mission. Currently known as the NASA SMD Bridge Program, its goal is to establish enduring partnerships among these institutions, research-intensive universities, and NASA centers. There are concerns about using "Bridge" in the program's name, with stakeholders suggesting that it might stigmatize students and mislead applicants about its focus. In this white paper, we address these concerns and conclude that a name change that better reflects the mission of this SMD effort is necessary to address these concerns.</description>

      <title>Mean-Motion Resonances With Interfering Density Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the dynamics of two less massive objects moving around a central massive object, which are all embedded within a thin accretion disc. In addition to the gravitational interaction between these objects, the disc-object interaction is also crucial for describing the long-term dynamics of the multi-body system, especially in the regime of mean-motion resonances. We point out that near the resonance the density waves generated by the two moving objects generally coherently interfere with each other, giving rise to extra angular momentum fluxes. The resulting backreaction on the objects is derived within the thin-disc scenario, which explicitly depends on the resonant angle and sensitively depends on the smoothing scheme used in the two-dimensional theory. We have performed hydrodynamical simulations with planets embedded within a thin accretion disc and have found qualitatively agreement on the signatures of interfering density waves by measuring the torques on the embedded objects. By including in interference torque and the migration torques in the evolution of a pair of planets, we show that the chance of resonance trapping depends on the sign of the interference torque. For negative torques the pairs are more likely located at off-resonance regimes. The negative torques may also explain the $1\%-2\%$ offset (for the period ratios) from the exact resonance values as observed in {\it Kepler} multi-planet systems.</description>

      <title>Detection and characterisation of icy cavities on the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the detection of three icy cavities on the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. They were identified on high-resolution anaglyphs built from images acquired by the OSIRIS instrument aboard the Rosetta spacecraft on 2016 April 9-10. Visually, they appear as bright patches of typically 15 to 30 m across whose large reflectances and spectral slopes in the visible substantiate the presence of sub-surface water ice. Using a new high-resolution photogrammetric shape model we determined the three-dimensional shape of these cavities whose depth ranges from 20 to 47 m. Spectral slopes were interpreted with models combining water ice and refractory dark material and the water ice abundances in the cavities were found to amount to a few per cent. The determination of the lifetime of the icy cavities was strongly biased by the availability of appropriate and favourable observations, but we found evidences of values of up to two years. The icy cavities were found to be connected to jets well documented in past studies. A thermal model allowed us to track their solar insolation over a large part of the orbit of the comet and a transitory bright jet on 2015 July 18 was unambiguously linked to the brief illumination of the icy bottom of one of the three cavities. These cavities are likely to be the first potential subsurface access points detected on a cometary nucleus and their lifetimes suggest that they reveal pristine sub-surface icy layers or pockets rather than recently recondensed water vapor.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Waves Driving Variability and Cloud Modulation on a Planetary-Mass Object</title>

Abstract: Planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs at the transition ($\rm{T}_{eff}\sim1300$\,K) from relatively red L dwarfs to bluer mid-T dwarfs show enhanced spectrophotometric variability. Multi-epoch observations support atmospheric planetary-scale (Kelvin or Rossby) waves as the primary source of this variability; however, large spots associated with the precipitation of silicate and metal clouds have also been theorized and suggested by Doppler imaging. We applied both wave and spotted models to fit near-infrared (NIR), multi-band ($Y$/$J$/$H$/$K$) photometry of SIMP\,J013656.5+093347 (hereafter SIMP0136), collected at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope using the Wide-field InfraRed Camera. SIMP0136 is a planetary-mass object (12.7$\pm1.0 \ \rm{M_J}$) at the L/T transition (T2$\pm0.5$) known to exhibit light curve evolution over multiple rotational periods. We measure the maximum peak-to-peak variability of $6.17\pm0.46\%$, $6.45\pm0.33\%$, $6.51\pm0.42\%$, and $4.33\pm0.38\%$ in the $Y$, $J$, $H$, and $K$ bands respectively, and find evidence that wave models are preferred for all four NIR bands. Furthermore, we determine the spot size necessary to reproduce the observed variations is larger than the Rossby deformation radius and Rhines scale, which is unphysical. Through the correlation between light curves produced by the waves and associated color variability, we find evidence of planetary-scale, wave-induced cloud modulation and breakup, similar to Jupiter's atmosphere and supported by general circulation models. We also detect a $93.8^{\circ}\pm7.4^{\circ}$ ($12.7\sigma$) phase shift between the $H-K$ and $J-H$ color time series, providing evidence for complex vertical cloud structure in SIMP0136's atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Three short-period Earth-sized planets around M dwarfs discovered by TESS: TOI-5720b, TOI-6008b and TOI-6086b</title>

Abstract: One of the main goals of the NASA's TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) mission is the discovery of Earth-like planets around nearby M-dwarf stars. Here, we present the discovery and validation of three new short-period Earth-sized planets orbiting nearby M-dwarfs: TOI- 5720b, TOI-6008b and TOI-6086b. We combined TESS data, ground-based multi-color light curves, ground-based optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, and Subaru/IRD RVs data to validate the planetary candidates and constrain the physical parameters of the systems. In addition, we used archival images, high-resolution imaging, and statistical validation techniques to support the planetary validation. TOI-5720b is a planet with a radius of Rp=1.09 Re orbiting a nearby (23 pc) M2.5 host, with an orbital period of P=1.43 days. It has an equilibrium temperature of Teq=708 K and an incident flux of Sp=41.7 Se. TOI-6008b has a period of P=0.86 day, a radius of Rp=1.03 Re, an equilibrium temperature of Teq=707 K and an incident flux of Sp=41.5 Se. The host star (TOI-6008) is a nearby (36 pc) M5 with an effective temperature of Teff=3075 K. Based on the RV measurements collected with Subaru/IRD, we set a 3-sigma upper limit of Mp&lt;4 M_Earth, thus ruling out a star or brown dwarf as the transiting companion. TOI-6086b orbits its nearby (31 pc) M3 host star (Teff=3200 K) every 1.39 days, and has a radius of Rp=1.18 Re, an equilibrium temperature of Teq=634 K and an incident flux of Sp=26.8 Se. Additional high precision radial velocity measurements are needed to derive the planetary masses and bulk densities, and to search for additional planets in the systems. Moreover, short-period earth-sized planets orbiting around nearby M-dwarfs are suitable targets for atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) through transmission and emission spectroscopy, and phase curve photometry.</description>

      <title>Stellar X-ray activity and habitability revealed by ROSAT sky survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the homogeneous X-ray catalog from ROSAT observations, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into stellar X-ray activity-rotation relations for both single and binary stars. Generally, the relation for single stars consists of two distinct regions: a weak decay region, indicating a continued dependence of the magnetic dynamo on stellar rotation rather than a saturation regime with constant activity, and a rapid decay region, where X-ray activity is strongly correlated with the Rossby number. Detailed analysis reveals more fine structures within the relation: in the extremely fast rotating regime, a decrease in X-ray activity was observed with increasing rotation rate, referred to as super-saturation, while in the extremely slow rotating region, the relation flattens, mainly due to the scattering of F stars. This scattering may result from intrinsic variability in stellar activities over one stellar cycle or the presence of different dynamo mechanisms. Binaries exhibit a similar relation to that of single stars while the limited sample size prevented the identification of fine structures in the relation for binaries. We calculated the mass loss rates of planetary atmosphere triggered by X-ray emissions from host stars. Our findings indicate that for an Earth-like planet within the stellar habitable zone, it would easily lose its entire primordial H/He envelope (equating to about 1% of the planetary mass).</description>
