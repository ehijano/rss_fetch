      <title>Systolic $S^1$-index and characterization of non-smooth Zoll convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the systolic $S^1$-index of a convex body as the Fadell-Rabinowitz index of the space of centralized generalized systoles associated with its boundary. We show that this index is a symplectic invariant. Using the systolic $S^1$-index, we propose a definition of generalized Zoll convex bodies and prove that this definition is equivalent to the usual one in the smooth setting. Moreover, we show how the generalized Zoll convex bodies can be characterized in the term of their Gutt-Hutchings capacities. Additionally, we show that the space of generalized Zoll convex bodies is closed in the space of all convex bodies. As a corollary, we establish that if the interior of a convex body is symplectomorphic to the interior of a ball, then such a convex body must be generalized Zoll, and in particular Zoll if the boundary of that convex body is smooth. We also discuss some examples.</description>

      <title>On the projection of exact Lagrangians in locally conformally symplectic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct examples of exact Lagrangians (of "locally conformally symplectic" type) in cotangent bundles of closed manifolds with locally conformally symplectic (lcs) structures and give conditions under which the projection induces a simple homotopy equivalence between an exact Lagrangian and the $0$-section of the cotangent bundle. This line of questioning leads us to investigate the links between the contact geometry of jet spaces and the lcs geometry of cotangent bundles. Among other things, we will study essential Liouville chords, which seem to be the lcs equivalent to Reeb chords. We will also see how Legendrians in jet spaces are an obstruction to the straightforward adaptation of the Abouzaid-Kragh theorem to lcs geometry.</description>
