      <title>Miraculous cancellations and the quantum Frobenius for $SL_3$ skein modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a quantum Frobenius map for the $SL_3$ skein module of any oriented 3-manifold specialized at a root of unity, and describe the map by way of threading certain polynomials along links. The homomorphism is a higher rank version of the Chebyshev-Frobenius homomorphism of Bonahon-Wong. The strategy builds on a previous construction of the Frobenius map for $SL_3$ skein algebras of punctured surfaces, using the Frobenius map of Parshall-Wang for the quantum group $\mathcal{O}_q(SL_3).$</description>

      <title>Arithmeticity and commensurability of links in thickened surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of right-angled tiling links consists of links built from regular 4-valent tilings of constant-curvature surfaces that contain one or two types of tiles. The complements of these links admit complete hyperbolic structures and contain two totally geodesic checkerboard surfaces that meet at right angles. In this paper, we give a complete characterization of which right-angled tiling links are arithmetic, and which are pairwise commensurable. The arithmeticity classification exploits symmetry arguments and the combinatorial geometry of Coxeter polyhedra. The commensurability classification relies on identifying the canonical decompositions of the link complements, in addition to number-theoretic data from invariant trace fields.</description>

      <title>Twist spun knots of twist spun knots of classical knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-twist spun knot is an $n+1$-dimensional knot in the $n+3$-dimensional sphere which is obtained from an $n$-dimensional knot in the $n+2$-dimensional sphere by applying an operation called a $k$-twist-spinning. This construction was introduced by Zeeman in 1965. In this paper, we show that the $m_2$-twist-spinning of the $m_1$-twist-spinning of a classical knot is a trivial $3$-knot in $S^5$ if $\gcd(m_1,m_2)=1$. We also give a sufficient condition for the $m_2$-twist-spinning of the $m_1$-twist-spinning of a classical knot to be non-trivial.</description>

      <title>Simplicial degree $d$ self-maps on $n$-spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree of a map between orientable manifolds is a crucial concept in topology, providing deep insights into the structure and properties of the manifolds and the corresponding maps. This concept has been thoroughly investigated, particularly in the realm of simplicial maps between orientable triangulable spaces. In this paper, we concentrate on constructing simplicial degree $d$ self-maps on $n$-spheres. We describe the construction of several such maps, demonstrating that for every $d \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus {0}$, there exists a degree $d$ simplicial map from a triangulated $n$-sphere with $3|d| + n - 1$ vertices to $\mathbb{S}^n_{n+2}$. Further, we prove that, for every $d \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus {0}$, there exists a simplicial map of degree $3 d$ from a triangulated $n$-sphere with $6|d| + n$ vertices, as well as a simplicial map of degree $3d+\frac{d}{|d|}$ from a triangulated $n$-sphere with $6|d|+n+3$ vertices, to $\mathbb{S}^{n}_{n+2}$. Furthermore, we show that for any $|k| \geq 2$ and $n \geq |k|$, a degree $k$ simplicial map exists from a triangulated $n$-sphere $K$ with $|k| + n + 3$ vertices to $\mathbb{S}^n_{n+2}$. We also prove that for $d = 2$ and 3, these constructions produce vertex-minimal degree $d$ self-maps of $n$-spheres. Additionally, for every $n \geq 2$, we construct a degree $n+1$ simplicial map from a triangulated $n$-sphere with $2n + 4$ vertices to $\mathbb{S}^{n}_{n+2}$. We also prove that this construction provides facet minimal degree $n+1$ self-maps of $n$-spheres.</description>

      <title>Farey Bryophylla</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of the Farey tessellation in the hyperbolic plane starts with a finitely generated group of symmetries of an ideal triangle, i.e. a triangle with all vertices on the boundary. It induces a remarkable fractal structure on the boundary of the hyperbolic plane, encoding every element by the continued fraction related to the structure of the tessellation. The problem of finding a generalisation of this construction to the higher dimensional hyperbolic spaces has remained open for many years. In this paper we make the first steps towards a generalisation in the three-dimensional case. We introduce conformal bryophylla, a class of subsets of the boundary of the hyperbolic 3-space which possess fractal properties similar to the Farey tessellation. We classify all conformal bryophylla and study the properties of their limiting sets.</description>

      <title>Algebraic intersections on Bouw-M\"oller surfaces, and more general convex polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on intersection of closed curves on translation surfaces. Namely, we investigate the question of determining the intersection of two closed curves of a given length on such surfaces. This question has been investigated in several papers and this paper complement the work of Boulanger, Lanneau and Massart done for double regular polygons, and extend the results to a large family of surfaces which includes in particular Bouw-M\"oller surfaces. Namely, we give an estimate for KVol on surfaces based on geometric constraints (angles and indentifications of sides). This estimate is sharp in the case of Bouw-M\"oller surfaces with a unique singularity, and it allows to compute KVol on the $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$-orbit of such surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the extension of the faithfulness question for the Burau representation of braid groups to the case of Artin--Tits groups. We prove that the Burau representation is not faithful in affine type $\tilde{A_3}$, and not faithful over several finite rings in type $D_4$, using an algorithmic approach based on categorical methods that generalize Bigelow's curve strategy outside of type $A$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We undertake a study of topological properties of the real Mordell-Weil group $\operatorname{MW}_{\mathbb R}$ of real rational elliptic surfaces $X$ which we accompany by a related study of real lines on $X$ and on the "subordinate" del Pezzo surfaces $Y$ of degree 1. We give an explicit description of isotopy types of real lines on $Y_{\mathbb R}$ and an explicit presentation of $\operatorname{MW}_{\mathbb R}$ in the mapping class group $\operatorname{Mod}(X_{\mathbb R})$. Combining these results we establish an explicit formula for the action of $\operatorname{MW}_{\mathbb R}$ in $H_1(X_{\mathbb R})$.</description>

      <title>Holes in Convex and Simple Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gons and holes in point sets have been extensively studied in the literature. For simple drawings of the complete graph a generalization of the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres theorem is known and empty triangles have been investigated. We introduce a notion of $k$-holes for simple drawings and study their existence with respect to the convexity hierarchy. We present a family of simple drawings without 4-holes and prove a generalization of Gerken's empty hexagon theorem for convex drawings. A crucial intermediate step will be the structural investigation of pseudolinear subdrawings in convex~drawings.</description>

      <title>Simplicial arrangements with few double points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In their solution to the orchard-planting problem, Green and Tao established a structure theorem which proves that in a line arrangement in the real projective plane with few double points, most lines are tangent to the dual curve of a cubic curve. We provide geometric arguments to prove that in the case of a simplicial arrangement, the aforementioned cubic curve cannot be irreducible. It follows that Gr\"{u}nbaum's conjectural asymptotic classification of simplicial arrangements holds under the additional hypothesis of a linear bound on the number of double points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.04462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide characterizations of Anosov representations of word hyperbolic groups into real semisimple Lie groups in terms of the existence of equivariant limit maps on the Gromov boundary, the Cartan property and the uniform gap summation property introduced by Guichard-Gu\'eritaud-Kassel-Wienhard. We also study representations of finitely generated groups satisfying weak uniform gaps in eigenvalues and establish conditions to be Anosov. As an application, we also obtain a characterization of strongly convex cocompact subgroups of the projective linear group $\mathsf{PGL}_d(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>Homology concordance and knot Floer homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.14803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the homology concordance group of knots in integer homology three-spheres which bound integer homology four-balls. Using knot Floer homology, we construct an infinite number of $\mathbb{Z}$-valued, linearly independent homology concordance homomorphisms which vanish for knots coming from $S^3$. This shows that the homology concordance group modulo knots coming from $S^3$ contains an infinite-rank summand. The techniques used here generalize the classification program established in previous papers regarding the local equivalence group of knot Floer complexes over $\mathbb{F}[U, V]/(UV)$. Our results extend this approach to complexes defined over a broader class of rings.</description>

      <title>An analog of the {K}auffman bracket polynomial for knots in the non-orientable thickening of a non-orientable surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00540v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study pseudo-classical knots in the non-orientable thickening of a non-orientable surface, specifically knots that are orientation-preserving paths in a non-orientable $3$-manifold of the form (non-orientable surface) $\times$ $[0, 1]$. For these knots, we propose an analog of the Kauffman bracket polynomial. The construction of this polynomial closely mirrors the classical version, with key differences in the definitions of the sign of a crossing and the positive/negative smoothing of a crossing. We prove that this polynomial is an isotopy invariant of pseudo-classical knots and demonstrate that it is independent of the classical Kauffman bracket polynomial for knots in the thickened orientable surface, which is the orientable double cover of the non-orientable surface under consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13526v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa's conjecture that the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants are radial limits of homological blocks, which are $ q $-series introduced by them for plumbed $ 3 $-manifolds with negative definite linking matrices. In our previous work, the author attributed this conjecture to the holomorphy of certain rational functions by developing an asymptotic formula based on the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula. However, it is challenging to prove holomorphy for general plumbed manifolds. In this paper, we address this challenge using induction on a sequence of trees obtained by repeating "pruning trees."</description>

      <title>Gompf's cork and Heegaard Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gompf showed that for $K$ in a certain family of double-twist knots, the swallow-follow operation makes $1/n$-surgery on $K \# -K$ into a cork boundary. We derive a general Floer-theoretic condition on $K$ under which this is the case. Our formalism allows us to produce many further examples of corks, partially answering a question of Gompf. Unlike Gompf's method, our proof does not rely on any closed 4-manifold invariants or effective embeddings, and also generalizes to other diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Nielsen equivalence and multisections of 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Islambouli showed that there exist infinitely many 4-manifolds admitting non-isotopic trisections using a Nielsen equivalence, which can be used to construct non-isotopic Heegaard splittings. In this paper, we show that there exist infinitely many 4-manifolds admitting non-isotopic bisections in the same way. Moreover, we show that there exist infinitely many 4-manifolds admitting non-isotopic 4-sections by considering the doubles of the bisections.</description>

      <title>Splitting links by integer homology spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every $n \ge 3$, we construct 2-component links in $S^{n+1}$ that are a split by an integer homology $n$-sphere, but not by $S^n$. In the special case $n=3$, i.e. that of 2-links in $S^4$, we produce an infinite family of links $L_\ell$ and of integer homology spheres $Y_\ell$ such that the link $L_\ell$ is (topologically or smoothly) split by $Y_\ell$ and by no other integer homology sphere in the family.</description>

      <title>Coarse group theoretic study on stable mixed commutator length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group and $N$ a normal subgroup of $G$. We study the large scale behavior, not the exact values themselves, of the stable mixed commutator length $scl_{G,N}$ on the mixed commutator subgroup $[G,N]$; when $N=G$, $scl_{G,N}$ equals the stable commutator length $scl_G$ on the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$. For this purpose, we regard $scl_{G,N}$ not only as a function from $[G,N]$ to $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, but as a bi-invariant metric function $d^+_{scl_{G,N}}$ from $[G,N]\times [G,N]$ to $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. Our main focus is coarse group theoretic structures of $([G,N],d^+_{scl_{G,N}})$. Our preliminary result (the absolute version) connects, via the Bavard duality, $([G,N],d^+_{scl_{G,N}})$ and the quotient vector space of the space of $G$-invariant quasimorphisms on $N$ over one of such homomorphisms. In particular, we prove that the dimension of this vector space equals the asymptotic dimension of $([G,N],d^+_{scl_{G,N}})$.
  Our main result is the comparative version: we connect the coarse kernel, formulated by Leitner and Vigolo, of the coarse homomorphism $\iota_{G,N}\colon ([G,N],d^+_{scl_{G,N}})\to ([G,N],d^+_{scl_{G}})$; $y\mapsto y$, and a certain quotient vector space $W(G,N)$ of the space of invariant quasimorphisms. Assume that $N=[G,G]$ and that $W(G,N)$ is finite dimensional with dimension $\ell$. Then we prove that the coarse kernel of $\iota_{G,N}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{\ell}$ as a coarse group. In contrast to the absolute version, the space $W(G,N)$ is finite dimensional in many cases, including all $(G,N)$ with finitely generated $G$ and nilpotent $G/N$. As an application of our result, given a group homomorphism $\varphi\colon G\to H$ between finitely generated groups, we define an $\mathbb{R}$-linear map `inside' the groups, which is dual to the naturally defined $\mathbb{R}$-linear map from $W(H,[H,H])$ to $W(G,[G,G])$ induced by $\varphi$.</description>

      <title>Cobordism Obstructions to Complex Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18613v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A notion of vector field cobordism for oriented manifolds was defined by B\"okstedt and Svane. We extend this notion to define complex section cobordism for almost complex manifolds. We then determine the complex section cobordism groups and a relevant cobordism category. We describe an obstruction which tells us when a cobordism class contains a manifold, which can be equipped with $r$ linearly independent complex sections, in terms of the Chern classes. Finally, we show that this obstruction vanishes for certain multiplicative generators in the complex cobordism ring.</description>

      <title>Existence of arbitrary large numbers of non-$\mathbb R$-covered Anosov flows on hyperbolic $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to prove that, for every $n\in \mathbb N$, there exists a closed hyperbolic $3$-manifold $M$ which carries at least $n$ non-$\mathbb R$-covered Anosov flows, that are pairwise non-orbitally equivalent. Due to a recent result by Fenley, such Anosov flows are quasi-geodesic. Hence, we get the existence of hyperbolic $3$-manifolds carrying many pairwise non-orbitally equivalent quasi-geodesic Anosov flows. Based on the orbit space theory of Anosov flows developed by Fenley and Barbot, we completely studied the connected components of edge-adjacent lozenges, say, clusters in the orbit spaces of the Anosov flows in construction. The number of the lozenges of a cluster and a type of orientations on the clusters together are used as dynamical invariants to prove that the flows we construct are not orbitally equivalent. We believe that those dynamical invariants could be used in a much wider context.</description>

      <title>Generic doubling of rectangular pegs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13209v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a multiplicity result for rectangular pegs that there is a generic class of smooth Jordan curves in which every curve admits two geometrically distinct similar inscribed rectangles with aspect angle in $(0,\frac{\pi}{2})$, based on the a priori existence result of rectangular peg by Greene and Lobb [GL21], in which the rectangular peg problem is translated into finding intersection points of two Lagrangian tori. The key insights are certain generic geometric transversality of the two tori, and the correspondence between the intersection points and the inscribed rectangles. We present two distinct proofs: one involves the Lagrangian Floer homology, and the other is differential topological in nature which employs a novel computation formula for the algebraic intersection number. Moreover, such generic doubling result can be further extended to cyclic quadrilateral pegs based on [GL23]. In Appendix B, written jointly with Urs Frauenfelder, we provide the detailed derivation of this computation formula.</description>

      <title>Cobordism Obstructions to Complex Sections II: Torsion Obstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the previous paper, we studied obstructions to the existence of complex sections on almost complex manifolds up to cobordism. We determined the obstruction rationally, in terms of the Chern classes. In this paper, we study the torsion obstructions, that is, the obstructions which vanish after tensoring with $\mathbb{Q}$ or multiplication by an integer. Calculations with the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence for the Thom spectra $\mathbf{MTU}(d)$ allow us to show the torsion obstructions for low $r$. For prime $p\geq 3$, we show that torsion obstructions for finding $r$ complex sections of order $p$ vanish for $r&lt;p^2-p$.</description>

      <title>A 2-Person Game Decomposing 2-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two players play a game by alternately splitting a surface of a compact $2$-manifold along a simple closed curve that is not null-homotopic and attaching disks to the resulting boundary; the last player who can move wins. Starting from an orientable surface, the $G$-series is $01\dot{2}\dot{0}$ according to increasing genus. Starting from a nonorientable surface, the $G$-series is $012\dot{4}60\dot{3}$ according to increasing genus. Nim addition determines the $G$-values of the remaining compact $2$-manifolds.</description>
