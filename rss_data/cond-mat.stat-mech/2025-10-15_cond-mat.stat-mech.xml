      <title>Algorithmic Temperature Induced by Adopted Regular Universal Turing Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that an effective temperature naturally emerges from the algorithmic structure of a regular universal Turing machine (UTM), without introducing any external physical parameter. In particular, the redundancy growth of the machine's wrapper language induces a Boltzmann--like exponential weighting over program lengths, yielding a canonical ensemble interpretation of algorithmic probability. This establishes a formal bridge between algorithmic information theory and statistical mechanics, in which the adopted UTM determines the intrinsic ``algorithmic temperature.'' We further show that this temperature approaches its maximal limit under the universal mixture (Solomonoff distribution), and discuss its epistemic meaning as the resolution level of an observer.</description>

      <title>Universal behaviors of the multi-time correlation functions of random processes with renewal: the step noise case (the random velocity of a L\'evy walk)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic processes with renewal properties are powerful tools for modeling systems where memory effects and long-time correlations play a significant role. In this work, we study a broad class of renewal processes where a variable's value changes according to a prescribed Probability Density Function (PDF), $p(\xi)$, after random waiting times $\theta$. This model is relevant across many fields, including classical chaos, nonlinear hydrodynamics, quantum dots, cold atom dynamics, biological motion, foraging, and finance. We derive a general analytical expression for the $n$-time correlation function by averaging over process realizations. Our analysis identifies the conditions for stationarity, aging, and long-range correlations based on the waiting time and jump distributions. Among the many consequences of our analysis, two new key results emerge. First, for Poissonian waiting times, the correlation function quickly approaches that of telegraphic noise. Second, for power-law waiting times with $\mu&gt;2$, , \emph{any $n$-time correlation function asymptotically reduces to the two-time correlation evaluated at the earliest and latest time points}. This second result reveals a universal long-time behavior where the system's full statistical structure becomes effectively two-time reducible. Furthermore, if the jump PDF $p(\xi)$ has fat tails, this convergence becomes independent of the waiting time PDF and is significantly accelerated, requiring only modest increases in either the number of realizations or the trajectory lengths. Building upon earlier work that established the universality of the two-point correlation function (i.e., a unique formal expression depending solely on the variance of $\xi$ and on the waiting-time PDF), the present study extends that universality to the full statistical description of a broad class of renewal-type stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Non-Normal Eigenvector Amplification in Multi-Dimensional Kesten Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy-tailed fluctuations and power law statistics pervade physics, finance, and economics, yet their origin is often ascribed to systems poised near criticality. Here we show that such behavior can emerge far from instability through a universal mechanism of non-normal eigenvector amplification in multidimensional Kesten processes $x_{t+1}=A_t x_t+\eta_t$, where $A_t$ are random interaction matrices and $\eta_t$ represents external inputs, capturing the evolving interdependence among $N$ coupled components. Even when each random multiplicative matrix is spectrally stable, non-orthogonal eigenvectors generate transient growth that renormalizes the Lyapunov exponent and lowers the tail exponent, producing stationary power laws without eigenvalues crossing the stability boundary. We derive explicit relations linking the Lyapunov exponent and the tail index to the statistics of the condition number, $\gamma\!\sim\!\gamma_0+\ln\kappa$ and $\alpha\!\sim\!-2\gamma/\sigma_\kappa^2$, confirmed by numerical simulations. This framework offers a unifying geometric perspective that help interpret diverse phenomena, including polymer stretching in turbulence, magnetic field amplification in dynamos, volatility clustering and wealth inequality in financial systems. Non-normal interactions provide a collective route to scale-free behavior in globally stable systems, defining a new universality class where multiplicative feedback and transient amplification generate critical-like statistics without spectral criticality.</description>

      <title>Adjoint ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the phase structure and thermodynamics of ferromagnets consisting of elementary magnets carrying the adjoint representation of $SU(N)$ and coupled through two-body quadratic interactions. Such systems have a continuous $SU(N)$ symmetry as well as a discrete conjugation symmetry. We uncover a rich spectrum of phases and transitions, involving a paramagnetic and two distinct ferromagnetic phases that can coexist as stable and metastable states in different combinations over a range of temperatures. The ferromagnetic phases break $SU(N)$ invariance in various channels, leading to spontaneous magnetization. Interestingly, the conjugation symmetry also breaks over a range of temperatures and group ranks $N$, providing a realization of a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics of Gross-Pitaevskii qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What are the resources that can be leveraged for a thermodynamic device to exhibit genuine quantum advantage? Typically, the answer to this question is sought in quantum correlations. In the present work, we show that quantum Otto engines that operate with nonlinear qubits significantly outperform linear engines. To this end, we develop a comprehensive thermodynamic description of nonlinear qubits starting with identifying the proper thermodynamic equilibrium state. We then show that for ideal cycles as well as at maximum power the efficiency of the nonlinear engine is significantly higher. Interestingly, nonlinear dynamics can be thought of as an effective description of a correlated, complex quantum many body system. Hence, our findings corroborate common wisdom, while at the same time propose a new design of more efficient quantum engines.</description>

      <title>The Popkov-Sch\"{u}tz two-lane lattice gas: Universality for general jump rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the asymmetric version of the Popkov-Sch\"{u}tz two-lane lattice gas with general jump rates, subject to the stationary measure being of product form. This still leaves five free parameters. At density $\tfrac{1}{2}$ the eigenvalues of the flux Jacobian are degenerate. We compute the second order expansion of the average fluxes at density $\tfrac{1}{2}$ and thereby identify the universality classes.</description>

      <title>Temperature and conditions for thermalization after canonical quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quenches of a quantum system that is prepared in a canonical equilibrium state of one Hamiltonian and then evolves unitarily in time under a different Hamiltonian. Technically, our main result is a systematic expansion of the pre- and post-quench canonical ensembles in the quench strength. We first demonstrate how this can be used to predict the system's temperature after the quench from equilibrium properties at the pre-quench temperature. For a thermalizing post-quench system, it furthermore allows us to calculate equilibrium observable expectation values. Finally, in the presence of additional conserved quantities besides the Hamiltonian, we obtain a hierarchy of necessary conditions for thermalization towards the (post-quench) canonical ensemble. At first order, these thermalization conditions have a nice geometric interpretation in operator space with the canonical covariance as a semi-inner product: The quench operator (difference between post- and pre-quench Hamiltonians) and the conserved quantity must be orthogonal in the orthogonal complement of the post-quench Hamiltonian. We illustrate the results numerically for a variety of setups involving integrable and nonintegrable models.</description>

      <title>Error thresholds of toric codes with transversal logical gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The threshold theorem promises a path to fault-tolerant quantum computation by suppressing logical errors, provided the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. While transversal gates offer an efficient method for implementing logical operations, they risk spreading errors and potentially lowering this threshold compared to a static quantum memory. Available threshold estimates for transversal circuits are empirically obtained and limited to specific, sub-optimal decoders. To establish rigorous bounds on the negative impact of error spreading by the transversal gates, we generalize the statistical mechanical (stat-mech) mapping from quantum memories to logical circuits. We establish a mapping for two toric code blocks that undergo a transversal CNOT (tCNOT) gate. Using this mapping, we quantify the impact of two independent error-spreading mechanisms: the spread of physical bit-flip errors and the spread of syndrome errors. In the former case, the stat-mech model is a 2D random Ashkin-Teller model. We use numerical simulation to show that the tCNOT gate reduces the optimal bit-flip error threshold to $p=0.080$, a $26\%$ decrease from the toric code memory threshold $p=0.109$. The case of syndrome error coexisting with bit-flip errors is mapped to a 3D random 4-body Ising model with a plane defect. There, we obtain a conservative estimate error threshold of $p=0.028$, implying an even more modest reduction due to the spread of the syndrome error compared to the memory threshold $p=0.033$. Our work establishes that an arbitrary transversal Clifford logical circuit can be mapped to a stat-mech model, and a rigorous threshold can be obtained correspondingly.</description>

      <title>Secret communication games and a hierarchy of quasiparticle statistics in 3 + 1D topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a family of secret communication challenge games naturally define a hierarchy of emergent quasiparticle statistics in three-dimensional (3D) topological phases. The winning strategies exploit a special class of the recently proposed $R$-paraparticles to allow nonlocal secret communication between the two participating players. We first give a high-level, axiomatic description of emergent $R$-paraparticles, and show that any physical system hosting such particles admits a winning strategy. We then analyze the games using the categorical description of topological phases (where point-like excitations in 3D are described by symmetric fusion categories), and show that only $R$-paraparticles can win the 3D challenge in a noise-robust way, and the winning strategy is essentially unique. This analysis associates emergent $R$-paraparticles to deconfined gauge theories based on an exotic class of finite groups. Thus, even though this special class of $R$-paraparticles are fermions or bosons under the categorical classification, their exchange statistics can still have nontrivial physical consequences in the presence of appropriate defects, and the $R$-paraparticle language offers a more convenient description of the winning strategies. Finally, while a subclass of non-Abelian anyons can win the game in 2D, we introduce twisted variants that exclude anyons, thereby singling out $R$-paraparticles in 2D as well. Our results establish the secret communication challenge as a versatile diagnostic for both identifying and classifying exotic exchange statistics in topological quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steadily shearing a non-Brownian suspension forms a memory of direction in its structure, while periodically shearing it forms a memory of amplitude. Our experiments show that these memories coexist and compete within a limited memory capacity. A specific oscillatory amplitude, previously associated with a critical transition, suppresses the directional (fore-aft) asymmetry. A similar picture is known in amorphous solids. We propose that these competing kinds of memory are a motif for non-equilibrium systems coupled to a scalar drive and are a basic example of interplay between memories.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbatively slow spread of quantum correlations in non-resonant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong disorder often has drastic consequences for quantum dynamics. This is best illustrated by the phenomenon of Anderson localization in non-interacting systems, where destructive quantum wave interference leads to the complete absence of particle and information transport over macroscopic distances. In this work, we investigate the extent to which strong disorder leads to provably slow dynamics in many-body quantum lattice models. We show that in any spatial dimension, strong disorder leads to a non-perturbatively small velocity for ballistic information transport under unitary quantum dynamics, almost surely in the thermodynamic limit, in every many-body state. In these models, we also prove the existence of a "prethermal many-body localized regime", where entanglement spreads logarithmically slowly, up to non-perturbatively long time scales. More generally, these conclusions hold for all models corresponding to quantum perturbations to a classical Hamiltonian obeying a simple non-resonant condition. Deterministic non-resonant models are found, including spin systems in strong incommensurate lattice potentials. Consequently, quantum dynamics in non-resonant potentials is asymptotically easier to simulate on both classical or quantum computers, compared to a generic many-body system.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of Coulomb potential systems in thermal baths. We study these systems within the framework of open quantum dynamics theory, focusing on preserving the rotational symmetry of the entire system, including the baths. Thus, we employ a three-dimensional rotationally invariant system-bath (3D-RISB) model to derive numerically ``exact'' hierarchical equations of motion for atomic orbitals (AO-HEOM) that enable a non-perturbative and non-Markovian treatment of system-bath interactions at finite temperatures. To assess the formalism, we calculated the linear absorption spectrum of an atomic system under isotropic thermal environment, with systematic variation of system-bath coupling strength and temperature.</description>

      <title>Train Stochastic Non Linear Coupled ODEs to Classify and Generate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A general class of dynamical systems which can be trained to operate in classification and generation modes are introduced. A procedure is proposed to plant asymptotic stationary attractors of the deterministic model. Optimizing the dynamical system amounts to shaping the architecture of inter-nodes connection to steer the evolution towards the assigned equilibrium, as a function of the class to which the item - supplied as an initial condition - belongs to. Under the stochastic perspective, point attractors are turned into probability distributions, made analytically accessible via the linear noise approximation. The addition of noise proves beneficial to oppose adversarial attacks, a property that gets engraved into the trained adjacency matrix and therefore also inherited by the deterministic counterpart of the optimized stochastic model. By providing samples from the target distribution as an input to a feedforward neural network (or even to a dynamical model of the same typology of the adopted for classification purposes), yields a fully generative scheme. Conditional generation is also possible by merging classification and generation modalities. Automatic disentanglement of isolated key features is finally proven.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Ratchet for Tracer Transport in a Soft Microchannel: A Detailed Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding surface-driven transport is of paramount importance from the perspective of biological applications and the synthesis of microfluidic devices. In this work, we develop an analysis of a local inversion symmetry broken fluid flow model through an undulating microchannel. Surface undulations of a few tens of Hertz in a soft microchannel keep the fluid flow in a low Reynolds number regime, allowing the advantage of a perturbation analysis of fluid flow. Using this, we develop a detailed analysis of the relationship between the fluid velocity and surface undulations, which is crucial for the subsequent numerical analysis of tracer motion. We used this information to study the dynamics of a tracer particle in the velocity field of an undulating microchannel. We show that the tracer particle can undergo ratcheting (which we call the hydrodynamics ratchet effect) in very specific, physically meaningful circumstances. We observe a ratcheting velocity of $\sim 0.15 \;\mu$m/sec for a micrometre-sized particle at room temperature in water when the undulations wavelength is of the order of 1 $\mu$m.</description>

Abstract: We derive semiclassical analytical solutions for both the diagonal and off-diagonal functions in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in a quarter-stadium quantum billiard. For a representative observable, we obtain an explicit expression and an asymptotic closed-form solution that naturally separate into a local contribution and a phase-space correlation term. These analytical results predict the band structure of the observable matrix, including its bandwidth and scaling behavior. We further demonstrate that our analytical formula is equivalent to the prediction of Berry's conjecture. Supported by numerical evidence, we show that Berry's conjecture captures the energetic long-wavelength behavior in the space of eigenstates, while our analytical solution describes the asymptotic behavior of the f function in the semiclassical limit. Finally, by revealing the connection between the bandwidth scaling and the underlying classical dynamics, our results suggest that the ETH carries important physical implications in single-particle and few-body systems, where "thermalization" manifests as the loss of information about initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal stability of synchronized coupled map lattice states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of spatiotemporal chaos, unstable periodic orbits play a major role in understanding the dynamics. Their stability changes and bifurcations in general are thus of central interest. Here, coupled map lattice discretizations of nonlinear partial differential equations, exhibiting a variety of behaviors depending on the coupling strength, are considered. In particular, the linear stability analysis of synchronized states is performed by evaluating the Bravais lattice orbit Jacobian in its reciprocal space first Brillouin zone, with space and time treated on equal grounds. The eigenvalues of the orbit Jacobian operator, computed as functions of the coupling strength, tell us about the stability of the periodic orbit under a perturbation of a certain time- and space frequency. Moreover, the stability under aperiodic, that is, incoherent perturbations, is revealed by integrating the sum of the stability exponents over all space-time frequencies.</description>

      <title>Modeling Epidemics on Multiplex Networks: Epidemic Threshold and Basic Reproduction Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate epidemic forecasting requires models that account for the layered and heterogeneous nature of real social interactions. The basic reproduction number $\mathcal R_0$ calculated from models that assume homogeneous mixing or single-layer contact structures have limited applicability to complex social systems. Here, we propose an expression of $\mathcal R_0$ in the context of multiplex networks, enabling the analysis of disease transmission across multiple social layers.
  We adapt the Degree-Based Mean-Field (DBMF) SIR model for single-layered complex networks to the multiplex setting, where each layer has its own degree distribution and infection rate. Using the Next Generation Matrix method, we derive an analytical expression for the basic reproduction number $\mathcal R_0$. Numerical integration of the multiplex DBMF equations shows that $\mathcal R_0 = 1$ marks the epidemic threshold and governs the functional dependence of key outbreak indicators. In addition to the exact result for the $\mathcal R_0$, we provide an approximation denoted as $\tau$, which is easier to compute and more straightforward to interpret in terms of the parameters of the system, and shares most of the expected properties of the basic reproduction number.
  Stochastic agent-based simulations confirm these results, demonstrating a direct correspondence between $\tau$ and the average number of secondary infections in the early epidemic phase, in line with the interpretation of $\mathcal R_0$.
  This research provides a robust generalization of $\mathcal R_0$ for layered contact structures, offering a more realistic basis for epidemic forecasting and the design of intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of quantum processes: An operational framework for free energy and reversible athermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the thermodynamics of quantum processes (quantum channels) by axiomatically introducing the free energy for channels, defined via the quantum relative entropy with an absolutely thermal channel whose fixed output is in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. This definition finds strong support through its operational interpretations in designated quantum information and thermodynamic tasks. We construct a resource theory of athermality for quantum processes, where free operations are Gibbs preserving superchannels and golden units are unitary channels with respect to absolutely thermal channel having fully degenerate output Hamiltonian. We exactly characterize the one-shot distillation and formation of quantum channels using hypothesis-testing and max-relative entropy with respect to the absolutely thermal channel. These rates converge asymptotically to the channel free energy (up to a multiplicative factor of half the inverse temperature), establishing its operational meaning and proving the asymptotic reversibility of the athermality. We show the direct relation between the resource theory of athermality and quantum information tasks such as private randomness and purity distillation and thermodynamic tasks of erasure and work extraction. Our work connects the core thermodynamic concepts of free energy, energy, entropy, and maximal extractable work of quantum processes to their information processing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Prethermal gauge structure and surface growth in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal aspects of thermalization in interacting many-body systems are typically challenging to derive microscopically, yet provide a powerful framework for understanding emergent phenomena. Here, we numerically study the mean-field dynamics of a $(2+1)$D spin system with thousands of spins and show that experimentally-feasible two-body Ising interactions can stabilize a prethermal $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge structure with dynamical matter, manifested by a gauge-invariant plateau with exponentially long lifetime. Eventually, the metastable prethermal $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge structure breaks down via a proliferation of Gauss' law defects, similar to bubble formation in false vacuum decay. In this regime, we discover spatio-temporal correlations described by a non-linear surface growth consistent with the $(1+1)$D Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. We benchmark our results in small systems against semi-classical discrete time Wigner approximation (DTWA) and exact diagonalization (ED), where the breakdown of DTWA signals the emergence of an extensive number of local symmetries that strongly influence the thermalization pathway. Our model provides a testbed for quantum simulators and is directly implementable in large-scale arrays of Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>A framework for the use of generative modelling in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11630v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. The FEP is a method whose use allows us to build a model of the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations amongst subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations amongst subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03927v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temperature of a finite-sized system fluctuates due to the thermal fluctuations. However, a systematic mathematical framework for measuring or estimating the temperature is still underdeveloped. Here, we incorporate the estimation theory in statistical inference to estimate the temperature of a finite-sized system and propose optimal estimation based on the uniform minimum variance unbiased estimation. Treating the finite-sized system as a thermometer measuring the temperature of a heat reservoir, we demonstrate that different optimal estimation of parameters yield different formulas of entropy, e.g., optimal estimation of inverse temperature (or temperature) aligns with the Boltzmann entropy (or Gibbs entropy). The optimal estimation leads to a achievable energy-temperature uncertainty relation and exhibits sample-size dependence, coinciding with their counterparts in nanothermodynamics. The achievable bound and the non-Gaussian distribution of temperature enable experimental testing in finite-sized systems.</description>

Abstract: Preparing thermal and ground states is an essential quantum algorithmic task for quantum simulation. In this work, we construct the first efficiently implementable and exactly detailed-balanced Lindbladian for Gibbs states of arbitrary noncommutative Hamiltonians. Our construction can also be regarded as a continuous-time quantum analog of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. To prepare the quantum Gibbs state, our algorithm invokes Hamiltonian simulation for a time proportional to the mixing time and the inverse temperature $\beta$, up to polylogarithmic factors. Moreover, the gate complexity reduces significantly for lattice Hamiltonians as the corresponding Lindblad operators are (quasi-) local (with radius $\sim\beta$) and only depend on local Hamiltonian patches. Meanwhile, purifying our Lindbladians yields a temperature-dependent family of frustration-free "parent Hamiltonians", prescribing an adiabatic path for the canonical purified Gibbs state (i.e., the Thermal Field Double state). These favorable features suggest that our construction serves as a quantum algorithmic counterpart to classical Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Relaxation and Odd-Even Effect in Finite-Temperature Electron Gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pauli blocking in Fermi liquids imposes strong phase-space constraints on quasiparticle lifetimes, leading to a well-known quadratic-in-temperature decay rate of quasiparticle modes at low temperatures. In two-dimensional systems, however, even longer-lived modes are predicted (dubbed ``odd-parity'' modes) that involve a collective deformation of the Fermi distribution. Here, we present an efficient method to evaluate the full spectrum of relaxational eigenmodes of a Fermi liquid within kinetic theory. We employ this method to study the experimentally relevant case of a Fermi liquid with screened Coulomb interactions and map out the decay rates of quasiparticle modes beyond the asymptotic low-temperature limit up to the Fermi temperature, thus covering the entire temperature range of typical experiments. We confirm the existence of anomalously long-lived odd-parity modes and provide a comprehensive classification and detailed analysis of the relaxation spectrum. In particular, we find that (i) the odd-parity effect in the decay rates extends to temperatures as large as $T=0.15T_F$, (ii) there is only a small number of long-lived odd-parity modes, with an infinite number of remaining modes that show standard Fermi-liquid scaling, and (iii) the ratio between the odd- and even-parity lifetimes is tunable with the Coulomb interaction strength, in addition to temperature, which reflects a difference in the microscopic relaxation mechanism of the modes. Our findings provide a comprehensive description of the nonequilibrium relaxation behavior of two-dimensional electron gases and bridge a significant gap in our understanding of these systems.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms by which complex correlations emerge through the dynamics of quantum many-body systems remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. To address this, quench dynamics starting from nonthermal states have been extensively studied, leading to significant progress. In this paper, we propose a novel quench protocol, termed the "crosscap quench", to investigate how highly structured thermal pure states relax into typical ones. We begin by analyzing conformal field theories (CFTs) and derive universal features in the time evolution of the entanglement entropy. Furthermore, leveraging the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study holographic CFTs, providing an analytically tractable example in chaotic CFTs. Finally, we validate these findings through numerical simulations in both nonintegrable and integrable quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Global symmetries of quantum lattice models under non-invertible dualities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12514v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-invertible dualities/symmetries have become an important tool in the study of quantum field theories and quantum lattice models in recent years. One of the most studied examples is non-invertible dualities obtained by gauging a discrete group. When the physical system has more global symmetries than the gauged symmetry, it has not been thoroughly investigated how those global symmetries transform under non-invertible duality. In this paper, we study the change of global symmetries under non-invertible duality of gauging a discrete group $G$ in the context of (1+1)-dimensional quantum lattice models. We obtain the global symmetries of the dual model by focusing on different Hilbert space sectors determined by the $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We provide general conjectures of global symmetries of the dual model forming an algebraic ring of the double cosets. We present concrete examples of the XXZ models and the duals, providing strong evidence for the conjectures.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Physics perspective on fairness in shared expenses: The bar bill analogy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In social contexts where individuals consume varying amounts, such as shared meals or bar gatherings, splitting the total bill equally often yields surprisingly fair outcomes. In this work, we develop a statistical physics framework to explain this emergent fairness by modeling individual consumption as stochastic variables drawn from a realistic distribution, specifically the gamma distribution. Introducing a Boltzmann-like weighting factor, we derive exact analytical expressions for the partition function, average consumption, variance, and entropy under economic or social penalization constraints. Numerical simulations, performed using the Marsaglia-Tsang algorithm, confirm the analytical results with high precision. Drawing a direct parallel between individual consumption and ideal gas particle energy in the canonical ensemble, we show how the law of large numbers, mutual compensation, and the effective ordering induced by penalization combine to make equal cost-sharing statistically robust and predictable. These findings reveal that what appears to be an informal social convention is, in fact, grounded in the same fundamental principles that govern the collective behavior of particles in thermodynamic systems, highlighting the interdisciplinary power of statistical physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on the geometric formulation of quantum mechanics, we develop a coherence theory for ensembles that exploits the probability-phase structure of the quantum state space. Standard coherence measures quantify superposition within density matrices but cannot distinguish ensembles that produce the same mixed state through different distributions of pure states. First, we introduce the probability-phase mutual information $I(P;\Phi)$, which measures statistical correlations between measurement-accessible probabilities and measurement-inaccessible phases across an ensemble. Then, we prove this satisfies the axioms of a coherence monotone, establishing it as a bona-fide measure of ensemble-level coherence. Eventually, through the definition of the \emph{coherence surplus} $\delta_{\mathcal{C}} \geq 0$, we show how ensemble coherence relates to, but exceeds, density-matrix coherence, thus quantifying structure lost in statistical averaging.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulation of many-body localization crossover in a disordered kicked Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. However, a faithful digital quantum simulation of the Hamiltonian evolution is very challenging in the present noisy quantum devices. Instead, nonequilibrium dynamics under the Floquet evolution realized by the Trotter decomposition of the Hamiltonian evolution with a large Trotter step size is considered to be a suitable problem for simulating in the present or near-term quantum devices. In this work, we propose simulating the many-body localization crossover as such a nonequilibrium problem in the disordered Floquet many-body systems. As a demonstration, we simulate the many-body localization crossover in a disordered kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice using $60$ qubits from $156$ qubits available in the IBM Heron r2 superconducting qubit device named ibm\_fez. We compute out-of-time-ordered correlators as an indicator of the many-body localization crossover. From the late-time behavior of out-of-time-ordered correlators, we locate the quantum chaotic and many-body localized regimes as a function of the disorder strength. The validity of the results is confirmed by comparing two independent error mitigation methods, that is, the operator renormalization method and zero-noise extrapolation.</description>
