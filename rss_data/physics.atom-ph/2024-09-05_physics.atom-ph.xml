      <title>Laser cooling a centimeter-scale torsion pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We laser cool a centimeter-scale torsion pendulum to a temperature of 10 mK (average occupancy of 6000 phonons) starting from room temperature (equivalent to $2\times 10^8$ phonons). This is achieved by optical radiation pressure forces conditioned on a quantum-noise-limited optical measurement of the pendulum's angular displacement with an imprecision 13 dB below that at the standard quantum limit (SQL). The measurement sensitivity is the result of a novel `mirrored' optical lever that passively rejects extraneous spatial-mode noise by 60 dB. The high mechanical quality ($10^7$) and quantum-noise-limited sub-SQL measurement imprecision demonstrate the necessary ingredients for realizing the quantum ground state of torsional motion -- a pre-requisite for mechanical tests of gravity's alleged quantum nature.</description>

      <title>Symmetry based efficient simulation of dissipative quantum many-body dynamics in subwavelength quantum emitter arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient method to numerically simulate the dissipative dynamics of large numbers of quantum emitters in ordered arrays in the presence of long-range dipole-dipole interactions mediated by the vacuum electromagnetic field. Using the spatial symmetries of the system, we rewrite the equations of motion in a collective spin basis and subsequently apply a higher-order cumulant expansion for the collective operators. By truncating the subradiant collective modes with a heavily suppressed decay rate and keeping only the effect from the radiating collective modes, we reduce the numerical complexity significantly. This allows to efficiently compute the dissipative dynamics of the observables of interest for a linear, ring-shaped and planar arrays of quantum emitters. In particular, we characterize the excited population, the total photon emission rate and the second order intensity correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau =0)$, which are challenging to compute for large systems with traditional cumulant expansion methods based on the individual spins.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian Algorithms for Maximum Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14546v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With qubits encoded into atomic ground and Rydberg states and situated on the vertexes of a graph, the conditional quantum dynamics of Rydberg blockade, which inhibits simultaneous excitation of nearby atoms, has been employed recently to find maximum independent sets following an adiabatic evolution algorithm hereafter denoted by HV [Science 376, 1209 (2022)]. An alternative algorithm, short named the PK algorithm, reveals that the independent sets diffuse over a media graph governed by a non-abelian gauge matrix of an emergent PXP model. This work shows the above two algorithms are mathematically equivalent, despite of their seemingly different physical implementations. More importantly, we demonstrated that although the two are mathematically equivalent, the PK algorithm exhibits more efficient and resource-saving performance. Within the same range of experimental parameters, our numerical studies suggest that the PK algorithm performs at least 25% better on average and saves at least $6\times10^6$ measurements ($\sim 900$ hours of continuous operation) for each graph when compared to the HV algorithm. We further consider the measurement error and point out that this may cause the oscillations in the performance of the HV's optimization process.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of the Fidelity in Open Qudit Systems: Gate and Noise Dependence in High-dimensional Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum computing has generated significant interest due to its potential to address scalability and error correction challenges faced by traditional qubit-based systems. This paper investigates the Average Gate Fidelity (AGF) of single qudit systems under Markovian noise in the Lindblad formalism, extending previous work by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework for the calculation of higher-order correction terms. We derive general expressions for the perturbative expansion of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) in terms of the environmental coupling coefficient and validate these with extensive numerical simulations, emphasizing the transition from linear to nonlinear behaviour in the strong coupling regime. Our findings highlight the dependence of AGI on qudit dimensionality, quantum gate choice, and noise strength, providing critical insights for optimising quantum gate design and error correction protocols. Additionally, we utilise our framework to identify universal bounds for the AGI in the strong coupling regime and explore the practical implications for enhancing the performance of near-term qudit architectures. This study offers a robust foundation for future research and development in high-dimensional quantum computing, contributing to the advancement of robust, high-fidelity quantum operations.</description>
