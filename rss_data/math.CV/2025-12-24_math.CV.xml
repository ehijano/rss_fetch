      <title>Characterizations of quasihyperbolic John domains and uniform domains in metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work of Zhou and Ponnusamy [Ann. Sc. Norm. Super. Pisa Ci. Sci. 2025], the authors studied the following natural question: find sufficient and necessary conditions for a domain $\Omega$ in a metric space $X$ to be quasihyperbolic John. It was proved that Gromov hyperbolic John domains are quasihyperbolic John, quantitatively. As an application, they obtained a characterization of uniform domains in Ahlfors regular spaces.
  In a recent work, using a deep improved characterization of Gromov hyperbolicity, Guo, Huang and Wang [arXiv 2025] proved the quantitative equivalence bteween inner uniformity and the quasihyperbolic John condition in metric doubling spaces. However, the proof does not yield a similar characterization for uniform domains. In this article, we find a new elementary approach to successfully extend the above characterization to uniform domains: a domain $\Omega$ in a doubling length space $X$ is uniform if and only if it is linearly locally connected (LLC) and satisfies the ball separation condition, if and only if it is LLC-1 and quasihyperbolic John, quantitatively. This substantially improved the corresponding results of Zhou and Ponnusamy. Our new approach also allows us to give an alternative proof of the inner uniformity result of Guo-Huang-Wang without using the improved characterization on Gromov hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>Singular Gauduchon Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1984 Gauduchon conjectured that one can find Gauduchon metrics with prescribed Ricci curvature on all compact complex manifolds. This conjecture was settled by Sz\'ekelyhidi-Tosatti-Weinkove (TW17, TW19, STW17) by the study of the Monge-Amp\`ere equation for $(n-1)$-plurisubharmonic functions with a gradient term. In this paper we study a singular version of this conjecture. We obtain a $C^{0}$-estimate for this problem, without gradient terms, in smoothable hermitian variaties by adapting a recent technique of Guedj-Lu. We also prove the smoothness of solutions on holomorphic K\"ahler families, generalizing TW17.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity and fundamental groups of complex quasi-projective varieties (III): applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is Part III of a series of three. We begin by introducing the notion of $h$-special varieties, which can be seen as varieties "chain-connected by the Zariski closures of entire curves." We prove that if $X$ is either a special complex quasi-projective variety in the sense of Campana or an $h$-special variety, then for any linear representation $\varrho:\pi_1(X)\to \mathrm{GL}_N(\mathbb{C})$, the image $\varrho(\pi_1(X))$ is virtually nilpotent. We also provide examples showing that this result is sharp, leading to a revised form of Campana's abelianity conjecture for smooth quasi-projective varieties. In addition, we prove a structure theorem for quasi-projective varieties with big and semisimple representations of the fundamental groups, thereby addressing a conjecture by Koll\'ar in 1995. We also construct several examples of quasi-projective varieties that are special and $h$-special, highlighting certain atypical properties of the non-compact case in contrast with the projective setting.</description>

      <title>From the planar Ising model to quasiconformal mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify the scaling limit of full-plane Kadanoff-Ceva fermions on generic, non-degenerate $s$-embeddings. In this broad setting, the scaling limits are described in terms of solutions to conjugate Beltrami equations with prescribed singularities. For the underlying Ising model, this leads to the scaling limit of the energy-energy correlations and reveals a connection between the scaling limits of (near-)critical planar Ising models and quasiconformal mappings. For grids approximating bounded domains in the complex plane, we establish, in the scaling regime, the conformal covariance of the energy density on critical doubly periodic graphs. We complement this result with an analogous statement in the case where the limiting conformal structure generates a maximal surface $(z,\vartheta)$ in Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{(2,1)}$. All scaling factors obtained are local and expressed in terms of the geometry of the embedding, even in situations where they vary drastically from one region to another.
  These results confirm the predictions of Chelkak and highlight that the scaling limits of generic (near-)critical Ising models naturally live on a substantially richer conformal structure than the classical Euclidean one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we prove a central limit theorem for the mass distribution of random holomorphic sections associated with a sequence of positive line bundles endowed with $\mathscr{C}^3$ Hermitian metrics over a compact K\"{a}hler manifold. In addition, we show that almost every sequence of such random holomorphic sections exhibits quantum ergodicity in the sense of Zelditch.</description>

      <title>Boundedness and compactness of Bergman projection commutators in two-weight setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to study the boundedness and compactness of the Bergman projection commutators in two weighted settings via the weighted BMO and VMO spaces, respectively. The novelty of our work lies in the distinct treatment of the symbol b in the commutator, depending on whether it is analytic or not, which turns out to be quite different. In particular, we show that an additional weight condition due to Aleman, Pott, and Reguera is necessary to study the commutators when b is not analytic, while it can be relaxed when b is analytic. In the analytic setting, we completely characterize boundedness and compactness, while in the non-analytic setting, we provide a sufficient condition which generalizes the Euclidean case and is also necessary in many cases of interest. Our work initiates a study of the commutators acting on complex function spaces with different symbols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conformal boundary of a hyperbolic $3$-manifold $M$ is a union of Riemann surfaces. If any of these Riemann surfaces has a nontrivial Teichm\"uller space, then the hyperbolic metric of $M$ can be deformed quasi-isometrically. These deformations correspond to small pertubations in the matrices of the holonomy group $ \pi_1(M) \subset \mathsf{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C}) $, which together give an island of discrete representations around the identity map in $ X=\operatorname{Hom}(\pi_1(M), \mathsf{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})) $. Determining the extent of this island is a hard problem. If $M$ is geometrically finite and its convex core boundary is pleated only along simple closed curves, then we cut up its conformal boundary in a way governed by the pleating combinatorics to produce a fundamental domain for $ \pi_1(M) $ that is combinatorially stable under small deformations, even those which change the pleating structure. We give a computable region in $X$, cut out by polynomial inequalities over $\mathbb{R}$, within which this fundamental domain is valid: all the groups in the region have peripheral structures that look `coarsely similar', in that they come from real-algebraically deforming a fixed conformal polygon and its side-pairings. The union of all these regions for different pleating laminations gives a countable cover, with sets of controlled topology, of the entire quasi-isometric deformation space of $ \pi_1(M) $ -- which is known to be topologically wild.</description>

      <title>A Complete Characterization of Pythagorean Hodograph Preserving Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We fully characterize the mappings $\Phi$ that send every Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curve to a PH curve. We prove that in any dimension, such mappings are precisely the conformal functions whose dilation is the square of a real rational function. In the planar case, this implies (up to conjugation) that $\partial\Phi/\partial z = \Psi^{2}$, where $\Psi$ is meromorphic and satisfies $\operatorname{Res}(\Psi^{2}) = 0$ at every pole. In higher dimensions, PH preservation forces $\Phi$ to be a conformal map; for $n \ge 3$, Liouville's theorem then implies that any local diffeomorphism with this property is (anti-)M\"obius. These results subsume the previously known ``(scaled) PH-preserving'' constructions of mappings $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ and align with Ueda's conformal viewpoint on isothermal and spherical geometries. At the level of examples, we demonstrate how PH-preserving mappings relate to the construction of rational PH curves and minimal surfaces.</description>
