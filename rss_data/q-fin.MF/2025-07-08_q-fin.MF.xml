      <title>Perpetual American Standard and Lookback Options in Insider Models with Progressively Enlarged Filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive closed-form solutions to the optimal stopping problems related to the pricing of perpetual American standard and lookback put and call options in the extensions of the Black-Merton-Scholes model with progressively enlarged filtrations. More specifically, the information available to the insider is modelled by Brownian filtrations progressively enlarged with the times of either the global maximum or minimum of the underlying risky asset price over the infinite time interval, which is not a stopping time in the filtration generated by the underlying risky asset. We show that the optimal exercise times are the first times at which the asset price process reaches either lower or upper stochastic boundaries depending on the current values of its running maximum or minimum given the occurrence of times of either the global maximum or minimum, respectively. The proof is based on the reduction of the original problems into the necessarily three-dimensional optimal stopping problems and the equivalent free-boundary problems. We apply either the normal-reflection or the normal-entrance conditions as well as the smooth-fit conditions for the value functions to characterise the candidate boundaries as either the maximal or minimal solutions to the associated first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations and the transcendental arithmetic equations, respectively.</description>

      <title>On time-consistent equilibrium stopping under aggregation of diverse discount rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a central planner's decision making on behalf of a group of members with diverse discount rates. In the context of optimal stopping, we work with an aggregation preference to incorporate all discount rates via an attitude function that reflects the aggregation rule chosen by the central planner. The problem formulation is also applicable to single agent's stopping problem with uncertain discount rate, where our aggregation preference coincides with the conventional smooth ambiguity preference. The resulting optimal stopping problem is time inconsistent, for which we develop an iterative approach using consistent planning and characterize all time-consistent mild equilibria as fixed points of an operator in the setting of one-dimensional diffusion processes. We provide some sufficient conditions on the underlying models and the attitude function such that the smallest mild equilibrium attains the optimal equilibrium. In addition, we show that the optimal equilibrium is a weak equilibrium. When the sufficient condition of the attitude function is violated, we illustrate by various examples that the characterization of the optimal equilibrium may differ significantly from some existing results for a single agent, which now sensitively depends on the attitude function and the diversity distribution of discount rates within the group.</description>

      <title>Computation of Greeks under rough Volterra stochastic volatility models using the Malliavin calculus approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Malliavin calculus techniques, we obtain formulas for computing Greeks under different rough Volterra stochastic volatility models. Due to the fact that underlying prices are not always square integrable, we extend the classical integration by parts formula to integrable but not necessarily square integrable functionals. First of all, we obtain formulas for general stochastic volatility (SV) models, concretely the Greeks Delta, Gamma, Rho, Vega and we introduce the Greek with respect to the roughness parameter. Then, the particular case of rough Volterra SV models is analyzed. Finally, three examples are treated in detail: the family of alpha-RFSV models, that includes rough versions of SABR and Bergomi models, a mixed alpha-RFSV model with two different Hurst parameters representing short (roughness) and long memory, and the rough Stein-Stein model. For different models and Greeks we show a numerical convergence of our formulas in Monte Carlo simulations and depict for example a dependence of the Greeks on the roughness parameter.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of behavioral singular stochastic control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the well-posedness of a general class of singular stochastic control problems in which controls are processes of finite variation. We develop an abstract framework, which we then apply to storage management and portfolio investment problems under proportional transaction costs. Within this setting, we establish the existence of an optimal strategy in the class of randomized controls for a range of goal functionals, including cumulative prospect theory (CPT) preferences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first treatment of behavioral storage management with the CPT goal functional. For the portfolio management problem, our analysis exploits the metrizable Meyer-Zheng topology to simplify proofs. We thoroughly investigate the applicability of the Skorokhod representation theorem for adapted random processes. Overall, the presented framework provides a clear separation between constraints imposed on the market model and properties required of the goal functional.</description>

      <title>The geometry of financial institutions -- Wasserstein clustering of financial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing availability of granular and big data on various objects of interest has made it necessary to develop methods for condensing this information into a representative and intelligible map. Financial regulation is a field that exemplifies this need, as regulators require diverse and often highly granular data from financial institutions to monitor and assess their activities. However, processing and analyzing such data can be a daunting task, especially given the challenges of dealing with missing values and identifying clusters based on specific features.
  To address these challenges, we propose a variant of Lloyd's algorithm that applies to probability distributions and uses generalized Wasserstein barycenters to construct a metric space which represents given data on various objects in condensed form. By applying our method to the financial regulation context, we demonstrate its usefulness in dealing with the specific challenges faced by regulators in this domain. We believe that our approach can also be applied more generally to other fields where large and complex data sets need to be represented in concise form.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Factor Models: Generating High-Dimensional Returns with Factor Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial scenario simulation is essential for risk management and portfolio optimization, yet it remains challenging especially in high-dimensional and small data settings common in finance. We propose a diffusion factor model that integrates latent factor structure into generative diffusion processes, bridging econometrics with modern generative AI to address the challenges of the curse of dimensionality and data scarcity in financial simulation. By exploiting the low-dimensional factor structure inherent in asset returns, we decompose the score function--a key component in diffusion models--using time-varying orthogonal projections, and this decomposition is incorporated into the design of neural network architectures. We derive rigorous statistical guarantees, establishing nonasymptotic error bounds for both score estimation at O(d^{5/2} n^{-2/(k+5)}) and generated distribution at O(d^{5/4} n^{-1/2(k+5)}), primarily driven by the intrinsic factor dimension k rather than the number of assets d, surpassing the dimension-dependent limits in the classical nonparametric statistics literature and making the framework viable for markets with thousands of assets. Numerical studies confirm superior performance in latent subspace recovery under small data regimes. Empirical analysis demonstrates the economic significance of our framework in constructing mean-variance optimal portfolios and factor portfolios. This work presents the first theoretical integration of factor structure with diffusion models, offering a principled approach for high-dimensional financial simulation with limited data. Our code is available at https://github.com/xymmmm00/diffusion_factor_model.</description>
