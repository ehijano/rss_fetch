      <title>Regular polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of regular polygons with a compass and straightedge is a well-known task and this problem has interested mathematicians for a long time. In particular, for a long time they could not answer the question of whether is it possible to construct a regular 17-gon with a compass and straightedge. C. F. Gauss solved this problem in 1796. He proved later that it is possible to construct with a compass and straightedge the regular polygons with $n=2^m n_1\cdots n_l$ sides, where $n_1,\cdots, n_l$ are different prime numbers of the form $\; n_k=2^{2^{\nu_k}}+1$. P. Wantzel proved in 1837 that only these regular polygons can be constructed. Essential is here the construction of the regular polygons with $n_k=2^{2^{\nu_k}}+1$ sides. The currently known prime numbers of the form $n=2^{2^{\nu}}+1$ are $3, 5, 17, 257$ and $65537$. In the paper we present a new approach for solving this task. Among other things we analyze in detail the case of $n=65537$. J. G. Hermes announced in 1894 that he had a full description of the construction of the 65537-gon. This was the result of 10 years of work, but his text was too extensive and was never published. We show exactly and without gaps how the regular 65537-gon can be constructed.</description>

      <title>On various Carleson-type geometric lemmas and uniform rectifiability in metric spaces: Part 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize uniform $k$-rectifiability in Euclidean spaces in terms of a Carleson-type geometric lemma for a new notion of flatness coefficients, which we call $\iota$-numbers. The characterization follows from an abstract statement about approximation by generalized planes in metric spaces, which also applies to the study of low-dimensional sets in Heisenberg groups. A key aspect is that the $\iota$-coefficients are in general not pointwise comparable to the usual squared $\beta$-numbers for dyadic cubes on $k$-regular sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$, however our result implies that they are still equivalent in terms of a Carleson-type geometric lemma.</description>

      <title>On a Simplex Contained in a Ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $B_n$ be the $n$-dimensional unit ball given by the inequality $\|x\|\leq 1$, where $\|x\|$ is the standard Euclid norm in ${\mathbb R}^n$. For an $n$-dimensional nondegenerate simplex $S$, we denote by $E$ the ellipsoid of minimum volume which contains $S$. Suppose $S\subset B_n$, $0\leq m\leq n-1$. Let $G$ be any $m$-dimensional face of $S$ and let $H$ be the opposite $(n-m-1)$-dimensional face. Denote by $g$ and $h$ the centers of gravity of $G$ and $H$ respectively. Define $y$ as the intersection point of the line passing from $g$ to $h$ with the boundary of $E$. Let us call the face $G$ suitable if $y\in B_n.$ Earlier it was proved that each simplex $S\subset B_n$ has a suitable face of any dimension $\leq n-1$. We show the following. If some vertex of $S$ is suitable, then there exists a suitable face of any dimension $\leq n-1$ which contains this vertex.</description>

      <title>Sharp H\"older regularity of weak solutions of the Neumann problem and applications to nonlocal PDE in metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove global H\"older regularity result for weak solutions $u\in N^{1,p}(\Omega, \mu)$ to a PDE of $p$-Laplacian type with a measure as non-homogeneous term: \[ -\text{div}\!\left( |\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u \right)=\overline\nu, \] 
where $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and $\overline\nu \in (N^{1,p}(\Omega,\mu))^*$ is a signed Radon measure supported in $\overline \Omega$. Here, $\Omega$ is a John domain in a metric measure space satisfying a doubling condition and a $p$-Poincar\'e inequality, and $\nabla u$ is the Cheeger gradient. The regularity results obtained in this paper improve on earlier estimates proved by the authors in \cite{CGKS} for the study of the Neumann problem, and have applications to the regularity of solutions of nonlocal PDE in doubling metric spaces. Moreover, the obtained H\"older exponent matches with the known sharp result in the Euclidean case \cite{CSt,BLS,BT}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce new flatness coefficients, which we call $\iota$-numbers, for Ahlfors $k$-regular sets in metric spaces ($k\in \mathbb{N}$). Using these coefficients for $k=1$, we characterize uniform $1$-rectifiability in rather general metric spaces, completing earlier work by Hahlomaa and Schul. Our proof proceeds by quantifying an isometric embedding theorem due to Menger, and by an abstract argument that allows to pass from a local covering by continua to a global covering by $1$-regular connected sets.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic quantization on Riemannian manifolds via covering growth estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantization problem looks for best approximations of a probability measure on a given metric space by finitely many points, where the approximation error is measured with respect to the Wasserstein distance. On particular smooth domains, such as $\mathbb{R}^d$ or complete Riemannian manifolds, the quantization error is known to decay polynomially as the number of points is taken to infinity, provided the measure satisfies an integral condition which controls the amount of mass outside compact sets. On Riemannian manifolds, the existing integral condition involves a quantity measuring the growth of the exponential map, for which the only available estimates are in terms of lower bounds on sectional curvature.
  In this paper, we provide a more general integral condition for the asymptotics of the quantization error on Riemannian manifolds, given in terms of the growth of the covering numbers of spheres, which is purely metric in nature and concerns only the large-scale growth of the manifold. We further estimate the covering growth of manifolds in two particular cases, namely lower bounds on the Ricci curvature and geometric group actions by a discrete group of isometries. These estimates can themselves generalize beyond manifolds, and hint at a future treatment of asymptotic quantization also on non-smooth metric measure spaces.</description>

      <title>Isometric rigidity of the Wasserstein space over the plane with the maximum metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $p$-Wasserstein spaces over the branching spaces $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $[-1,1]^2$ equipped with the maximum norm metric. We show that these spaces are isometrically rigid for all $p\geq1,$ meaning that all isometries of these spaces are induced by isometries of the underlying space via the push-forward operation. This is in contrast to the case of the Euclidean metric since with that distance the $2$-Wasserstein space over $\mathbb{R}^2$ is not rigid. Also, we highlight that the $1$-Wasserstein space is not rigid over the closed interval $[-1,1]$, while according to our result, its two-dimensional analog, the closed unit ball $[-1,1]^2$ with the more complicated geodesic structure is rigid.</description>
