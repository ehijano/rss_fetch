      <title>Capillary phenomena: New fundamental formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a new fundamental formula that describes in a more coherent way, the rise and fall of liquids in capillaries. The variation of the contact angle classically associated with these phenomena appears to be the indirect result of a more authentic physical parameter, which we call the apparent capillary range. This range depends on factors expected to affect the contact angle, such as liquid-solid adhesion forces, liquid-liquid cohesion forces, liquid density, gravitational forces and the geometric shape of the capillary section. Our main objective in this work is not to criticize the classical theory, a task that has been largely accomplished, but to present a more general and coherent approach, which perfectly reconciles the thermodynamic and mechanical points of view and makes the interpretation of various configurations clearer. This new perspective can serve as a platform to guide researcher's efforts toward more promising results. In the first part of this work, we discuss the theoretical basis of the new formula using common examples. In the second part, we introduce the more explicit form of this formula, thus allowing a more precise quantification of wettability by providing access to the direct measurement of liquid-solid adhesive forces. The third part proposes a method for measuring static surface tension without the adverse effects of the substrate.</description>

      <title>Adhesion study at the interface of PDMS-elastomer and borosilicate glass-slide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adhesion control at the interface of two surfaces is crucial in many applications. Examples are the design of micro and nanodevices such as microfuidics devices, biochips, and electronic sensors. Adhesion at the interface of two materials can be controlled by various methods such as chemical treatment on the surface of the materials, modification of the surface texture of materials, and change of the mechanical properties of materials. The main idea of this study is to control the adhesion by changing the mechanical properties (modulus) of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer. We vary the modulus of PDMS elastomer by changing the mixing ratio of silicone elastomer base mixing ratio and its curing agent (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning). Our study also includes the effect of the thickness of the PDMS elastomer sheet on its adhesion behavior. Adhesion measurements at the interface of the borosilicate glass slide and different PDMS elastomer specimens were performed using a wedge test. This method inserts a glass coverslip at the interface to create the wedge. We observe a significant decrease in the work of adhesion and an increase in equilibrium crack length with an increase in elastic-modulus and thickness of the PDMS elastomer samples. We present and discuss the effect of modulus and specimen-thickness on the adhesion behavior of PDMS elastomer against glass slide.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Mamba state-space model for anomalous diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing anomalous diffusion is crucial in order to understand the evolution of complex stochastic systems, from molecular interactions to cellular dynamics. In this work, we characterize the performances regarding such a task of Bi-Mamba, a novel state-space deep-learning architecture articulated with a bidirectional scan mechanism. Our implementation is tested on the AnDi-2 challenge datasets among others. Designed for regression tasks, the Bi-Mamba architecture infers efficiently the effective diffusion coefficient and anomalous exponent from single, short trajectories. As such, our results indicate the potential practical use of the Bi-Mamba architecture for anomalousdiffusion characterization.</description>

      <title>Controlled Locomotion of a Minimal Soft Structure by Stick-Slip Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a locomotion mechanism that uses the stick-slip transition of a soft passive structure with an internal mechanical resonance. The structure is harmonically driven by a global vertical shaking and, because of its resonance dephasing and the threshold response of stick-slip transition, it can either move forward or backward. We establish a relation for the motion acceleration threshold that we experimentally validate. We identify a non-trivial regime close to the resonance with a velocity inversion for a constant excitation frequency and an increasing driving amplitude. We finally show that we can achieve a controlled multi-modal motion by combining multiple internal resonances.</description>

      <title>Magnetic colloidal single particles and \changes{dumbbells} on a tilted washboard moire pattern in a precessing external field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the dynamical behavior of colloidal singlets and dumbbells on an inclined magnetic moir\'e pattern, subject to a precessing external homogeneous magnetic field. At low external field strength single colloidal particles and dumbbells move everywhere on the pattern: At stronger external field strengths colloidal singlets and dumbbells are localized in generic locations. There are however nongeneric locations of flat channels that cross the moir\'e Wigner Seitz cell. In the flat channels we find gravitational driven translational and non-translational dynamic phase behavior of the colloidal singlets and dumbbells depending on the external field strength and the precession angle of the external homogeneous magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Bacterial liquid-bridge evaporation and deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study evaporation and precipitate formation mechanics of bacteria-laden liquid bridge using experimental and theoretical analysis. Aqueous suspension of motile and non-motile Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa typically found in contaminated food and water were used in liquid bridge configuration between hydrophilic substrates. Using inverse logarithmic evaporation flux model, we study volume regression for cylindrical/catenoid volume models with confinement distance as a parameter. For all confinement distances, the regression is linear on normalizing both volume and time as in the case of pure sessile drop. However, in normalized volume and dimensional time space, we observe non-linearities as the evaporation time scales non linearly with the confinement distance. The non-linearities were captured using the catenoid model. The catenoid model conforms to the experimental volume regression data at all confinement distances, and the transient liquid bridge interface evolution profile at high confinement distance. We also study the precipitate pattern and bacterial distribution using micro/nano characterization techniques. We show the average precipitate pattern for both sessile and higher confinement distance resembles coffee ring type deposits although the underlying bacterial distribution differs. For lower confinement, we observe pattern resulting from a combination of coffee ring effect, stick-slick motion, and thin film instability. The reduction in confinement distance causes an altered bacterial agglomeration, resulting in a multi-pattern network instead of a single circumferential edge deposition. We show the aerial size of motile bacteria increases with decreasing confinement, whereas the size for non-motile bacteria remains constant in the precipitate.</description>

      <title>Quasi-universal behaviour of shear relaxation times in simple fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the shear relaxation times in four important simple monatomic model fluids: Lennard-Jones, Yukawa, soft-sphere and hard-sphere fluids. It is observed that in properly reduced units, the shear relaxation times exhibit quasi-universal behaviour when the density increases from the gas-like low values to the high-density regime near crystallization. They first decrease with density at low densities, reach minima at moderate densities, and then increase toward the freezing point. The reduced relaxation times at the minima and at the fluid-solid phase transition are all comparable for the various systems investigated, despite more than ten orders of magnitude difference in real systems. Important implications of these results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Entropy production of active Brownian particles going from liquid to hexatic and solid phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its inherent intertwinement with irreversibility, entropy production is a prime observable to monitor in systems of active particles. In this numerical study, entropy production in the liquid, hexatic and solid phases of a two-dimensional system of active Brownian particles is examined at both average and fluctuation level. The trends of averages as functions of density show no singularity and marked changes in their derivatives at the hexatic-solid transition. Distributions show instead peculiar tail structures interpreted by looking at microscopic configurations. Particles in regions of low local order generate tail values according to different dynamical mechanisms: they move towards empty regions or bounce back and forth into close neighbours. The tail structures are reproduced by a simple single-particle model including an intermittent harmonic potential.</description>

      <title>Effects of diameter polydispersity and small-range interactions on the structure of biocompatible colloidal nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The particles of synthetic colloids are usually treated with chemical techniques to prevent the loss of colloidal stability caused by van der Waals and magnetic dipolar attractive interactions. However, understanding the counterbalance between the attractive and repulsive interactions is challenging due to the limitations of the conventional mesoscopic models at short nanoparticle separations. In this study, we examined three models that describe short-range interactions by proposing different corrections to the van der Waals energy for short distances. The three models show only a minimal deviation from energy extensivity, as expected of a system with a comparatively short interaction range. Our analysis shows that a more detailed microscopic model at short-range separations is crucial for proper sampling, which is necessary to estimate physical quantities adequately. The same model predicts that polydispersity can lead to an overall decrease in mean particle distance for a configuration with 5% colloidal volume fraction. The other, simpler models make the opposite prediction, which opens an interesting venue for experimental exploration that could shed light on the validity of this model. The predicted decrease in particle distance could lead to coagulation, suggesting a preference for ferrofluids with more uniform particle sizes, leading to lower attraction, but still responding to applied fields, as needed in most applications.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian finite element method for lipid membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian finite element method and numerical implementation for curved and deforming lipid membranes is presented here. The membrane surface is endowed with a mesh whose in-plane motion need not depend on the in-plane flow of lipids. Instead, in-plane mesh dynamics can be specified arbitrarily. A new class of mesh motions is introduced, where the mesh velocity satisfies the dynamical equations of a user-specified two-dimensional material. A Lagrange multiplier constrains the out-of-plane membrane and mesh velocities to be equal, such that the mesh and material always overlap. An associated numerical inf--sup instability ensues, and is removed by adapting established techniques in the finite element analysis of fluids. In our implementation, the aforementioned Lagrange multiplier is projected onto a discontinuous space of piecewise linear functions. The new mesh motion is compared to established Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations by investigating a preeminent numerical benchmark of biological significance: the pulling of a membrane tether from a flat patch, and its subsequent lateral translation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a slender filament beating in a viscous fluid with novel curvature-dependent bending stiffness. Our numerical and experimental investigations reveal that such differential stiffness can sustain planar bending waves far along flexible filaments, in stark contrast to the uniform-stiffness case which requires more sophisticated control. In particular, we establish basal actuation as a viable, parsimonious mechanism for generating high-amplitude planar bending waves. Moreover, the resulting beat patterns closely resemble the power-and-recovery strokes of propulsive biological filaments such as cilia, suggesting extensive applications in robotic and engineered systems.</description>

      <title>Snap and Jump: How Elastic Shells Pop Out</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grip, walk, crawl, and jump. Soft robots are integrated functional structures composed of compliant mechanisms, whose activity spans various industrial applications such as surgery, healthcare, surveillance, and even planetary exploration. One of their promising mobility mechanism is snap-buckling; the instability mode of flexible structures passing from one equilibrium state to another can instantaneously generate large power for its motion. Predicting their performance with even simple geometry requires disentangling material, geometric nonlinearity, and contact, thereby still being a challenging problem to date. Here, we study the jumping dynamics of hemispherical elastic shells driven by snap-buckling, as a model system of soft jumping mechanisms, combining experiments, simulations, and analytical theory. We find that the contact transition dynamics trigger the jumping phenomenon upon snap-buckling by constructing the analytical predictions with shell elasticity in excellent agreement with both experiments and simulations. Despite the simple geometry of the shell, its dynamical performance primarily relies on a complex interplay between elasticity, geometry, and contact friction. By elucidating the dynamics of the building blocks of soft robots that undergo large deformations, we can build their predictive experimental and numerical framework. Our research paves the way for designing soft robots suitable for the required loading conditions or structural requirements without empirical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic subwavelength particles combine the strong response and tunability of nanostructures with the exotic properties of anisotropic materials. Here we analytically derive the quasielectrostatic eigenmodes and eigenpermittivity relations of anistropic spheres and ellipsoids and present the results for spheres. We show that anisotropic particles exhibit novel radiation patterns and axial-eigenpermittivity sum rules, resulting in resonance splitting and eigenvalue degeneracy. Our results pave the way for a new generation of directional and multispectral detectors and biomarkers and apply to other fields of physics.</description>
