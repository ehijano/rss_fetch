      <title>Gaussian Processes simplify differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use Gaussian processes (kernel methods) to learn mappings between trajectories of distinct differential equations. Our goal is to simplify both the representation and the solution of these equations. We begin by examining the Cole-Hopf transformation, a classical result that converts the nonlinear, viscous Burgers' equation into the linear heat equation. We demonstrate that this transformation can be effectively learned using Gaussian process regression, either from single or from multiple initial conditions of the Burgers equation. We then extend our methodology to discover mappings between initial conditions of a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) and a linear PDE, where the exact form of the linear PDE remains unknown and is inferred through Computational Graph Completion (CGC), a generalization of Gaussian Process Regression from approximating single input/output functions to approximating multiple input/output functions that interact within a computational graph. Further, we employ CGC to identify a local transformation from the nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the Brusselator to its Poincar\'{e} normal form, capturing the dynamics around a Hopf bifurcation. We conclude by addressing the broader question of whether systematic transformations between nonlinear and linear PDEs can generally exist, suggesting avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Box dimension of fractal functions on attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a wide class of fractal interpolation functions in a single platform by considering the domains of these functions as general attractors. We obtain lower and upper bounds of the box dimension of these functions in a more general setup where the interpolation points need not be equally spaced, the scale vectors can be variables and the maps in the corresponding IFS can be non-affine. In particular, we obtain the exact value of the box dimension of non-affine fractal functions on general m-dimensional cubes and Sierpinski Gasket.</description>

      <title>Entropy and Gurevich Pressure for piecewise smooth vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a bridge between classical results concerning discrete dynamical systems and dynamical systems governed by nonsmooth vector fields. In fact, we obtain a set of piecewise smooth vector field trajectories where the time-one map is well defined. Afterwards, we obtain a topological conjugacy between the itinerary of a trajectory contained in this set and the one-sided shift space with a set of states countable with the discrete topology. We then use this fact to calculate the Gurevich pressure and entropy for non-smooth vector fields, and we also use the Lyapunnov function to estimate the mixing time. Furthermore, we relate the topological entropy at infinity of the global trajectories of these non-smooth vector fields to the Hausdorff dimension of the set of recurrent points that escape on average. Finally, we approach it from the point of view of cofinite topology, thus obtaining relevant examples.</description>

      <title>A Training-Free Conditional Diffusion Model for Learning Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a training-free conditional diffusion model for learning unknown stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using data. The proposed approach addresses key challenges in computational efficiency and accuracy for modeling SDEs by utilizing a score-based diffusion model to approximate their stochastic flow map. Unlike the existing methods, this technique is based on an analytically derived closed-form exact score function, which can be efficiently estimated by Monte Carlo method using the trajectory data, and eliminates the need for neural network training to learn the score function. By generating labeled data through solving the corresponding reverse ordinary differential equation, the approach enables supervised learning of the flow map. Extensive numerical experiments across various SDE types, including linear, nonlinear, and multi-dimensional systems, demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of the method. The learned models exhibit significant improvements in predicting both short-term and long-term behaviors of unknown stochastic systems, often surpassing baseline methods like GANs in estimating drift and diffusion coefficients.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of singular de-Sitter tori with respect to their lightlike bi-foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a natural notion of constant curvature Lorentzian surfaces with conical singularities, and provide a large class of examples of such structures. We moreover initiate the study of their global rigidity, by proving that de-Sitter tori with a single singularity of a fixed angle are determined by the topological equivalence class of their lightlike bi-foliation. While this result is reminiscent of Troyanov's work on Riemannian surfaces with conical singularities, the rigidity will come from topological dynamics in the Lorentzian case.</description>

      <title>Reduced-Order Modelling and Closed-Loop Control of the Cylinder Wake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model-based approach for the closed-loop control of vortex shedding in the cylinder wake. The control objective is to suppress the unsteadiness of the flow, which arises at a critical Reynolds number $Re_c$ through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. In the vicinity of $Re_c$ the flow is well described by a forced Stuart-Landau equation derived via a global weakly nonlinear analysis. This Stuart-Landau equation governs the evolution of the amplitude $A$ of the global mode on the slow time scale. In this paper, we generalize the approach from [Sipp 2012], which considers a fixed-amplitude harmonic forcing, by allowing the forcing amplitude E0 to vary on the slow time scale. This enables the design of closed-loop controllers for multiple surrogate Stuart-Landau models, which we obtain for different classes of forcing frequencies. When these frequencies are near the global mode oscillation frequency at Rec, we can bring both $A$ and $E'$ to zero, which fully suppresses the unsteady part of the flow. We also show that near this frequency, the optimal forcing structure is in the direction of the adjoint global mode. Assuming partial velocity measurements of the flow, we design an output-feedback control law that stabilizes the flow. The approach hinges on a model predictive controller for the surrogate model, which exploits the full-order model measurements to determine the necessary forcing amplitudes while respecting the modelling constraints. We achieve suppression of the wake oscillations with spatially dense volume forcing and two-point velocity measurement at $Re=50$.</description>

      <title>HALO: A High-Precision Orbit Propagation Tool for Mission Design in the Cis-Lunar Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent implementation of the Artemis Accords, interest in the cis-lunar space is rapidly increasing, necessitating the development of more precise and accurate modeling tools. While general-purpose mission design tools are available, this study proposes an open-source mission design tool, HALO, for High-precision Analyser for Lunar Orbits. This work presents a comprehensive review of the modeling approaches, structural design, and algorithms employed, aiming at facilitating ease of use and adaptation for other research in the cis-lunar domain. Furthermore, accuracy studies of the propagator are provided for various orbits of interest within this domain, including low lunar orbits, elliptical frozen orbits, and 3-body problem orbits, such as Near Rectilinear Halo Orbits and Distant Retrograde Orbits.</description>

      <title>S7: Selective and Simplified State Space Layers for Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in sequence modeling is efficiently handling tasks with extended contexts. While recent state-space models (SSMs) have made significant progress in this area, they often lack input-dependent filtering or require substantial increases in model complexity to handle input variability. We address this gap by introducing S7, a simplified yet powerful SSM that can handle input dependence while incorporating stable reparameterization and specific design choices to dynamically adjust state transitions based on input content, maintaining efficiency and performance. We prove that this reparameterization ensures stability in long-sequence modeling by keeping state transitions well-behaved over time. Additionally, it controls the gradient norm, enabling efficient training and preventing issues like exploding or vanishing gradients. S7 significantly outperforms baselines across various sequence modeling tasks, including neuromorphic event-based datasets, Long Range Arena benchmarks, and various physical and biological time series. Overall, S7 offers a more straightforward approach to sequence modeling without relying on complex, domain-specific inductive biases, achieving significant improvements across key benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Never Mind The No-Ops: Faster and Less Volatile Simulation Modelling of Co-Evolutionary Species Interactions via Spatial Cyclic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Issues in co-evolutionary population dynamics have long been studied via computationally intensive simulations of minimally simple agent-based models, known as Evolutionary Spatial Cyclic Games (ESCGs), involving multiple interacting biological species in which each agent has its own unique spatial location in a cell on a regular lattice, and can move from cell to cell over time. Many papers have been published exploring the dynamics of ESCGs where competitive inter-species predator/prey relationships are modelled via the cyclic game Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) for three species, or Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (RPSLS) for five. At the core of these simulations is the "Elementary Step" (ES), in which one or two agents are chosen at random to either compete to the death, or to reproduce, or to move location. ESCG studies typically involve executing trillions of ESs and hence the computational efficiency of the core ES algorithm is a key concern. In this paper I demonstrate that the de facto standard "Original ES" (OES) algorithm is computationally inefficient both in time and in space due to the implicit execution of many "no-op" commands (i.e., commands that do nothing) and because at steady state large numbers of cells can be empty, and yet empty cells serve no purpose. I present a new "Revised ES" (RES) algorithm which eliminates these inefficiencies, and I show empirically that ESCGs with RES exhibit qualitatively the same characteristics as those with OES, and are also markedly more stable. The more stable dynamics of RES-based simulations means that they can be run with smaller lattices than when using OES, leading to reductions in total simulation times of 85% or more. Python source code developed for the experiments reported here is freely available on GitHub.</description>

Abstract: We study the periodicity of subshifts of finite type (SFT) on Baumslag-Solitar groups. We show that for residually finite Baumslag-Solitar groups there exist both strongly and weakly-but-not-strongly aperiodic SFTs. In particular, this shows that unlike $\mathbb{Z}^2$, but like $\mathbb{Z}^3$, strong and weak aperiodic SFTs are different classes of SFTs in residually finite BS groups. More precisely, we prove that a weakly aperiodic SFT on BS(m,n) due to Aubrun and Kari is, in fact, strongly aperiodic on BS(1,n); and weakly but not strongly aperiodic on any other BS(m,n). In addition, we exhibit an SFT which is weakly but not strongly aperiodic on BS(1,n); and we show that there exists a strongly aperiodic SFT on BS(n,n).</description>

Abstract: The non-emptiness, called the Domino Problem, and the characterization of the possible entropies of $\mathbb{Z}^2$-subshifts of finite type are standard problems of symbolic dynamics. In this article we study these questions with horizontal constraints fixed beforehand as a parameter. We determine for which horizontal constraints the Domino Problem is undecidable and when all right-recursively enumerable numbers can be obtained as entropy, with two approaches: either the additional local rules added to the horizontal constraints can be of any shape, or they can only be vertical rules.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider local centralizer classification and rigidity of some toral automorphisms. In low dimensions we classify up to finite index possible centralizers for volume preserving diffeomorphisms $f$ $C^{1}-$close to an ergodic irreducible toral automorphism $L$. Moreover, we show a rigidity result in the case that the centralizer of $f$ is large: If the smooth centralizer $Z^{\infty}(f)$ is virtually isomorphic to that of $L$ then $f$ is $C^{\infty}-$conjugate to $L$. In higher dimensions we show a similar rigidity result for certain irreducible toral automorphisms. We also classify up to finite index all possible centralizers for symplectic diffeomorphisms $C^{5}-$close to a class of irreducible symplectic automorphisms on tori of any dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a global rigidity result for abelian partially hyperbolic higher rank actions on certain $2-$step nilmanifolds $X_{\Gamma}$. We show that, under certain natural assumptions, all such actions are $C^{\infty}-$conjugated to an affine model. As a consequence, we obtain a centralizer rigidity result, classifying all possible centralizers for any $C^{1}-$small perturbation of an irreducible, affine partially hyperbolic map on $X_{\Gamma}$. Along the way, we also prove two results of independent interest. We describe fibered partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms on $X_{\Gamma}$ and we show that topological conjugacies between partially hyperbolic actions and higher rank affine actions are $C^{\infty}$.</description>

      <title>Learning dynamical systems from data: A simple cross-validation perspective, part III: Irregularly-Sampled Time Series</title>

Abstract: A simple and interpretable way to learn a dynamical system from data is to interpolate its vector-field with a kernel. In particular, this strategy is highly efficient (both in terms of accuracy and complexity) when the kernel is data-adapted using Kernel Flows (KF)\cite{Owhadi19} (which uses gradient-based optimization to learn a kernel based on the premise that a kernel is good if there is no significant loss in accuracy if half of the data is used for interpolation). Despite its previous successes, this strategy (based on interpolating the vector field driving the dynamical system) breaks down when the observed time series is not regularly sampled in time. In this work, we propose to address this problem by directly approximating the vector field of the dynamical system by incorporating time differences between observations in the (KF) data-adapted kernels. We compare our approach with the classical one over different benchmark dynamical systems and show that it significantly improves the forecasting accuracy while remaining simple, fast, and robust.</description>

      <title>Deeper but smaller: Higher-order interactions increase linear stability but shrink basins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key challenge of nonlinear dynamics and network science is to understand how higher-order interactions influence collective dynamics. Although many studies have approached this question through linear stability analysis, less is known about how higher-order interactions shape the global organization of different states. Here, we shed light on this issue by analyzing the rich patterns supported by identical Kuramoto oscillators on hypergraphs. We show that higher-order interactions can have opposite effects on linear stability and basin stability: they stabilize twisted states (including full synchrony) by improving their linear stability, but also make them hard to find by dramatically reducing their basin size. Our results highlight the importance of understanding higher-order interactions from both local and global perspectives.</description>

      <title>Foundational Inference Models for Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07594</link>

Abstract: Dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) serve as models for a vast number of natural and social phenomena. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on the classical problem of imputing missing time series data, whose underlying dynamics are assumed to be determined by ODEs. Specifically, we revisit ideas from amortized inference and neural operators, and propose a novel supervised learning framework for zero-shot time series imputation, through parametric functions satisfying some (hidden) ODEs. Our proposal consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over the space of ODE solutions, observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we generate a large, synthetic dataset of (hidden) ODE solutions, along with their noisy and sparse observations. Second, a neural recognition model that is trained offline, to map the generated time series onto the spaces of initial conditions and time derivatives of the (hidden) ODE solutions, which we then integrate to impute the missing data. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) recognition model can perform zero-shot imputation across 63 distinct time series with missing values, each sampled from widely different dynamical systems. Likewise, we demonstrate that it can perform zero-shot imputation of missing high-dimensional data in 10 vastly different settings, spanning human motion, air quality, traffic and electricity studies, as well as Navier-Stokes simulations -- without requiring any fine-tuning. What is more, our proposal often outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which are trained on the target datasets.
  Our pretrained model will be available online soon.</description>

      <title>On the set of stable primes for postcritically infinite maps over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many interesting questions in arithmetic dynamics revolve, in one way or another, around the (local and/or global) reducibility behavior of iterates of a polynomial. We show that for very general families of integer polynomials $f$ (and, more generally, rational functions over number fields), the set of stable primes, i.e., primes modulo which all iterates of $f$ are irreducible, is a density zero set. Compared to previous results, our families cover a much wider ground, and in particular apply to $100\%$ of polynomials of any given odd degree, thus adding evidence to the conjecture that polynomials with a "large" set of stable primes are necessarily of a very specific shape, and in particular are necessarily postcritically finite.</description>

      <title>Counting rational maps on $\mathbb{P}^1$ with prescribed local conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore distribution questions for rational maps on the projective line $\mathbb{P}^1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ within the framework of arithmetic dynamics, drawing analogies to elliptic curves. Specifically, we investigate counting problems for rational maps $\phi$ of fixed degree $d \geq 2$ with prescribed reduction properties. Our main result establishes that the set of rational maps with minimal resultant has positive density. Additionally, for degree 2 rational maps, we perform explicit computations demonstrating that over $32.7\%$ possess a squarefree, and hence minimal, resultant.</description>
