      <title>Econometrics of Insurance with Multidimensional Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the identification and estimation of insurance models where insurees have private information about their risk and risk aversion. The model includes random damages and allows for several claims, while insurers choose from a finite number of coverages. We show that the joint distribution of risk and risk aversion is nonparametrically identified despite bunching due to multidimensional types and a finite number of coverages. Our identification strategy exploits the observed number of claims as well as an exclusion restriction, and a full support assumption. Furthermore, our results apply to any form of competition. We propose a novel estimation procedure combining nonparametric estimators and GMM estimation that we illustrate in a Monte Carlo study.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the value of recommendations for disseminating economic information, with a focus on frictions resulting from preference heterogeneity. We consider Bayesian expected-payoff maximizers who receive non-strategic recommendations by other consumers. The paper provides conditions under which different consumer types accept these recommendations. Moreover, we assess the overall value of a recommendation system and the determinants of that value. Our analysis highlights the importance of disentangling objective information from subjective preferences when designing value-maximizing recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>The Green Peace Dividend: the Effects of Militarization on Emissions and the Green Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper argues that military buildups lead to a significant rise in greenhouse gas emissions and can disrupt the green transition. Identifying military spending shocks, I use local projections to show that a percentage point rise in the military spending share leads to a 0.9-2% rise in total emissions, as well as a 1% rise in emission intensity, depending on the economy's overall emission intensity. Using a dynamic production network model calibrated for the US, I find that a permanent shock of the same size would increase total emissions by between 0.36% and 1.81%, and emission intensity by between 0.22% and 1.5%. The empirical analysis indicates that green patenting is reduced by 10-25% following such a shock, and the model suggests that investment in renewables could be crowded out by defence spending, hindering the energy transition. These effects can significantly raise climate damages, temperatures, and can lead to a quicker exhaustion of the carbon budget.</description>
