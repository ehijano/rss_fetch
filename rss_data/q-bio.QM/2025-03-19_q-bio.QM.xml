      <title>Machine learning algorithms to predict stroke in China based on causal inference of time series analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Participants: This study employed a combination of Vector Autoregression (VAR) model and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to systematically construct dynamic causal inference. Multiple classic classification algorithms were compared, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Gradient Boosting, and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP). The SMOTE algorithm was used to undersample a small number of samples and employed Stratified K-fold Cross Validation. Results: This study included a total of 11,789 participants, including 6,334 females (53.73%) and 5,455 males (46.27%), with an average age of 65 years. Introduction of dynamic causal inference features has significantly improved the performance of almost all models. The area under the ROC curve of each model ranged from 0.78 to 0.83, indicating significant difference (P &lt; 0.01). Among all the models, the Gradient Boosting model demonstrated the highest performance and stability. Model explanation and feature importance analysis generated model interpretation that illustrated significant contributors associated with risks of stroke. Conclusions and Relevance: This study proposes a stroke risk prediction method that combines dynamic causal inference with machine learning models, significantly improving prediction accuracy and revealing key health factors that affect stroke. The research results indicate that dynamic causal inference features have important value in predicting stroke risk, especially in capturing the impact of changes in health status over time on stroke risk. By further optimizing the model and introducing more variables, this study provides theoretical basis and practical guidance for future stroke prevention and intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Impact of Tobacco Use and Social Determinants on Respiratory Health Disparities Among Louisiana Medicaid Enrollees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tobacco use remains a leading preventable contributor to serious health conditions in the United States, notably chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe COVID-19 complications. Within Louisiana's Medicaid population, tobacco use prevalence is particularly high compared to privately insured groups, yet its full impact on long-term outcomes is not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate how tobacco use, in conjunction with demographic and clinical risk factors, influences the incidence of COPD and COVID-19 among Medicaid enrollees over time. We analyzed Louisiana Department of Health data from January 2020 to February 2023. Chi-square tests were conducted to provide descriptive statistics, and multivariate logistic regression models were applied across three discrete waves to assess both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between risk factors and disease outcomes. Enrollees without baseline diagnoses of COPD or COVID-19 were followed to determine new-onset cases in subsequent waves. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) were calculated after controlling for socio-demographic variables, comorbidities, and healthcare utilization patterns. Tobacco use emerged as a significant independent predictor of both COPD (Adjusted Odd Ratio= 1.12) and COVID-19 (Adjusted Odd Ratio = 1.66). Additional risk factors -- such as older age, gender, region, and pre-existing health conditions -- also showed significant associations with higher incidence rates of COPD and COVID-19. By linking tobacco use, demographic disparities, and comorbidities to an increased risk of COPD and COVID-19, this study underscores the urgent need for targeted tobacco cessation efforts and prevention strategies within this underserved population.</description>

      <title>Identifying Critical Phases for Disease Onset with Sparse Haematological Biomarkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Routinely collected clinical blood tests are an emerging molecular data source for large-scale biomedical research but inherently feature irregular sampling and informative observation. Traditional approaches rely on imputation, which can distort learning signals and bias predictions while lacking biological interpretability. We propose a novel methodology using Graph Neural Additive Networks (GNAN) to model biomarker trajectories as time-weighted directed graphs, where nodes represent sampling events and edges encode the time delta between events. GNAN's additive structure enables the explicit decomposition of feature and temporal contributions, allowing the detection of critical disease-associated time points. Unlike conventional imputation-based approaches, our method preserves the temporal structure of sparse data without introducing artificial biases and provides inherently interpretable predictions by decomposing contributions from each biomarker and time interval. This makes our model clinically applicable, as well as allowing it to discover biologically meaningful disease signatures.</description>

      <title>Efficient Data Selection for Training Genomic Perturbation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genomic studies, including CRISPR-based PerturbSeq analyses, face a vast hypothesis space, while gene perturbations remain costly and time-consuming. Gene expression models based on graph neural networks are trained to predict the outcomes of gene perturbations to facilitate such experiments. Active learning methods are often employed to train these models due to the cost of the genomic experiments required to build the training set. However, poor model initialization in active learning can result in suboptimal early selections, wasting time and valuable resources. While typical active learning mitigates this issue over many iterations, the limited number of experimental cycles in genomic studies exacerbates the risk. To this end, we propose graph-based one-shot data selection methods for training gene expression models. Unlike active learning, one-shot data selection predefines the gene perturbations before training, hence removing the initialization bias. The data selection is motivated by theoretical studies of graph neural network generalization. The criteria are defined over the input graph and are optimized with submodular maximization. We compare them empirically to baselines and active learning methods that are state-of-the-art on this problem. The results demonstrate that graph-based one-shot data selection achieves comparable accuracy while alleviating the aforementioned risks.</description>

      <title>Sequence Analysis Using the Bezier Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of sequences (e.g., protein, DNA, and SMILES string) is essential for disease diagnosis, biomaterial engineering, genetic engineering, and drug discovery domains. Conventional analytical methods focus on transforming sequences into numerical representations for applying machine learning/deep learning-based sequence characterization. However, their efficacy is constrained by the intrinsic nature of deep learning (DL) models, which tend to exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to tabular data. An alternative group of methodologies endeavors to convert biological sequences into image forms by applying the concept of Chaos Game Representation (CGR). However, a noteworthy drawback of these methods lies in their tendency to map individual elements of the sequence onto a relatively small subset of designated pixels within the generated image. The resulting sparse image representation may not adequately encapsulate the comprehensive sequence information, potentially resulting in suboptimal predictions. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to transform sequences into images using the B\'ezier curve concept for element mapping. Mapping the elements onto a curve enhances the sequence information representation in the respective images, hence yielding better DL-based classification performance. We employed different sequence datasets to validate our system by using different classification tasks, and the results illustrate that our B\'ezier curve method is able to achieve good performance for all the tasks.</description>

      <title>The three-dimensional impulse-response model: Modeling the training process in accordance with energy system-specific adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Athletic training is characterized by physiological systems responding to repeated exercise-induced stress, resulting in gradual alterations in the functional properties of these systems. The adaptive response leading to improved performance follows a remarkably predictable pattern that may be described by a systems model provided that training load can be accurately quantified and that the constants defining the training-performance relationship are known. While various impulse-response models have been proposed, they are inherently limited in reducing training stress (the impulse) into a single metric, assuming that the adaptive responses are independent of the type of training performed. This is despite ample evidence of markedly diverse acute and chronic responses to exercise of different intensities and durations. Herein, we propose an alternative, three-dimensional impulse-response model that uses three training load metrics as inputs and three performance metrics as outputs. These metrics, represented by a three-parameter critical power model, reflect the stress imposed on each of the three energy systems: the alactic (phosphocreatine/immediate) system; the lactic (glycolytic) system; and the aerobic (oxidative) system. The purpose of this article is to outline the scientific rationale and the practical implementation of the three-dimensional impulse-response model.</description>

      <title>Functional Correspondences in the Human and Marmoset Visual Cortex During Movie Watching: Insights from Correlation, Redundancy, and Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The world of beauty is deeply connected to the visual cortex, as perception often begins with vision in both humans and marmosets. Quantifying functional correspondences in the visual cortex across species can help us understand how information is processed in the primate visual cortex, while also providing deeper insights into human visual cortex functions through the study of marmosets. In this study, we measured pairwise and beyond pairwise correlation, redundancy, and synergy in movie-driven fMRI data across species. Our first key finding was that humans and marmosets exhibited significant overlaps in functional synergy. Second, we observed that the strongest functional correspondences between the human peri-entorhinal and entorhinal cortex (PeEc) and the occipitotemporal higher-level visual regions in the marmoset during movie watching reflected a functional synergistic relationship. These regions are known to correspond to face-selective areas in both species. Third, redundancy measures maintained stable high-order hubs, indicating a steady core of shared information processing, while synergy measures revealed a dynamic shift from low- to high-level visual regions as interaction increased, reflecting adaptive integration. This highlights distinct patterns of information processing across the visual hierarchy. Ultimately, our results reveal the marmoset as a compelling model for investigating visual perception, distinguished by its remarkable functional parallels to the human visual cortex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16615v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding transcription factor dynamics is crucial for unraveling the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression that underpin cellular function and development. Measurements of transcription factor subcellular movements are essential for developing predictive models of gene expression. However, obtaining these quantitative measurements poses significant challenges due to the inherent variability of biological data and the need for high precision in tracking the movement and interaction of molecules. Our computational pipeline provides a solution to these challenges, offering a comprehensive approach to the quantitative analysis of transcription factor dynamics. Our pipeline integrates advanced image segmentation to accurately delineate individual nuclei, precise nucleus tracking to monitor changes over time, and detailed intensity extraction to measure fluorescence as a proxy for transcription factor activity. Combining our pipeline with techniques such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching enables the estimation of vital biophysical parameters, such as transcription factor import and export rates.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic evaluation of covariate distributions models</title>

Abstract: Statistical modelling of covariate distributions allows to generate virtual populations or to impute missing values in a covariate dataset. Covariate distributions typically have non-Gaussian margins and show nonlinear correlation structures, which simple multivariate Gaussian distributions fail to represent. Prominent non-Gaussian frameworks for covariate distribution modelling are copula-based models and models based on multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE). While both frameworks have already found applications in the life sciences, a systematic investigation of their goodness-of-fit to the theoretical underlying distribution, indicating strengths and weaknesses under different conditions, is still lacking. To bridge this gap, we thoroughly evaluated covariate distribution models in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-D), a scale-invariant information-theoretic goodness-of-fit criterion for distributions. Methodologically, we proposed a new approach to construct confidence intervals for KL-D by combining nearest neighbour-based KL-D estimators with subsampling-based uncertainty quantification. In relevant data sets of different sizes and dimensionalities with both continuous and discrete covariates, non-Gaussian models showed consistent improvements in KL-D, compared to simpler Gaussian or scale transform approximations. KL-D estimates were also robust to the inclusion of latent variables and large fractions of missing values. While good generalization behaviour to new data could be seen in copula-based models, MICE shows a trend for overfitting and its performance should always be evaluated on separate test data. Parametric copula models and MICE were found to scale much better with the dataset dimension than nonparametric copula models. These findings corroborate the potential of non-Gaussian models for modelling realistic life science covariate distributions.</description>

      <title>Interpretable High-order Knowledge Graph Neural Network for Predicting Synthetic Lethality in Human Cancers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic lethality (SL) is a promising gene interaction for cancer therapy. Recent SL prediction methods integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) into graph neural networks (GNNs) and employ attention mechanisms to extract local subgraphs as explanations for target gene pairs. However, attention mechanisms often lack fidelity, typically generate a single explanation per gene pair, and fail to ensure trustworthy high-order structures in their explanations. To overcome these limitations, we propose Diverse Graph Information Bottleneck for Synthetic Lethality (DGIB4SL), a KG-based GNN that generates multiple faithful explanations for the same gene pair and effectively encodes high-order structures. Specifically, we introduce a novel DGIB objective, integrating a Determinant Point Process (DPP) constraint into the standard IB objective, and employ 13 motif-based adjacency matrices to capture high-order structures in gene representations. Experimental results show that DGIB4SL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and provides multiple explanations for SL prediction, revealing diverse biological mechanisms underlying SL inference.</description>

      <title>AI-driven control of bioelectric signalling for real-time topological reorganization of cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and manipulating bioelectric signaling could present a new wave of progress in developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and synthetic biology. Bioelectric signals, defined as voltage gradients across cell membranes caused by ionic movements, play a role in regulating crucial processes including cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue morphogenesis. Recent studies demonstrate the ability to modulate these signals to achieve controlled tissue regeneration and morphological outcomes in organisms such as planaria and frogs. However, significant knowledge gaps remain, particularly in predicting and controlling the spatial and temporal dynamics of membrane potentials (V_mem), understanding their regulatory roles in tissue and organ development, and exploring their therapeutic potential in diseases. In this work we propose an experiment using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework together with lab automation techniques for real-time manipulation of bioelectric signals to guide tissue regeneration and morphogenesis. The proposed framework should interact continuously with biological systems, adapting strategies based on direct biological feedback. Combining DRL with real-time measurement techniques -- such as optogenetics, voltage-sensitive dyes, fluorescent reporters, and advanced microscopy -- could provide a comprehensive platform for precise bioelectric control, leading to improved understanding of bioelectric mechanisms in morphogenesis, quantitative bioelectric models, identification of minimal experimental setups, and advancements in bioelectric modulation techniques relevant to regenerative medicine and cancer therapy. Ultimately, this research aims to utilize bioelectric signaling to develop new biomedical and bioengineering applications.</description>
