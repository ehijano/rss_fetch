      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Track Finding in the LHCb Vertex Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next decade will see an order of magnitude increase in data collected by high-energy physics experiments, driven by the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The reconstruction of charged particle trajectories (tracks) has always been a critical part of offline data processing pipelines. The complexity of HL-LHC data will however increasingly mandate track finding in all stages of an experiment's real-time processing. This paper presents a GNN-based track-finding pipeline tailored for the Run 3 LHCb experiment's vertex detector and benchmarks its physics performance and computational cost against existing classical algorithms on GPU architectures. A novelty of our work compared to existing GNN tracking pipelines is batched execution, in which the GPU evaluates the pipeline on hundreds of events in parallel. We evaluate the impact of neural-network quantisation on physics and computational performance, and comment on the outlook for GNN tracking algorithms for other parts of the LHCb track-finding pipeline.</description>

      <title>Development of MMC-based lithium molybdate cryogenic calorimeters for AMoRE-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AMoRE collaboration searches for neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{100}$Mo using molybdate scintillating crystals via low temperature thermal calorimetric detection. The early phases of the experiment, AMoRE-pilot and AMoRE-I, have demonstrated competitive discovery potential. Presently, the AMoRE-II experiment, featuring a large detector array with about 90 kg of $^{100}$Mo isotope, is under construction.This paper discusses the baseline design and characterization of the lithium molybdate cryogenic calorimeters to be used in the AMoRE-II detector modules. The results from prototype setups that incorporate new housing structures and two different crystal masses (316 g and 517 - 521 g), operated at 10 mK temperature, show energy resolutions (FWHM) of 7.55 - 8.82 keV at the 2.615 MeV $^{208}$Tl $\gamma$ line, and effective light detection of 0.79 - 0.96 keV/MeV. The simultaneous heat and light detection enables clear separation of alpha particles with a discrimination power of 12.37 - 19.50 at the energy region around $^6$Li(n, $\alpha$)$^3$H with Q-value = 4.785 MeV. Promising detector performances were demonstrated at temperatures as high as 30 mK, which relaxes the temperature constraints for operating the large AMoRE-II array.</description>

      <title>On the E-DeltaE low pressure pentane filled detection module of DGFRS-2 setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper describes a new E-Delta-E detection module which includes a position-sensitive double-sided strip detector (DSSD) and a low-pressure pentane-filled Delta-E chamber for detection of Evaporation Residues (ER) in complete fusion nuclear reactions. The goal is to synthesize superheavy isotopes at the new DC-280 (Dubna Cyclotron) cyclotron of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR). With the 48Ca ion beam intensity of about 5-7 pmcA (particle micro ampere) and the Delta-E counter count rate of approximately 1.0E+4 sec-1, we observe a decrease in the overall registration efficiency of the gas Delta-E counter. The paper proposes a solution to this problem: introduction of an additional negatively biased electrode, which results in the stabilization of the Delta-E detector operation.</description>

      <title>Towards real-world applications of levitated optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Levitated optomechanics, a rapidly expanding field that employs light to monitor and manipulate the mechanical motion of levitated objects, is increasingly relevant across physics, engineering, and other fields. This technique, which involves levitating micro- and nano-scale objects in a vacuum where they exhibit high-quality motion, provides an essential platform for precision measurements. Noted for their ultra-high sensitivity, levitated particles hold potential for a wide range of real-world applications. This perspective article briefly introduces the principle of optical levitation and the dynamics of levitated particles. It then reviews the emerging applications of levitated particles in ultrasensitive force and torque measurements, acceleration and rotation sensing, electric and magnetic field detection, scanning probe microscopy, localized vacuum pressure gauging, acoustic transduction, and chemical and biological sensing. Moreover, we discuss the present challenges and explore opportunities to minimize and integrate levitation systems for broader applications. We also briefly review optomechanics with ion traps and magnetic traps which can levitate particles in high vacuum without laser heating.</description>

      <title>A primary quantum current standard based on the Josephson and the quantum Hall effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The new definition of the ampere calls for a quantum current standard able to deliver a flow of elementary charges per second controlled with a relative uncertainty of one part in $10^8$. Despite many efforts, nanodevices handling electrons one by one have never been able to demonstrate such an accuracy. The alternative route based on applying Ohm's law to the Josephson voltage and quantum Hall standards recently reached the target uncertainty but this was at the expense of the application of error corrections, hampering simplicity and further improvement. As a result, national metrology institutes still lack an operational quantum current standard. Here, we present a new quantum current generator, combining both quantum standards and a superconducting cryogenic amplifier, free of error correction, which provides quantized currents driven by the Josephson microwave signal. We show that it can realize the ampere definition with the target uncertainty over a range extended from mA down to $\mu$A and improve end-user current measurements, which are up to now a hundred times less accurate. Other prospects include measuring large resistances using the new current standard in conjunction with a quantum voltmeter and, by exploiting its low-noise performances, bridging the gap with the lower currents of other quantum current sources.</description>

      <title>Performance of the electromagnetic and hadronic prototype segments of the ALICE Forward Calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the performance of a full-length prototype of the ALICE Forward Calorimeter (FoCal). The detector is composed of a silicon-tungsten electromagnetic sampling calorimeter with longitudinal and transverse segmentation (FoCal-E) of about 20$X_0$ and a hadronic copper-scintillating-fiber calorimeter (FoCal-H) of about 5$\lambda_{\rm int}$. The data were taken between 2021 and 2023 at the CERN PS and SPS beam lines with hadron (electron) beams up to energies of 350 (300) GeV. Regarding FoCal-E, we report a comprehensive analysis of its response to minimum ionizing particles across all pad layers. The longitudinal shower profile of electromagnetic showers is measured with a layer-wise segmentation of 1$X_0$. As a projection to the performance of the final detector in electromagnetic showers, we demonstrate linearity in the full energy range, and show that the energy resolution fulfills the requirements for the physics needs. Additionally, the performance to separate two-showers events was studied by quantifying the transverse shower width. Regarding FoCal-H, we report a detailed analysis of the response to hadron beams between 60 and 350 GeV. The results are compared to simulations obtained with a Geant4 model of the test beam setup, which in particular for FoCal-E are in good agreement with the data. The energy resolution of FoCal-E was found to be lower than 3% at energies larger than 100 GeV. The response of FoCal-H to hadron beams was found to be linear, albeit with a significant intercept that is about factor 2 larger than in simulations. Its resolution, which is non-Gaussian and generally larger than in simulations, was quantified using the FWHM, and decreases from about 16% at 100 GeV to about 11% at 350 GeV. The discrepancy to simulations, which is particularly evident at low hadron energies, needs to be further investigated.</description>

      <title>Detection of Low-Energy Electrons with Transition-Edge Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first detection of electrons with kinetic energy in the 100 eV range with transition-edge sensors (TESs). This has been achieved with a $(100\times 100)$ $\mu$m$^2$ Ti-Au bilayer TES, with a critical temperature of about 84 mK. The electrons are produced directly in the cryostat by an innovative cold source based on field emission from vertically-aligned multiwall carbon nanotubes. We obtain a Gaussian energy resolution between 0.8 and 1.8 eV for fully-absorbed electrons in the $(90-101)$ eV energy range, which is found to be compatible with the resolution of this same device for photons in the same energy range. This work opens new possibilities for high-precision energy measurements of low-energy electrons.</description>

      <title>Method to Reduce Noise for Measurement of $^7$Be and $^8$B Solar Neutrinos on Gallium-71</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gallium solar neutrino experiments have historically used radiochemical counting to determine the event rate. A detector which directly measures the ejected electron and de-excitation gamma could reduce background counting rates by way of a double-pulse technique. We find this reduction could be as large as 10 orders of magnitude in a 100 ton detector. In this process, the detector measures the excited nuclear final state of the germanium after an electron neutrino interacts with gallium nucleus through the charged-current interaction. This results in a loss of approximately 90\% of the total neutrino signal, but higher energy processes are less suppressed. The neutrinos resulting from this higher energy selection are predominantly from the {}$^8$B and {}$^7$Be solar neutrino fluxes.</description>

      <title>All-fiber, near-infrared, laser system at 780nm for atom cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the prominent platforms for quantum technologies, cold atoms require reliable laser systems. We present the design, implementation, and characterization of a simple, compact, and economical laser system at 780 nm, entirely based on fiber components. Two semiconductor lasers at 1560 nm are amplified in a single Erbium-doped fiber amplifier and frequency-doubled in a periodically-poled lithium niobate crystal. We characterize the amplitude noise and the linewidths of the lasers, as well as the SHG efficiency. With a rms relative amplitude noise of 3$\times$10$^{-4}$ at 1 s and linewidths below 1 MHz, our system is suitable for cooling and trapping of Rb atoms.</description>
