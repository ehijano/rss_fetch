      <title>An analytic characterization of freeness for finitely generated discrete quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a freer quantum group has smaller moments of the self-adjoint main character in the category of finitely generated discrete quantum groups. As a result, the moments are minimized pre-precisely by the unitary free quantum groups FU (Q). Furthermore, in the spirit of [CC22], we prove that the operator norm of the self-adjoint main character is minimized only by unitary free quantum groups, at least in the subcategory of free easy quantum groups.</description>

      <title>Resolving Verlinde's formula of logarithmic CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verlinde's formula for rational vertex operator algebras computes the fusion rules from the modular transformations of characters. In the non semisimple and non finite case, a logarithmic Verlinde formula has been proposed together with David Ridout. In this formula one replaces simple modules by their resolutions by standard modules. Here and under certain natural assumptions this conjecture is proven in generality.
  The result is illustrated in the examples of the singlet algebras and of the affine vertex algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at any admissible level, i.e. in particular the Verlinde conjectures in these cases are true. In the latter case it is also explained how to compute the actual fusion rules from knowledge of the Grothendieck ring.</description>

      <title>Ribbon categories of weight modules for affine $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at admissible levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the braided tensor category of finitely-generated weight modules for the simple affine vertex operator algebra $L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at any admissible level $k$ is rigid and hence a braided ribbon category. The proof uses a recent result of the first two authors with Shimizu and Yadav on embedding a braided Grothendieck-Verdier category $\mathcal{C}$ into the Drinfeld center of the category of modules for a suitable commutative algebra $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$, in situations where the braided tensor category of local $A$-modules is rigid. Here, the commutative algebra $A$ is Adamovi\'{c}'s inverse quantum Hamiltonian reduction of $L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, which is the simple rational Virasoro vertex operator algebra at central charge $1-\frac{6(k+1)^2}{k+2}$ tensored with a half-lattice conformal vertex algebra. As a corollary, we also show that the category of finitely-generated weight modules for the $N = 2$ super Virasoro vertex operator superalgebra at central charge $-6\ell-3$ is rigid for $\ell$ such that $(\ell+1)(k+2) = 1$.</description>

      <title>Fusion rules and rigidity for weight modules over the simple admissible affine $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal vertex operator superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the categories of weight modules over the simple $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal vertex operator algebras at fractional admissible levels and central charges are rigid (and hence the categories of weight modules are braided ribbon categories) and that the decomposition formulae of fusion products of simple projective modules conjectured by Thomas Creutzig, David Ridout and collaborators hold (including when the decomposition involves summands that are indecomposable yet not simple). In addition to solving this old open problem, we develop new techniques for the construction of intertwining operators by means of integrating screening currents over certain cycles, which are expected to be of independent interest, due to their applicability to many other algebras. In the example of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ these new techniques allow us to give explicit formulae for a logarithmic intertwining operator from a pair of simple projective modules to the projective cover of the tensor unit, namely, the vertex operator algebra as a module over itself.</description>

      <title>Coprime extensions of indecomposable solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a method to extend involutive nondegenerate set-theoretic solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation by means of equivariant mappings to graded modules, thus leading to the notion of a \emph{twisted extension}. Furthermore, we define coprime extensions of solutions and prove that each coprime extension of indecomposable solutions can be obtained as a suitable twisted extension. We then apply our results to obtain a full description of indecomposable solutions of size $pqr$, where $p,q,r$ are different primes, from a structure theorem of Ced\'o and Okni\'nski. We close with some remarks on a cohomology theory for solutions developed by Lebed and Vendramin. We express our results in the language of cycle sets.</description>

      <title>The Large-Color Expansion Derived from the Universal Invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The colored Jones polynomial associated to a knot admits an expansion of knot invariants known as the large-color expansion or Melvin-Morton-Rozansky expansion. We will show how this expansion can be derived from the universal invariant arising from a Hopf algebra $\mathbb{D}$, as introduced by Bar-Natan and Van der Veen. We utilize a Mathematica implementation to compute the universal invariant $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathbb{D}}(\mathcal{K})$ up to a certain order for a given knot $\mathcal{K}$, allowing for experimental verification of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Cluster structures via representation theory: cluster ensembles, tropical duality, cluster characters and quantisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of cluster categories, applying to a 2-Calabi-Yau extriangulated category $\mathcal{C}$ and cluster-tilting subcategory $\mathcal{T}$ satisfying only mild finiteness conditions. We show that the structure theory of $\mathcal{C}$ and the representation theory of $\mathcal{T}$ give rise to the rich combinatorial structures of seed data and cluster ensembles, via Grothendieck groups and homological algebra. We demonstrate that there is a natural dictionary relating cluster-tilting subcategories and their tilting theory to A-side tropical cluster combinatorics and, dually, relating modules over $\underline{\mathcal{T}}$ to the X-side; here $\underline{\mathcal{T}}$ is the image of $\mathcal{T}$ in the triangulated stable category of $\mathcal{C}$. Moreover, the exchange matrix associated to $\mathcal{T}$ arises from a natural map $p_{\mathcal{T}}\colon\mathrm{K}_0(\operatorname{mod}\underline{\mathcal{T}})\to\mathrm{K}_0(\mathcal{T})$ closely related to taking projective resolutions.
  Via our approach, we categorify many key identities involving mutation, g-vectors and c-vectors, including in infinite rank cases and in the presence of loops and 2-cycles. We are also able to define A- and X-cluster characters, which yield A- and X-cluster variables when there are no loops or 2-cycles, and which enable representation-theoretic proofs of cluster-theoretical statements.
  Continuing with the same categorical philosophy, we give a definition of a quantum cluster category, as a cluster category together with the choice of a map closely related to the adjoint of $p_{\mathcal{T}}$. Our framework enables us to show that any Hom-finite exact cluster category admits a canonical quantum structure, generalising results of Gei{\ss}--Leclerc--Schr\"oer.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Gelfand Duality: the algebraic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to define a notion of non-commutative Gelfand duality. Using techniques from derived algebraic geometry, we show that category of rings is anti-equivalent to a subcategory of pre-ringed spaces, inspired by Grothendieck's work on commutative rings. Our notion of spectrum, although formally reminiscent of the Grothendieck spectrum, is new; in particular, for commutative rings it does not always agree with the Grothendieck spectrum, but it always projects onto it. Remarkably, an appropriately defined relative version of our spectrum agrees with the Grothendieck spectrum for finitely generated commutative algebras over the complex numbers. This work aims to represent the starting point for a rigorous study of geometric properties of quantum spacetimes.</description>

      <title>The Evaluation of Graphs on Surfaces for State-Sum Models with Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evaluation of graphs on 2-spheres is a central ingredient of the Turaev-Viro construction of three-dimensional topological field theories. In this article, we introduce a class of graphs, called extruded graphs, that is relevant for the Turaev-Viro construction with general defect configurations involving defects of various dimensions. We define the evaluation of extruded graphs and show that it is invariant under a set of moves. This ensures the computability and uniqueness of our evaluation.</description>

      <title>The Unicity Theorem and the center of the ${\rm SL}_3$-skein algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ${\rm SL}_3$-skein algebra $\mathscr{S}_{\bar{q}}(\mathfrak{S})$ of a punctured oriented surface $\mathfrak{S}$ is a quantum deformation of the coordinate algebra of the ${\rm SL}_3$-character variety of $\mathfrak{S}$. When $\bar{q}$ is a root of unity, we prove the Unicity Theorem for representations of $\mathscr{S}_{\bar{q}}(\mathfrak{S})$, in particular the existence and uniqueness of a generic irreducible representation. Furthermore, we show that the center of $\mathscr{S}_{\bar{q}}(\frak{S})$ is generated by the peripheral skeins around punctures and the central elements contained in the image of the Frobenius homomorphism for $\mathscr{S}_{\bar{q}}(\frak{S})$, a surface generalization of Frobenius homomorphisms of quantum groups related to ${\rm SL}_3$. We compute the rank of $\mathscr{S}_{\bar{q}}(\mathfrak{S})$ over its center, hence the dimension of the generic irreducible representation.</description>

      <title>Phase Space and Quantization of 2D BF Theory Coupled to 1D Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study ring of functions on the (classical and quantized) phase space of 2-dimensional BF theory with the gauge group $\mathrm{GL}_N$ coupled to a 1-dimensional quantum mechanics with global symmetry $\mathrm{GL}_K$. These functions are gauge-invariant local observables of the coupled system. We first construct the classical phase space of this system and describe its ring of functions and their large-$N$ limit. We next compute the Hilbert series of these algebras for finite-$N$ and also in the large-$N$ limit. We then study the quantization of this phase space and the deformation quantization of its ring of functions, elaborate its relation to the Yangian, and construct its coproduct. Finally, we identify these quantized algebras with the quantized Coulomb branch algebras of certain 3-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ quiver gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Analogs of the dual canonical bases for cluster algebras from Lie theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For almost all the known (quantum) cluster algebras from Lie theory, we construct the common triangular bases. These bases provide analogs of the dual canonical bases which have long been anticipated in cluster theory. Moreover, when the generalized Cartan matrices are symmetric, these cluster algebras and bases are quasi-categorified.
  We adopt a unified approach based on the structural similarities of different cluster algebras, introducing and investigating various cluster operations to propagate structures across different cases.
  We obtain fruitful byproducts. First, we prove A=U for these quantum cluster algebras. Furthermore, we discover rich structures of the locally compactified quantum cluster algebras arising from double Bott-Samelson cells: T-systems, standard bases, Kazhdan-Lusztig type algorithms, and, in type ADE, monoidal categorifications. The monoidal categories appearing are associated with positive braids and consist of modules of quantum affine algebras. We also obtain monoidal categorifications of the quantum function algebras in type ADE.</description>

      <title>R-matrices and Miura operators in 5d Chern-Simons theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive Miura operators for $W$- and $Y$-algebras from first principles as the expectation value of the intersection between a topological line defect and a holomorphic surface defect in 5-dimensional non-commutative $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ Chern-Simons theory. The expectation value, viewed as the transition amplitude for states in the defect theories forming representations of the affine Yangian of $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$, satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation and is thus interpreted as an R-matrix. To achieve this, we identify the representations associated with the line and surface defects by calculating the operator product expansions (OPEs) of local operators on the defects, as conditions that anomalous Feynman diagrams cancel each other. We then evaluate the expectation value of the defect intersection using Feynman diagrams. When the line and surface defects are specified, we demonstrate that the expectation value precisely matches the Miura operators and their products.</description>

      <title>Operator algebra and algorithmic construction of boundaries and defects in (2+1)D topological Pauli stabilizer codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computational algorithm for constructing all boundaries and defects of topological generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two spatial dimensions. Utilizing the operator algebra formalism, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the topological data-such as anyon types, fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics-of (2+1)D bulk stabilizer codes and (1+1)D boundary anomalous subsystem codes. To make the operator algebra computationally accessible, we adapt Laurent polynomials and convert the tasks into matrix operations, e.g., the Hermite normal form for obtaining boundary anyons and the Smith normal form for determining fusion rules. This approach enables computers to automatically generate all possible gapped boundaries and defects for topological Pauli stabilizer codes through boundary anyon condensation and topological order completion. This streamlines the analysis of surface codes and associated logical operations for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our algorithm applies to $Z_d$ qudits, including both prime and nonprime $d$, thus enabling the exploration of topological quantum codes beyond toric codes. We have applied the algorithm and explicitly demonstrated the lattice constructions of 2 boundaries and 6 defects in the $Z_2$ toric code, 3 boundaries and 22 defects in the $Z_4$ toric code, 1 boundary and 2 defects in the double semion code, 1 boundary and 22 defects in the six-semion code, 6 boundaries and 270 defects in the color code, and 6 defects in the anomalous three-fermion code. In addition, we investigate the boundaries of two specific bivariate bicycle codes within a family of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We demonstrate that their topological orders are equivalent to 8 and 10 copies of $Z_2$ toric codes, with anyons restricted to move by 12 and 1023 lattice sites in the square lattice, respectively.</description>
