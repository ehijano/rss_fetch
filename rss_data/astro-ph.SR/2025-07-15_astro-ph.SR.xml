      <title>MASTER OT J072007.30+451611.6: A Polar with Strong Optical Variability and Suppressed He II Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transient optical source MASTER OT J072007.30+451611.6 has been recently discovered and proposed as a peculiar polar with an unusually high amplitude of the orbital brightness variation in the optical of $\sim$3 mag. To clarify its nature, we performed multiband time-series optical photometry with 1.5-m class telescopes and spectroscopy with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. We also analysed archival data of different optical surveys and detected the source in X-rays with the Spectrum-RG/eROSITA telescope. We confirm the orbital period of $\approx$1.5 h with the high amplitude of the brightness modulation. Compiling survey data, covering $\sim$19 yr, we find high and low brightness states of the object at time scales of years, likely explained by different accretion rates. Our data were obtained in the high brightness state. Optical spectra with hydrogen and helium emission lines, consisting of broad and narrow components, indicate the presence of an accretion stream without disk. The Doppler tomography shows that the narrow component is mainly emitted from the Lagrangian L$_1$ point, while the broad component is from the region where the accretion stream interacts with the white dwarf magnetosphere. The ratio of equivalent widths of HeII 4686 and H$\beta$ emission lines is $&lt;$0.4, which is curiously low for polars. The X-ray spectrum of the source can be described by the thermal plasma emission model with parameters consistent with values observed for polars.</description>

      <title>Placing the Solar System in its Astrophysical Context</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine recent astronomical data to assess whether the sun and Solar System possess anomalous properties compared to other stars and exoplanetary systems, providing context for astrobiology research. Utilising data primarily from large surveys like {\it Gaia}, {\it Kepler}, {\it TESS}, and ground-based spectroscopy (e.g., GALAH, LAMOST, HARPS), we construct comparison samples (e.g., nearby stars, solar analogues and twins within 20-200 pc) and employ statistical methods, including regression analysis, to account for parameter dependencies. We find that the sun is modestly metal-rich compared to nearby solar-age stars. More anomalous solar properties include its mass (top $\sim$8 percent locally), low photometric variability on short timescales ($\sim$0.2 percent), specific light and heavy element abundance patterns (high beryllium, low lithium, low carbon/oxygen and nitrogen/oxygen ratios, and low heavy neutron capture and refractory elements), slow rotation, and low superflare rate. The sun has average $\alpha$/iron, phosphorus/iron, and Ytterbium/iron abundance ratios. It also has average chromospheric activity as measured by R$^{\rm '}_{\rm HK}$(T$_{\rm eff}$), R$^{\rm +}_{\rm HK}$, and H$\alpha$ indices. The Solar System is unusual in its lack of super-Earths despite hosting a cold Jupiter ($\sim$3 percent), the low eccentricities of its planets (especially considering detectability, $&lt;2$ percent), its large size scale for a multi-planet system ($\sim$6 percent), and potentially the sun's obliquity. The sun's galactic orbit is less eccentric and has lower vertical excursions than $\sim$95 percent of nearby solar analogues. Its current position is near perigalacticon and minimum distance from the Galactic plane, resulting in a higher local star density than 98.8 percent of randomly chosen times from $-0.5$ to $+0.5$ Gyrs.</description>

      <title>RHINE: R-process Heating Implementation in hydrodynamic simulations with NEural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron-rich outflows in neutron-star mergers (NSMs) or other explosive events can be subject to substantial heating through the release of rest-mass energy in the course of the rapid neutron-capture (r-) process. This r-process heating can potentially have a significant impact on the dynamics determining the velocity distribution of the ejecta, but due to the complexity of detailed nuclear networks required to describe the r-process self-consistently, hydrodynamic models of NSMs often neglect r-process heating or include it using crude parametrizations. In this work, we present a conceptually new method, RHINE, for emulating the r-process and concomitant energy release in hydrodynamic simulations via machine-learning algorithms. The method requires the evolution of only a few additional quantities characterizing the composition, of which the nuclear rates of change are obtained at each location and time step from neural networks trained by a large set of trajectories from full nuclear-network calculations. The scheme is tested by comparing spherically symmetric wind simulations and long-term simulations of NSMs using RHINE with post-processing results from nucleosynthesis calculations, where we find very good agreement. In our NSM models on average about 2.3MeV, 0.7MeV, and 2.1MeV are released per baryon in dynamical ejecta, NS-torus ejecta, and black-hole (BH) torus ejecta, respectively. The strongest velocity boost is observed for BH-torus ejecta, which also become 40% more massive with r-process heating. The nucleosynthesis yields are only mildly affected by r-process heating, but the kilonova gets significantly brighter once the BH-torus ejecta become visible. RHINE can be readily implemented in existing hydrodynamics codes using pre-trained machine-learning data and routines for source-term prediction that we provide online.</description>

      <title>Bringing the Norma Dark Cloud to Light in X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The filamentary dark cloud complex in Norma reveals signs of active low-mass star formation including protostars, H-alpha emission line stars, Herbig Haro objects, and the eruptive FU Orionis-like star V346 Nor. We present results of the first pointed X-ray observations of the Norma dark cloud, focusing on the westernmost Sandqvist 187 region. Chandra detected 75 X-ray sources and a complementary XMM-Newton observation detected 92 sources within the Chandra field-of-view, of which 46 are cross-matched to Chandra, yielding 121 unique X-ray sources. We present a catalog of X-ray sources along with basic X-ray properties and candidate IR and optical counterparts. Existing near-IR photometry reveals several X-ray sources with color excesses as typical of young stars with disks. Gaia parallaxes single out foreground stars and X-ray sources with distances of 500 - 1000 pc that are probable cloud members. The known emission line stars Sz 136 and Sz 137 were detected but V346 Nor was not. Interestingly, the optical and IR counterparts of the brightest Chandra source are not known with certainty but the prime suspects are very faint. Thus, the nature of the object responsible for the bright X-ray emission remains speculative. The X-ray observations presented here will serve as a pathfinder for identifying and characterizing the young stellar population in the Norma dark cloud.</description>

      <title>Probing periodic trends in the TESS light curves of the seventeen known Double White Dwarf systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a relatively large population of known double white dwarfs (DWDs) that were mostly discovered through spectroscopic observations and by measuring their radial velocity variations. Photometric observations from these systems give us additional information about their faint components by manifesting eclipsing or lensing signals or periodic trends such as ellipsoidal variations or Doppler boosting. To find these signals and trends we probe the public photometric data collected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) telescope from 17 known DWD systems. We use the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) technique to de-noise their light curves. For DWD systems J1717$+$6757, J1557$+$2823, LP400$-$22, J1449$+$1717, J2132$+$0754, and J2151$+$1614 we find regular and periodic trends in their TESS light curves. The periodic trend in light curve J1449$+$1717 is caused by the blending effect due to a variable and bright star close to it which are unresolvable in the TESS observations. The discovered periodic trend for J1717$+$6757 was recovered by the TESS data. The periodic trends in light curves of J1557$+$2823 and J2151$+$1614 have the False Alarm Probability (FAP) values $\simeq 14.8,~36.5\%$. So their detected trends are likely noises with non-orbital origins. Periods of trends in light curves of LP400$-$22 and J2132$+$0754 are the same as and half of orbital periods, respectively. We evaluate possible ranges for Doppler boosting and ellipsoidal variations's amplitudes for these targets. This study highlights the importance of TESS data for identifying periodic trends such as ellipsoidal or intrinsic variations rather than short eclipsing/lensing signals in DWD light curves specially bright targets with ignorable blending.</description>

      <title>Polarized, variable radio emission from the scallop-shell binary system DG CVn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DG CVn is an eruptive variable star and represents the closest member of the known sample of complex periodic variables, or scallop-shell stars. Over the years, this M dwarf binary system has shown significant flaring activity at a wide range of frequencies. Here, we present a detailed analysis of $\sim 14$ hours of radio observations of this stellar system, taken with the Karl G.Jansky Very Large Array at band L, centered at 1.5 GHz. In both $7$-hour long observations, we have found a quiescent, weakly polarized component, that could be ascribable to the incoherent, gyro-synchrotron emission coming from the magnetosphere surrounding one or both stars, along with multiple $\sim90\%$ right-circularly polarized bursts, some of which last for a few minutes, while others being longer, $\gtrsim$ 30 minutes. Some of these bursts show a drift in frequency and time, possibly caused due to beaming effects or the motion of the plasma responsible for the emission. We assess the possible modulation of burst frequency with the primary and secondary periods, and discuss the properties of these bursts, favoring electron cyclotron maser over plasma emission as the likely underlying mechanism. We compare DG CVn's dynamic spectrum to other young M dwarfs and find many similarities. A dedicated proper radio/optical simultaneous follow-up is needed to monitor the long-term variability, increase the statistics of bursts, in order to test whether the co-rotating absorbers detected in optical can drive the observed radio emission, and whether the occurrence of radio bursts correlates with the rotational phase of either stars.</description>

      <title>MVPinn: Integrating Milne-Eddington Inversion with Physics-Informed Neural Networks for GST/NIRIS Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MVPinn, a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach tailored for solving the Milne-Eddington (ME) inversion problem, specifically applied to spectropolarimetric observations from the Big Bear Solar Observatory's Near-InfraRed Imaging Spectropolarimeter (BBSO/NIRIS) at the Fe I 1.56 {\mu}m lines. Traditional ME inversion methods, though widely used, are computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, and often struggle to accurately capture complex profile asymmetries resulting from gradients in magnetic field strength, orientation, and line-of-sight velocities. By embedding the ME radiative transfer equations directly into the neural network training as physics-informed constraints, our MVPinn method robustly and efficiently retrieves magnetic field parameters, significantly outperforming traditional inversion methods in accuracy, noise resilience, and the ability to handle asymmetric and weak polarization signals. After training, MVPinn infers one magnetogram in about 15 seconds, compared to tens of minutes required by traditional ME inversion on high-resolution spectropolarimetric data. Quantitative comparisons demonstrate excellent agreement with well-established magnetic field measurements from the SDO/HMI and Hinode/SOT-SP instruments, with correlation coefficients of approximately 90%. In particular, MVPINN aligns better with Hinode/SOT-SP data, indicating some saturation of HMI data at high magnetic strengths. We further analyze the physical significance of profile asymmetries and the limitations inherent in the ME model assumption. Our results illustrate the potential of physics-informed machine learning methods in high-spatial-temporal solar observations, preparing for more sophisticated, real-time magnetic field analysis essential for current and next-generation solar telescopes and space weather monitoring.</description>

      <title>Millions of Main-Sequence Binary Stars from Gaia BP/RP Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the main-sequence binary (MSMS) Catalog derived from Gaia Data Release 3 BP/RP (XP) spectra. Leveraging the vast sample of low-resolution Gaia XP spectra, we develop a forward modeling approach that maps stellar mass and photometric metallicity to XP spectra using a neural network. Our methodology identifies binary systems through statistical comparison of single- and binary-star model fits, enabling detection of binaries with mass ratios between 0.4 and 1.0 and flux ratios larger than 0.1. From an initial sample of 35 million stars within 1 kpc, we identify 14 million binary candidates and define a high-confidence "golden sample" of 1 million binary systems. This large, homogeneous sample enables detailed statistical analysis of binary properties across diverse Galactic environments, providing new insights into binary star formation and evolution. In addition, the $\chi^2$ comparison allows us to distinguish stars with luminous companions from single stars or binaries with dark companions, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars and black hole candidates, improving our understanding of compact object populations.</description>

      <title>A population analysis of Galactic Miras with light-curve asymmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: In a recent publication, we established a close relationship between light-curve asymmetries in Mira variables and indicators of their dust mass-loss rate. The light-curve asymmetries appear to be related to the stars' third dredge-up (3DUP) activity. Aims: We aim to reveal the evolutionary status of M-type Miras with light-curve asymmetries ('bumps') within the spectral sequence M -- S -- C, determine their mass-loss properties, and check possible evolutionary scenarios. Methods: We analysed a sample of 3100 Miras collected from the ASAS database, distinguishing between symmetric and asymmetric light curves. We determined their periods, luminosity functions, and period-luminosity relations, their locations relative to the Galactic midplane, as well as mass-loss rate indicators through the 2MASS-WISE colours and the Gaia-2MASS diagram. Results: The M-type Miras with symmetric light curves are generally found to have shorter periods, lower luminosities, a larger average distance to the Galactic midplane, and lower initial masses than the M-type Miras with asymmetries. In addition, 25 Miras are proposed as candidates for new carbon stars. Conclusions: We propose that the M-type Miras have two distinct populations: M-type Miras with symmetric light curves, which have lower initial mass progenitors than M-type Miras with asymmetries, which show signs of 3DUP activity and are the link to the S-type Miras.</description>

      <title>Determining the Magnetic Field in the Atmosphere of a Solar Active Region Observed by the CLASP2.1 Sounding Rocket Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine magnetic fields from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere combining data from the Hinode satellite and the CLASP2.1 sounding rocket experiment. CLASP2.1 provided polarization profiles of the Mg~{|sc ii} $h$ and $k$ lines, as well as of the Mn~{|sc i} lines around 2800~{|AA}, across various magnetic structures in an active region, containing a plage, a pore, and the edges of a sunspot penumbra. By applying the Weak-Field Approximation (WFA) to the circular polarization profiles of these spectral lines, we obtain a longitudinal magnetic field map at three different heights in the chromosphere (lower, middle, and upper). This is complemented by data from Hinode (photospheric magnetic field), IRIS, and SDO (high-spatial-resolution observations of the chromosphere and corona). We quantify the height expansion of the plage magnetic fields and find that the magnetic fields expand significantly in the middle chromosphere, shaping the moss observed above in the transition region and corona. We identified an area with polarity reversal at the upper chromosphere around the edge of the pore, suggesting the presence of a magnetic discontinuity in the upper chromosphere. Transient and recurrent jet-like events are observed in this region, likely driven by magnetic reconnection. Around the penumbral edge, we find large-scale magnetic fields corresponding to the superpenumbral fibrils seen in the upper chromosphere. In the superpenumbral fibrils, we find Zeeman-induced linear polarization signals, suggesting the presence of a significantly inclined magnetic field, as strong as 1000~G in the upper chromosphere.</description>

      <title>Generation of Surface Sausage Oscillations of a Current Sheet and Propagating Magnetoacoustic Waves by Impulsive Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection and Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves may well be both playing a role in coronal heating. In this paper, we simulate reconnection in the corona as a response to the convergence of opposite-polarity magnetic sources at the base of the corona. A current sheet forms at a magnetic null and undergoes impulsive bursty reconnection which drives natural modes of oscillation of the current sheet by a process of symbiosis. These are leaky surface sausage modes which cause the length of the current sheet to oscillate. Interaction of the oscillations and reconnection outflows with the magnetic Y-points at the ends of the sheet acts as sources for magnetoacoustic waves. Fast-mode waves propagate outwards into the coronal environment, while slow-mode waves propagate along the separatrices extending from the ends of the current sheet. The periodicities for sausage oscillations of the current sheet, for the current sheet length, and for the propagating large-scale magnetoacoustic waves are all estimated to be approximately 91 s for the parameters of our experiment.</description>

      <title>Parametric instability of Alfv\'en wave packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric instability of Alfv\'en wave packets with monochromatic carrier wave in low-$\beta$ plasma is studied using one-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The results show spatial growth of incoming perturbations as they propagate through the mother wave. For sufficiently short packets, the perturbations emerge downstream of the packet as small-amplitude reverse Alfv\'en waves and forward slow magnetosonic waves. For larger packets the perturbations reach non-linear amplitude while still inside the mother wave. In this case, a downstream section of the mother wave collapses but the remaining upstream section stays largely intact and enters the phase of very slow evolution. The length scale separating the linear and non-linear regimes, as well as determining the size of the surviving section in the non-linear regime, is set by the Alfv\'en crossing time of the packet, the growth rate of the parametric instability for the unmodulated carrier wave, and the amplitude of incoming perturbations. The results are discussed in connection with the physics of solar wind.</description>

      <title>Observational mapping of the mass discrepancy in eclipsing binaries. A new self-contained framework for concurrent analysis of photometric and spectroscopic time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass discrepancy problem, observed in high-mass stars within eclipsing binaries, highlights systematic differences between dynamical and evolutionary mass estimates, challenging the accuracy of stellar evolution models. We aim to determine whether analysis methods directly contribute to this discrepancy and to assess how methodological improvements might reduce or clarify it. To address this, we developed a new self-contained framework that simultaneously models the photometric and spectroscopic data, minimising biases introduced by traditional iterative approaches and enabling consistent parameter optimisation. We present this framework alongside validation tests on synthetic data and demonstrate its application to three well-studied observed binaries, including one system known for its pronounced mass discrepancy. The framework recovers multiple viable solutions from distinct local minima, including one that reduces the mass discrepancy. These results illustrate how methodological biases, rather than evolutionary model assumptions, can contribute to the mass discrepancy problem. We further highlight that external constraints, such as independent distance estimates or evolutionary models, may be necessary to distinguish between degenerate solutions. Expanding this analysis to a larger sample will provide a more complete understanding, with forthcoming results in the next paper in this series.</description>

      <title>How an overweight and rapidly rotating PG 1159 star in the Galactic halo challenges evolutionary models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PG 1159 stars are thought to be progenitors of the majority of H-deficient white dwarfs. Their unusual He-, C-, and O-dominated surface composition is typically believed to result from a late thermal pulse experienced by a single (pre-)white dwarf. Yet, other formation channels - involving close binary evolution - have recently been proposed and could lead to similar surface compositions. Here we present a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral analysis based on new UV and archival optical spectra of one of the hottest PG 1159 stars, $\text{RX J}0122.9\text{ -}7521$. We find $T_\text{eff} = 175$ kK and a surface gravity of log $g = 7.7$, and an astonishingly low O/C ratio of $7.3 \times 10^{-3}$ by mass. By combining the spectroscopic surface gravity and Gaia parallax with a spectral energy distribution fit, we derive a mass of $M_\text{spec} = 1.8^{+1.1}_{-0.7}$ $M_\odot$. Although this spectroscopic mass is higher than predicted by evolutionary models, it is subject to substantial uncertainty. Furthermore, we find that $\text{RX J}0122.9\text{ -}7521$ shows strongly rotationally broadened lines, suggesting that the previously reported photometric period of $41$ min indeed corresponds to the rotational period of this star. Our kinematic analysis shows that $\text{RX J}0122.9\text{ -}7521$ belongs to the Galactic halo, which - assuming single-star evolution - is in stark contrast to its relatively high mass. The rapid rotation, high mass, and halo kinematics, as well as the lack of evidence for a close companion, lead us to believe that $\text{RX J}0122.9\text{ -}7521$ formed through the merger of two white dwarfs. Yet, none of the current models can explain the surface abundances of $\text{RX J}0122.9\text{ -}7521$.</description>

      <title>Massive stars advanced evolution: I -- New reaction rates for carbon and oxygen nuclear reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear rates for reactions involving 12C and 16O are key to compute the energy release and nucleosynthesis of massive stars during their evolution. These rates shape the stellar structure and evolution, and impact the nature of the final compact remnant. We explore the impact of new nuclear reaction rates for 12C({\alpha},{\gamma})16O, 12C+12C, 12C+16O and 16O+16O reactions for massive stars. We aim to investigate how the structure and nucleosynthesis evolve and how these processes influence the stellar fate. We computed stellar models using the GENEC code, including updated rates for 12C({\alpha},{\gamma})16O and, for the three fusion reactions, new rates following a fusion suppression scenario and new theoretical rates obtained with TDHF calculations. The updated 12C({\alpha},{\gamma})16O rates mainly impact the chemical structure evolution changing the 12C/16O ratio with little effect on the CO core mass. This variation in the 12C/16O ratio is critical for predicting the stellar fate, which is very sensitive to 12C abundance. The combined new rates for 12C+12C and 16O+16O fusion reactions according to the HIN(RES) model lead to shorter C- and O-burning lifetimes, and shift the ignition conditions to higher temperatures and densities. Theoretical TDHF rates primarily affect C-burning, increasing its duration and lowering the ignition temperature. These changes alter the core chemical structure, the carbon shell size and duration, and hence the compactness. They also affect nucleosynthesis. This work shows that accurate reaction rates for key processes in massive star evolution drive significant changes in stellar burning lifetimes, chemical evolution, and stellar fate. In addition, discrepancies between experimental and theoretical rates introduce uncertainties in model predictions, influencing both the internal structure and the supernova ejecta composition.</description>

      <title>Intermittency in Voyager Magnetic Field Beyond the Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the two Voyager spacecraft traveled beyond the heliosphere, they encountered a magnetic field environment that had never been observed before. Studies have attempted to characterize this new regime by examining the magnetic field intermittency. This is typically done by fitting the optimal kappa distribution function and interpreting its so-called q-statistics to characterize the magnetic field increments. Using this approach, recent findings concluded that beyond a certain distance, the magnetic field increments in the very local interstellar medium (VLISM) follow Gaussian statistics, unlike those both inside the heliosphere and in the region just beyond the widely accepted heliopause location, raising questions about the heliopause identification. This study explores this issue in detail by (1) optimizing the derivation of the distribution function, (2) examining whether and how the results depend on increment windows and time periods, and (3) determining the statistical behavior of the examined time series. Using magnetic field measurements from Voyager 1, we present two independent techniques and introduce a statistical framework to systematically analyze the distributions of magnetic field increments. Contrary to previous findings, we find that magnetic field increments in the VLISM do not follow a Gaussian distribution (k to infinity) and instead are in the non-Gaussian range of kappa values (3-7, when analyzed on a 30-day statistical period). We further demonstrate how erroneous, statistically induced results can arise that mimic Gaussian-like results when mixing different structures in such analyses. Our results show that Voyager 1 still travels in the intermittent magnetic field environment of the VLISM.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of 3 minute Slow Magnetoacoustic Waves in the Sunspot Umbral Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slow magnetoacoustic waves with a 3 minute period are upward-propagating waves traveling through the density-stratified umbral atmosphere. The decreasing density causes their amplitude to increase, developing into nonlinear waves through steepening and eventually forming shocks. To investigate the vertical evolution of this wave nonlinearity, we utilized multi-wavelength data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), covering from the photosphere to the lower corona across 20 active regions. The steepening of the wave profile leads to the generation of higher harmonics. We quantify this using a nonlinearity index (NI), defined as the ratio of the amplitude of 2nd harmonic to the fundamental obtained using wavelet analysis. We find a characteristic pattern: nonlinearity increases from the photosphere through the lower chromosphere, peaking near the AIA 1700 \r{A} formation height, and decreases at higher altitudes, notably in the AIA 304 \r{A} channel. This trend indicates progressive wave steepening and subsequent energy dissipation before reaching the formation of AIA 304 \r{A}, consistent with shock formation in the lower atmosphere. An additional rise in NI is observed at the AIA 131 \r{A} channel, followed by a decline in AIA 171 \r{A}, suggesting a 2nd phase of wave nonlinearity evolution in the lower corona. Based on the NI profile and the formation heights of these channels, we conjecture that nonlinear wave processes are most prominent between the AIA 1700 \r{A} and AIA 304 \r{A} formation layers and again between AIA 131 \r{A} and AIA 171 \r{A}.</description>

      <title>A New Brown Dwarf Orbiting an M star and An Investigation on the Eccentricity Distribution of Transiting Long-Period Brown Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbital eccentricities of brown dwarfs encode valuable information of their formation and evolution history, providing insights into whether they resemble giant planets or stellar binaries. Here, we report the discovery of TOI-5575b, a long-period, massive brown dwarf orbiting a low-mass M5V star ($\rm 0.21\pm0.02\,M_\odot$) delivered by the TESS mission. The companion has a mass and radius of $\rm 72.4\pm4.1\,M_J$ and $\rm 0.84\pm0.07\,R_J$ on a 32-day moderately eccentric orbit ($e=0.187\pm0.002$), making it the third highest-mass-ratio transiting brown dwarf system known to date. Building on this discovery, we investigate the eccentricity distributions of a sample of transiting long-period ($10\leq P\lesssim 1000$ days, $\sim$0.1-1.5 AU) giant planets, brown dwarfs and low-mass stars. We find that brown dwarfs exhibit an eccentricity behavior nearly identical to that of giant planets: a preference for circular orbits with a long tail toward high eccentricities. Such a trend contrasts sharply with direct imaging findings, where cold (5-100 AU) brown dwarfs and giant planets display distinct eccentricity distributions. Our results suggest that transiting long-period brown dwarfs and giant planets probably 1) form in different routes at exterior orbits but undergo analogous dynamical evolution processes and migrate inwards; or 2) both contain two sub-groups, one with widely spread eccentricities while the other has circular orbits, that jointly sculpt the eccentricity distributions. The low-mass-star systems appear to be a distinctive population, showing a peak eccentricity at about 0.3, akin to more massive stellar binaries.</description>

      <title>Identification of Outer Galaxy Cluster Members Using Gaia DR3 and Multidimensional Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The outer Galaxy presents a distinctive environment for investigating star formation. This study develops a novel approach to identify true cluster members based on unsupervised clustering using astrometry with significant uncertainties. As a proof of concept, we analyze three outer Galactic Young Stellar Object (YSO) clusters at different distances and densities within 65 &lt; l &lt; 265 degrees, each known to contain &gt;100 members based on the Star Formation in Outer Galaxy catalog. The 618 YSO clusters in the SFOG dataset were based on 2-dimensional clustering. In this contribution, we apply the HDBSCAN* algorithm to the precise Gaia DR3 astrometry to assign YSO cluster membership. Monte Carlo simulation, coupled with HDBSCAN* (HDBSCAN-MC algorithm), addresses YSO astrometric uncertainties while 5-dimensional clustering. We introduce the Generation Of cLuster anD FIeld STar (GOLDFIST) simulation, to enable robust membership determination, performing an unsupervised clustering analysis in higher-dimensional feature space while accommodating measurement errors. In this study, we extended our approach to distant outer galaxy YSOs and clusters with larger astrometric uncertainties. The results include the discovery of new members in the previously identified clusters. We also analyze the known stars in the clusters and confirm their membership. The derived membership probabilities are included in the provided cluster catalogs. The more accurately predicted simulation distance estimates closely agree, within uncertainty limits, with the median distance estimates derived from Gaia data, and are compared with the kinematic distances from the WISE HII survey.</description>

      <title>Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the MagnetoPause (CRIMP): A Mission Concept to Uncover the Impact of Mesoscale Reconnection and Plasma Outflow Processes at the Dayside Magnetopause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the Magnetopause (CRIMP) mission is a Heliophysics Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) Announcement of Opportunity (AO) mission concept designed to study mesoscale structures and particle outflow along Earth's magnetopause using two identical spacecraft. CRIMP would uncover the impact of magnetosheath mesoscale drivers, dayside magnetopause mesoscale phenomenological processes and structures, and localized plasma outflows on magnetic reconnection and the energy transfer process in the dayside magnetosphere. CRIMP accomplishes this through uniquely phased spacecraft configurations that allow multipoint, contemporaneous measurements at the magnetopause. This enables an unparalleled look at mesoscale spatial differences along the dayside magnetopause on the scale of 1-3 Earth Radii (Re). Through these measurements, CRMIP will uncover how local mass density enhancements affect global reconnection, how mesoscale structures drive magnetopause dynamics, and if the magnetopause acts as a perfectly absorbing boundary for radiation belt electrons. This allows CRIMP to determine the spatial scale, extent, and temporal evolution of energy and mass transfer processes at the magnetopause - crucial measurements to determine how the solar wind energy input in the magnetosphere is transmitted between regions and across scales. This concept was conceived as a part of the 2024 NASA Heliophysics Mission Design School.</description>

      <title>The New Generation Planetary Population Synthesis (NGPPS) VIII. Impact of host star metallicity on planet occurrence rates, orbital periods, eccentricities, and radius valley morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dust-to-gas ratio in the protoplanetary disk, which is likely imprinted into the host star metallicity, is a property that plays a crucial role during planet formation. We aim at constraining planet formation and evolution processes by statistically analysing planetary systems generated by the Generation III Bern model, comparing with the correlations derived from observational samples. Using synthetic planets biased to observational completeness, we find that (1) the occurrence rates of large giant planets and Neptune-size planets are positively correlated with [Fe/H], while small sub-Earths exhibit an anti-correlation. In between, for sub-Neptune and super-Earth, the occurrence rate first increases and then decreases with increasing [Fe/H] with an inflection point at 0.1 dex. (2) Planets with orbital periods shorter than ten days are more likely to be found around stars with higher metallicity, and this tendency weakens with increasing planet radius. (3) Both giant planets and small planets exhibit a positive correlation between the eccentricity and [Fe/H], which could be explained by the self-excitation and perturbation of outer giant planets. (4) The radius valley deepens and becomes more prominent with increasing [Fe/H], accompanied by a lower super-Earth-to-sub-Neptune ratio. Furthermore, the average radius of the planets above the valley increases with [Fe/H]. Our nominal model successfully reproduces many observed correlations with stellar metallicity, supporting the description of physical processes and parameters included in the Bern model. However, the dependences of orbital eccentricity and period on [Fe/H] predicted by the synthetic population is however significantly weaker than observed. This discrepancy suggests that long-term dynamical interactions between planets, along with the impact of binaries/companions, can drive the system towards a dynamically hotter state.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Reliability of the AfriTEC Model During the Descending Phase of Solar Cycle 24 Across East Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the reliability of the African Regional Ionospheric Total Electron Content (AfriTEC) model during the descending phase of Solar Cycle 24 (2016-2017) across East Africa. Using GNSS-derived TEC data from five equatorial and low-latitude stations MOIU, MAL2, ZAMB, ADIS, and MBAR the model's performance is assessed through statistical metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and correlation coefficient r. Results indicate that the AfriTEC model effectively captures the diurnal and seasonal behavior of TEC, particularly during equinoxes, with MAE values generally below 1.5 TECU and correlation coefficients exceeding 0.80. However, discrepancies emerge during solstice periods and post-sunset hours, reflecting the model's limitations in representing complex ionospheric processes such as the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA). To benchmark its performance, AfriTEC is also compared against the widely used NeQuick model. AfriTEC demonstrates superior regional adaptability and reduced error under most conditions, though it remains sensitive to localized ionospheric disturbances. These findings suggest that while AfriTEC is a valuable tool for ionospheric modeling in whole Africa especially at East African sector, enhancements incorporating real-time solar and geomagnetic indices could further improve its predictive capabilities.</description>

      <title>Study of solar activity with AERA at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar activity events release vast amounts of energy, including radio waves, X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, and energetic particles, which interact with the ionosphere of the Earth and can disrupt radio wave propagation, affecting radio communications. They can either enhance reflections, improving long-distance terrestrial communications, or cause signal degradation and absorption, respectively, depending on whether the increased ionization affects the upper or lower layers of the ionosphere. In the first case, the solar cycle modulates the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF), the highest frequency usable for radio communication between two Earth-based points. The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) of the Pierre Auger Observatory was developed to measure the radio emission from extensive air showers in the $30-80$ MHz band. We examine the impact of solar activity on AERA data collected over approximately 11 years. We report the detection of different types of solar radio bursts and we investigate how increased solar radiation - particularly in the X-ray and extreme ultraviolet bands - also affects measurements in the AERA energy band. Our results show a remarkable correlation between the MUF and the broadband noise observed in the $30-40$ MHz frequency range. Radio blackouts are also observed in AERA spectrograms in coincidence with those reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Additionally, we performed a search for temporal coincidences between AERA data and independent observations of solar radio burst events from the e-CALLISTO network and the SWAVES instrument. These findings highlight the complex interplay between solar activity and radio wave propagation, which is also relevant for cosmic-ray detection.</description>

      <title>Multispacecraft Observations of the 2024 September 9 Backside Solar Eruption that Resulted in a Sustained Gamma Ray Emission Event</title>

Abstract: We report on the 2024 September 9 sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) event observed by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi satellite. The event was associated with a backside solar eruption observed by multiple spacecraft such as the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), Parker Solar Probe (PSP), Solar Orbiter (SolO), Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), Wind, and GOES, and by ground based radio telescopes. Fermi LAT observed the SGRE after the EUV wave from the backside eruption crossed the limb to the frontside of the Sun. SolO's Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X rays (STIX) imaged an intense (X3.3) flare, which occurred about 41 deg behind the east limb, from heliographic coordinates S13E131. Forward modeling of the CME flux rope revealed that it impulsively accelerated (3.54 km/s/s) to attain a peak speed of 2162 km/s. SolO's energetic particle detectors (EPD) observed protons up to about 1 GeV from the extended shock and electrons that produced a complex type II burst and possibly type III bursts. The durations of SGRE and type II burst are consistent with the linear relation between these quantities obtained from longer duration (&gt;3 hours) SGRE events. All these observations are consistent with an extended shock surrounding the CME flux rope, which is the likely source of high energy protons required for the SGRE event. We compare this event with six other BTL SGRE eruptions and find that they are all consistent with energetic shock driving CMEs. We also find a significant east west asymmetry (3:1) in the BTL source locations.</description>

      <title>Topological ignition of the stealth coronal mass ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of hot topics in the solar physics are the so-called 'stealth' coronal mass ejections (CME), which are not associated with any appreciable energy release events in the lower corona, such as the solar flares. It is often assumed recently that these phenomena might be produced by some specific physical mechanism, but no particular suggestions were put forward. It is the aim of the present paper to show that a promising explanation of the stealth CMEs can be based on the so-called 'topological' ignition of the magnetic reconnection, when the magnetic null point is produced by a specific superposition of the remote sources (sunspots) rather than by the local current systems. As follows from our numerical simulations, the topological model explains very well all basic features of the stealth CMEs: (i) the plasma eruption develops without an appreciable heat release from the spot of reconnection, i.e., without the solar flare; (ii) the spot of reconnection (magnetic null point) can be formed far away from the location of the magnetic field sources; (iii) the trajectories of eruption are usually strongly curved, which can explain observability of CMEs generated behind the solar limb.</description>

      <title>Validating the bright Gaia celestial reference frame with new VLBI astrometry of radio stars</title>

Abstract: There exist inconsistencies between the bright and faint Gaia Celestial Reference Frame 3 (Gaia-CRF3), which manifests as a systematic rotation and needs to be independently estimated then corrected in future data releases. We collected 64 radio stars with VLBI astrometry, of which 16 have new VLBI observations with reference epochs close to Gaia. We estimated the orientation and spin biases of the bright Gaia-CRF3 by comparing VLBI radio star astrometry with their Gaia DR3 counterparts. We also attempted to estimate orientation by utilizing the a priori magnitude-dependent spin parameters derived from Gaia internal estimation. Our independent estimation of the orientation at G&lt;10.5 is [-15\pm119, +330\pm139,+218\pm109] uas (J2016.0), and the spin ([+21\pm18, +52\pm20,-7\pm20] uas/yr) agrees with Gaia internal estimation within 1-sigma range. The orientation-only estimation suggests that the orientation bias of the bright Gaia-CRF3 may also be magnitude-dependent.</description>

      <title>Impact of a binary companion in AGB outflows on CO spectral lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the late stage of their evolution, low- to intermediate-mass stars pass through the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, characterised by strong mass loss through dust driven winds. High angular resolution observations reveal that these winds harbour strong deviations from spherical symmetry, such as spirals and arcs, believed to be caused by hidden (sub-)stellar companions. Much more often, one observes spectral lines, where the presence of a companion is less clear. We study the impact of a binary companion on low-J CO spectral lines of AGB star outflows. By varying the orbital separation and wind velocity, we aim to find line shapes characteristic of more complex binary-induced morphologies. We generated a grid of nine 3D models of a mass-losing AGB star using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code Phantom, with three values for both the outflow velocity and orbital separation. Utilising the radiative transfer code Magritte, we created synthetic spectral lines for the low rotational transitions of CO at different inclinations and position angles. Our simulations show a variety of morphologies, always with a pronounced spiral structure arising in the orbital plane, but with varying shapes in the meridional plane, and different degrees of global flattening. We find that the CO line profiles can deviate strongly from the parabolic or flat-topped profiles expected from spherically symmetric outflows. A variety of line shapes emerge, with two peaks near the terminal velocity, and a central bump near the central velocity being the most pronounced. In specific cases, the spectral lines can appear parabolic, hiding the presence of a binary companion. We find the CO spectral lines can serve as a binary diagnostic. The influence of the companion on the line can however also go easily unnoticed, as the features can be concealed by the beam profile and the noise of the observations.</description>

Abstract: The transport of non-thermal particles across a large-scale magnetic field in the presence of magnetised turbulence has been a long-standing issue in high-energy astrophysics. Of particular interest is the dependence of the parallel and perpendicular mean free paths $\lambda_{\parallel}$ and $\lambda_{\perp}$ on rigidity $\mathcal{R}$. We have revisited this important issue with a view to applications from the transport of Galactic cosmic rays to acceleration at astrophysical shocks. We have run test particle simulations of cosmic ray transport in synthetic, isotropic Kolmogorov turbulence at unprecedentedly low reduced rigidities $\rg/\Lc \simeq 10^{-4}$, corresponding to $\mathcal{R} \simeq 10 \, \text{TV}$ for a turbulent magnetic field of $\Brms = 4 \, \mu\text{G}$ and correlation length $\Lc = 30 \, \text{pc}$. Extracting the (asymptotic) parallel and perpendicular mean free paths $\lambda_{\parallel}$ and $\lambda_{\perp}$, we have found $\lambda_{\parallel} \propto (\rg/\Lc)^{1/3}$ as expected for a Kolmogorov turbulence spectrum. In contrast, $\lambda_{\perp}$ has a faster dependence on $\rg/\Lc$ for $10^{-2} \lesssim \rg/\Lc \lesssim 1$, but for $\rg/\Lc \ll 10^{-2}$, also $\lambda_{\perp} \propto (\rg/\Lc)^{1/3}$. Our results have important implications for the transport of Galactic cosmic rays.</description>

Abstract: The transport of high-energy particles in the presence of small-scale, turbulent magnetic fields is a long-standing issue in astrophysics. Analytical theories on transport perpendicular to the large-scale magnetic field disagree with numerical simulations at rigidities where the particles' gyroradii are slightly smaller than the correlation length of turbulence. At the same time, extending the numerical simulations to lower rigidities has proven computationally prohibitive. We present an analytical model for the perpendicular transport, based on (1) initial particle transport along field lines, (2) the transport of field lines and (3) the eventual decorrelation of particles from field lines. Transport parallel to the large-scale field is governed by pitch-angle scattering and so for times larger than the inverse pitch-angle diffusion coefficient, particles spatially diffuse in the parallel direction. Our results suggest that perpendicular diffusion occurs when particles have displaced in the perpendicular direction by a few correlation lengths of turbulence. We have tested the analytical theory by running a large suite of test particle simulations at unprecedentedly low rigidities, making extensive use of graphical processing units (GPUs). Our numerical results exhibit a non-standard rigidity-dependence for the perpendicular diffusion coefficient at intermediate rigidities. At the lowest rigidities, the standard rigidity-dependence is recovered. The simulated diffusion coefficients are nicely reproduced by our analytical model. We have traced the non-standard rigidity-dependence to a subdiffusive phase in the field line transport. Our study confirms our understanding of the escape of cosmic rays from the Galactic halo and its rigidity-dependence. [abridged]</description>

      <title>A study of newly discovered close binary open clusters in the Milky Way</title>

Abstract: With the release of Gaia data, the number of known Galactic open clusters (OCs) has increased rapidly, providing an excellent opportunity to confirm more binary open clusters in the Milky Way. Using a recently released OC catalogue, we employed the photometric and astrometric data of OCs and their member stars to find close binary open clusters (CBOCs). The three dimensional spatial coordinates, proper motions, and colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) are used for identifying candidate CBOCs. The fundamental parameters of 26 star clusters are determined by fitting CMDs to stellar population isochrones, to check the similarity of reddenings, ages and metallicities of the sub-clusters of candidate CBOCs. The virial equilibrium is then used to exclude fake CBOCs including unbound moving groups. To further confirm the binary nature of the CBOC candidates, we calculated their Roche radii and orbital parameters. The tidal radius and radial velocity difference are then compared to the Roche radius and orbital velocity respectively, to find out gravitationally bound pairs. We identified nine new CBOC candidates from bound candidate open clusters, seven of which are shown to be candidates for primordial binary open clusters (PBOCs). However, only the pair CWNU 1024 and OCSN 82 is identified as a gravitationally bound CBOC, when considering the uncertainties. The other eight CBOC candidates appear to be gravitationally unbound pairs, but the results depend on the methods of tidal radius determination and gravitational binding examination.</description>

      <title>Diffusive interactions between photons and electrons, an application to cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gradient force is the conservative component of many types of forces exerted by light on particles. When it is derived from a potential, there is no heat transferred to the particle interacting with the light field. However, most theoretical descriptions of the gradient force use simplified configurations of the light field and particle interactions which overlook small amounts of heating. It is known that quantum fluctuations contribute to a very small but observable momentum diffusion of atoms and a corresponding increase in their temperature. This paper examines the contribution to momentum diffusion from a gradient force described as a quantum interaction between electron wave packets and a classical electromagnetic field. Stimulated transfers of photons between interfering light beams produce a small amount of heating that is difficult to detect in laboratory experiments. However the solar corona, with its thermal electrons irradiated by an intense electromagnetic field, provides ideal conditions for such a measurement. Heating from stimulated transfers contributes a large fraction of the observed coronal heating. Furthermore, the energy removed from the light field produces a wavelength shift of its spectrum as it travels through free electrons. Theory predicts a stimulated transfer redshift comparable to the redshift of distant objects observed in astronomy.</description>

      <title>Polarized multiwavelength emission from pulsar wind - accretion disk interaction in a transitional millisecond pulsar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) bridge the evolutionary gap between accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries and millisecond radio pulsars. These systems exhibit a unique subluminous X-ray state characterized by the presence of an accretion disk and rapid switches between high and low X-ray emission modes. The high mode features coherent millisecond pulsations spanning from the X-ray to the optical band. We present multiwavelength polarimetric observations of the tMSP PSR J1023+0038 aimed at conclusively identifying the physical mechanism powering its emission in the subluminous X-ray state. During the high mode, we detect polarized emission in the 2-6 keV energy range, with a polarization degree of 12% +/- 3% and a polarization angle of -2deg +/- 9deg (1sigma) measured counterclockwise from the North celestial pole towards East. At optical wavelengths, we find a polarization degree of 1.41% +/- 0.04% and a polarization angle aligned with that in the soft X-rays, suggesting a common physical mechanism operating across these bands. Remarkably, the polarized flux spectrum matches the pulsed emission spectrum from optical to X-rays. The polarization properties differ markedly from those observed in other accreting neutron stars and isolated rotation-powered pulsars and are also inconsistent with an origin in a compact jet. Our results provide direct evidence that the polarized and pulsed emissions both originate from synchrotron radiation at the shock formed where the pulsar wind interacts with the inner regions of the accretion disk.</description>

Abstract: By consideration of the Compact object HESS J1731-347 as a hybrid twin compact star, i.e., a more compact star than its hadronic twin of the same mass, its stellar properties are derived. Besides showing that the properties of compact stars in this work are in good agreement with state-of-the-art constraints both from measurements carried out in laboratory experiments as well as by multi-messenger astronomy observations, the realization of an early strong hadron-quark first order phase transition as implied by the twins is discussed.</description>

      <title>Puzzling Variation of Gamma Rays from the Sun over the Solar Cycle Revealed with Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The steady-state gamma-ray emission from the Sun is thought to consist of two emission components due to interactions with Galactic cosmic rays: (1) a hadronic disk component, and (2) a leptonic extended component peaking at the solar edge and extending into the heliosphere. The flux of these components is expected to vary with the 11-year solar cycle, being highest during solar minimum and lowest during solar maximum, as it varies with the cosmic-ray flux. No study has yet analyzed the flux variation of each component over solar cycles.
  In this work, we measure the temporal variations of the flux of each component over 15 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope observations and compare them with the sunspot number and Galactic cosmic-ray flux from AMS-02 near Earth.
  We find that the flux variation of the disk anticorrelates with the sunspot number and correlates with cosmic-ray protons, as expected, confirming its emission mechanism. In contrast, the extended component exhibits a more complex variation: despite an initial anticorrelation with the sunspot number, we find neither anticorrelation with the sunspot number nor correlation with cosmic-ray electrons over the full 15-year period. This most likely suggests that cosmic-ray transport and modulation in the inner heliosphere are unexpectedly complex and may differ for electrons and protons or, alternatively, that there is an additional, unknown component of gamma rays or cosmic rays.
  These findings impact space weather research and emphasize the need for close monitoring of Cycle 25 and the ongoing polarity reversal.</description>

      <title>The HOSTS Survey: Suspected variable dust emission and constraints on companions around {\theta} Boo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the HOSTS survey by the LBTI, an excess emission from the main sequence star {\theta} Boo (F7V spectral type, 14.5pc distance) was observed. This excess indicates the presence of exozodiacal dust near the habitable zone (HZ) of the star. Previous observations from Spitzer and Herschel showed no sign of outer cold dust within their respective detection limits. Additional nulling and high-contrast AO observations were taken to spatially constrain the dust distribution, search for variability, and directly image potential companions in the system. This study presents the results of these observations and provides an interpretation of the inner system's architecture. The star was observed using the LBTI's N'-band nulling mode during three epochs in 2017, 2018, and 2023. The dust distribution is modeled and constrained for each epoch using the standard LBTI nulling pipeline, assuming a vertically thin disk with a face-on inclination. In addition, high-contrast AO observations are performed in the L'-band and H-band to constrain the presence of substellar companions around the star. Several solutions are found for the dust distribution, and for each epoch. However, the LBTI nulling observations are not able to discriminate between them. Using the upper limits from previous observations, we constrain the representative size of the dust grains around 3-5$\mu$m. A tentative increase in dust brightness is also measured at the Earth-equivalent insolation distance between 2017 and 2023. Several options are considered to explain the origin of the observed dust and its variability, but no clear sources could be identified from the current observations. Partly because our high-contrast AO observations could only constrain the presence of companions down to $11M_\text{Jup}$ at 1.3" separation.</description>

      <title>Correlation between U/Th and Pb/Os abundance ratios and its application in nuclear cosmochronology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The abundance ratios of radioactive elements U/Th and stable elements Pb/Os from the $r$-process are found to have a strong correlation. This correlation is quite robust with respect to astrophysical conditions. The U/Th-Pb/Os correlation is then applied to provide customized initial abundance ratios U/Th from the observed abundance ratios Pb/Os for six $r$-process enhanced metal-poor stars respectively. Ages of these six metal-poor stars are predicted by the U/Th chronometer, which are approximately between $11$ and $15$ Gyr. Their ages are compatible with the cosmic age of 13.8 billion years predicted from the cosmic microwave background radiation.</description>

      <title>Cold Jupiters and small planets: Friends, foes, or indifferent? A search for correlations with the largest exoplanet samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining whether there is any correlation between the presence of short-period small planets (SPs) with $P\lesssim100~d$ ($a \lesssim0.4~AU$) and $1&lt;M_{p}&lt;20~M_\oplus$ and that of outer cold Jupiters (CJs) with $a=1-10~AU$ and $M_{p}=0.5-20~M_{Jup}$ around solar-type stars may provide crucial constraints on models of formation and/or migration of SPs. However, discrepant results regarding the occurrence rates of CJs in SP systems have been reported in the literature, with some recent studies suggesting a strong SP-CJ correlation but only at super-solar metallicities and/or masses of the host stars. Here, we homogeneously recomputed the occurrence rates of CJs at average, sub-solar ($[Fe/H]&lt;-0.1$), solar ($-0.1\le[Fe/H]\le0.1$), and super-solar ($[Fe/H]&gt;0.1$) metallicity as well as at average and subintervals of stellar mass, namely 0.6-0.8, 0.8-1.0, and 1.0-1.2 $M_\odot$, using (i) a carefully-selected sample of 217 SP systems, and (ii) a large comparison sample of 1167 solar-type stars. We determine the integrated occurrence rate of CJs in SP systems to be $f_{CJ|SP}=11.1^{+2.5}_{-1.8}\%$; this is consistent with the estimated frequencies of CJs in both the comparison sample ($f_{CJ}=9.8^{+0.9}_{-0.8}\%$) and the HARPS-N survey of transiting SP systems. We find a possible correlation ($f_{CJ|SP}&gt;f_{CJ}$) only at super-solar mass and metallicity, though with statistical confidence of less than $3\sigma$. To test some theoretical predictions, we also searched for possible SP-CJ relations as a function of SP and CJ multiplicity, as well as SP composition, and we found none. We show that the architectures of SP systems are not indifferent to the presence of CJs, because the multiplicity of SPs strongly depends on the CJ eccentricity, as expected from planetary dynamics. A more comprehensive understanding of the relation between SPs and CJs requires larger samples of SP systems.[Abridged]</description>

      <title>Open cluster members in APOGEE DR17 I. Dynamics and star members</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19936</link>

Abstract: Context. Open clusters (OCs) are groups of stars formed from the same cloud of gas and cosmic dust. They play an important role in studies of star formation and evolution and our understanding of galaxy structure and dynamics. Aims. The main objective of this work is to identify stars that belong to OCs using astrometric data from Gaia EDR3 and spectroscopic data from APOGEE DR17. Furthermore, we investigate the metallicity gradients and orbital properties of the OCs in our sample. Methods. By applying the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm to these data, we identified observed stars in our galaxy with similar dynamics, chemical compositions, and ages. The orbits of the OCs were also calculated using the GravPot16 code. Results. We find 1,987 stars that tentatively belong to 49 OCs; 941 of these stars have probabilities above 80 \% of belonging to OCs. Our metallicity gradient presents a two-slope shape for two measures of different Galactic center distances -- the projected Galactocentric distance and the guiding center radius to the Galactic center -- as already reported in previous work. However, when we separate the OCs by age, we observe no significant difference in the metallicity gradient slope beyond a certain distance from the Galactic center. Our results show a shallower gradient for clusters younger than 2 Gyr than those older than 2 Gyr. All our OCs dynamically assemble the disk-like population very well, and they are in prograde orbits, which is typical for disk-like populations. Some OCs resonate with the Galactic bar at the Lagrange points L4 and L5.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Quenched $g_A$ in Nuclear Matter To Dense Compact-Star Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An argument is developed that the long-standing mystery in nuclear physics of the effective axial-current coupling constant in nuclei, $g_A^{\rm eff}\approx 1$, could be understood in terms of the mechanism referred to as ``pseudo-conformal sound speed" in dense compact-star matter, $v_{\rm pcs}^2/c^2\approx 1/3$. Both pros and cons are presented using an effective field theory anchored on renormalization-group approach to interacting baryons on the Fermi surface that enables one to go beyond Weinberg's highly successful EFT $\chi$EFT$_\pi$ with the pion field only (in nuclear medium) by implementing heavy-meson degrees of freedom. Both hidden local symmetry and hidden scale symmetry, the former involving the vector mesons $\rho$ and $\omega$ and the latter involving the hidden scalar meson, a dilaton $\hat{\sigma}$ ($f_0(500)$), play the crucial role. Going beyond the density regime applicable to normal nuclear matter $n_0$, the notion of ``hadron-quark continuity" is brought in via the topological structure of the nucleon, i.e., skyrmion considered to be valid in QCD at large $N_c$ limit. The new inputs for the argumentation are the large N limit of the Grassmanian model for hidden local symmetry and the IR fixed point in QCD for $N_f \leq 3$ involving ``genuine/QCD-conformal dilaton" for hidden scale symmetry.</description>
