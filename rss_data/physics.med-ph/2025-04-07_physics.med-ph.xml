      <title>A novel methodology to estimate pileup effects and induced error in microdosimetric spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microdosimetry provides a superior characterization of the radiation field compared to conventional LET-based methodology, and for this reason it has become increasingly attractive for quality assurance in particle therapy. However, the typical particle rates used in the treatments lead to pileup, which distorts the experimental spectra, and thus compromises the accuracy of microdosimetric measurements, limiting their use in clinical settings. In this work, we investigated the pileup in a spherical Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter (TEPC), and developed an algorithm to evaluate the contribution of this effect to the measured spectra. We exposed the TEPC to 11 and 70 MeV proton beams, and collected the microdosimetric spectra at rates in the $10^3$-$10^6$ pps range. Using a combination of GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulations and experimental data, we develop an algorithm capable of estimating the pileup probability affecting experimental measurements. The data suggest that the pileup probability has a linear increase with rate until it reaches a value of $15 \pm 3 \, \%$ at $28.2 \times 10^3$ pps, at which point it begins to saturate. Additionally, the outcomes from the comparison of the two proton energies suggest that the methodology used to estimate pileup can be used to predict the effects in clinical proton beams with similar energies. This same methodology can be applied to any type of microdosimetric measurement making it a reliable tool for addressing pileup issues and facilitating the application of microdosimetry in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>A new theoretical inverse quadratic Apodization function: A Comparison with traditional Apodization functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard apodization methods suppress side lobes but increase FWHM, reducing lateral resolution. Grating lobes can interfere with the main lobe, introducing artifacts in ultrasound images. A simple mathematical apodization function is needed to reduce side lobes while decreasing FWHM, thereby improving lateral resolution. The advantage of the new apodization function is that it performs comparably to the Hanning function in suppressing the first grating lobe while also reducing FWHM. This leads to improved lateral resolution and fewer artifacts caused by interference between side lobes and the main beam. Simulations using the new inverse quadratic apodization and no apodization were conducted with a wave pressure model. The new method was implemented using a rectangular function convoluted with the Fourier transform of an inverse quadratic. FWHM and the first side lobe amplitudes were quantified and compared across apodization functions. The inverse quadratic apodization outperformed no apodization in FWHM, with values of 0.906 mm and 1.22 mm, respectively. For first grating lobe suppression, the inverse quadratic and Hanning apodizations yielded -31.47 dB and -31 dB, respectively. Simulated B-mode wire phantom scans showed CNR values of 1.06 (no apodization), 1.32 (Hanning), and 1.66 (inverse quadratic). Corresponding image sharpness values were 7.3398, 6.6009, and 7.0039. The proposed apodization improves FWHM over rectangular and better suppresses the first side lobe than Hanning. When combined with Slepian sequences, the method yields superior CNR compared to standard apodizations, with only a slight trade-off in sharpness.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of Ge-doped Multi-Mode Fibers in Total Ionizing Dose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: The fiber optical links in 850 nm band with Ge-doped multi-mode (MM) fibers are well developed for data transmission at 10 Gbps and higher. The applications in nuclear environments require radiation resistance. The characteristics of Ge-doped MM fibers are investigated for Radiation Induced Attenuation (RIA) in Total Ionizing Dose (TID).
  Methods: Commercial samples of Ge-doped MM fibers were irradiated in Go-60 gamma rays at dose rates of 5 to 1.4k Gy(SiO2)/hr. The fiber samples were packaged in water tanks maintained at constant temperatures in the range of -15 to 45 degC. The optical power transmitted through the fibers were recorded in irradiation, and in annealing when the source was shielded. The measurements of RIA in time are analyzed for dose rate and temperature dependences.
  Results: Ge-doped fiber samples of OM2 to OM4 grades were investigated for attenuation of optical power in radiation ionizing dose. Depending on the fabrication technology, two of the fiber types show radiation resistance with the RIAs of 0.2 dB/m and 0.05 dB/m, respectively, for the TID of 300 kGy(SiO2). At low dose rate of 5 Gy/hr, the RIA increases steadily and the annealing of low density ionizing defects does not cause notable deviation. At 1.4 kGy/hr the accumulated defects result to twice higher RIA during irradiation, and is worsen to a factor three in cold temperature. However, once the source is shielded the recovery is effective in a few hours.
  Conclusion: The telecom products of 850 nm Ge-doped MM fibers provide high speed communication in distances of a few hundred meters. The industrial fabrication methods provide fibers that can endure radiation ionizing dose for applications in nuclear instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Ionomeric extracellular matrices for dynamic soft robotic tissue engineering devices through protein sulfonation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional tissue engineering methodologies frequently depend on pharmacological strategies to induce or expedite tissue repair. However, bioengineered strategies incorporating biophysical stimulation have emerged as promising alternatives. Electroactive materials facilitate the provision of controlled electrical, mechanical, and electromechanical stimuli, which support cell proliferation and tissue remodelling. Despite their ability to supply external electrical and mechanical stimuli to the tissue microenvironment, the electroactive polymers in use today often lack critical biochemical signals essential for native-like cell-cell and cell-scaffold interactions, thereby constraining their regenerative capabilities. To address the demand for biomimetic materials that possess enhanced capabilities in promoting cell and tissue stimulation, we present the development of a novel class of polymers called ionomeric extracellular matrices (iECMs). By utilising the linker-mediated conjugation of sulfonic acid biomolecules (taurine) to the backbone of an extracellular matrix protein (collagen), we illustrate the potential of iECMs as the first electromechanical actuating material platform derived entirely from ECM materials, paving the way for dynamic and soft-robotic platforms for a wide range of tissue engineering applications.</description>

      <title>When More Is Less: Higher Magnetic Fields and Their Limited Impact on SNR per Time Unit of Acquisition Time in Single Voxel Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) offers significant diagnostic potential but is inherently constrained by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While increasing the main magnetic field strength B_0 is theoretically linked to increased SNR, practically obtained gains in SNR from B07/4 to B0 depending on the domination of thermal noise at high B0, are not always realized. Especially in clinical settings the maximum reachable SNR is further constrained by the total available acquisition time (TA) and the regulatory limits on maximum tolerable specific absorption rate (SAR). This work attempts to derive mathematical expressions that enable systematical analysis of the theoretical achievable SNR-gain. One important notion is this context is the SNR gain per unit of measurement time as a function of the main magnetic field B0 strengths in the case of single voxel spectroscopy (SVS) pulse sequences. Our findings indicate that under given fixed total amount of (patient acceptable) measurement time TA, and maximum tolerable SAR limitation, together with conditions that ensure the adiabaticity of specific sequences, further increasing B0 does not further improve SNR per unit of measurement time. Key factors were identified, including RF-pulse bandwidth scaling with B0 and longitudinal relaxation time (T1) dependencies, impact the net gain as well. Our theoretical analysis emphasizes critical considerations for optimizing SNR per unit time in clinical MRS, even challenging the presumption that higher magnetic fields B0 always yield improved SNR per time unit of measurement time performance.</description>
