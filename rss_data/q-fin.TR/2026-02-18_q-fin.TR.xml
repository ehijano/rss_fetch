      <title>Autodeleveraging as Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15182</link>

Abstract: Autodeleveraging (ADL) is a last-resort loss socialization mechanism used by perpetual futures venues when liquidation and insurance buffers are insufficient to restore solvency. Despite the scale of perpetual futures markets, ADL has received limited formal treatment as a sequential control problem. This paper provides a concise formalization of ADL as online learning on a PNL-haircut domain: at each round, the venue selects a solvency budget and a set of profitable trader accounts. The profitable accounts are liquidated to cover shortfalls up to the solvency budget, with the aim of recovering exchange-wide solvency. In this model, ADL haircuts apply to positive PNL (unrealized gains), not to posted collateral principal. Using our online learning model, we provide robustness results and theoretical upper bounds on how poorly a mechanism can perform at recovering solvency. We apply our model to the October 10, 2025 Hyperliquid stress episode. The regret caused by Hyperliquid's production ADL queue is about 50\% of an upper bound on regret, calibrated to this event, while our optimized algorithm achieves about 2.6\% of the same bound. In dollar terms, the production ADL model over liquidates trader profits by up to \$51.7M. We also counterfactually evaluated algorithms inspired by our online learning framework that perform better and found that the best algorithm reduces overshoot to \$3M. Our results provide simple, implementable mechanisms for improving ADL in live perpetuals exchanges.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis of the Model-Free Valuation Approach: Hedging Gaps, Conservatism, and Trading Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the quality of model-free valuation approaches for financial derivatives by systematically evaluating the difference between model-free super-hedging strategies and the realized payoff of financial derivatives using historical option prices from several constituents of the S&amp;P 500 between 2018 and 2022.
  Our study allows in particular to describe the realized gap between payoff and model-free hedging strategy empirically so that we can quantify to which degree model-free approaches are overly conservative. Our results imply that the model-free hedging approach is only marginally more conservative than industry-standard models such as the Heston-model while being model-free at the same time.
  This finding, its statistical description and the model-independence of the hedging approach enable us to construct an explicit trading strategy which, as we demonstrate, can be profitably applied in financial markets, and additionally possesses the desirable feature with an explicit control of its downside risk due to its model-free construction preventing losses pathwise.</description>

      <title>Autodeleveraging: Impossibilities and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autodeleveraging (ADL) is a last-resort loss socialization mechanism for perpetual futures venues. It is triggered when solvency-preserving liquidations fail. Despite the dominance of perpetual futures in the crypto derivatives market, with over \$60 trillion of volume in 2024, there has been no formal study of ADL. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous model of ADL. We prove that ADL mechanisms face a fundamental \emph{trilemma}: no policy can simultaneously satisfy exchange \emph{solvency}, \emph{revenue}, and \emph{fairness} to traders. This impossibility theorem implies that as participation scales, a novel form of \emph{moral hazard} grows asymptotically, rendering `zero-loss' socialization impossible. On the positive side, we show that three classes of ADL mechanisms can optimally navigate this trilemma to provide fairness, robustness to price shocks, and maximal exchange revenue. We analyze these mechanisms on the Hyperliquid dataset from October 10, 2025, when ADL was used repeatedly to close \$2.1 billion of positions in 12 minutes. By comparing production ADL to transparent benchmark allocations, we find that Hyperliquid's production algorithm overshot the minimum trader profit haircut required to cover the shortfall. Our methodology suggests the excess profits lost by profitable traders is between \$45.0M and \$51.7M. In terms of the positions liquidated, this corresponds to roughly \$653.6M of positions being closed. This comparison also suggests that Binance overutilized ADL far more than Hyperliquid. Our results show both theoretically and empirically that optimized ADL mechanisms can dramatically reduce losses of trader profitability while maintaining exchange solvency.</description>
