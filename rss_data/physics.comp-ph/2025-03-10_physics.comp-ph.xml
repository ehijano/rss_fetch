      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models to Address Data Scarcity in Machine Learning: Applications in Graphene Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning in materials science faces challenges due to limited experimental data, as generating synthesis data is costly and time-consuming, especially with in-house experiments. Mining data from existing literature introduces issues like mixed data quality, inconsistent formats, and variations in reporting experimental parameters, complicating the creation of consistent features for the learning algorithm. Additionally, combining continuous and discrete features can hinder the learning process with limited data. Here, we propose strategies that utilize large language models (LLMs) to enhance machine learning performance on a limited, heterogeneous dataset of graphene chemical vapor deposition synthesis compiled from existing literature. These strategies include prompting modalities for imputing missing data points and leveraging large language model embeddings to encode the complex nomenclature of substrates reported in chemical vapor deposition experiments. The proposed strategies enhance graphene layer classification using a support vector machine (SVM) model, increasing binary classification accuracy from 39% to 65% and ternary accuracy from 52% to 72%. We compare the performance of the SVM and a GPT-4 model, both trained and fine-tuned on the same data. Our results demonstrate that the numerical classifier, when combined with LLM-driven data enhancements, outperforms the standalone LLM predictor, highlighting that in data-scarce scenarios, improving predictive learning with LLM strategies requires more than simple fine-tuning on datasets. Instead, it necessitates sophisticated approaches for data imputation and feature space homogenization to achieve optimal performance. The proposed strategies emphasize data enhancement techniques, offering a broadly applicable framework for improving machine learning performance on scarce, inhomogeneous datasets.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Analysis of Woven Composites Using Hierarchical Physically Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiscale homogenization of woven composites requires detailed micromechanical evaluations, leading to high computational costs. Data-driven surrogate models based on neural networks address this challenge but often suffer from big data requirements, limited interpretability, and poor extrapolation capabilities. This study introduces a Hierarchical Physically Recurrent Neural Network (HPRNN) employing two levels of surrogate modeling. First, Physically Recurrent Neural Networks (PRNNs) are trained to capture the nonlinear elasto-plastic behavior of warp and weft yarns using micromechanical data. In a second scale transition, a physics-encoded meso-to-macroscale model integrates these yarn surrogates with the matrix constitutive model, embedding physical properties directly into the latent space. Adopting HPRNNs for both scale transitions can avoid nonphysical behavior often observed in predictions from pure data-driven recurrent neural networks and transformer networks. This results in better generalization under complex cyclic loading conditions. The framework offers a computationally efficient and explainable solution for multiscale modeling of woven composites.</description>

      <title>Quantum generative adversarial networks for gluon initiated jets generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to offer significant advantages over classical computing, making it a promising avenue for exploring alternative methods in High Energy Physics (HEP) simulations. This work presents the implementation of a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (qGAN) to simultaneously generate gluon-initiated jet images for both ECAL and HCAL detector channels, a task crucial for high-energy physics simulations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The results demonstrate high fidelity in replicating energy deposit patterns and preserving the implicit training data features. This study marks the first step toward generating multi-channel pictures and quark-initiated jet images using quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Vertex Effects: Time-Dependent Interaction Kernel with Correlated Multi-Excitons in the Bethe-Salpeter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on a beyond-GW many-body framework that incorporates higher-order vertex effects in the self-energy - giving rise to T-matrix and second-order exchange contributions - this approach is extended to the kernel in the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) for the reducible polarization. This results in a frequency-dependent interaction kernel that naturally captures random phase approximation (RPA) effects, dynamical excitonic interactions, and the correlated propagation of multiple correlated electron-hole pairs that model multi- (including bi- and tri-) excitonic effects, relevant for nonlinear optics and high harmonic generation. These processes emerge from including the functional derivatives of the screening and vertex with respect to the Greens function in the vertex, enabling a fully ab initio, time-dependent treatment of correlation effects. By focusing on the reducible rather than irreducible polarization, this approach provides a computationally viable framework for capturing complex many-body interactions for calculating the self-energy, optical spectra and EELS. The resulting interaction kernel is relatively straightforward and clearly delineates the physical processes that are included and omitted. The method is expected to facilitate the integration of advanced many-body effects into state-of-the-art software packages, offering a universal and highly accurate framework for the description of sub-atomic correlations. Such advancements are crucial for the development of semiconductor, optoelectronic, superconducting and antimatter technologies, and ensuring that theoretical modeling evolves alongside exascale and accelerated computing.</description>

      <title>Suppressing grid instability and noise in particle-in-cell simulation by smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smoothing short-wavelength charge density variations can stabilize explicit electrostatic particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations against grid heating and cold beam instabilities, which cause unphysical heating when the Debye length is poorly resolved. We demonstrate this by solving the dispersion and by running 1D electrostatic PIC simulations, using an efficient smoothing algorithm that leverages the Poisson solve. To ensure stability, the smoothing radius must increase with the number of Debye lengths per cell. Smoothing also suppresses particle noise, which is severely exacerbated by poor resolution of the Debye length. To help determine optimal PIC configuration, we empirically characterize electric field noise, particle velocity diffusion, and unphysical energy exchanges in 1D PIC simulation, as a function of Debye-length resolution, smoothing, and particles per cell. We also show how PIC noise causes test particles to exhibit misleading behavior. Since smoothing reduces the effective resolution, the optimal cell size is less than the desired resolution but can be much greater than the Debye length, reducing computational expense.</description>

      <title>A sharp-interface discontinuous Galerkin method for simulation of two-phase flow of real gases based on implicit shock tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a high-order, sharp-interface method for simulation of two-phase flow of real gases using implicit shock tracking. The method is based on a phase-field formulation of two-phase, compressible, inviscid flow with a trivial mixture model. Implicit shock tracking is a high-order, optimization-based discontinuous Galerkin method that automatically aligns mesh faces with non-smooth flow features to represent them perfectly with inter-element jumps. It is used to accurately approximate shocks and rarefactions without stabilization and converge the phase-field solution to a sharp interface one by aligning mesh faces with the material interface. Time-dependent problems are formulated as steady problems in a space-time domain where complex wave interactions (e.g., intersections and reflections) manifest as space-time triplet points. The space-time formulation avoids complex re-meshing and solution transfer that would be required to track moving waves with mesh faces using the method of lines. The approach is applied to several two-phase flow Riemann problems involving gases with ideal, stiffened gas, and Becker-Kistiakowsky-Wilson (BKW) equations of state, including a spherically symmetric underwater explosion problem. In all cases, the method aligns element faces with all shocks (including secondary shocks that form at time t &gt; 0), rarefactions, and material interfaces, and accurately resolves the flow field on coarse space-time grids.</description>

      <title>Performance Portable Monte Carlo Neutron Transport in MCDC via Numba</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding a software engineering approach that allows for portability, rapid development, and open collaboration for high-performance computing on GPUs and CPUs is a challenge. We implement a portability scheme using the Numba compiler for Python in Monte Carlo / Dynamic Code (MC/DC), a new neutron transport application for rapidly developing Monte Carlo. Using this scheme, we have built MC/DC as an application that can run as a pure Python, compiled CPU, or compiled GPU solver. In GPU mode, we use Numba paired with an asynchronous GPU scheduler called Harmonize to increase GPU performance. We present performance results (including weak scaling up to 256 nodes) for a time-dependent problem on both CPUs and GPUs and compare favorably to a production C++ code.</description>

      <title>Combining Evolutionary Strategies and Novelty Detection to go Beyond the Alignment Limit of the $Z_3$ 3HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel Artificial Intelligence approach for Beyond the Standard Model parameter space scans by augmenting an Evolutionary Strategy with Novelty Detection. Our approach leverages the power of Evolutionary Strategies, previously shown to quickly converge to the valid regions of the parameter space, with a \emph{novelty reward} to continue exploration once converged. Taking the $Z_3$ 3HDM as our Physics case, we show how our methodology allows us to quickly explore highly constrained multidimensional parameter spaces, providing up to eight orders of magnitude higher sampling efficiency when compared with pure random sampling and up to four orders of magnitude when compared to random sampling around the alignment limit. In turn, this enables us to explore regions of the parameter space that have been hitherto overlooked, leading to the possibility of novel phenomenological realisations of the $Z_3$ 3HDM that had not been considered before.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised detection of semantic correlations in big data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world data, information is stored in extremely large feature vectors. These variables are typically correlated due to complex interactions involving many features simultaneously. Such correlations qualitatively correspond to semantic roles and are naturally recognized by both the human brain and artificial neural networks. This recognition enables, for instance, the prediction of missing parts of an image or text based on their context. We present a method to detect these correlations in high-dimensional data represented as binary numbers. We estimate the binary intrinsic dimension of a dataset, which quantifies the minimum number of independent coordinates needed to describe the data, and is therefore a proxy of semantic complexity. The proposed algorithm is largely insensitive to the so-called curse of dimensionality, and can therefore be used in big data analysis. We test this approach identifying phase transitions in model magnetic systems and we then apply it to the detection of semantic correlations of images and text inside deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>Temporal modulation on mixed convection in turbulent channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied flow organization and heat transfer properties in mixed turbulent convection within Poiseuille-Rayleigh-B\'enard channels subjected to temporally modulated sinusoidal wall temperatures. Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations were performed for Rayleigh numbers in the range $10^6 \leq Ra \leq 10^8$, a Prandtl number $Pr = 0.71$ and a bulk Reynolds number $Re_b \approx 5623$. We found that high-frequency wall temperature oscillations had minimal impact on flow structures, while low-frequency oscillations induced adaptive changes, forming stable stratified layers during cooling. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) analysis revealed a dominant streamwise unidirectional shear flow mode. Large-scale rolls oriented in the streamwise direction appeared as higher POD modes and were significantly influenced by lower-frequency wall temperature variations. Long-time-averaged statistics showed that the Nusselt number increased with decreasing frequency by up to 96\%, while the friction coefficient varied by less than 15\%. High-frequency modulation predominantly influenced near-wall regions, enhancing convective effects, whereas low frequencies reduced these effects via stable stratified layer formation. Phase-averaged statistics showed that high-frequency modulation resulted in phase-stable streamwise velocity and temperature profiles, while low-frequency modulation caused significant variations due to weakened turbulence. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) profiles remained high near the wall during both heating and cooling at high frequency, but decreased during cooling at low frequencies. A TKE budget analysis revealed that during heating, TKE production was dominated by shear near the wall and by buoyancy in the bulk region; while during cooling, the production, distribution and dissipation of TKE were all nearly zero.</description>

      <title>CrystalGRW: Generative Modeling of Crystal Structures with Targeted Properties via Geodesic Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining whether a candidate crystalline material is thermodynamically stable depends on identifying its true ground-state structure, a central challenge in computational materials science. We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials with an ultra-low temperature coefficient of resistivity are desired for the temperature and flow sensors in high-precision electronic measuring systems. In this work, the Kubo-Greenwood formula, implemented in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, is employed to predict the finite-temperature resistivity of multi-component alloys with severe lattice distortion. We observe a tiny change in resistivity over a wide temperature range in high-entropy alloys. The electronic resistivity invar effect in B2 Ni$_{25}$Co$_{25}$(HfTiZr)$_{50}$ Elinvar alloys results from a balance between intrinsic and residual resistivity. This effect is associated with atomic displacements from ideal lattice sites, which are caused by lattice thermal vibrations and chemical disorder-induced lattice distortions. It is further evidenced by a decrease in lattice distortion with temperature and changes in the electronic density of states.</description>

      <title>Wyckoff Transformer: Generation of Symmetric Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry rules that atoms obey when they bond together to form an ordered crystal play a fundamental role in determining their physical, chemical, and electronic properties such as electrical and thermal conductivity, optical and polarization behavior, and mechanical strength. Almost all known crystalline materials have internal symmetry. Consistently generating stable crystal structures is still an open challenge, specifically because such symmetry rules are not accounted for. To address this issue, we propose WyFormer, a generative model for materials conditioned on space group symmetry. We use Wyckoff positions as the basis for an elegant, compressed, and discrete structure representation. To model the distribution, we develop a permutation-invariant autoregressive model based on the Transformer and an absence of positional encoding. WyFormer has a unique and powerful synergy of attributes, proven by extensive experimentation: best-in-class symmetry-conditioned generation, physics-motivated inductive bias, competitive stability of the generated structures, competitive material property prediction quality, and unparalleled inference speed.</description>

      <title>Nuclear-electronic calculations need uncontracted basis sets on the quantum protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An attractive way to calculate nuclear quantum effects is to describe select nuclei quantum mechanically at the same level as the electrons, requiring the solution of coupled Schr\"odinger equations for the electrons and the quantum nuclei. This is commonly known as the nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) method, but it also has many other names. Two types of basis sets are required: a nuclear basis set is required in addition to the usual electronic basis set. In this work, we demonstrate that while existing nuclear basis sets are sufficient for NEO density-functional calculations, many sets producing proton affinities converged within 0.1 kcal/mol of the complete basis set limit, NEO calculations should always use uncontracted electronic basis sets on the quantum protons, since the contraction coefficients in typical electronic basis sets have been derived for point nuclear charge distributions. Uncontracting the basis sets on the quantized protons leads to significantly faster convergence to the basis set limit, leading to improvements of 18 kcal/mol and 10 kcal/mol in proton affinities employing double-$\zeta$ aug-pc-1 and triple-$\zeta$ aug-pc-2 electronic basis sets, respectively, with little effect on the computational effort. The partially uncontracted aug-pc-3 electronic basis set already affords proton affinities converged beyond 0.1 kcal/mol from the complete basis set limit. Similar results are also obtained with Dunning's correlation-consistent cc-pVXZ basis sets, as well as the Karlsruhe def2-XZP basis sets, albeit at a somewhat slower rate of convergence. As the protonic basis sets yield fully converged values, we find the protonic basis sets to be unnecessarily large for ground state density functional calculations, as the error in the protonic basis set is not balanced with that for typical electronic basis sets.</description>
