      <title>Planet-Disk Interactions and the Convective Overstability. I. Low Mass Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid inward migration driven by Type I torques threatens the survival of low-mass planets in their nascent protoplanetary disks (PPDs). Positive co-rotation torques offer a potential solution, but require viscous diffusion to remain unsaturated. However, it is unclear if (magneto)-hydrodynamic turbulence provides the necessary diffusion, and disk profiles supporting such torques are often also susceptible to the Convective Overstability (COS) for suitable gas cooling timescales. To this end, we investigate torques on low-mass planets through radially global 2D (razor-thin) and vertically unstratified 3D hydrodynamic simulations of PPDs with thermal diffusion and optically thin cooling. Our 3D models with thermal diffusion, which allows COS development, show systematically different torque behavior compared to 2D models, wherein COS is absent. In 3D, the COS saturates into large-scale, long-lived vortices that migrate radially and interact gravitationally with the embedded planet. When these vortices encounter the planet, they typically provide positive torque "kicks" counteracting inward migration, as the less-massive vortices are scattered onto horseshoe orbits by the more-massive planet. We validate our simulation methods against the theoretical framework of Paardekooper et al. (2011) and demonstrate that COS-induced torque modifications can extend migration timescales by factors of approximately 10. For plausible disk models, our results suggest that COS activity can lengthen migration timescales sufficiently to overlap with, or even exceed Super-Earth formation windows (0.1-5 Myr). In contrast, simulations with optically thin cooling do not show significant torque modifications, as COS saturates in near-axisymmetric structures without producing large-scale vortices for the disk models considered here.</description>

      <title>Molecular diagnostics for the mid-infrared emission of planet-forming disks. Carbon and oxygen elemental abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared observations of planet-forming disks reveal a wide diversity in molecular spectra. Carbon and oxygen abundances play a central role in setting the chemical environment of the inner disk and the spectral appearance. We aim to systematically explore how variations in elemental carbon and oxygen abundances affect the mid-infrared spectra of planet-forming disks, and to identify robust mid-infrared molecular diagnostics of C/H, O/H, and the C/O ratio. Using the thermochemical disk code ProDiMo and the line radiative transfer code FLiTs, we construct a grid of 25 models with varying carbon and oxygen abundances, covering a broad range of C/O ratios. We analyze the resulting mid-infrared molecular emission, including species such as $\rm H_2O$, $\rm CO$, $\rm CO_2$, $\rm C_2H_2$, $\rm OH$. We find that the mid-infrared molecular spectra are highly sensitive not only to the C/O ratio, but also to the absolute abundances of carbon and oxygen. Despite the same disk structure and C/O ratios, molecular fluxes (e.g., $\rm C_2H_2$, $\rm CO_2$) vary by more than an order of magnitude. This variation stems from the differences in excitation conditions and emitting regions caused by the elemental abundances of oxygen and carbon. We identify diagnostic molecular flux ratios - such as $\rm CO_2$/$\rm H_2O$ and $\rm H_2O$/$\rm C_2H_2$ - that can serve as tracers of C/H and O/H respectively. By combining these diagnostics, we demonstrate a method to infer the underlying C/O ratio. Our model grid provides a framework for interpreting mid-infrared molecular emission from disks, allowing estimates of elemental abundances if the disk properties and structure are known. Comparisons with recent JWST observations suggest that a variety in C and O abundances is seen in a sample of T Tauri disks, possibly shaped by disk transport processes and the presence of gaps.</description>

      <title>Diffusive Instabilities in Dusty Disks: Linear Growth and Nonlinear Breakdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the diffusive instability in dusty disks that arises when the dust mass diffusivity and/or viscosity decreases sufficiently steeply with increasing dust density. Our updated model includes an incompressible, viscous gas that responds azimuthally and couples to the dust through drag. We show that the basic criterion for diffusion-slope-driven instability remains approximately $\beta_\mathrm{diff}\lesssim -2$ for small dust stopping times, with gas feedback providing only modest quantitative changes for parameters motivated by streaming-instability turbulence. We perform nonlinear numerical calculations and confirm linear growth and mode selection toward the fastest-growing wavenumber. However, for power-law closures $D\propto\Sigma^{\beta_\mathrm{diff}}$ with $\beta_\mathrm{diff}&lt;0$, the nonlinear evolution does not saturate. Instead, steepening gradients amplify the nonlinear dust-pressure term and drive finite-time collapse into increasingly sharp spikes. Motivated by the absence of multidimensional saturation channels in our 1D framework, we test a simple piecewise closure in which the negative diffusion slope operates only over a finite density interval. This modification eliminates blowup and produces peak densities controlled by the imposed saturation scale. Our results support diffusive instabilities as a linear organizing mechanism in dusty turbulence, while highlighting that realistic nonlinear saturation requires additional physics beyond the present closure.</description>

      <title>Direct contact binary planetesimal formation from gravitational collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilobate contact binaries comprise a significant fraction of the relict Kuiper Belt, which includes the exemplary contact binary (486958) Arrokoth. The surfaces of its lobes contain similar amounts of highly volatile chemical species and few craters, indicating formation in a homogeneous and gentle environment. Arrokoth's bilobate shape was initially hypothesized to have formed via the direct gravitational collapse of a pebble cloud in the solar system's protoplanetary disk. However, alternative hypotheses have proposed that Arrokoth may be the result of binary planetesimal formation and the subsequent dynamical evolution of the binary components into contact through external perturbations over long timescales. Here, we show that contact binary planetesimals like Arrokoth can form directly from the gravitational collapse of pebble clouds. We used a soft-sphere discrete element method (SSDEM) to discover that planetesimals form a wide variety of shapes, including bilobate contact binaries. This method creates planetesimals as particle-aggregates with particles resting upon each other's surfaces via mutual surface penetration. The formation of contact binaries in our simulations strengthens the hypothesis that Arrokoth, and perhaps many other contact binaries in the Kuiper Belt, formed directly as bilobate objects from gravitational collapse, and so their shapes and surfaces record the era of planet formation.</description>

      <title>Three Saturn-mass Microlensing Planets Identified through Signals from Peripheral-caustic Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery and analysis of three microlensing planets identified through brief positive anomalies on the wings of their light curves. The events, KMT-2021-BLG-0852, KMT-2024-BLG-2005, and KMT-2025-BLG-0481, were detected in high-cadence survey data from the KMTNet, OGLE, MOA, and PRIME collaborations. The anomaly morphologies are consistent with major-image perturbations induced by planetary-mass companions located near the peripheral caustic. A systematic exploration of model degeneracies, including binary-source scenarios, higher mass-ratio binary lenses, and the inner--outer caustic degeneracy, firmly establishes the planetary origin of each signal. Measurements of the angular Einstein radius and event timescale, combined with Bayesian priors from a Galactic model, yield the physical parameters of each system. The hosts are low-mass stars (0.12--0.75~$M_\odot$), while the companions are Saturn-mass planets (0.16--0.59 $M_{\rm J}$) projected at separations of 1.1--7.8 au, placing them beyond the snowline of their hosts. These results demonstrate the capability of microlensing to detect and characterize cold giant planets around low-mass stars at kpc distances, populating the critical transition region between ice giants and gas giants.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of Lyapunov Times for Trans-Neptunian Objects and Main-Belt Asteroids: stability, accuracy, and methodological comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We computed Lyapunov times ($T_L$) for a sample of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) and outer main-belt asteroids (MBAs) using three numerical approaches: the variational method and two implementations of the renormalization technique. For each object, $T_L$ was derived both from the nominal orbit and from ensembles of 1001 orbital clones, enabling direct comparison between single-orbit and ensemble-based estimates. Across the sample, the methods generally produced consistent results, though larger discrepancies were observed for some MBAs. TNOs, in contrast, displayed greater consistency across methods, likely due to fewer overlapping resonances. Importantly, clone ensembles provided more robust and reliable stability indicators than nominal-orbit computations. Median values from clone populations reduced method-dependent biases and revealed dynamical behaviors that would remain hidden in single-orbit analyses, especially for objects with poorly constrained orbits or evolving in resonant regions. While our study focused on a limited but diverse set of objects, the methodology can be directly extended to larger populations, offering a systematic framework for exploring the long-term stability and dynamical evolution of main-belt asteroids, trans-Neptunian objects or other classes of objects in the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Deepest ever photographed Geminid with small but not negligible terminal mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an instrumental observation of the very exceptional Geminid fireball which was observed in scope of the Czech part of the European Fireball Network (EN) on 13 December 2012 at 4h12m59.4s UT. The uniqueness of this Geminid fireball consists of the record depth of its penetration in the atmosphere (to the height of 32.5 km) and in the fact that most likely a very small fraction of its initial mass survived severe deceleration in the atmosphere and landed on the ground. Such deeply penetrating Geminid with so precise and reliable data has not yet been observed. From a comparison with a large number of Geminids observed by the European Fireball Network and all brightest Geminids from the Prairie Fireball Network in USA and the Canadian MORP Network, we have shown that for Geminids with an entry mass greater than approximately 10 grams, the terminal altitude limit does not decrease further as it does for smaller Geminids, but remains constant at around 38 km. In this comparison, we have shown that there is only one exception, and that is the Geminid presented here. This one penetrated nearly 6 km deeper with very low terminal speed for Geminids. During the atmospheric flight this Geminid meteoroid slowed down from its original speed of 35.75 km/s to 6.8 km/s. This small meteoroid with initial mass of only 0.25 kg is probably the fastest candidate for a meteorite dropping event ever observed. This solid meteoroid belonging to the meteor shower survived a significant dynamic pressure of almost 2 MPa and thus ranks among the interplanetary bodies of asteroidal origin that caused the observed meteorite fall. Although a similar Geminid event has been previously presented in the literature, we demonstrate here that this claim was flawed.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Photolysis Rates with Socrates (24.11): Species for Earth and Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Socrates photolysis scheme, we present newly calculated photolysis rates under modern Earth atmospheric conditions for species directly relevant to Earth and species relevant to different atmospheric compositions. We compare to a previous photolysis comparison exercise, namely PhotoComp 2011. Overall, we find good agreement between our results and previous work, with discrepancies usually caused by the implementation of temperature or pressure dependent quantum yields and updated cross-section data. We provide a new set of benchmark photolysis rates for additional species both for Solar irradiance and when irradiated by an M dwarf host star. In general, the higher actinic flux at far-UV and shorter wavelengths of the M dwarf compared to the Sun drives increased photolysis rates for reactions with high threshold energies. This work provides an updated set of benchmark results for further studies of photolysis in the Earth's atmosphere and that of other planets.</description>

      <title>Meteor statistics I: The distribution of instrumental magnitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of meteor magnitudes is known to follow an exponential distribution, where the base of this distribution is called the population index. The distribution of observed magnitudes preserves this behavior, but is truncated by the detection threshold. If both the population index and detection threshold can be determined, observed meteor rates can be converted to fluxes and extrapolated to any desired brightness or size. We argue that the distribution of observed or instrumental meteor magnitudes is best modeled as an exponentially modified Gaussian (exGaussian) distribution. This is for three reasons: first, an exGaussian distribution is the natural result of random variations in detection threshold and/or post-detection measurement errors in magnitude. Second, an exGaussian distribution provides a better fit to the magnitude distribution than all other competing distributions in the literature; we demonstrate this using both a set of faint optical meteor magnitudes and a set of radar meteor echo amplitudes. Finally, the population index, mean detection threshold, and random variation/error terms are easily extracted from the best-fit parameters of an exGaussian distribution.</description>

      <title>Two warm sub-Saturn mass planets identified from the TESS Full Frame Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Characterization of warm giants is crucial to constrain giant planet formation and evolution. Measuring the mass and radius of these planets, combined with their moderated irradiation, allows us to estimate their planetary bulk composition, which is a key quantity to comprehend giant planet formation and structure. Aims. We present the discovery of two transiting warm giant planets orbiting solar-type stars from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which were characterized by further spectroscopic and photometric ground-based observations. Methods. We performed a joint analysis of photometric data with radial velocities to confirm and characterize TOI-883 b and TOI-899 b, two sub-Saturns orbiting solar-like stars. Results. TOI-883 b and TOI-899 b have masses of $0.123 \pm 0.012$ $M_J$ and $0.213 \pm 0.024$ $M_J$, radius of $0.604 \pm 0.028$ $R_J$ and $0.991 \pm 0.044$ $R_J$, periods of $10.06$ d and $12.85$ d and equilibrium temperature of $1086 \pm 19$ K and $1040 \pm 19$ K, respectively. Conclusions. While having similar masses, orbital periods and stellar host properties, these planets seem to have different internal compositions, which could point to distinct formation histories. Both planets are suitable targets for atmospheric studies to further constrain formation scenarios of planets in the Neptune-Saturn mass range</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Campaign Observations of a Young Solar-type Star, EK Draconis. III. Comparison between Starspot Mapping, Zeeman Doppler Imaging, and Multiwavelength Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent simultaneous multiwavelength observations of a nearby young solar-type star EK Dra in the optical, H$\alpha$ spectrum, and X-ray, have provided evidence for stellar prominence eruptions associated with superflares. The large prominence eruption is suggested to have been caused by a large mid-latitude spot on the polarity inversion lines near the stellar limb from the concurrent Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) and optical photometry by the TESS. In this study, we perform starspot mapping for the TESS data of EK Dra to investigate the relation of starspots and magnetic fields from the photometry and ZDI. We also explore the multiwavelength rotational variability ascribed to starspots and active regions for the TESS, B-band, H$\alpha$, and X-ray light curves. As a result, we find that (i) spot locations deduced from the TESS light curve are mostly consistent with the intensity map from the ZDI except for a polar spot, and (ii) the H$\alpha$ light curve exhibits clear periodicity with respect to the TESS light curve because the H$\alpha$ line is radiated around spots in the chromosphere. The X-ray light curve does not show such association probably because of multiple spots on high activity level and extended spatial structure of coronal active regions. The results provide clues to explore their association with stellar flares at different heights of active regions in chromospheric and coronal lines. Our study also enables us to quantify the stellar XUV radiation from the magnetic fields of active stars toward understanding atmospheric evolution of exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Comet-type periodic motions and their out-of-plane bifurcations in the Earth-Moon CR3BP: a computational symplectic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comet-type periodic orbits of the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) are periodic solutions that are generated from very large retrograde and direct circular Keplerian motions around the common center of mass of the primaries. In this paper we first provide an analytical proof of the existence of comet-type periodic orbits by using the classical Poincar\'e continuation method. Within this analytical approach, we also determine their Conley-Zehnder index, defined as a Maslov index using a crossing form. Then, by applying a standard corrector-predictor technique, we explore numerically the two families of comet orbits within the Earth-Moon CR3BP. We compute their stability indices, identify vertical self-resonant orbits up to multiplicity six, investigate the vertically bifurcated periodic solutions and discuss their orbital characteristics. Our main results we illustrate in form of bifurcation graphs, based on symplectic invariants, which provide a topological overview of the connections of the bifurcated branches, including bridge families.</description>

Abstract: A protostellar disk is threaded by a static magnetic field that is perpendicular to the disk-surface. The magnetic field acts to brake the protostellar disk and cause the disk material to move towards the protostar. General analytic equations are derived for the accretion speed, and mass accretion rate. Simplified analytic equations are also obtained for the disk energy dissipation, accretion timescale and the disk radial position plus disk surface density, as a function of time. In addition to providing physical insight, such equations might be useful as a check on computational models for protostar and protostellar disk formation.</description>

      <title>Novel Physics of Escaping Secondary Atmospheres May Shape the Cosmic Shoreline</title>

Abstract: Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of cool, rocky exoplanets reveal a probable lack of thick atmospheres, suggesting prevalent escape of the secondary atmospheres formed after losing primordial hydrogen. Yet, simulations indicate that hydrodynamic escape of secondary atmospheres, composed of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, requires intense fluxes of ionizing radiation (XUV) to overcome the effects of high molecular weight and efficient line cooling. This transonic outflow of hot, ionized metals (not hydrogen) presents a novel astrophysical regime ripe for exploration. We introduce an analytic framework to determine which planets retain or lose their atmospheres, positioning them on either side of the cosmic shoreline. We model the radial structure of escaping atmospheres as polytropic expansions - power-law relationships between density and temperature driven by local XUV heating. Our approach diagnoses line cooling with a three-level atom model and incorporates how ion-electron interactions reduce mean molecular weight. Crucially, hydrodynamic escape onsets for a threshold XUV flux dependent upon the atmosphere's gravitational binding. Ensuing escape rates either scale linearly with XUV flux when weakly ionized (energy-limited) or are controlled by a collisional-radiative thermostat when strongly ionized. Thus, airlessness is determined by whether the XUV flux surpasses the critical threshold during the star's active periods, accounting for expendable primordial hydrogen and revival by volcanism. We explore atmospheric escape from Young-Sun Mars and Earth, LHS 1140 b and c, and TRAPPIST-1 b. Our modeling characterizes the bottleneck of atmospheric loss on the occurrence of observable Earth-like habitats and offers analytic tools for future studies.</description>

      <title>TIC-65910228 b / NGTS-38 b, a 180 day transiting warm super-Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12977</link>

Abstract: We present the discovery of TIC-65910228 b / NGTS-38 b, a giant exoplanet with a radius of $1.081\pm0.047$ R$_\text{J}$ and a mass of $4.78_{-0.37}^{+0.40}$ M$_\text{J}$ on a long-period ($180.52791\pm0.00038$ day), moderately eccentric ($e=0.308\pm0.011$) orbit transiting a bright (V=$10.230\pm0.020$ mag) metal rich ([Fe/H]=$0.33\pm0.09$, 'dex') F6V-F7V type host star. The planet was initially detected from a single transit in TESS Sector 33. A photometric monitoring campaign of 228 nights with NGTS detected a transit egress of the planet, which together with spectroscopic radial velocity monitoring with CORALIE and HARPS identified an orbital period of ~180.5,d. These radial velocity measurements also showed the mass of the companion to be planetary. Additional transit observations coordinated by the TESS follow-up observing program allowed further confirmation and refinement of this period. With its relatively cool equilibrium temperature of $458\pm11$ K, NGTS-38 b joins a small but growing population of well characterised transiting warm-Jupiters and has one of the longest periods of any discovered to date. The target is situated in the LOPS2 field of the upcoming PLATO mission which will allow for greater refinement of the system parameters and potential for the discovery of additional companions too small and/or too long-period to be seen by TESS or NGTS. NGTS-38 b's bright host star and wide orbital separation make it an attractive target for further study, including potential measurement of its spin-orbit alignment or targeted exomoon/ring searches.</description>
