      <title>Magnetic diffusion in Solar atmosphere produces measurable electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient release of magnetic energy in astrophysical plasmas, such as during solar flares, can in principle be achieved through magnetic diffusion, at a rate determined by the associated electric field. However, attempts at measuring electric fields in the solar atmosphere are scarce, and none exist for sites where the magnetic energy is presumably released. Here, we present observations of an energetic event using the National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope, where we detect the polarization signature of electric fields associated with magnetic diffusion. We measure the linear and circular polarization across the hydrogen H-epsilon Balmer line at 397 nm at the site of a brightening event in the solar chromosphere. Our spectro-polarimetric modeling demonstrates that the observed polarization signals can only be explained by the presence of electric fields, providing conclusive evidence of magnetic diffusion, and opening a new window for the quantitative study of this mechanism in space plasmas.</description>

      <title>Visual Orbits of Wolf-Rayet Stars I: The Orbit of the dust-producing Wolf-Rayet binary WR\,137 measured with the CHARA Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Wolf-Rayet stars are the descendants of massive OB stars that have lost their hydrogen envelopes and are burning helium in their cores prior to exploding as type Ib/c supernovae. The mechanisms for losing their hydrogen envelopes are either through binary interactions or through strong stellar winds potentially coupled with episodic mass-loss. Amongst the bright classical WR stars, the binary system WR\,137 (HD\,192641; WC7d + O9e) is the subject of this paper. This binary is known to have a 13-year period and produces dust near periastron. Here we report on interferometry with the CHARA Array collected over a decade of time and providing the first visual orbit for the system. We combine these astrometric measurements with archival radial velocities to measure masses of the stars of $M_{\rm WR} = 9.5\pm3.4 M_\odot$ and $M_{\rm O} = 17.3\pm 1.9 M_\odot$ when we use the most recent \textit{Gaia} distance. These results are then compared to predicted dust distribution using these orbital elements, which match the observed imaging from \textit{JWST} as discussed recently by Lau et al. Furthermore, we compare the system to the BPASS models, finding that the WR star likely formed through stellar winds and not through binary interactions. However, the companion O star did likely accrete some material from the WR's mass-loss to provide the rotation seen today that drives its status as an Oe star.</description>

      <title>On the Acceleration of the Young Solar Wind from Different Source Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The acceleration of the young solar wind is studied using the first 17 encounters of Parker Solar Probe. We identify wind intervals from different source regions: coronal hole (CH) interiors, streamers, and low Mach number boundary layers (LMBLs), i.e. the inner boundaries of coronal holes. We present their statistical trends in the acceleration process. Most of the observations can be reproduced by a two-fluid hydrodynamic model with realistic corona temperatures. In such a model, the solar wind is accelerated by the combined thermal pressures of protons and electrons,but it is mainly the difference in the proton pressure that leads to the difference in the solar wind speed. The proton pressure is the highest in the fastest CH wind, with a high initial proton temperature that decreases slowly. It is lower in the relatively slow LMBL wind, and the lowest in the slowest streamer wind. The proton temperature is quadratically correlated with the wind speed when scaled to the same distance. In contrast, the electron temperature shows no significant differences for different wind types or wind speeds, indicating more similar contributions from the electron pressure. The model gives reasonable locations for the sonic critical point, which is on average at 3.6-7.3 solar radii and can also extend to large distances when the proton temperature is extremely low, as in the LMBL wind. In addition to the thermal pressure, we raise the possibility that Alfv\'en waves may contribute to the solar wind acceleration, especially for the fast CH wind.</description>

      <title>A New Approach of Data-driven Simulation and Its Application to Solar Active Region 12673</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar coronal magnetic field is a pivotal element in the study of eruptive phenomena, and understanding its dynamic evolution has long been a focal point in solar physics. Numerical models, driven directly by observation data, serve as indispensable tools in investigating the dynamics of the coronal magnetic field. This paper presents a new approach to electric field inversion, which involves modifying the electric field derived from the DAVE4VM velocity field using ideal Ohm's law. The time series of the modified electric field is used as a boundary condition to drive a MHD model, which is applied to simulate the magnetic field evolution of active region 12673. The simulation results demonstrate that our method enhances the magnetic energy injection through the bottom boundary, as compared with energy injection calculated directly from the DAVE4VM code, and reproduce of the evolution of the photospheric magnetic flux. The coronal magnetic field structure is also in morphological similarity to the coronal loops. This new approach will be applied to the high-accuracy simulation of eruption phenomena and provide more details on the dynamical evolution of the coronal magnetic field.</description>

      <title>A Study on the Nested Rings CME Structure Observed by the WISPR Imager Onboard Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the significance of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in space weather, a comprehensive understanding of their interior morphology remains a scientific challenge, particularly with the advent of many state-of-the-art solar missions such as Parker Solar Probe (Parker) and Solar Orbiter (SO). In this study, we present an analysis of a complex CME as observed by the Wide-Field Imager for Solar PRobe (WISPR) heliospheric imager during Parker's seventh solar encounter. The CME morphology does not fully conform with the general three-part density structure, exhibiting a front and core not significantly bright, with a highly structured overall configuration. In particular, its morphology reveals non-concentric nested rings, which we argue are a signature of the embedded helical magnetic flux rope (MFR) of the CME. For that, we analyze the morphological and kinematical properties of the nested density structures and demonstrate that they outline the projection of the three-dimensional structure of the flux rope as it crosses the lines of sight of the WISPR imager, thereby revealing the magnetic field geometry. Comparison of observations from various viewpoints suggests that the CME substructures can be discerned owing to the ideal viewing perspective, close proximity, and spatial resolution of the observing instrument.</description>

      <title>Solar Plasma Noise in TianQin Laser Propagation: An Extreme Case and Statistical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TianQin proposes to detect gravitational wave signals by using laser interferometry. However, laser propagation effect introduces a potential noise factor for TianQin. In this work, we used MHD simulations to obtain the space magnetic field and plasma distributions during an extremely strong solar eruption, and based on the magnetohydrodynamic simulation result, we investigate laser propagation noise for TianQin. For the extremely strong solar eruption event, we find that the laser propagation noise closely approaches 100\% of TianQin's displacement noise requirement for Michelson combination; While the laser propagation noise is still about 30\% of TianQin's displacement noise requirement for time-delay interferometry X combination. In addition, we investigate the laser propagation noise for 12 cases with different solar wind conditions. Our finding reveals a linear correlation between the laser propagation noise and several space weather parameters, e.g., solar wind dynamic pressure, Sym-H, and $D$st, where the correlation coefficients for solar wind dynamic pressure is strongest. Combining the cumulative distribution of solar wind dynamic pressure from 1999 to 2021 with the linear correlation between solar wind dynamic pressure and laser propagation noise, we have determined that the occurrence rate of the laser propagation noise to be greater than 30\% of TianQin's displacement noise requirement for Michelson combination over the entire solar activity week is about 15\%. In addition, we find that time-delay interferometry can suppress the laser propagation noise, and reduce the occurrence rate of the laser propagation noise exceeding 30\% of TianQin's requirement to less than 1\%.</description>

      <title>Convection, rotation, and magnetic activity of solar-like stars from asteroseismology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the last decade, our understanding of stellar physics and evolution has undergone a tremendous revolution thanks to asteroseismology. Space missions such as CoRoT, \kep, K2, and TESS have already been observing millions of stars providing high-precision photometric data. With these data, it is possible to study the convection of stars through the convective background in the power spectrum density of the light curves. The properties of the convective background or granulation has been shown to be correlated to the surface gravity of the stars. In addition, when we have enough resolution (so long enough observations) and a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the individual modes can be characterized in particular to study the internal rotational splittings and magnetic field of stars. Finally, the surface magnetic activity also impacts the amplitude and hence detection of the acoustic modes. This effect can be seen as a double-edged sword. Indeed, modes can be studied to look for magnetic activity changes. However, this also means that for stars too magnetically active, modes can be suppressed, preventing us from detecting them. In this talk, I will present some highlights on what asteroseismology has allowed us to better understand the convection, rotation, and magnetism of solar-like stars while opening doors to many more questions.</description>

      <title>Complex Network in Solar Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is an overview of studying the solar features in a complex network approach. First, we introduce the structural features of complex networks and important network parameters. Applying the detrended fluctuation and rescaled range analysis and nodes degree power-law distributions confirmed the non-randomness of the solar features complex networks. Using the HEALPix pixelization and considering all parts of the solar surface under the same conditions, as well as applying centrality parameters (the nodes with the highest connectivity, closeness, betweenness, and Pagerank) showed that the active areas on the solar surface were correctly identified and were consistent with observations. A review of the complex structure of the solar proton flux and active regions also showed that in these networks, the average clustering coefficient and Page-rank parameters are suitable criteria to use in event prediction methods. The complex network of sunspots has also shown that sunspots and sunspot groups are formed through complex nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>A study of the electrostatic properties of the interiors of low-mass stars: Possible implications for the observed rotational properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the partially ionized material of stellar interiors, the strongest forces acting on electrons and ions are the Coulomb interactions between charges. The dynamics of the plasma as a whole depend on the magnitudes of the average electrostatic interactions and the average kinetic energies of the particles that constitute the stellar material. An important question is how these interactions of real gases are related to the observable stellar properties. Specifically, the relationships between rotation, magnetic activity, and the thermodynamic properties of stellar interiors are still not well understood.
  In this study, we investigate the electrostatic effects within the interiors of low-mass main sequence (MS) stars. Specifically, we introduce a global quantity, a global plasma parameter, which allows us to compare the importance of electrostatic interactions across a range of low-mass theoretical models ($0.7 - 1.4 \, M_\odot$) with varying ages and metallicities. We then correlate the electrostatic properties of the theoretical models with the observable rotational trends on the MS. We use the open-source 1D stellar evolution code MESA to compute a grid of main-sequence stellar models. Our models span the $\log g - T_{\text{eff}}$ space of a set of 66 Kepler main-sequence stars.
  We identify a correlation between the prominence of electrostatic effects in stellar interiors and stellar rotation rates. The variations in the magnitude of electrostatic interactions with age and metallicity further suggest that understanding the underlying physics of the collective effects of plasma can clarify key observational trends related to the rotation of low-mass stars on the MS. These results may also advance our understanding of the physics behind the observed weakened magnetic braking in stars.</description>

      <title>Study of the excitation of large amplitude oscillations in a prominence by nearby flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large amplitude oscillations commonly occur in solar prominences, triggered by energetic phenomena such as jets and flares. On March 14-15, 2015, a filament partially erupted in two stages, leading to oscillations in different parts. This study explores longitudinal oscillations from the eruption, focusing on the mechanisms behind their initiation, with special attention to the large oscillation on March 15. The oscillations and jets are analyzed using the time-distance technique. For flares and their interaction with the filament, we analyze AIA channels and use the DEM technique. Initially, a jet fragments the filament, splitting it into two segments. One remains in place, while the other detaches and moves. This causes oscillations in both segments: (a) the position change causes the detached segment to oscillate with a period of $69 \pm 3$ minutes; (b) the jet flows cause the remaining filament to oscillate with a period of $62 \pm 2$ minutes. In the second phase, on March 15, another jet seemingly activates the detached filament eruption, followed by a flare. A large longitudinal oscillation occurs in the remnant segment with a period of $72 \pm 2$ minutes and velocity amplitude $73 \pm 1 \, \mathrm{km s^{-1}}$. During the oscillation trigger, bright field lines connect the flare with the filament, appearing only in the AIA 131$\r{A}$ and 94$\r{A}$ channels, indicating the presence of hot plasma. DEM analysis confirms this, showing plasma around 10 MK pushing the prominence from its southeastern side, displacing it along the field lines and starting the oscillation. From this, the flare -- not the preceding jet-triggers the oscillation. The hot plasma flows into the filament channel. We explain how flares trigger large oscillations in filaments by proposing that post-flare loops reconnect with the filament channel's magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Stripped helium-star and compact object binaries in coeval populations -- predictions based on detailed binary evolution models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10283v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars mainly form in close binaries, where their mutual interactions can profoundly alter their evolutionary paths. Evolved binaries consisting of a massive OB-type main-sequence star with a stripped helium star or a compact companion represent a crucial stage in the evolution towards double compact objects, whose mergers are (potentially) detectable via gravitational waves. The recent detection of X-ray quiet OB+black hole binaries and OB+stripped helium star binaries has set the stage for discovering more of these systems in the near future. In this work, based on 3670 detailed binary-evolution models and using empirical distributions of initial binary parameters, we compute the expected population of such evolved massive binaries in coeval stellar populations, including stars in star clusters and in galaxies with starburst activities, for ages up to 100 Myr. Our results are vividly illustrated in an animation that shows the evolution of these binaries in the color-magnitude diagram over time. We find that the number of OB+black hole binaries peaks around 10 Myr, and OB+neutron star binaries are most abundant at approximately 20 Myr. Both black holes and neutron stars can potentially be found in populations with ages up to 90 Myr. Additionally, we analyze the properties of such binaries at specific ages. We find that OB+helium stars and OB+black hole binaries are likely to be identifiable as single-lined spectroscopic binaries. Our research serves as a guide for future observational efforts to discover such binaries in young star clusters and starburst environments.</description>

      <title>Proton ingestion in asymptotic giant branch stars as a possible explanation for J-type stars and AB2 grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: J-type stars are a subclass of carbon stars that are generally Li-rich, not enriched in s-elements, and have low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios. They were suggested to be the manufacturers of the pre-solar grains of type AB2 (having low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and supersolar $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N). In this Letter, we investigate the possibility that J-type stars are early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that experienced a proton ingestion event (PIE). We used the stellar evolution code STAREVOL to compute AGB stellar models with initial masses of 1, 2, and 3 $M_{\odot}$ and metallicities [Fe/H] $= -0.5$ and 0.0. We included overshooting above the thermal pulse and used a network of 1160 nuclei coupled to the transport equations. In solar-metallicity AGB stars, PIEs can be triggered if a sufficiently high overshoot is considered. These events lead to low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios, high Li abundances, and no enrichment in s-elements. We find that the $2-3$ $M_{\odot}$ AGB models experiencing a PIE can account for most of the observational features of J-type stars and AB2 grains. The remaining tensions between models and observations are (1) the low $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio of some AB2 grains and of 2 out of 13 J-type stars, (2) the high $^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al of some AB2 grains, and (3) the J-type stars with A(Li) $&lt;2$. Extra mixing mechanisms can alleviate some of these tensions, such as thermohaline or rotation. This work highlights a possible match between AGB stellar models that undergo a PIE and J-type stars and AB2 grains. To account for other types of carbon stars, such as N-type stars, PIEs should only develop in a fraction of solar-metallicity AGB stars. Additional work is needed to assess how the occurrence of PIEs depends on mixing parameters and initial conditions, and therefore to further confirm or exclude the proposed scenario.</description>

      <title>Blue straggler stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blue straggler stars are unique main-sequence stars that appear more luminous, hotter, and therefore younger, than their coeval counterparts. In star clusters, these stars are located above the cluster turn-off in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram or color-magnitude diagram. First identified in the 1950s, these stars are found across diverse environments, from sparse galactic fields to dense star clusters. They are crucial for understanding stellar and binary evolution and star cluster dynamics. Despite extensive research, many challenges concerning their properties and origin mechanisms remain unresolved. This chapter delves into the properties and origins of blue stragglers, examining how theoretical tools are employed to study them and the implications of each proposed formation mechanism. We assess how contemporary observational data either support or challenge these theoretical predictions. Continued theoretical and observational efforts are essential for advancing our understanding of these enigmatic stars.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet extinction correlation with 3D dust maps using white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate astrometric and photometric measurements from Gaia have led to the construction of 3D dust extinction maps which can now be used for estimating the integrated extinctions of Galactic sources located within 5 kpc. These maps based on optical observations may not be reliable for use in the ultraviolet (UV) which is more sensitive to reddening. Past studies have focused on studying UV extinction using main-sequence stars but lack comparison with 3D dust maps. White dwarfs with well-modeled hydrogen-dominated (DA) atmospheres provide an advantage over main-sequence stars affected by magnetic activity. In this work, we study the variation of UV extinction with 3D dust maps utilising HST and GALEX observations of DA white dwarfs located within 300 pc. We used HST COS spectroscopic data of 76 sight lines to calculate the optical extinction from Si II column densities and validate our results with the kinematic model predictions of the local interstellar medium. Also, we combined GALEX and Gaia photometric observations of 1158 DA white dwarfs to study UV reddening by comparing observed and modeled colour-colour relations. We calculated GALEX non-linearity corrections and derived reddening coefficients (R(NUV-G) = 6.52 +/- 1.53 and R(FUV-G) = 6.04 +/- 2.41) considering their variations with optical extinction (Av &lt; 0.1 mag), and found them to be in good agreement with known extinction laws. HST analysis suggests a positive bias of 0.01-0.02 mag in the optical extinction from 3D maps depending on the Galactic latitude. These results independently confirm the validity of 3D dust maps to deredden the optical and UV observations of white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>A possible formation scenario of the Gaia BH1: inner binary merger in triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on astrometric measurements and spectral analysis from $Gaia$ DR3, two quiescent black hole (BH) binaries, $Gaia$ BH1 and BH2, have been identified. Their origins remain controversial, particularly for $Gaia$ BH1. By considering a rapidly rotating ($\omega/\omega_{\rm crit} = 0.8$) and strongly magnetized ($B_{\rm 0} = 5000$ G) merger product, we find that, at typical Galactic metallicity, the merger product can undergo efficient chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE). This results in the merger product having a significantly smaller radius during its evolution compared to that of a normally evolving massive star. Under the condition that the initial triple stability is satisfied, we use the Multiple Stellar Evolution (MSE) code and the MESA code to identify an initial hierarchical triple that can evolve into $Gaia$ BH1. It initially consists of three stars with masses of 9.03 $M_{\odot}$, 3.12 $M_{\odot}$, and 1 $M_{\odot}$, with inner and outer orbital periods of 2.21 days and 121.92 days, and inner and outer eccentricities of 0.41 and 0.45, respectively. This triple initially experiences triple evolution dynamics instability (TEDI) followed by Roche lobe overflow (RLOF). During RLOF, the inner orbit shrinks, and tidal effects gradually suppress the TEDI. Eventually, the inner binary undergoes a merger through contact (or collision). Finally, using models of rapidly rotating and strongly magnetic stars, along with standard core-collapse supernova (SN) or failed supernova (FSN) models, we find that a PMB consisting of an 12.11 $M_{\odot}$ merger product and a 1 $M_{\odot}$ companion star (originally an outer tertiary) can avoid RLOF. After a SN or FSN with a low ejected mass of $\sim$0.22 $M_{\odot}$ and a low kick velocity ($46^{+25}_{-33}$ ${\rm km/s}$ or $9^{+16}_{-8}$ ${\rm km/s}$), the PMB can form $Gaia$ BH1 in the Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>Monitoring the daily variation of Sun-Earth magnetic fields using galactic cosmic rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) between the Sun and Earth is an extension of the solar magnetic field carried by the solar wind into interplanetary space. Monitoring variations in the IMF upstream of the Earth would provide very important information for the prediction of space weather effects, such as effects of solar storms and the solar wind, on human activity. In this study, the IMF between the Sun and Earth was measured daily for the first time using a cosmic-ray observatory. Cosmic rays mainly consist of charged particles that are deflected as they pass through a magnetic field.Therefore, the cosmic-ray Sun shadow, caused by high-energy charged cosmic rays blocked by the Sun and deflected by the magnetic field, can be used to explore the transverse IMF between the Sun and Earth. By employing the powerful kilometer-square array at the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory, the cosmic-ray Sun shadows were observed daily with high significance for the first time. The displacement of the Sun shadow measured in 2021 correlates well with the transverse IMF component measured in situ by spacecraft near the Earth, with a time lag of 3:31 $\pm$ 0:12 days. The displacement of the Sun shadow was also simulated using Parker's classic IMF model, yielding a time lag of 2:06 $\pm$ 0:04 days. This deviation may provide valuable insights into the magnetic field structure, which can improve space weather research.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI Observations of Newly Formed Dust in the Cold, Dense Shell of the Type IIn SN 2005ip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), specifically Type IIP SNe, has been suggested to be a significant source of the dust observed in high-redshift galaxies. CCSNe eject large amounts of newly formed heavy elements, which can condense into dust grains in the cooling ejecta. However, infrared (IR) observations of typical CCSNe generally measure dust masses that are too small to account for the dust production needed at high redshifts. Type IIn SNe, classified by their dense circumstellar medium (CSM), are also known to exhibit strong IR emission from warm dust, but the dust origin and heating mechanism have generally remained unconstrained because of limited observational capabilities in the mid-IR. Here, we present a JWST/MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) spectrum of the Type IIn SN 2005ip nearly 17 years post-explosion. The Type IIn SN 2005ip is one of the longest-lasting and most well-studied SNe observed to date. Combined with a Spitzer mid-IR spectrum of SN 2005ip obtained in 2008, this data set provides a rare 15-year baseline, allowing for a unique investigation of the evolution of dust. The JWST spectrum shows a new high-mass dust component ($\gtrsim0.08$ M$_{\odot}$) that is not present in the earlier Spitzer spectrum. Our analysis shows dust likely formed over the past 15 years in the cold, dense shell (CDS), between the forward and reverse shocks. There is also a smaller mass of carbonaceous dust ($\gtrsim0.005$ M$_{\odot}$) in the ejecta. These observations provide new insights into the role of SN dust production, particularly within the CDS, and its potential contribution to the rapid dust enrichment of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>A Candidate High-Velocity Exoplanet System in the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of adaptive optics (AO) images from the Keck-I telescope of the microlensing event MOA-2011-BLG-262. The original discovery paper by Bennett et al. 2014 reports two distinct possibilities for the lens system; a nearby gas giant lens with an exomoon companion or a very low mass star with a planetary companion in the galactic bulge. The $\sim$10 year baseline between the microlensing event and the Keck follow-up observations allows us to detect the faint candidate lens host (star) at $K = 22.3$ mag and confirm the distant lens system interpretation. The combination of the host star brightness and light curve parameters yields host star and planet masses of $M_{\rm host} = 0.19 \pm 0.03M_{\odot}$ and $m_p = 28.92 \pm 4.75M_{\oplus}$ at a distance of $D_L = 7.49 \pm 0.91\,$kpc. We perform a multi-epoch cross reference to \textit{Gaia} DR3 and measure a transverse velocity for the candidate lens system of $v_L = 541.31 \pm 65.75$ km s$^{-1}$. We conclude this event consists of the highest velocity exoplanet system detected to date, and also the lowest mass microlensing host star with a confirmed mass measurement. The high-velocity nature of the lens system can be definitively confirmed with an additional epoch of high-resolution imaging at any time now. The methods outlined in this work demonstrate that the \textit{Roman} Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) will be able to securely measure low-mass host stars in the bulge.</description>

      <title>Formation of Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects through photoerosion of fragmenting cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of tens of Jupiter-mass binary objects (JuMBOs) in the Orion Nebula Cluster with the James Webb Space Telescope has intensified the debate on the origin of free-floating planetary mass objects within star-forming regions. The JuMBOs have masses below the opacity limit for fragmentation, but have very wide separations (10s - 100s au), suggesting that they did not form in a similar manner to other substellar mass binaries. Here, we propose that the theory of photoerosion of prestellar cores by Lyman continuum radiation from massive stars could explain the JuMBOs in the ONC. We find that for a range of gas densities the final substellar mass is comfortably within the JuMBO mass range, and that the separations of the JuMBOs are consistent with those of more massive (G- and A-type) binaries, that would have formed from the fragmentation of the cores had they not been photoeroded. The photoerosion mechanism is most effective within the HII region(s) driven by the massive star(s). The majority of the observed JuMBOs lie outside of these regions in the ONC, but may have formed within them and then subsequently migrated due to dynamical evolution.</description>

      <title>Extending the cosmic distance ladder two orders of magnitude with strongly lensed Cepheids, carbon AGB, and RGB stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme magnification of stars near the caustics of clusters allow to detect individual luminous stars at high redshift. We show how deep exposures of caustic crossing galaxies at $z\lesssim1$ with IR telescopes such as JWST, can detect non-explosive distance calibrators, such as Cepheids, carbon stars in the asymptotic giant branch or stars in the tip of the red giant branch. A large number of such detections, combined with careful modelling of the magnification affecting these stars (including microlensing), opens the door to using them as alternative standard candles to SNe in a redshift range that would extend the cosmic distance ladder two orders of magnitude for these distance calibrators. As a bonus, strongly lensed stars detected in deep exposures provide also a robust method of mapping small dark matter substructures since they cluster around the critical curves of small scale dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>The JWST-NIRCam View of Sagittarius C. I. Massive Star Formation and Protostellar Outflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)-NIRCam observations of the massive star-forming molecular cloud Sagittarius C (Sgr C) in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). In conjunction with ancillary mid-IR and far-IR data, we characterize the two most massive protostars in Sgr C via spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, estimating that they each have current masses of $m_* \sim 20\:M_\odot$ and surrounding envelope masses of $\sim 100\:M_\odot$. We report a census of lower-mass protostars in Sgr C via a search for infrared counterparts to mm continuum dust cores found with ALMA. We identify 88 molecular hydrogen outflow knot candidates originating from outflows from protostars in Sgr C, the first such unambiguous detections in the infrared in the CMZ. About a quarter of these are associated with flows from the two massive protostars in Sgr C; these extend for over 1 pc and are associated with outflows detected in ALMA SiO line data. An additional $\sim 40$ features likely trace shocks in outflows powered by lower-mass protostars throughout the cloud. We report the discovery of a new star-forming region hosting two prominent bow shocks and several other line-emitting features driven by at least two protostars. We infer that one of these is forming a high-mass star given an SED-derived mass of $m_* \sim 9\:M_\odot$ and associated massive ($\sim 90\:M_\odot$) mm core and water maser. Finally, we identify a population of miscellaneous Molecular Hydrogen Objects (MHOs) that do not appear to be associated with protostellar outflows.</description>

      <title>Measuring Star Formation Histories from Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars: A Demonstration in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how near infrared (NIR) imaging of resolved luminous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars can be used to measure well-constrained star formation histories (SFHs) across cosmic time. Using UKIRT J and K-band imaging of M31, we first show excellent agreement over the past $\sim8$ Gyr between the PHAT SFH of M31's outer disk derived from a deep optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD; $\sim3.3\times10^{7}$ stars with $M_{F814W} \lesssim +2$), and our spatially-matched SFH based only on modeling AGB stars on a NIR CMD ($\sim2.3\times10^{4}$ stars with $M_{J} \lesssim -5$). We find that only hundreds of AGB stars are needed for reliable SFH recovery, owing to their excellent age sensitivity in the NIR. We then measure the spatially resolved SFH of M31's inner stellar halo ($D_{M31, projected} \sim20-30$ kpc) using $\sim10^5$ AGB stars. We find: (i) a dominant burst of star formation across M31's inner stellar halo from $4-5$ Gyr ago and lower level, spatially distributed star formation $\sim1-2$ Gyr ago; (ii) a younger 'quenching time' in the vicinity of NGC 205 ($\sim1$ Gyr ago) than near M32 ($\sim1.1$ Gyr ago); (iii) $M_{\star}\sim4\pm0.5\times10^9 M_{\odot}$ formed over the past $\sim8$ Gyr. We discuss some caveats and the enormous potential of resolved AGB stars in the NIR for measuring SFHs back to ancient epochs ($\sim13$ Gyr ago) in galaxies to large distances ($D\gtrsim20$ Mpc) with JWST, Roman, and Euclid.</description>

      <title>The formation and survival of the Milky Way's oldest stellar disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It remains a mystery when our Milky Way first formed a stellar disk component that survived and maintained its disk structure from subsequent galaxy mergers. We present a study of the age-dependent structure and star formation rate of the Milky Way's disk using high-alpha stars with significant orbital angular momentum that have precise age determinations. Our results show that the radial scale length is nearly independent of age, while the vertical scale height experienced dramatic evolution. A disk-like geometry presents even for populations older than 13 Gyr, with the scale height-to-length ratio dropping below 0.5 for populations younger than 12.5 Gyr. We dub the oldest population that has maintained a disk geometry - apparently formed over 13 Gyr ago - PanGu. With an estimated present-day stellar mass of $2 \times 10^9$ $M_\odot$, PanGu is presumed to be a major stellar component of our Galaxy in the earliest epoch. The total present-day stellar mass of the whole high-alpha disk is $2 \times 10^{10}$ $M_\odot$, mostly formed during a distinct star formation rate peak of 11 $M_\odot$ per year around 11 Gyrs ago. A comparison with Milky Way analogs in the TNG50 simulations implies that our Galaxy has experienced an exceptionally quiescent dynamical history, even before the Gaia-Enceladus merger.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRSpec Observations of Brown Dwarfs in the Orion Nebula Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have used the multiobject mode of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to obtain low-resolution 1-5um spectra of 22 brown dwarf candidates in the Orion Nebula Cluster, which were selected with archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope. One of the targets was previously classified as a Herbig-Haro (HH) object and exhibits strong emission in H I, H2, and the fundamental band of CO, further demonstrating that HH objects can have bright emission in that CO band. The remaining targets have late spectral types (M6.5 to early L) and are young based on gravity sensitive features, as expected for low-mass members of the cluster. According to theoretical evolutionary models, these objects should have masses that range from the hydrogen burning limit to 0.003-0.007 Msun. Two of the NIRSpec targets were identified as proplyds in earlier analysis of Hubble images. They have spectral types of M6.5 and M7.5, making them two of the coolest and least massive known proplyds. Another brown dwarf shows absorption bands at 3-5um from ices containing H2O, CO2, OCN-, and CO, indicating that it is either an edge-on class II system or a class I protostar. It is the coolest and least massive object that has detections of these ice features. In addition, it appears to be the first candidate for a protostellar brown dwarf that has spectroscopy confirming its late spectral type.</description>

      <title>The Stellar Abundances and Galactic Evolution Survey (SAGES) III -- The g/r/i-band Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stellar Abundances and Galactic Evolution Survey (SAGES) is a multi-band survey that covers the northern sky area of ~12000 deg2. Nanshan One-meter Wide-field Telescope (NOWT) of Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory (XAO) carried out observations on g/r/i bands. We present here the survey strategy, data processing, catalog construction, and database schema. The observations of NOWT started in 2016 August and was completed in 2018 January, total 17827 frames were obtained and ~4600 deg2 sky areas were covered. In this paper, we released the catalog of the data in the g/r/i bands observed with NOWT. In total, there are 109,197,578 items of the source records. The catalog is the supplement for the SDSS for the bright end, and the combination of our catalog and these catalogs could be helpful for source selections for other surveys and the Milky Way sciences, e.g., white dwarf candidates and stellar flares.</description>

      <title>Searching for similarities in the accretion flow of Seyfert 1 galaxies and cataclysmic variables based on flare profiles of IRAS 13224-3809, 1H 0707-495, Mrk 766 and MV Lyr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AIMS: We studied fast variability of three selected AGNs, IRAS 13224-3809, 1H 0707-495 and Mrk 766, and the cataclysmic variable MV Lyr observed by XMM-Newton and Kepler spacecrafts, respectively. Our goal is to search for common origin of the variability and to test the so-called sandwich model where a geometrically thick corona is surrounding a geometrically thin disc. METHODS: We study substructures of the averaged flare profiles. The flare profile method identifies individual flares in the light curve, and averages them. Direct fitting of the profile substructures identify individual characteristic frequencies seen in standard power density spectra (PDS) as a break frequency or quasi-periodic oscillation. The credibility of flare profile substructures is demonstrated by comparison with autocorrelation function. RESULTS: We found that the flare profiles of AGNs are similar to that of the cataclysmic variable in the low state. We explain this as a consequence of a truncated inner disc in a sandwich model. The same scenario is also able to explain the presence of characteristic break frequencies in X-ray PDS, but not seen in optical. We also searched for substructures in the flare profile of IRAS 13224-3809. In addition to a permanently present main flare, we found transient side-lobe appearing before the main flare and only seen in a high flux period. This complex flare profile of this AGN suggests that an additional source of X-rays appears during the high flux period. We propose a scenario in which an accretion flow fluctuation enters the sandwich corona and propagates further to some very central part of the accretion disc.</description>

      <title>On the Low-Latitude Ionospheric Irregularities under Geomagnetically Active and Quiet Conditions using NavIC observables: A Spectral Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionospheric irregularities and associated scintillations under geomagnetically active/quiet conditions have detrimental effects on the reliability and performance of space- and ground-based navigation satellite systems, especially over the low-latitude region. The current work investigates the low-latitude ionospheric irregularities using the phase screen theory and the corresponding temporal Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis to present an estimate of the outer irregularity scale sizes over these locations. The study uses simultaneous L5 signal C/N$_o$ observations of NavIC (a set of GEO and GSO navigation satellite systems) near the northern crest of EIA (Indore: 22.52$^\circ$N, 75.92$^\circ$E, dip: 32.23$^\circ$N) and in between the crest and the dip equator (Hyderabad: 17.42$^\circ$N, 78.55$^\circ$E, dip: 21.69$^\circ$N). The study period (2017-2018) covers disturbed and quiet-time conditions in the declining phase of the solar cycle 24. The PSD analysis brings forward the presence of irregularities, of the order of a few hundred meters during weak-to-moderate and quiet-time conditions and up to a few km during the strong event, over both locations. The ROTI values validate the presence of such structures in the Indian region. Furthermore, only for the strong event, a time delay of scintillation occurrence over Indore, with values of 36 minutes and 50 minutes for NavIC satellites (PRNs) 5 and 6, respectively, from scintillation occurrence at Hyderabad is observed, suggesting a poleward evolution of irregularity structures. Further observations show a westward propagation of these structures on this day. This study brings forward the advantage of utilizing continuous data from the GEO and GSO satellite systems in understanding the evolution and propagation of the ionospheric irregularities over the low-latitude region.</description>

      <title>Candidates for Substellar Members of the Orion Nebula Cluster from JWST/NIRCam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) obtained 1-5um images of the center of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). I have analyzed these data in an attempt to search for substellar members of the cluster. Using a pair of color-color diagrams, I have identified &gt;200 brown dwarf candidates that lack spectral classifications. Some of the candidates could be protostars (either stellar or substellar) given their very red colors. Based on the age of the ONC and the photometry predicted by theoretical evolutionary models, the faintest candidates could have masses of 1-2 Mjup. This sample of candidates may prove to be valuable for studying various aspects of young brown dwarfs, including their mass function and minimum mass. However, spectroscopy is needed to confirm the membership (via signatures of youth) and late spectral types of the candidates. Finally, I note that most of the "Jupiter-mass binary objects" that have been previously identified with these JWST images are absent from my sample of candidates because their colors are indicative of reddened background sources rather than young brown dwarfs or their photometry is inadequate for assessing their nature because of very low signal-to-noise ratios and/or detections in only a few bands.</description>

      <title>Infrared Period-Luminosity-Metallicity Relations and the Evolution of Metallicity Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calibrate the period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relations of classical Cepheid (DCEP) in three near-infrared bands ($J$, $H$, $K_S$) and four mid-infrared bands ($W1$, $W2$, $[3.6]$ and $[4.5]$). The PLZ relations of $W1$ and $W2$ bands are calibrated for the first time. The distance moduli of the Large Magellanic Cloud estimated by these PLZ relations are in good agreement with the most accurate published value measured by geometric methods. These seven homogenous PLZ relations can aid in obtaining more robust distances for DCEPs. Applying our PLZ relations to trace the metallicity gradient of the Galactic disc, we find that the gradient for sources with logarithmic age less than 7.67 is almost fixed: $-0.056 \,\pm\, 0.002 \,\textrm{dex}\, \textrm{kpc}^{-1}$; the gradient for sources with logarithmic age greater than 7.67 is period-dependent (i.e., age-dependent): $(-0.074 \,\pm\, 0.003)+(-0.022 \,\pm\, 0.002)\log P)\,\textrm{dex}\, \textrm{kpc}^{-1}$. In addition, we find that DCEPs in the $R_{GC} \gtrsim 14.5\,\textrm{kpc}$ region tend to migrate toward the Galactic center, while DCEPs in the $10.5\,\textrm{kpc} \lesssim R_{GC} \lesssim 14.5\,\textrm{kpc}$ region tend to migrate toward the anti-Galactic center, which may be the reason for the obvious break of the metallicity gradient at $R_{GC} \thickapprox 14.5\,\textrm{kpc}$. We conclude that the evolution of the metallicity gradient of DCEPs may be related to their radial migration.</description>

      <title>Behaviors of Ca II K line in A-type stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.15152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A synthetic spectrum-fitting analysis was applied to the Ca II line at 3933.68 A for 122 A-type stars (7000 &lt;Te &lt; 10000 K) in a wide range of rotational velocity (10 &lt; vsini &lt; 300 km/s), in order to study the behaviors of Ca abundances ([Ca/H]39) determined from this Ca II 3934 line, especially in context of (i) how they are related with the Am phenomenon (often seen in slow rotators) and (ii) whether they are consistent with the Ca abundances ([Ca/H]61) derived from the weaker Ca I 6162 line. It was confirmed that Ca line strengths in Am stars tend to be weaker and associated abundances are lower compared to non-Am stars at the same Te, indicating a deficiency of Ca in the photosphere of Am stars. However, an appreciable fraction of cool Am stars (Te &lt; 8000 K) were found to show anomalous Ca II 3934 line feature (i.e., unusually broad for its weakness) which is hard to explain. Regarding the comparison between [Ca/H]39 and [Ca/H]61, while both are roughly consistent for hotter stars (Te &gt; 8000 K), the former tends to be lower (by up to -1 dex or even more) than the latter for cooler A stars (Te &lt; 8000 K) including those "weak broad K line" objects, This fact suggests that some special mechanism reducing the strength of Ca II 3934 line is involved at Te &lt; 8000 K where [Ca/H]39 would be no more reliable. Whereas atomic diffusion causing the deficit of Ca in the photosphere as a result of element segregation in the deeper radiative envelope may be regarded as a promising explanation because it seems to fit in the qualitative trend of [Ca/H]61 in A-type stars, the well-known feature of considerably weak Ca II K line in classical Am stars should not necessarily be attributed to only this element diffusion scenario, for which some unknown weakening mechanism specific to this resonance line may independently be operative.</description>

      <title>First Observation of the Complete Rotation Period of the Ultra-Slowly Rotating Magnetic O Star HD 54879</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: HD 54879 is the most recently discovered magnetic O-type star. Previous studies ruled out a rotation period shorter than 7 years, implying that HD 54879 is the second most slowly-rotating known magnetic O-type star. We report new high-resolution spectropolarimetric measurements of HD 54879, which confirm that a full stellar rotation cycle has been observed. We derive a stellar rotation period from the longitudinal magnetic field measurements of P = 2562+63-58 d (about 7.02 yr). The radial velocity of HD 54879 has been stable over the last decade of observations. We explore equivalent widths and longitudinal magnetic fields calculated from lines of different elements, and conclude the atmosphere of HD 54879 is likely chemically homogeneous, with no strong evidence for chemical stratification or lateral abundance nonuniformities. We present the first detailed magnetic map of the star, with an average surface magnetic field strength of 2954 G, and a strength for the dipole component of 3939 G. There is a significant amount of magnetic energy in the quadrupole components of the field (23%). Thus, we find HD 54879 has a strong magnetic field with a significantly complex topology.</description>

      <title>Flare-accelerated Electrons in the Kappa Distribution from X-Ray Spectra with the Warm-Target Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray observations provide important and valuable insights into the acceleration and propagation of nonthermal electrons during solar flares. Improved X-ray spectral analysis requires a deeper understanding of the dynamics of energetic electrons. Previous studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of accelerated electrons with a few thermal speeds are more complex than those with significantly higher speeds. To better describe the energetic electrons after injection, a model considering energy diffusion and thermalization effects in flare conditions (the warm-target model) has recently been developed for spectral analysis of hard X-rays. This model has demonstrated how the low-energy cutoff, which can hardly be constrained in cold-target modeling, can be determined. However, the power-law form may not be the most suitable representation of injected electrons. The kappa distribution, which is proposed as a physical consequence of electron acceleration, has been applied successfully in RHESSI spectral analysis. In this study, we employ the kappa-form injected electrons in the warm-target model to analyze two M-class flares, observed by RHESSI and STIX, respectively. The best-fit results show that the kappa-form energetic electron spectrum generates lower nonthermal energy than the power-law form when producing a similar photon spectrum in the fit range. We also demonstrated that the fit parameters associated with the kappa-form electron spectrum can be well determined with small uncertainty. Further, the kappa distribution, which covers the entire electron energy range, enables the determination of key electron properties such as total electron number density and average energy at the flare site, providing valuable information on electron acceleration processes.</description>

      <title>JWST Resolves CIA Features in White Dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared-faint white dwarfs are cool white dwarfs exhibiting significant infrared flux deficits, most often attributed to collision-induced absorption (CIA) from H$_2$-He in mixed hydrogen-helium atmospheres. We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near- and mid-infrared spectra of three such objects using NIRSpec (0.6-5.3 $\mu$m) and MIRI (5-14 $\mu$m): LHS 3250, WD J1922+0233, and LHS 1126. Surprisingly, for LHS 3250, we detect no H$_2$-He CIA absorption at 2.4 $\mu$m, instead observing an unexpected small flux bump at this wavelength. WD J1922+0233 exhibits the anticipated strong absorption feature centered at 2.4 $\mu$m, but with an unexpected narrow emission-like feature inside this absorption band. LHS 1126 shows no CIA features and follows a $\lambda^{-2}$ power law in the mid-infrared. LHS 1126's lack of CIA features suggests a very low hydrogen abundance, with its infrared flux depletion likely caused by He-He-He CIA. For LHS 3250 and WD J1922+0233, the absence of a 1.2 $\mu$m CIA feature in both stars argues against ultracool temperatures, supporting recent suggestions that infrared-faint white dwarfs are warmer and more massive than previously thought. This conclusion is further solidified by Keck near-infrared spectroscopy of seven additional objects. We explore possible explanations for the unexpected emission-like features in both stars, and temperature inversions above the photosphere emerge as a promising hypothesis. Such inversions may be common among the infrared-faint population, and since they significantly affect the infrared spectral energy distribution, this would impact their photometric fits. Further JWST observations are needed to confirm the prevalence of this phenomenon and guide the development of improved atmospheric models.</description>

Abstract: Massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars comprise a spectroscopic class characterized by high temperatures (Teff &gt; ~30 kK) and powerful and rapid stellar winds. Hydrogen-rich WR stars represent the most massive stars in existence (M &gt; ~100 Msun), while classical WR stars are hydrogen-depleted, evolved massive stars which probe the final evolutionary stages of massive stars prior to core collapse. They dominate entire stellar populations in terms of radiative and mechanical feedback, and are thought to give rise to powerful transients such as hydrogen-stripped supernovae (type Ibc SNe) and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). In this chapter, we summarize the main observed properties of WR populations in our Galaxy and nearby galaxies, and discuss open problems in our understanding of their structure and formation</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Invisible: A Study of Gaia18ajz, a Candidate Black Hole Revealed by Microlensing</title>

Abstract: Identifying black holes is essential for comprehending the development of stars and uncovering novel principles of physics. Gravitational microlensing provides an exceptional opportunity to examine an undetectable population of black holes in the Milky Way. In particular, long-lasting events are likely to be associated with massive lenses, including black holes. We present an analysis of the Gaia18ajz microlensing event, reported by the Gaia Science Alerts system, which has exhibited a long timescale and features indicative of the annual microlensing parallax effect. Our objective is to estimate the parameters of the lens based on the best-fitting model. We utilized photometric data obtained from the Gaia satellite and terrestrial observatories to investigate a variety of microlensing models and calculate the most probable mass and distance to the lens, taking into consideration a Galactic model as a prior. Subsequently, weapplied a mass-brightness relation to evaluate the likelihood that the lens is a main sequence star. We also describe the DarkLensCode (DLC), an open-source routine which computes the distribution of probable lens mass, distance and luminosity employing the Galaxy priors on stellar density and velocity for microlensing events with detected microlensing parallax. We modelled Gaia18ajz event and found its two possible models with most likely Einstein timescale of $316^{+36}_{-30}$ days and $299^{+25}_{-22}$ days. Applying Galaxy priors for stellar density and motion, we calculated the most probable lens mass of $4.9^{+5.4}_{-2.3} M_\odot$ located at $1.14^{+0.75}_{-0.57}\,\text{kpc}$ or $11.1^{+10.3}_{-4.7} M_\odot$ located at $1.31^{+0.80}_{-0.60}\,\text{kpc}$. Our analysis of the blended light suggests that the lens is likely a dark remnant of stellar evolution, rather than a main sequence star.</description>

      <title>At the same age, metallicity, and alpha-enhancement, sodium is a more effective tracer of the young and old sequences of the Milky Way disc</title>

Abstract: Trends in the enrichment of elements with stellar ages are a powerful avenue to identify unexplained origins of the elements. We investigate the stellar abundance trends of low to intermediate-mass stars using the GALAH DR3 high-resolution spectroscopic dataset of 6234 solar-type stars. Our study explores the elemental abundance [X/Fe] of sodium (Na) with age. We find a pronounced enrichment in [Na/Fe] at super solar metallicity (i.e., [Fe/H] above 0) in the old sequence of Milky Way disc stars, a trend demanding a deeper understanding of the underlying source(s) responsible for the nucleosynthesis. This progressive [Na/Fe] enrichment at the young end of the old sequence has essential implications for Galactic archaeology. In this work, we propose a novel selection technique for separating the Milky Way's thick and thin disc stellar populations (i.e., old and young sequences) based on the observed [Na/Fe] rise of roughly 0.1 dex for stars around 5 - 8 Gyr old. We also compare our selection method to the conventional [Mg/Fe] vs [Fe/H] selection approach, and we find that our new Na-based selection method better disentangles the overlap between young- and old-sequence disc stars at these intermediate ages. This is especially true at super solar [Fe/H], where [Mg/Fe] vs [Fe/H] or [alpha/Fe] vs [Fe/H] separation approaches exhibit a lot of overlap. This new selection method should help us better understand the Milky Way disc's formation history.</description>

      <title>Structural Implications of the Chameleon Mechanism on White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of the chameleon mechanism on the structure of white dwarfs. Using a shooting method of our design, we solve the corresponding scalar-tensor equilibrium equations for a Chandrasekhar equation of state, exploring various energy scales and couplings of the chameleon field to matter. For the considered parameter ranges, we find the chameleon field to be in a thick-shell configuration, identifying for the first time in the literature a similarity relation of the theory for the radially normalised scalar field gradient. Our analysis reveals that the chameleon mechanism alters the internal pressure of white dwarfs, leading to a reduction in the stellar radii and masses and shifting the mass-radius curves below those predicted by Newtonian gravity. This lowers also the specific heat of white dwarfs, accelerating their cooling process. Finally, we derive parametric expressions from our results to expedite future analyses of white dwarfs in scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <title>A unifying polarization formalism for electric- and magnetic-multipole interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the spherical tensorial formalism for polarization to the treatment of electric- and magnetic-multipole transitions of any order. We rely on the spherical-wave expansion to derive the tensor form of the operator describing the interaction of the atomic system with a polarized radiation field, which naturally leads to the introduction of spherical tensors describing the polarization properties of the interacting field. As a direct application, the formalism is used to model the radiation anisotropy affecting the scattering of radiation in an electric-quadrupole transition, and the associated Hanle effect in the presence of a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Re-analysis of the Gamow-Teller distributions for N=Z nuclei, 24Mg, 28Si, and 32S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gamow-Teller (GT) strength distributions of sd shell N=Z nuclei ($^{24}$Mg, $^{28}$Si, and $^{32}$S) are investigated within the framework of proton-neutron quasi particle random phase approximation (pn QRPA) using a deformed basis. The nuclear properties of these special nuclei were investigated by the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model. The RMF framework with density-dependent interactions (DD-PC1 and DD-ME2) was employed to compute ground-state deformation parameters (beta 2) using potential energy curves. The $\beta_2$ values computed from the RMF and the finite range droplet model (FRDM) were employed as a free parameter in the pn QRPA calculation to investigate the resulting GT strength distributions.The present model-based analyses compare well with the observed data.</description>

      <title>SETI in 2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this third installment of SETI in 20xx, we very briefly and subjectively review developments in SETI in 2022. Our primary focus is 80 papers and books published or made public in 2022, which we sort into six broad categories: results from actual searches, new search methods and instrumentation, target and frequency selection, the development of technosignatures, theory of ETIs, and social aspects of SETI.</description>
