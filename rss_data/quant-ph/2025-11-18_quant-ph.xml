      <title>Enhanced Digitized Adiabatic Quantum Factorization Algorithm Using Null-Space Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integer factorization is a computational problem of fundamental importance in cybersecurity and secure communications, as its difficulty form the basis of modern public-key cryptography. While Shor's algorithm can solve this problem efficiently on a universal quantum computer, near-term devices require alternative approaches. The Adiabatic Factorization Algorithm and its digitized counterparts offer a promising NISQ-era pathway but suffer from high-order many-body interactions that are difficult to implement. In this work, we propose a modified QAOA-based factorization protocol that simplifies the interacting Hamiltonian to include only two-body terms, significantly reducing its experimental complexity. Numerical simulations show that this method achieves comparable or higher fidelities than the standard protocol, while requiring fewer quantum resources and converging more rapidly for problem instances up to eight qubits. We analyze the characteristic fidelity behavior introduced by the Hamiltonian modification. Additionally, we report on simulations with alternative cost-function definitions that frequently yielded improved performance.</description>

      <title>2025 Quantum Diamond Workshop Findings Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report synthesizes the outcomes of a two-day workshop held in Washington, D.C. in May, 2025 that convened researchers, industry representatives, and government stakeholders to examine the current state and future directions of quantum diamond technologies. The workshop's goals were to assess the most promising use cases, to identify the key technical and structural challenges limiting adoption, and to chart potential pathways for aligning application needs with diamond material and device development. Through a series of technical presentations and open discussions, participants explored both near-term demonstrations and long-term infrastructure needs, highlighting the critical role of coordination between material suppliers, device engineers, and end users. The goal of this report is to distill those insights into a coherent set of cross-cutting themes, challenges, and strategic actions that can guide government, industry, and academic efforts to accelerate the maturation and commercialization of quantum diamond technologies.</description>

      <title>Sample-based training of quantum generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers can efficiently sample from probability distributions that are believed to be classically intractable, providing a foundation for quantum generative modeling. However, practical training of such models remains challenging, as gradient evaluation via the parameter-shift rule scales linearly with the number of parameters and requires repeated expectation-value estimation under finite-shot noise. We introduce a training framework that extends the principle of contrastive divergence to quantum models. By deriving the circuit structure and providing a general recipe for constructing it, we obtain quantum circuits that generate the samples required for parameter updates, yielding constant scaling with respect to the cost of a forward pass, analogous to backpropagation in classical neural networks. Numerical results demonstrate that it attains comparable accuracy to likelihood-based optimization while requiring substantially fewer samples. The framework thereby establishes a scalable route to training expressive quantum generative models directly on quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Maxwell-Bloch Equations with Applications to Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive relativistic Maxwell-Bloch equations for potential applications in astronomical environments, where various radiative processes are known to occur, including the maser action and Dicke's superradiance. We show that for both phenomena a radiating system's response is preserved at different relative velocities between the system's rest frame and the observer, while the relevant timescales and the radiation intensity transform as expected from relativistic considerations. We verify that the level of coherence between groups of emitters travelling at different speeds is unchanged in all reference frames. We also derive relativistic versions of the maser equations applicable in the steady-state regime.</description>

      <title>Compact cavity-dressed Hamiltonian framework at arbitrarily strong light-matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a non-perturbative Hamiltonian mapping method for quantum systems strongly coupled to a quantized field mode (cavity), yielding compact closed-form representations of hybrid light-matter systems. The mapping method builds on an entangling transformation of photonic and atomic degrees of freedom. By truncating the resulting cavity-dressed Hamiltonian (CDH) to successively larger excitation sectors, we construct a series of compact models that converge to the exact limit, outpacing conventional approaches even in the challenging resonant and ultrastrong light-matter regime. The mapping principle also applies to multimode cavities coupled to matter through noncommuting operators and to leaky cavities. We benchmark the CDH framework on the quantum Rabi model, demonstrating accurate spectral predictions in both weak and strong coupling regimes, together with converging ground-state and thermal observables. We study the Dicke-Heisenberg lattice model and determine its phase diagram under resonant and strong light-matter coupling, achieving significant computational savings over brute-force simulations and identifying cavity-mediated spin correlations both analytically and numerically. The closed-form and compactness of the CDH provide both physical insight and enhanced computational efficiency, facilitating studies of strongly coupled hybrid light-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Error-Mitigation Enabled Multicomponent Quantum Simulations Beyond the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a multicomponent unitary coupled cluster framework for quantum simulations of molecular systems that incorporate both electronic and nuclear quantum effects beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Using the nuclear-electronic orbital formalism, we construct mcUCC ans\"atze for positronium hydride and molecular hydrogen with a quantum proton, and analyze hardware requirements for different excitation truncations. To further reduce resource costs effectively, we employ the local unitary cluster Jastrow ansatz and implement it experimentally on IBM Q's Heron superconducting hardware. With the Physics-Inspired Extrapolation error mitigation protocol, the computed ground-state energies remain within chemical accuracy, consistent with the stated uncertainty level. These results provide the first demonstration of error-mitigated multicomponent correlated simulations on quantum hardware and outline a path toward scalable algorithms unifying electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Emergent synchronization mode in coupled Rydberg atomic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a new oscillatory form in the two coupled dissipative Rydberg atomic chains by modulating its spacing. Such oscillation has $\pi$-phase difference between two neighboring sites, which distinguishes itself from antiferromagnetic-type synchronization in the previous studies. Theoretically, we find a phase with coexisting two types of continuous time crystals, and recognize that the transition belongs to Hopf and pitchfork bifurcation. Furthermore, we generalize the conclusion to multiple chains and verify the uniqueness of the new synchronization mode. We also discuss its experimental feasibility.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Based Quantum Computation Using the Spin-1 XXZ Model with Uniaxial Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12000v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the ground state of a spin-1 XXZ chain with uniaxial anisotropies, single-ion anisotropy $D$ and Ising-like anisotropy $J$, within the Haldane phase can serve as a resource state for measurement-based quantum computation implementing single-qubit gates. The gate fidelity of both elementary rotation gates and general single-qubit unitary gates composed of rotations about the $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-axes is evaluated, and is found to exceed 0.99 when $D$ or $J$ is appropriately tuned. Furthermore, we derive an analytic expression for the rotation-gate fidelity under the assumption that the state lies within the $\mathbb Z_2\times\mathbb Z_2$-protected Haldane phase, showing that it is determined by the post-measurement spin-spin correlation function and the failure probability. The observed enhancement of gate fidelity in the spin-1 XXZ chain originates from the strengthening of antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations near the AFM phase, which effectively suppresses failure states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Amplitude-Amplification Eigensolver: A State-Learning-Assisted Approach beyond Energy-Gradient-Based Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-state estimation lies at the heart of a broad range of quantum simulations. Most near-term approaches are cast as variational energy minimization and thus inherit the challenges of problem-specific energy landscapes. We develop the quantum amplitude-amplification eigensolver (QAAE), which departs from the variational paradigm and instead coherently drives a trial state toward the ground state via quantum amplitude amplification. Each amplitude-amplification round interleaves a reflection about the learned trial state with a controlled short-time evolution under a normalized Hamiltonian; an ancilla readout yields an amplitude-amplified pure target state that a state-learning step then re-encodes into an ansatz circuit for the next round -- without evaluating the energy gradients. Under standard assumptions (normalized $\hat{H}$, a nondegenerate ground-state, and a learning update), the ground-state overlap increases monotonically per round and the procedure converges; here, a per-round depth bound in terms of the ansatz depth and Hamiltonian-simulation cost establishes hardware compatibility. Cloud experiments on IBMQ processor verify our amplification mechanism on a two-level Hamiltonian and a two-qubit Ising model, and numerical benchmarks on $\mathrm{H}_2$, $\mathrm{LiH}$, and a $10$-qubit longitudinal-and-transverse-field Ising model show that QAAE integrates with chemistry-inspired and hardware-efficient circuits and can surpass gradient-based VQE in accuracy and stability. These results position QAAE as a variational-free and hardware-compatible route to ground-state estimation for near-term quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Nonreciprocal Quantum Battery Performance via Nonlinear Two-Photon Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries have attracted significant attention as efficient quantum energy storage devices.In this work, we propose a nonlinear two-photon driving quantum battery model featuring nonreciprocal dynamics that enables a highly efficient unidirectional charging mechanism through environmental engineering. Using a Markovian master-equation approach, we derive analytical solutions for the system dynamics and identify the parameter regime required for dynamical equilibration. Our results reveal that increasing the driving strength enhances both energy conversion and storage efficiency, albeit at the cost of longer equilibration times. Compared with single-photon driving, the two-photon process exhibits a pronounced advantage in energy capacity and entropy regulation, which becomes more prominent under stronger driving. Under asymmetric dissipation, optimizing the system-bath coupling can further improve performance. The proposed model is experimentally feasible and can be implemented across multiple quantum platforms, including photonic systems, superconducting circuits, and magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Application of optical squeezing to microresonator based optical sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Q optical microresonators combine low losses and high optical energy concentration in a small effective mode volume, making them an attractive platform for optical sensors. While light is confined in the microresonator by total internal reflection, a portion of the optical field, known as the evanescent field, extends outside. This makes the mode's resonant frequency sensitive to changes in the surrounding environment.
  In this work, we explore the quantum sensitivity limits of this type of sensors. We demonstrate that by preparing the probe light in a squeezed quantum state, it is possible to surpass the shot-noise limit. The resulting sensitivity is constrained only by optical losses and the available degree of squeezing. The influence of the losses can be reduced using additional squeezing of the light inside the microresonator.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Shadow Descent: Training Parametrized Quantum Circuits with Shadows of Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the task of optimizing the parameters in Parametrized Quantum Circuits (PQCs). While popular algorithms, such as Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA), limit the number of circuit-execution to two per iteration, irrespective of the number of parameters in the circuit, they have their own challenges. These methods use central-differences to calculate biased estimates of directional derivatives. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that this may lead to instabilities in \emph{training} the PQCs. To remedy this, we propose Stochastic Shadow Descent (\texttt{SSD}), which uses random-projections (or \emph{shadows}) of the gradient to update the parameters iteratively. We eliminate the bias in directional derivatives by employing the Parameter-Shift Rule, along with techniques from Quantum Signal Processing, to construct a quantum circuit that parsimoniously computes \emph{unbiased estimates} of directional derivatives. Finally, we prove the convergence of the \texttt{SSD} algorithm, provide worst-case bounds on the number of iterations, and numerically demonstrate its efficacy.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Charging Optimization of Inhomogeneous Dicke Quantum Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charging optimization is a key challenge to the implementation of quantum batteries, particularly under inhomogeneity and partial observability. This paper employs reinforcement learning to optimize piecewise-constant charging policies for an inhomogeneous Dicke battery. We systematically compare policies across four observability regimes, from full-state access to experimentally accessible observables (energies of individual two-level systems (TLSs), first-order averages, and second-order correlations). Simulation results demonstrate that full observability yields near-optimal ergotropy with low variability, while under partial observability, access to only single-TLS energies or energies plus first-order averages lags behind the fully observed baseline. However, augmenting partial observations with second-order correlations recovers most of the gap, reaching 94%-98% of the full-state baseline. The learned schedules are nonmyopic, trading temporary plateaus or declines for superior terminal outcomes. These findings highlight a practical route to effective fast-charging protocols under realistic information constraints.</description>

      <title>Channel-Constrained Markovian Quantum Diffusion Model from Open System Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a channel-constrained Markovian quantum diffusion (CCMQD) model that prepares quantum states by rigorously framing the generative process within the dynamics of open quantum systems. Our model interprets the forward diffusion process as natural decoherence using quantum master equations, whereas the reverse denoising is achieved by learning inverse quantum channels. Our core innovation is a comprehensive channel-constrained framework: we model the diffusion and denoising steps as quantum channels defined by Kraus operators, ensure their physical validity through optimization on the Stiefel manifold, and introduce tailored training strategies and loss functions that leverage this constrained structure for high-fidelity state reconstruction. Experimental validation on systems ranging from single qubits to entangled states $7$ -qubits demonstrates high-fidelity state generation, achieving fidelities exceeding $0.998$ under both random and depolarizing noise conditions. This work confirms that quantum diffusion can be characterized as a controlled Markov evolution, demonstrating that environmental interactions are not limited to being a source of decoherence but can also be utilized to achieve high-fidelity quantum state synthesis.</description>

      <title>Scalable quantum error mitigation with phase-cycled dynamical decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of quantum technologies in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era is severely constrained by qubit decoherence and control errors, presenting fundamental challenges to achieving quantum advantages. Dynamical decoupling is a widely used, powerful technique for decoherence error suppression. However, it is susceptible to control errors, making non-robust sequences like UDD impractical to implement and robust ones like CPMG to significantly overestimate decoherence times. This overestimation issue remains largely unexplored in the past few decades, leading to many reports of exceptionally long yet plausible decoherence times across various qubit platforms. Here, we construct Hadamard phase cycling as a non-Markovian quantum error mitigation method for dynamical decoupling. This method exploits group structure to design phase configurations of equivalent ensemble quantum circuits, effectively eliminates circuit outputs generated from erroneous dynamics, and scales linearly with circuit depth. Harnessing its error mitigation capability for ensemble solid-state electron spin qubits embedded in paramagnetic molecules and nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond enables accurate acquisition of decoherence times. Applying Hadamard phase cycling on single trapped ion and superconducting transmon qubits effectively preserves their state fidelity during dynamical decoupling. The integration of scalable quantum error mitigation and suppression would facilitate the development of quantum technologies with noisy qubits and control hardware.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate many-body phase transitions in a one-dimensional anisotropic XY model subject to a complex-valued transverse field. Within the biorthogonal framework, we calculate the ground-state correlation functions and entanglement entropy, confirming that their scaling behavior remains identical to that in the Hermitian XY model. The preservation of Hermitian phase transition features in the non-Hermitian setting is rooted in the persistence and emergence of symmetries and their breaking. Specifically, the ferromagnetic (FM) phase arises from the breaking of a $Z_2$ symmetry, while the Luttinger liquid (LL) phase is enabled by the emergence of a $U(1)$ symmetry together with the degeneracy of the real part of the energy spectrum. The nontrivial topology of the LL phase are characterized by the winding number around the exceptional point (EP). Given that non-Hermitian systems are inherently open, this research opens a new avenue for exploring conventional quantum phase transitions that are typically vulnerable to decoherence and environmental disruption in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Skyrmionic qubits stabilized by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as platforms for qubits and quantum gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computation departs from the classical paradigm of deterministic, bit-based processing by exploiting inherently quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. We propose a framework for qubit realization based on skyrmionic states stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in two-dimensional spin lattices. The model incorporates competing exchange interactions, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and Zeeman coupling, solved via exact diagonalization under periodic (PBC) and open boundary conditions (OBC). A quantum skyrmionic phase emerges for PBC within a parameter space defined by DMI, exchange, field, and anisotropy, while OBC favor classical-like, topologically protected skyrmions. Quantum logic gates (Pauli X, Y, Z, Hadamard) are implemented on both skyrmion types. Energy density and entanglement entropy analyses reveal that quantum skyrmions suffer from DMI-driven decoherence and reduced gate fidelity, whereas classical-like skyrmions maintain stability. Exact simulations of qubit dynamics, including drive effects and Lindblad decoherence, demonstrate tunable anharmonic energy levels and coherent Bloch-sphere manipulation, making these skyrmionic states promising candidates for qubit implementation. Overall, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction plays a dual role-stabilizing skyrmionic qubits while simultaneously inducing decoherence during gate operations.</description>

      <title>Transitional Bell Correlation from Dirac Wavepackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a closed-form expression for the Bell--CHSH correlation of entangled, counter-propagating electrons using realistic Dirac wavepackets and localized detection. In contrast to the conventional distance-independent result, the Bell parameter evolves continuously from the quantum bound $2\sqrt{2}$ to the classical limit $2$ as the spatial overlap of the two waves decreases. The quantum enhancement arises entirely from transverse overlap, showing that the Bell violation reflects the local overlap of propagating Dirac waves rather than any action at a distance.</description>

      <title>An Improved Quantum Anonymous Notification Protocol for Quantum-Augmented Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalability of current quantum networks is limited due to noisy quantum components and high implementation costs, thereby limiting the security advantages that quantum networks provide over their classical counterparts. Quantum Augmented Networks (QuANets) address this by integrating quantum components in classical network infrastructure to improve robustness and end-to-end security. To enable such integration, Quantum Anonymous Notification (QAN) is a method to anonymously inform a receiver of an incoming quantum communication. Therefore, several quantum primitives will serve as core tools, namely, quantum voting, quantum anonymous protocols, quantum secret sharing, etc. However, all current quantum protocols can be compromised in the presence of several common channel noises. In this work, we propose an improved quantum anonymous notification (QAN) protocol that utilizes rotation operations on shared GHZ states to produce an anonymous notification in an n-user quantum-augmented network. We study the behavior of this modified QAN protocol under the dephasing noise model and observe stronger resilience to false notifications than earlier QAN approaches. The QAN framework is also proposed to be integrated with a machine-learning classifier, enhanced quantum-augmented network. Finally, we discuss how this notification layer integrates with QuANets so that receivers can allow switch-bypass handling of quantum payloads, reducing header-based information leakage and vulnerability to targeted interference at compromised switches.</description>

      <title>QMA Complete Quantum-Enhanced Kyber: Provable Security Through CHSH Nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) must secure large-scale communication systems against quantum adversaries where classical hardness alone is insufficient and purely quantum schemes remain impractical. Lattice-based key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) such as CRYSTALS-Kyber provide efficient quantum-resistant primitives but rely solely on computational hardness assumptions that are susceptible to hybrid classical-quantum attacks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the first Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)-certified Kyber protocol, which embeds quantum non-locality verification directly within the key exchange phase. The proposed design integrates CHSH entanglement tests using Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs to yield measurable quantum advantage values exceeding classical correlation limits, thereby coupling information--theoretic quantum guarantees with lattice-based computational security. Formal reductions demonstrate that any polynomial-time adversary breaking the proposed KEM must either solve the Module Learning With Errors (Module-LWE) problem or a Quantum Merlin-Arthur (QMA)-complete instance of the 2-local Hamiltonian problem, under the standard complexity assumption QMA $\subset$ NP. The construction remains fully compatible with the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform, preserving chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) security and Kyber's efficiency profile. The resulting CHSH-augmented Kyber scheme therefore establishes a mathematically rigorous, hybrid post-quantum framework that unifies lattice cryptography and quantum non-locality to achieve verifiable, composable, and forward-secure key agreement.</description>

      <title>Stimulated Hawking effect and quasinormal mode resonance in a polariton simulator of field theory on curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hawking effect amplifies fluctuations in the vicinity of horizons, both in black holes and in analogue platforms.
  Here, we consider a polariton simulator and numerically examine the \emph{stimulated} Hawking effect using a coherent probe incident on the horizon from the exterior.
  We implement an experimentally realistic effective spacetime that supports a quasinormal mode (QNM) in the vicinity of the horizon.
  We find that the stimulated Hawking effect manifests as transmission into a negative-energy Bogoliubov channel inside the horizon, consistent with pseudo-unitary Bogoliubov scattering.
  Moreover, transmission across the horizon peaks at the QNM frequency.
  The computed spectral signatures provide a practical guide for future experimental investigations of the Hawking effect and its interplay with QNMs, an open question in quantum field theory in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Optimal Multiparameter Quantum Estimation of Magnonic Couplings in a Magnomechanical Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an experimentally viable scheme to enhance the simultaneous estimation precision of the couplings $G_{mc}$ and $G_{mb}$, with a particular focus on the performance of heterodyne detection. By comparing simultaneous and individual estimation strategies, we demonstrate that the simultaneous approach offers a notable advantage in our system. To support this, we compute the quantum Fisher information matrices (QFIMs) based on the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD). Our results show that the quantum Cram\'er Rao bound (QCRB) associated with the RLD is consistently lower than that of the SLD, indicating superior estimation precision. From a physical standpoint, this improvement reflects the system's enhanced capacity to encode, transfer, and extract quantum information while allowing optimal control of fundamental interactions. We show that increasing the Rabi frequency, cavity loss rate, and the average number of photons and phonons, combined with reduced mechanical damping and temperature, enhances the system's sensitivity to the coupling parameters. These mechanisms act on the available quantum resources, such as entanglement, squeezing, and state purity, leading to more precise estimations. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that under certain conditions, heterodyne detection can closely approach the ultimate precision set by the QFIM. This suggests that a measurement strategy based on heterodyne detection can offer an efficient and practical route for estimating the couplings $G_{mc}$ and $G_{mb}$, paving the way for high precision hybrid quantum sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimization allows for up to exponential quantum speedups for specific, possibly industrially relevant problems. As the key algorithm in this field, we motivate and discuss the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), which can be understood as a slightly generalized version of Quantum Annealing for gate-based quantum computers. We delve into the quantum circuit implementation of the QAOA, including Hamiltonian simulation techniques for higher-order Ising models, and discuss parameter training using the parameter shift rule. An example implementation with Pennylane source code demonstrates practical application for the Maximum Cut problem. Further, we show how constraints can be incorporated into the QAOA using Grover mixers, allowing to restrict the search space to strictly valid solutions for specific problems. Finally, we outline the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) as a generalization of the QAOA, highlighting its potential in the NISQ era and addressing challenges such as barren plateaus and ansatz design.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal action in Everettian Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to a common view, Everettian quantum mechanics (EQM) is a local theory because it avoids nonlocal action at a distance, and this is an important point in EQM's favor. Unlike collapse theories, EQM does not allow an action on one system to change the reduced density matrix (RDM) of a remote entangled system - a clear case of nonlocal action. However, EQM does allow an action on one system to change the global state of the system and its remote entangled partners. We argue that such changes should also count as nonlocal actions, meaning EQM is not local after all. First, we consider an argument to the contrary, which deems such global changes to be mere extrinsic changes, whereas nonlocal action requires intrinsic changes to the remote system. We respond that the intrinsic-extrinsic distinction is problematic and cannot hold the weight of this argument. We then try to clarify when actions that change global states count as nonlocal actions. We argue that it is when the global states are essential explanatory mechanisms of the theory. In EQM, the global state is needed to explain why, in an anti-correlated Bell state, Alice's measuring spin-up ensures that she encounters only the branch where Bob measures spin-down.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Chemistry on Quantum Computers with Fermionic Linear Optical Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and open source a simulator for circuits composed of passive fermionic linear optical elements and controlled-phase gates. Given such a circuit, our simulator can compute Born-rule probabilities for samples drawn from it. Our simulator supports both exact and approximate probability calculation, allowing users to trade accuracy for efficiency as needed. For approximate Born-rule probability calculation, our simulator's runtime is exponential only in the magnitudes of the angles of the circuit's controlled-phase gates. This makes our simulator useful for simulating certain systems that are beyond the reach of conventional state vector methods. We demonstrate our simulator's utility by simulating the local unitary cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) ansatz and integrating it with sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) to improve the accuracy of molecular ground-state energy estimates. Applied to a 52-qubit $N_2$ system, we observe accuracy improvements of up to $46\%$ over the baseline SQD implementation with negligible computational overhead. As an efficient and flexible tool for simulating fermionic circuits, our simulator enables new opportunities for enhancing near-term quantum algorithms in chemistry and related domains.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Framework for Efficient Prediction of Quantum Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Wasserstein distance (W-distance) is a fundamental metric for quantifying the distinguishability of quantum operations, with critical applications in quantum error correction. However, computing the W-distance remains computationally challenging for multiqubit systems due to exponential scaling. We present a machine learning framework that efficiently predicts the quantum W-distance by extracting physically meaningful features from quantum state pairs, including Pauli measurements, statistical moments, quantum fidelity, and entanglement measures. Our approach employs both classical neural networks and traditional machine learning models. On three-qubit systems, the best-performing Random Forest model achieves near-perfect accuracy ($R^2 = 0.9999$) with mean absolute errors on the order of $10^{-5}$. We further validate the framework's practical utility by successfully verifying two fundamental theoretical propositions in quantum information theory: the bound on measurement probability differences between unitary operations and the $W_1$ gate error rate bound. The results establish machine learning as a viable and scalable alternative to traditional numerical methods for W-distance computation, with particular promise for real-time quantum circuit assessment and error correction protocol design in NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Discovering autonomous quantum error correction via deep reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, standard methods relying on active measurements may introduce additional errors. Autonomous quantum error correction (AQEC) circumvents this by utilizing engineered dissipation and drives in bosonic systems, but identifying practical encoding remains challenging due to stringent Knill-Laflamme conditions. In this work, we utilize curriculum learning enabled deep reinforcement learning to discover Bosonic codes under approximate AQEC framework to resist both single-photon and double-photon losses. We present an analytical solution of solving the master equation under approximation conditions, which can significantly accelerate the training process of reinforcement learning. The agent first identifies an encoded subspace surpassing the breakeven point through rapid exploration within a constrained evolutionary time-frame, then strategically fine-tunes its policy to sustain this performance advantage over extended temporal horizons. We find that the two-phase trained agent can discover the optimal set of codewords, i.e., the Fock states $\ket{4}$ and $\ket{7}$ considering the effect of both single-photon and double-photon loss. We identify that the discovered code surpasses the breakeven threshold over a longer evolution time and achieve the state-of-art performance. We also analyze the robustness of the code against the phase damping and amplitude damping noise. Our work highlights the potential of curriculum learning enabled deep reinforcement learning in discovering the optimal quantum error correct code especially in early fault-tolerant quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Autonomously Designed Pulses for Precise, Site-Selective Control of Atomic Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers based on cold-atom arrays offer long-lived qubits with programmable connectivity, yet their progress toward fault-tolerant operation is limited by the relatively low fidelity of site-selective local control. We introduce an artificial-intelligence (AI) framework that overcomes this limitation. Trained on atom-laser dynamics, a deep neural network autonomously designs composite pulses that improve local control fidelities tenfold while remaining compatible with existing control hardware. We further demonstrate the robustness of these pulses against optical aberrations and beam misalignment. This approach establishes AI-trained pulse compilation for high-fidelity qubit control and can be readily extended to other atom-like platforms, such as trapped ions and solid-state color centers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-lived storage of single photons is a fundamental requirement for enabling quantum communication and foundational tests of quantum physics over extended distances. While the implementation of a global-scale quantum network requires quantum storage times on the order of seconds to minutes, existing photonic quantum memories have so far been limited to subsecond lifetimes. Although $^{151}$Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystals exhibit substantially extended spin coherence times at the `magic' magnetic field, the concomitant weak optical absorption has until now prevented single-photon storage. Here, we overcome this challenge by integrating a noiseless photon echo protocol -- which makes full use of the crystal's natural absorption for photonic storage -- with a universally robust dynamical decoupling sequence incorporating adiabatic pulses to protect nuclear spin coherence, enabling long-lived quantum storage at the `magic' magnetic field. At a storage time of 5.6 s, we achieve a time-bin qubit storage fidelity of 88.0 $\pm$ 2.1%, surpassing the maximum fidelity attainable via classical strategies. Our device reaches a $1/e$ storage lifetime of 27.6 $\pm$ 0.6 s, enabling single-photon-level storage for 42 s with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than unity. This work establishes photonic quantum memory in the minute-scale regime, laying a solid foundation for global-scale quantum network and deep-space quantum experiments.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-Driven Entanglement Detection in High-Dimensional Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of high-dimensional quantum entanglement is crucial for advanced quantum computing and quantum information algorithms. Traditional methods require extensive data acquisition and suffer from limited visibility due to experimental noise. Here, we introduce a sparsity-driven framework to enhance the detection and certification of high-dimensional entanglement in spatially entangled photon pairs. By applying $\ell_1$-regularized reconstruction to sample covariance matrices obtained from measurements on photons produced via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) measurements, we enhance the visibility of the correlation signal while suppressing noise. We demonstrate, using a position-momentum Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement criterion, that this approach enables certification of an entanglement dimensionality that cannot be achieved without regularization. Our method is scalable, simple to use and compatible with existing quantum-optics platforms, thus paves the way for efficient, real-time analysis of high-dimensional quantum states.</description>

      <title>Charge-state stability of single NV centers in HPHT-type IIa diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a preliminary version. Improvements and additional analysis will be included in a revised manuscript. We investigate the charge-state stability of individual nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in weakly doped HPHT IIa diamond containing sub-ppm concentrations of boron and nitrogen. Using Ti/Al coplanar electrodes on an oxygen-terminated surface, we study how applied electric fields and optical excitation jointly govern NV charge conversion. By combining voltage-dependent photoluminescence, real-time charge-state monitoring, laser-power saturation with spectral decomposition, and time-resolved measurements, we reveal that electric fields several micrometers from the contacts significantly increase the NV- population and enhance spin readout. At low excitation powers, the NV- population evolves on minute timescales following compressed-exponential kinetics, consistent with slow space-charge rearrangement in ultra-insulating diamond. Under pulsed excitation, we observe hundreds-of-nanoseconds NV-/NV0 conversion driven by hole capture, which is strongly suppressed by applied bias. Our results demonstrate that residual boron acceptors play a key role in determining charge-state stability and show how electrical bias can reliably stabilize NV- in weakly doped bulk diamond.</description>

      <title>Quantum Orthogonal Separable Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Quantum Orthogonal Separable Physics-Informed Neural Networks (QO-SPINNs), a novel architecture for solving Partial Differential Equations, integrating quantum computing principles to address the computational bottlenecks of classical methods. We leverage a quantum algorithm for accelerating matrix multiplication within each layer, achieving a $\mathcal O(d\log d/\epsilon^2)$ complexity, a significant improvement over the classical $\mathcal O(d^2)$ complexity, where $d$ is the dimension of the matrix, $\epsilon$ the accuracy level. This is accomplished by using a Hamming weight-preserving quantum circuit and a unary basis for data encoding, with a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the overall architecture provided. We demonstrate the practical utility of our model by applying it to solve both forward and inverse PDE problems. Furthermore, we exploit the inherent orthogonality of our quantum circuits (which guarantees a spectral norm of 1) to develop a novel uncertainty quantification method. Our approach adapts the Spectral Normalized Gaussian Process for SPINNs, eliminating the need for the computationally expensive spectral normalization step. By using a Quantum Orthogonal SPINN architecture based on stacking, we provide a robust and efficient framework for uncertainty quantification (UQ) which, to our knowledge, is the first UQ method specifically designed for Separable PINNs. Numerical results based on classical simulation of the quantum circuits, are presented to validate the theoretical claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Stability of intrinsic localized modes on the lattice with competing power nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation with competing powers (p,q) satisfying 2 &lt;= p &lt; q. The physically relevant cases are given by (p,q) = (2,3), (p,q) = (3,4), and (p,q) = (3,5). In the anticontinuum limit, all intrinsic localized modes are compact and can be classified by their codes, which record one of two nonzero (smaller and larger) states and their sign alternations. By using the spectral stability analysis, we prove that the codes for larger states of the same sign are spectrally and nonlinearly (orbitally) stable, whereas the codes for smaller states of the alternating signs are spectrally stable but have eigenvalues of negative Krein signature. We also identify numerically the spectrally stable codes which consist of stacked combinations of the sign-definite larger states and the sign-alternating smaller states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hyperdimensional Computing: a foundational paradigm for quantum neuromorphic architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant challenge in quantum computing (QC) is developing learning models that truly align with quantum principles, as many current approaches are complex adaptations of classical frameworks. In this work, we introduce Quantum Hyperdimensional Computing (QHDC), a fundamentally new paradigm. We demonstrate that the core operations of its classical counterpart, Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a brain-inspired model, map with remarkable elegance and direct correspondence onto the native operations of a QC. This suggests HDC is exceptionally well-suited for a quantum-native implementation. We establish a direct, resource-efficient mapping: (i) hypervectors are mapped to quantum states, (ii) the bundling operation is implemented as a quantum-native averaging process using a Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) and Oblivious Amplitude Amplification (OAA), (iii) the binding operation is realized via quantum phase oracles, (iv) the permutation operation is implemented using the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), and (v) vector similarity is calculated using quantum state fidelity measurements based on the Hadamard Test. We present the first-ever implementation of this framework, validated through symbolic analogical reasoning and supervised classification tasks. The viability of QHDC is rigorously assessed via a comparative analysis of results from classical computation, ideal quantum simulation, and execution of a 156-qubit IBM Heron r3 quantum processor. Our results validate the proposed mappings and demonstrate the versatility of the framework, establishing QHDC as a physically realizable technology. This work lays the foundation for a new class of quantum neuromorphic algorithms and opens a promising avenue for tackling complex cognitive and biomedical problems intractable for classical systems.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Dynamics of Charged Graphene Quantum Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate dissipative dynamics in a graphene-based quantum battery modeled as a four level spin valley system. The battery is charged via a Gaussian pulse and subsequently evolves under amplitude damping, dephasing, and both Markovian and non Markovian reservoirs. We find that amplitude damping, while inducing energy loss, can stabilize non passive steady states with finite ergotropy, whereas pure dephasing suppresses coherence and eliminates work extraction. On the other hand, non-Markovian memory slows ergotropy loss and enables partial recovery through information backflow. These results identify coherence and reservoir memory as essential resources for enhancing the long-time performance of graphene quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>Moments of quantum channel ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moments of ensembles of unitaries play a central role in quantum information theory as they capture the statistical properties of dynamics of systems with some form of randomness. Indeed, concepts such as approximate $t$-designs arise when comparing how close an associated moment operator of a given unitary ensemble is to that of another, reference ensemble. Despite the importance of moment operators, their properties have not been as explored for quantum channels. In this work we develop a theoretical framework to compute moment operators for ensembles of quantum channels, for all moment orders $t$, with a special focus on determining ensembles that can be used as points of reference. By deriving hierarchies between ensembles, via inequalities of their moment operator norms, we give them operational meaning, and define useful concepts such as that of channel $t$-designs. Finally, we perform theoretical and numerical studies which show that different types of noise can decrease the norm of the moment operators (e.g., depolarizing noise), as well as increase it (e.g., amplitude damping), and generalize noise-induced concentration phenomena to channel-design-induced phenomena. Along the way, we find a block-orthogonal basis for permutations, which greatly simplifies our analyses, and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The role of averages in CV-QKD over fast fading channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a study of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocols over fast-fading channels, typically found in free-space communication links. Two eavesdropping models are considered to evaluate their security under collective attacks: \textit{Holevo bound average} (HBA) and \textit{covariance matrix average} (CMA). In the HBA approach, the Holevo bound is averaged over the channel transmittance. In contrast, the CMA method calculates the Holevo bound from the average covariance matrix. Analytical expressions are developed for both strategies. The two methods also differ in how they calculate the mutual information between the legitimate parties. The results demonstrate that the SKR is significantly influenced by how you treat channel fluctuations, highlighting the importance of choosing the model that better describes the actual implementation of the protocol.</description>

      <title>Sdim: A Qudit Stabilizer Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers have steadily improved over the last decade, but developing fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) techniques, required for useful, universal computation remains an ongoing effort. Key elements of FTQC such as error-correcting codes and decoding are supported by a rich bed of stabilizer simulation software such as Stim and CHP, which are essential for numerically characterizing these protocols at realistic scales. Recently, experimental groups have built nascent high-dimensional quantum hardware, known as qudits, which have a myriad of attractive properties for algorithms and FTQC. Despite this, there are no widely available qudit stabilizer simulators. We introduce the first open-source realization of such a simulator for all dimensions. We demonstrate its correctness against existing state vector simulations and benchmark its performance in evaluating and sampling quantum circuits. This simulator is the essential computational infrastructure to explore novel qudit error correction as earlier stabilizer simulators have been for qubits.</description>

      <title>Verified Implementation of GRAPE Pulse Optimization for Quantum Gates with Hardware-Representative Noise Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12799v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gate fidelity in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers remains the primary bottleneck limiting practical quantum computation, constrained by decoherence and control noise. Quantum optimal control (QOC) techniques, such as the gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) algorithm, offer a powerful approach to designing noise-robust pulses that actively mitigate these effects. However, most QOC implementations operate in idealized simulation environments that fail to capture the real-time parameter drift inherent to physical quantum hardware, creating a critical ``sim-to-real'' gap. In this work, I present QubitPulseOpt, an open-source, rigorously-tested Python framework designed to bridge this gap through hardware-representative optimal control. The framework demonstrates API connectivity to IQM's Garnet quantum processor (20-qubit superconducting device) and implements a workflow that constructs a high-fidelity ``digital twin'' using hardware-representative parameters. Using this simulation framework, I demonstrate that GRAPE-optimized pulses achieve a simulated gate error reduction of 77$\times$ compared to standard Gaussian pulses. The framework's reliability is ensured through a 864-test verification suite (74\% code coverage) and adherence to NASA JPL Power-of-10 safety-critical coding standards, establishing a new paradigm for trustworthy quantum control software. All results are from verified GRAPE optimizations with full provenance documentation.</description>

      <title>Approximate Message Passing for Quantum State Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is an indispensable tool for characterizing many-body quantum systems. However, due to the exponential scaling cost of the protocol with system size, many approaches have been developed for quantum states with specific structure, such as low-rank states. In this paper, we show how approximate message passing (AMP), a compressed sensing technique, can be used to perform low-rank QST. AMP provides asymptotically optimal performance guarantees for large systems, which suggests its utility for QST. We discuss the design challenges that come with applying AMP to QST, and show that by properly designing the AMP algorithm, we can reduce the reconstruction infidelity by over an order of magnitude compared to existing approaches to low-rank QST. We also performed tomographic experiments on IBM Kingston and considered the effect of device noise on the reliability of the predicted fidelity of state preparation. Our work advances the state of low-rank QST and may be applicable to other quantum tomography protocols.</description>

      <title>Pulsation of quantum walk between two arbitrary graphs with weakly connected bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Grover walk on a finite graph composed of two arbitrary simple graphs connected by one edge, referred to as a bridge. The parameter $\epsilon&gt;0$ assigned at the bridge represents the strength of connectivity: if $\epsilon=0$, then the graph is completely separated. We show that for sufficiently small values of $\epsilon$, a phenomenon called pulsation occurs. The pulsation is characterized by the periodic transfer of the quantum walker between the two graphs. An asymptotic expression with respect to small $\epsilon$ for the probability of finding the walker on either of the two graphs is derived. This expression reveals that the pulsation depends solely on the number of edges in each graph, regardless of their structure. In addition, we obtain that the quantum walker is transferred periodically between the two graphs, with a period of order $O(\epsilon^{-1/2})$. Furthermore, when the number of edges of two graphs is equal, the quantum walker is almost completely transferred.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schmidt number is an important kind of characterization of quantum entanglement. Quantum states with higher Schmidt numbers demonstrate significant advantages in various quantum information processing tasks. By deriving a class of k-positive linear maps based on symmetric measurements, we present new Schmidt-number witnesses of class (k + 1). By detailed example, we show that our Schmidt number witnesses identify better the Schmidt number of quantum states in high-dimensional systems. Furthermore, we note that the Fedorov ratio, which coincides with the Schmidt number for pure Gaussian states and provides a close approximation in non-Gaussian cases such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion, serves as an experimentally accessible tool for validating the proposed (k +1)-class Schmidt-number witnesses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Mechanical ground states of many-body systems can be important resources for various investigations: for quantum sensing, as the initial state for nonequilibrium quantum dynamics following quenches, and the simulation of quantum processes that start by coupling systems in ground states, eg, could be a process in quantum chemistry. However, to prepare ground states can be challenging; for example, requires adiabatic switching of Hamiltonian terms slower than an inverse gap, which can be time consuming and bring in decoherence. Here we investigate the possibility of preparing a many-body entangled ground state of a certain Hamiltonian, which can be called a quantum ``problem'' Hamiltonian, using the time evolution of an initial fiducial state by another ``solver'' Hamiltonian/s for a very short fixed (unit) time. The parameters of the solver Hamiltonian are optimised classically using energy minimisation as the cost function. We present a study of up to n=10 qubit many-body states prepared using this methodology.</description>

      <title>A Global Spacetime Optimization Approach to the Real-Space Time-Dependent Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12983v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) in real space is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of many-electron quantum systems, with applications ranging from quantum chemistry to condensed matter physics and materials science. However, solving the TDSE for complex fermionic systems remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the need to capture the time-evolving many-body correlations, while the antisymmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions complicates the function space in which these solutions must be represented. We propose a general-purpose neural network framework for solving the real-space TDSE, Fermionic Antisymmetric Spatio-Temporal Network, which treats time as an explicit input alongside spatial coordinates, enabling a unified spatiotemporal representation of complex, antisymmetric wavefunctions for fermionic systems. This approach formulates the TDSE as a global optimization problem, avoiding step-by-step propagation and supporting highly parallelizable training. The method is demonstrated on four benchmark problems: a 1D harmonic oscillator, interacting fermions in a time-dependent harmonic trap, 3D hydrogen orbital dynamics, and a laser-driven H$_2$ molecule, achieving excellent agreement with reference solutions across all cases. These results confirm our method's scalability, accuracy, and flexibility across various dimensions and interaction regimes, while demonstrating its ability to accurately simulate long-time dynamics in complex systems. Our framework offers a highly expressive alternative to traditional basis-dependent or mean-field methods, opening new possibilities for ab initio simulations of time-dependent quantum systems, with applications in quantum dynamics, molecular control, and ultrafast spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>ZX-DB: A Graph Database for Quantum Circuit Simplification and Rewriting via the ZX-Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging computational paradigm with the potential to outperform classical computers in solving a variety of problems. To achieve this, quantum programs are typically represented as quantum circuits, which must be optimized and adapted for target hardware through quantum circuit compilation. We introduce ZX-DB, a data-driven system that performs quantum circuit simplification and rewriting inside a graph database using ZX-calculus, a complete graphical formalism for quantum mechanics. ZX-DB encodes ZX-calculus rewrite rules as standard openCypher queries and executes them on an example graph database engine, Memgraph, enabling efficient, database-native transformations of large-scale quantum circuits. ZX-DB integrates correctness validation via tensor and graph equivalence checks and is evaluated against the state-of-the-art PyZX framework. Experimental results show that ZX-DB achieves up to an order-of-magnitude speedup for independent rewrites, while exposing pattern-matching bottlenecks in current graph database engines.

      <title>A Fractional Calculus Framework for Open Quantum Dynamics: From Liouville to Lindblad to Memory Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum systems exhibit dynamics ranging from purely unitary evolution to irreversible dissipative relaxation. The Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad (GKSL) equation uniquely characterizes Markovian dynamics that are completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP), yet many physical systems display non-Markovian features such as algebraic relaxation and coherence backflow beyond the reach of semigroup evolution. Fractional calculus provides a natural framework for describing such long-memory behavior through power-law temporal kernels introduced by fractional time derivatives. Here we establish a unified hierarchy that embeds fractional quantum master equations within the broader landscape of open system dynamics. The fractional master equation forms a structured subclass of memory-kernel models, reducing to the GKSL form at unit fractional order. Through Bochner--Phillips subordination, fractional evolution is expressed as an average over Lindblad semigroups weighted by a power-law waiting-time distribution. This construction ensures physical consistency, explains the algebraic origin of long-time decay, and bridges unitary, Markovian, and structured non-Markovian regimes. The resulting framework positions fractional calculus as a rigorous and unifying language for quantum dynamics with intrinsic memory, enabling new directions for theoretical analysis and quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Quantum lattice Boltzmann method for several time steps: A local Carleman linearization algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a novel encoding for quantum Lattice Boltzmann method algorithm using Carleman linearization. In contrast to previous articles \cite{Sanavio2024LatticeBC,sanavio2025carleman}, the encoding used allows for local collision rules while keeping a higher probability to obtain the right result, which is of the order of $10^{-2}$. The algorithm scales as $O(log_2^3(N)+Q^4)$ each time step with $N$ the number of lattice sites of the 2D lattice and $Q$ the number of channels with a constant number of qubits when using dynamical circuits.</description>

      <title>Topological enhancement of a PT-symmetric Su-Schrieffer-Heeger quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a non-Hermitian quantum battery based on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) lattice, charged through a PT-symmetric protocol that alternates gain and loss between the two sublattices. The interplay between lattice topology and non-Hermiticity gives rise to both bulk and edge exceptional points (EPs), which govern the charging dynamics. In the topological regime, an edge-state EP emerges at an exponentially small non-Hermitian strength, resulting in early PT-symmetry breaking and rapid energy accumulation. This topological enhancement originates from the PT-symmetric non-Hermitian dynamics, in which the broken-symmetry edge mode with the largest imaginary part of the eigenvalue dominates the time evolution. Consequently, the topological phase consistently yields higher stored energy and faster saturation than the trivial configuration across all parameter regimes and system sizes. These findings demonstrate that topology constitutes a genuine physical resource for enhancing the performance of quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>Fractional Contribution of Dynamical and Geometric Phases in Quantum Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental division of the total quantum evolution phase into geometric and dynamical components is a central problem in quantum physics. Here, we prove a remarkably simple and universal law demonstrating that this partitioning is governed, at every instant, solely by a single geometric quantity: the Bargmann angle (Bures angle). This result provides a universally applicable and rigorous way to define the exact fraction of the total phase that is geometric versus dynamical in origin, thereby establishing a new quantitative link between the dynamics of quantum evolution and the geometry of the state space. This finding has immediate practical consequences, furnishing a real-time measure of the geometricity of an evolution for designing high-fidelity geometric quantum gates with optimized robustness, and opening new avenues for quantum speed limit and coherent control.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba Effect Induced by Non-Markovian Exceptional Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Mpemba effect describes an anomalous phenomenon of accelerated relaxation which is of fundamental interest in the field of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Conventional theories on this phenomenon strongly rely on the Born-Markovian approximation, but this effect is not well understood in non-Markovian regimes. By investigating the relaxation process within the framework of a general non-Markovian dynamics, we propose a mechanism of realizing the quantum Mpemba effect via non-Markovian exceptional points. We verify the feasibility of this mechanism in a dissipative quantum harmonic oscillator model. Providing a new insight into the interesting non-equilibrium dynamics phenomenon, our work paves a way to accelerate the transfer of energy and information in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The correlated matching decoder for the 4.8.8 color code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color codes present distinct advantages for fault-tolerant quantum computing, such as high encoding rates and the transversal implementation of Clifford gates. However, existing matching-based decoders for the color codes such as the restricted decoder (Kubica and Delfosse, 2023), suffer from limited decoding performance. Inspired by the global decoding insight of the unified decoder (Benhemou et al., 2023), this paper introduces a correlated decoder for the 4.8.8 color code, which improves upon the conventional restricted decoder by leveraging correlations between restricted lattices, and is derived by mapping the correlated matching decoder for the surface code onto the color code lattice. Analytical and numerical results show that the correlated decoder achieves higher thresholds than the restricted and unified decoders, while matching the performance of the unified decoder at very low physical error rates. Under the code capacity and phenomenological noise models, the estimated thresholds for the color code against bit-flip error are 10.38% and 3.13%, respectively. Furthermore, by applying the surface-color code mapping, the thresholds of 16.62% and 3.52% are obtained for the surface code against depolarizing noise.</description>

      <title>Topological quantum compilation for non-semisimple Ising anyons via monte carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic numerical construction of a universal quantum gate set for topological quantum computation based on the non-semisimple Ising anyons model. Using the elementary braiding matrices (EBMs) of this model by the Monte Carlo-enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm (MC-enhanced SKA), we achieve high-fidelity approximations of standard one-qubit gates (Hadamard H-gate and phase T-gate). Remarkably, a recursion level of just three suffices to meet the fidelity requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our numerical results demonstrate that for the parameter {\alpha} /in (2, 2.031], a single braiding operation can approximate the local equivalence class [CNOT] with high precision and great unitary measurement. Specifically, at {\alpha} = 2.031, 2.047, and 2.063, we successfully construct a universal gate set {H-gate, T-gate, CNOT-gate} with high accuracy. This work establishes a new pathway towards universal quantum computation using non-semisimple Ising anyons.</description>

      <title>Data-driven adaptive quantum error mitigation for probability distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM) has been proposed as a class of hardware-friendly error suppression techniques. While QEM has been primarily studied for mitigating errors in the estimation of expectation values of observables, recent works have explored its application to estimating noiseless probability distributions. In this work, we propose two protocols to improve the accuracy of QEM for probability distributions, inspired by techniques in software engineering. The first is the N-version programming method, which compares probability distributions obtained via different QEM strategies and excludes the outlier distribution, certifying the feasibility of the error-mitigated distributions. The second is a consistency-based method for selecting an appropriate extrapolation strategy. Specifically, we prepare $K$ data points at different error rates, choose $L&lt;K$ of them for extrapolation, and evaluate error-mitigated results for all $\binom{K}{L}$ possible choices. We then select the extrapolation method that yields the smallest variance in the error-mitigated results. This procedure can also be applied bitstring-wise, enabling adaptive error mitigation for each probability in the distribution.</description>

      <title>Depth Optimization of Ansatz Circuits for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing depth of quantum circuits presents a major limitation for the execution of quantum algorithms, as the limited coherence time of physical qubits leads to noise that manifests as errors during computation. In this work, we focus on circuits relevant to variational quantum algorithms and demonstrate that their depth can be reduced by introducing additional qubits, mid-circuit measurements, and classically controlled operations. As an illustrative example, we consider nonlinear dynamics governed by the one-dimensional Burgers' equation, which has broad applications in computational fluid dynamics. In particular, we show that the proposed non-unitary quantum circuits can efficiently represent fluid flow configurations in both laminar and turbulent regimes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, when noise is taken into account, these circuits are advantageous in regimes where two-qubit gate error rates are relatively low compared to idling error rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hardware-friendly quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) decoders are commonly built upon belief propagation (BP) processing. Yet, quantum degeneracy often prevents BP from achieving reliable convergence. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose the restart belief (RB) decoder, an iterative BP-based algorithm inspired by branch-and-bound optimization principles. From our analysis we find that the RB decoder represents both the fastest and most accurate decoding algorithm applicable to QLDPC codes to date, conceived with the explicit goal of approaching error correction up to the code distance.</description>

      <title>Switching rates in Kerr resonator with two-photon dissipation and driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically investigate the switching rate in a two-photon driven Kerr oscillator with finite detuning and two-photon dissipation. This system exhibits quantum bistability and supports a logical manifold for a bosonic qubit. Using Kramer's theory together with the $P$-representation, we derive an analytical expression for the bit-flip error rate within the potential-barrier approximation. The agreement is demonstrated between analytical calculations and numerical simulations obtained by diagonalization of the Liouvillian superoperator. In the purely dissipative limit, the switching rate increases monotonically with detuning, as the two metastable states approach each other in phase space. However, the exponential contribution to the bit-flip rate exhibits a nontrivial dependence on system parameters, extending beyond the naive scaling with the average photon number. In the presence of large Kerr nonlinearity, the switching rate becomes a nonmonotonic function of the detuning and reaches a minimum at a finite detuning. This effect arises because detuning lowers the activation barrier for weak nonlinearity but increases it for large ones, ensuring a minimum of the switching-rate at nonzero detuning. These results establish key conditions for optimizing the performance of critical cat qubits and are directly relevant for the design of scalable superconducting bosonic quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>HPC-Accelerated Simulation and Calibration for Silicon Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers (QCs) have the potential to solve critical problems significantly faster than today's most advanced supercomputers. One major challenge in realizing this technology is designing robust electrostatic pulses to realize unitaries on qubits. Current practice when calibrating unitaries involves recursive experimentation to find the highest-fidelity pulses. To accelerate this process for experimentalists, we implement Qalibrate, a fast, JAX-enabled simulator that generates pulses given target unitaries. Specifically, we generate a propagator that models the time evolution of three-electron spin qubits and integrate our gradient-based optimizer to generate the pulses. The simulation involves solving the Lindblad master equation, which we parallelize by employing an approximation of the time evolution called the Magnus expansion. Qalibrate shows up to a 34x speedup compared to an existing ODE simulator, making progress towards generating robust pulses for n-qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Floquet Recurrences in the Double Kicked Top</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study exact quantum recurrences in the double kicked top (DKT), a driven spin model that extends the quantum kicked top (QKT) by introducing an additional time-reversal symmetry-breaking kick. Reformulating its dynamics in terms of effective parameters $k_r$ and $k_\theta$, we analytically show exact periodicity of the Floquet operator for $k_r = j\pi/2$ and $k_r = j\pi/4$ with distinct periods for integer and half-odd integer $j$. These exact recurrences were found to be independent of $k_\theta$. The long-time-averaged entanglement and fidelity rate function show dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) for $k_r = j\pi/2$ at time-reversal symmetric cases $k_\theta = \pm k_r$. In the other time-reversal symmetric case $k_\theta = 0$, the DQPT exists only for a half-odd integer $j$. Using level statistics, a smooth transition is observed from integrable to non-integrable nature as $k_r$ is changed away from $j\pi/2$. Our work demonstrates that regular and chaotic regimes can be controlled for any system size by tuning $k_r$ and $k_\theta$, making the DKT a useful platform for quantum control and information processing applications.</description>

      <title>The Intrinsic Angular - Momentum of Particles and the Resolution of the Spin-Statistics Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional Standard Quantum Mechanics (SQM) theory is unable to solve the Spin-s problem, i.e., to justify the utterly important "Pauli Exclusion Principle". A complete and straightforward solution of the Spin-Statistics problem is presented based on the "Weyl Integrable Quantum Mechanics" (WIQM) theory. This theory provides a Weyl-gauge invariant formulation of the Standard Quantum Mechanics and reproduces successfully, with no restrictions, the full set of the quantum mechanical processes, including the formulation of Dirac's or Schr\"{o}dinger's equation, of Heisenberg's uncertainty relations, and of the nonlocal EPR correlations. etc. When the Weyl Integrable Quantum Mechanics is applied to a system made of many identical particles with spin, an additional constant property of all elementary particles enters naturally into play: the "intrinsic helicity", or the "intrinsic angular - momentum". This additional particle property, not considered by Standard Quantum Mechanics, determines the correct Spin-Statistics Connection (SSC) observed in Nature. All this leads to the consideration of a novel, most complete (in the EPR sense) quantum mechanical theory.</description>

      <title>Above-Unity Coherent Cooperativity of Tin-Vacancy Centers in Diamond Photonic Crystal Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tin-vacancy center in diamond (SnV) has emerged as a compelling building block for realizing next-generation quantum networks thanks to its excellent optical and spin properties. Coupling to photonic crystal cavities (PCCs) promises to further enhance the SnV light-matter interface and unlock a diverse range of entanglement generation protocols. Recent pioneering experiments showing Purcell enhancement of SnV centers in PCCs underscore this potential. However, optical coupling that is coherent - the key ingredient for use in quantum protocols - has so far remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate above-unity coherent cooperativity of SnV centers embedded in photonic crystal cavities. We fabricate free-standing PCCs using a quasi-isotropic undercut. Across two samples, we conduct room-temperature characterizations, measuring resonances for 327 cavities, with an average quality factor exceeding $Q = 1.0(3) \times 10^4$. Two cavity-coupled emitters are examined in detail, exhibiting quality factors up to $Q = 25.4(4) \times 10^3$ and Purcell-reduced lifetimes corresponding to cooperativities up to $C = 20.6(11)$. Furthermore, the single SnVs are observed to strongly modulate the cavity transmission with an extinction contrast up to $98.8(4) \%$ on resonance. Finally, SnV linewidth measurements reveal above-unity coherent cooperativities in both devices, with the highest value being $C_\mathrm{coh} = 8.3(12)$. These results open the door to using cavity-coupled SnV centers as efficient, coherent light-matter interfaces for future quantum networks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fidelity estimation between two quantum states is crucial for quantum computation and information science. However, an efficacious method for this, especially for mixed states and higher-dimensional density matrices, remains elusive. While there are many existing algorithms on computing the fidelity between two pure states, there is not much work on how to obtain the fidelity between two mixed states. Here, we propose an efficient quantum algorithm for the fidelity estimation, based primarily on the density matrix exponentiation and interferometeric scheme for mixed states, with a time complexity of $O(N^2/\epsilon^7)$, where $N$ is the system size and $\epsilon$ is a precision error. Our algorithm may serve as a resource-efficient technique to deduce fidelity of any two (pure or mixed) unknown or known quantum states, when the density matrices of the quantum states commute with each other.</description>

      <title>Taming Barren Plateaus in Arbitrary Parameterized Quantum Circuits without Sacrificing Expressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13408v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have enabled a wide range of applications on near-term quantum devices. However, existing PQC architectures face several challenges, among which the ``barren plateaus" phenomenon is particularly prominent. In such cases, the loss function concentrates exponentially with increasing system size, thereby hindering effective parameter optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a general and hardware-efficient method for eliminating barren plateaus in an arbitrary PQC. Specifically, our approach achieves this by inserting a layer of easily implementable quantum channels into the original PQC, each channel requiring only one ancilla qubit and four additional gates, yielding a modified PQC (MPQC) that is provably at least as expressive as the original PQC and, under mild assumptions, is guaranteed to be free from barren plateaus. Furthermore, by appropriately adjusting the structure of MPQCs, we rigorously prove that any parameter in the original PQC can be made trainable. Importantly, the absence of barren plateaus in MPQCs is robust against realistic noise, making our approach directly applicable to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Numerically, we demonstrate the practicality of our method by modifying a commonly used PQC for thermal-state preparation. The results show that {barren plateaus are effectively eliminated} in this class of circuits with up to 100 qubits and 2400 layers, whereas the original ansatz suffers from severe gradient vanishing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum cryptography remains a topic of enduring scientific and educational interest. Here, we present a clear and accessible framework for exploring the six-state quantum key distribution protocol, an enhanced three-basis extension of the BB84 scheme that combines optical experiments with computational analysis. Designed for testing quantum communication protocols through emulation, this approach provides a robust and cost-effective platform that highlights the fundamental principles of multi-basis encoding and demonstrates how experimental measurements connect directly to theoretical expectations in a controlled tabletop setting.</description>

      <title>Probing parameters estimation with Gaussian non-commutative measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian quantum states and channels are pivotal across many branches of quantum science and their applications, including the processing and storage of quantum information, the investigation of thermodynamics in the quantum regime, and quantum computation. The great advantage is that Gaussian states are experimentally accessible via their first and second statistical moments. In this work, we investigate parameter estimation for Gaussian states, in which the probe-state preparation stage involves two noncommutative Gaussian measurements on the position and momentum observables, introducing tunable parameters. The influence of these noncommutative Gaussian measurements is investigated through the quantum Fisher information (QFI). We showed that the QFI for characterizing Gaussian channels can be increased by adjusting the uncertainty parameters in the preparation of the probe state. Furthermore, if the probe is initially in a thermal state, probe-state preparation may generate quantum coherence in its energy basis. We showed that not only does the amount of coherence affect the improvement of the QFI, but also the rate of change of the coherence with respect to the parameter to be estimated. The proposed probe-state protocol is applied to two paradigmatic single-mode Gaussian channels, the attenuator and amplification channels, which are building blocks of Gaussian quantum information. Our results contribute to the use of coherence in quantum metrology and are experimentally feasible in quantum-optical devices.</description>

      <title>Machine learning inspired photon number resolution in superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon-number resolved detection with superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) attracts increasing interest, but lacks a systematic framework for interpreting and benchmarking this capability. In this work, we combine principal component analysis (PCA) with a new readout technique to explore the photon-number resolving capabilities of SNSPDs and find that the information of the photon number is contained in a single principal component which approximates the time derivative of the average response trace. We introduce a new confidence metric based on the Bhattacharyya coefficient to quantify the photon-number-resolving capabilities of a detector system and show that this metric can be used to compare different systems. Our analysis and interpretation of the principal components imply that photon-number resolution in SNSPDs can be achieved with moderate hardware requirements in terms of both sample rate (5 GSample/sec) and analog bandwidth (3 GHz) and could be implemented in an FPGA, giving a highly scalable solution for real-time photon counting.</description>

      <title>Spin-Adapted Fermionic Unitaries: From Lie Algebras to Compact Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conservation of symmetries plays a crucial role in both classical and quantum simulations of many-body systems, enabling the tracking of states with specific symmetry properties and leading to substantial reductions in the number of optimization parameters. The design of efficient quantum circuits that enforce all symmetries typically encountered in chemistry has remained elusive, mainly due to the interplay of point group and spin symmetries. By exploiting Lie algebraic techniques, we derive exact product formulas representing symmetry-adapted unitaries. These decompositions allow us to design the most efficient symmetry-preserving quantum circuits to date. Finally, we introduce a minimum universal symmetry-adapted operator pool to further reduce the required quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Software for Quantum Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is a leading candidate for demonstrating practical quantum advantage over classical computation, as it is believed to provide exponentially more compute power than any classical system. It offers new means of studying the behaviour of complex physical systems, for which conventionally software-intensive simulation codes based on numerical high-performance computing are used. Instead, quantum simulations map properties and characteristics of subject systems, for instance chemical molecules, onto quantum devices that then mimic the system under study.
  Currently, the use of these techniques is largely limited to fundamental science, as the overall approach remains tailored for specific problems: We lack infrastructure and modelling abstractions that are provided by the software engineering community for other computational domains.
  In this paper, we identify critical gaps in the quantum simulation software stack-particularly the absence of general-purpose frameworks for model specification, Hamiltonian construction, and hardware-aware mappings. We advocate for a modular model-driven engineering (MDE) approach that supports different types of quantum simulation (digital and analogue), and facilitates automation, performance evaluation, and reusability. Through an example from high-energy physics, we outline a vision for a quantum simulation framework capable of supporting scalable, cross-platform simulation workflows.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous variances of Pauli strings, weighted independence numbers, and a new kind of perfection of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of Pauli stings is well characterized by the graph that encodes its commutatitivity structure, i.e., by its frustration graph. This graph provides a natural interface between graph theory and quantum information, which we explore in this work. We investigate all aspects of this interface for a special class of graphs that bears tight connections between the groundstate structures of a spin systems and topological structure of a graph. We call this class $\hbar$-perfect, as it extends the class of perfect and $h$-perfect graphs.
  Having an $\hbar$-perfect graph opens up several applications: we find efficient schemes for entanglement detection, a connection to the complexity of shadow tomography, tight uncertainty relations and a construction for computing good lower on bounds ground state energies. Conversely this also induces quantum algorithms for computing the independence number. Albeit those algorithms do not immediately promise an advantage in runtime, we show that an approximate Hamilton encoding of the independence number can be achieved with an amount of qubits that typically scales logarithmically in the number of vertices. We also we also determine the behavior of $\hbar$-perfectness under basic graph operations and evaluate their prevalence among all graphs.</description>

      <title>Measurement-based Dynamical Decoupling for Fidelity Preservation on Large-scale Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling (DD) is a key technique for suppressing decoherence and preserving the performance of quantum algorithms. We introduce a measurement-based DD (MDD) protocol that determines control unitary gates from partial measurements of noisy subsystems, with measurement overhead scaling linearly with the number of subsystems. We prove that, under local energy relaxation and dephasing noise, MDD achieves the maximum entanglement fidelity attainable by any DD scheme based on bang-bang operations to first order in evolution time. On the IBM Eagle processor, MDD achieved up to a $450$-fold improvement in the success probability of a $14$-qubit quantum Fourier transform, and improved the accuracy of ground-state energy estimation for $N_2$ in the $56$-qubit sample-based quantum diagonalization compared with the standard XX-pulse DD. These results establish MDD as a scalable and effective approach for suppressing decoherence in large-scale quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Sequences of Bivariate Bicycle Codes from Covering Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that given an instance of a bivariate bicycle (BB) code, it is possible to generate an infinite sequence of new BB codes using increasingly large covering graphs of the original code's Tanner graph. When a BB code has a Tanner graph that is a $h$-fold covering of the base BB code's Tanner graph, we refer to it as a $h$-cover code. We show that for a BB code to be a $h$-cover code, its lattice parameters and defining polynomials must satisfy simple algebraic conditions relative to those of the base code. By extending the graph covering map to a chain map, we show there are induced projection and lifting maps on (co)homology that enable the projection and lifting of logical operators and, in certain cases, automorphisms between the base and the cover code. The search space of cover codes is considerably reduced compared to the full space of possible polynomials and we find that many interesting examples of BB codes, such as the $[[144,12,12]]$ gross code, can be viewed as cover codes. We also apply our method to search for BB codes with weight 8 checks and find many codes, including a $[[64,14,8]]$ and $[[144,14,14]]$ code. For an $h$-cover code of an $[[n,k,d]]$ BB code with parameters $[[n_h = hn, k_h, d_h]]$, we prove that $k_h \geq k$ and $d_h \leq hd$ when $h$ is odd. Furthermore if $h$ is odd and $k_h = k$, we prove the lower bound $d \leq d_h$. We conjecture it is always true that an $h$-cover BB code of a base $[[n,k,d]]$ BB code has parameters $[[n_h = hn, k_h \geq k, d \leq d_h \leq hd]]$. While the focus of this work is on bivariate bicycle codes, we expect these methods to generalise readily to many group algebra codes and to certain code constructions involving hypergraph, lifted, and balanced products.</description>

      <title>Qudit-native simulation of the Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating entangled, many-body quantum systems is notoriously hard, especially in the case of high-dimensional nature of physical underlying objects. In this work, we propose an approach for simulating the Potts model based on the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition that we construct for qudit systems. Specifically, we introduce two qudit-native decomposition schemes: (i) the first utilizes Molmer-Sorensen gate and additional local levels to encode the Potts interactions, while (ii) the second employs an light-shift gate that naturally fits qudit architectures. These decompositions enable a direct and efficient mapping of the Potts model dynamics into hardware-efficient qudit gate sequences for trapped-ion platform. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a Suzuki-Trotter approximation with our evolution-into-gates framework, for detecting the dynamical quantum phase transition. Our results establish a pathway toward qudit-based digital quantum simulation of many-body models and provide a new perspective on probing nonanalytic behavior in high-dimensional quantum many-body models.</description>

      <title>Long-range entanglement and quantum correlations in a multi-frequency comb system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency combs are multimode photonic systems that underlie countless precision sensing and metrology applications. Since their invention over two decades ago, numerous efforts have pushed frequency combs to broader bandwidths and more stable operation. More recently, quantum squeezing and entanglement have been explored in single frequency comb systems for quantum advantages in sensing and signal multiplexing. However, the production of quantum light across multiple frequency combs remains unexplored. In this work, we theoretically explore a mechanism that generates a series of nonlinearly coupled frequency combs through cascaded three-wave upconversion and downconversion processes mediated by a single idler comb. We show how this system generates inter- and intracomb two-mode squeezing and entanglement spanning a very large spectral range, from ultraviolet to mid-IR frequencies. Finally, we show how this system can be engineered to produce on-demand multimode quantum light through covariance matrix optimization. Our findings could enable tunable broadband ghost spectroscopy protocols, squeezing-enhanced pump-probe measurements, and broadband entanglement between spectrally-multiplexed quanta of information.</description>

      <title>Modeling Quantum Noise in Nanolasers using Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random nature of spontaneous emission leads to unavoidable fluctuations in a laser's output. This is often included through random Langevin forces in laser rate equations, but this approach falls short for nanolasers. In this paper, we show that the laser quantum noise can be quantitatively computed for a very broad class of lasers by starting from simple and intuitive rate equations and merely assuming that the number of photons and excited electrons only takes discrete values. The success of the model is explained by showing that it constitutes a Markov chain, which can be derived from the full master equations. We show that in the many-photon limit, the model simplifies to Langevin equations. We perform an extensive comparison of different approaches for computing quantum noise in lasers, identifying the best approach for different system sizes, ranging from nanolasers to macroscopic lasers, and different levels of excitation, i.e., cavity photon number. In particular, we find that the numerical solution to the Langevin equations is inaccurate below the laser threshold, while the laser Markov chain model, on the other hand, is accurate for all pump values and laser sizes when collective emitter effects are excluded.</description>

      <title>Architectural Approaches to Fault-Tolerant Distributed Quantum Computing and Their Entanglement Overheads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault tolerant quantum computation over distributed quantum computing (DQC) platforms requires careful evaluation of resource requirements and noise thresholds. As quantum hardware advances toward modular and networked architectures, various fault tolerant DQC schemes have been proposed, which can be broadly categorized into three architectural types. Type 1 architectures consist of small quantum nodes connected via Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, enabling nonlocal stabilizer measurements. Type 2 architectures distribute a large error correcting code block across multiple modules, with most stabilizer measurements remaining local, except for a small subset at patch boundaries that are performed using nonlocal CNOT gates. Type 3 architectures assign code blocks to distinct modules and can perform fault tolerant operations such as transversal gates, lattice surgery, and teleportation to implement logical operations between code blocks. Using the planar surface code and toric code as representative examples, we analyze how the resource requirements, particularly the number of Bell pairs and the average number of generation attempts, scale with increasing code distance across different architectural designs. This analysis provides valuable insights for identifying architectures well suited to fault tolerant distributed quantum computation under near term hardware and resource constraints.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage in Learning Mixed Unitary Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the task of learning mixed unitary channels using Fisher information, under different quantum resource assumptions including ancilla and concatenation. Our result shows that the asymptotic sample complexity scales as $\frac{r}{d\varepsilon^2}$, where $r$ is the rank of the channel (i.e.\ the number of different unitaries), $d$ is the dimension of the system, and $\varepsilon^2$ is the mean-square error. Thus the critical resource is the ancilla, which mirrors the result in~\cite{chen2022quantum} but in a more precise form, as we point out that $r$ is also important. Additionally, we demonstrate the practical potential of mixed unitary channels by showing that random mixed unitary channels are easy to learn.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing distributed architectures for quantum computing is crucial to scaling up computational power. A key component of such architectures is a scheduler that coordinates operations over a short-range quantum network required to enable the necessary non-local entangling gates between quantum processing units (QPUs). It is desirable to determine schedules of minimum make span, which in the case of networks with constrained resources hinges on their efficient usage. Here we compare and contrast two approaches to solving the make span minimization problem, an approach based on the resource constrained project scheduling (RCPSP) framework, and another based on a greedy heuristic algorithm. The workflow considered is as follows. Firstly, the computational circuit is partitioned and assigned to different QPUs such that the number of nonlocal entangling gates acting across partitions is minimized while the qubit load is nearly uniform on the individual QPUs, which can be accomplished using, e.g., the METIS solver. Secondly, the nonlocal entangling gate requirements with respect to the partitions are identified, and mapped to network operation sequences that deliver the necessary entanglement between the QPUs. Finally, the network operations are scheduled such that the make span is minimized. As illustrative examples, we analyze the implementation of a small instance of the Quantum Fourier Transform algorithm over instances of a simple hub and spoke (star) network architecture comprised of a quantum switch as the hub and QPUs as spokes, each with a finite qubit resource budget. In one instance, our results show the RCPSP approach outperforming the greedy heuristic. In another instance, we find the two performing equally well. Our results thus illustrate the effectiveness of the RCPSP framework, while also underlining the relevance and usefulness of greedy heuristics.</description>

      <title>Ultra Low Overhead Syndrome Extraction for the Steane code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a new performance benchmark for the fault-tolerant syndrome extraction of [[7, 1, 3]] Steane code with a dynamic protocol. Our method is built on two highly optimized circuits derived using fault-equivalent ZX-rewrites: a primary fault-tolerant circuit with 14 CNOTs and an efficient non-fault-tolerant recovery circuit with 11 CNOTs. The protocol uses an adaptive response to internal faults, discarding flagged measurements and falling back to the recovery circuit to correct potentially detrimental errors. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the efficiency of our protocol, reducing the logical error rate per cycle by an average of ~14.3% relative to the optimized Steane method [arXiv:2506.17181] and ~17.7% compared to the Reichardt's three-qubit method [arXiv:1804.06995], the leading prior techniques.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction Codes for Truncated SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct two quantum error correction codes for pure SU(2) lattice gauge theory in the electric basis truncated at the electric flux $j_{\rm max}=1/2$, which are applicable on quasi-1D plaquette chains, 2D honeycomb and 3D triamond and hyperhoneycomb lattices. The first code converts Gauss's law at each vertex into a stabilizer while the second only uses half vertices and is locally the carbon code. Both codes are able to correct single-qubit errors. The electric and magnetic terms in the SU(2) Hamiltonian are expressed in terms of logical gates in both codes. The logical-gate Hamiltonian in the first code exactly matches the spin Hamiltonian for gauge singlet states found in previous work.</description>

      <title>Measurement protocol for detecting correlated topological insulators in synthetic quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators, characterized by symmetry-protected anomalous boundary modes, have been generalized to the strongly correlated regime for both bosonic and fermionic systems. As correlated topological insulators (TI) approach experimental realization in quantum simulators, conventional probes, such as transport measurements, are not easily applicable to these synthetic platforms. In this study, we focus on two examples of correlated TI: a bosonic TI protected by $\mathbb{Z}_2\times U(1)$ symmetry and the fermionic quantum spin Hall insulator protected by time-reversal symmetry. We propose a unified, readily implementable protocol based on measuring the disorder parameter $\langle\exp(\mathrm{i}\theta \hat{Q}_A)\rangle$ for a large subregion $A$, with $\hat{Q}_A$ the total charge operator within $A$. Our key finding is that this quantity exhibits non-analytical dependence on $\theta$ for correlated TI, a signature robust against decoherence. We establish this diagnostic through both numerical simulations and analytical derivations. This protocol is well-suited for implementation on near-term quantum simulation platforms, providing a direct route to experimentally confirm correlated TI.</description>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has drawn significant inspiration from neuroscience to develop artificial neural network (ANN) models. However, these models remain constrained by the Von Neumann architecture and struggle to capture the complexity of the biological brain. Quantum computing, with its foundational principles of superposition, entanglement, and unitary evolution, offers a promising alternative approach to modeling neural dynamics. This paper explores the possibility of a neuro-quantum model of the brain by introducing a stochastic quantum approach that incorporates random fluctuations of neuronal processing within a quantum framework. We propose a mathematical formalization of stochastic quantum neural networks (QNNS), where qubits evolve according to stochastic differential equations inspired by biological neuronal processes. We also discuss challenges related to decoherence, qubit stability, and implications for AI and computational neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Towards autonomous quantum physics research using LLM agents with access to intelligent tools</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in numerous fields of science, yet the initial research questions and targets are still almost always provided by human researchers. AI-generated creative ideas in science are rare and often vague, so that it remains a human task to execute them. Automating idea generation and implementation in one coherent system would significantly shift the role of humans in the scientific process. Here we present AI-Mandel, an LLM agent that can generate and implement ideas in quantum physics. AI-Mandel formulates ideas from the literature and uses a domain-specific AI tool to turn them into concrete experiment designs that can readily be implemented in laboratories. The generated ideas by AI-Mandel are often scientifically interesting - for two of them we have already written independent scientific follow-up papers. The ideas include new variations of quantum teleportation, primitives of quantum networks in indefinite causal orders, and new concepts of geometric phases based on closed loops of quantum information transfer. AI-Mandel is a prototypical demonstration of an AI physicist that can generate and implement concrete, actionable ideas. Building such a system is not only useful to accelerate science, but it also reveals concrete open challenges on the path to human-level artificial scientists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the localization problem in quantum stochastic mechanics. We start from the Edwards model for a particle in a bath of scattering centers and prove static localization of the ground state wavefunction of the particle in a one dimensional square well coupled to Dirac delta like scattering centers in arbitrary but fixed positions. We see how the localization increases for increasing coupling $g$. Then we choose the scattering centers positions as pseudo random numbers with a uniform probability distribution and observe an increase in the localization of the average of the ground state over the many positions realizations. We discuss how this averaging procedure is consistent with a picture of a particle in a Bose-Einstein condensate of of non interacting boson scattering centers interacting with the particle with Dirac delta functions pair potential. We then study the dynamics of the ground state wave function. We conclude with a discussion of the affine quantization version of the Lax model which reduces to a system of contiguous square wells with walls in arbitrary positions independently of the coupling constant $g$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a framework for designing arbitrary high order low-rank schemes for the Lindblad equation with time-dependent Hamiltonians. Our approach is based on nested Picard iterative integrators (NPI) and results in schemes in Kraus form that are completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP). The schemes are amenable to low rank formulations, making them suitable for problems where the matrix rank of the density matrix is small.</description>

      <title>Photonic spin Hall effect in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanics (CMM), which incorporates the magnon-photon and magnon-phonon interactions simultaneously, enables rich physical phenomena, including exceptional-point-enhanced sensing, and offers pathways toward topological transitions and nonreciprocal quantum transformation. These interactions exert a pivotal influence on the optical response of a weak probe field and pave the way for novel applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we consider a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere coupled to a microwave cavity. The magnon mode of the YIG sphere is directly excited through microwave field coupling, whereas the cavity mode is probed via a weak-field interrogation scheme. The direct interaction of a traveling field with the magnon mode induces gain in the system, thereby establishing non-Hermitian dynamics. The parity-time (PT)-symmetric behavior of a hybrid non-Hermitian CMM is designed and investigated. Eigenvalue spectrum analysis demonstrates that a third-order exceptional point (EP_3) emerges under tunable effective magnon-photon coupling when the traveling field is oriented at an angle of \pi/2 relative to the cavity's x-axis. The photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in a reflected probe field is subsequently examined in such a system. Under balanced gain and loss conditions and in the presence of effective magnon-phonon coupling, tunable effective magnon-photon coupling enables coherent control of the PSHE across the broken PT-symmetric phase, at the EP_3, and in the PT-symmetric phase. Investigation reveals that the PSHE can be significantly enhanced or suppressed via effective magnon-photon coupling. The influence of intracavity length on the PSHE is further explored, providing an additional parameter for fine-tuning the transverse shift. These findings establish a direct correspondence between the PSHE and the underlying non-Hermitian eigenvalue spectrum.</description>

      <title>Entanglement degradation of static black holes in effective quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information science has been broadly explored in Einstein gravity and in various modified gravity theories; however, its extension to quantum gravity settings remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, in this paper we investigate the degradation of quantum entanglement of scalar and Dirac fields in the third-type black hole geometry arising from effective quantum gravity, which incorporates generic quantum gravitational corrections beyond classical general relativity. This quantum corrected spacetime is free of a Cauchy horizon and can be cast into a Rindler form in the near-horizon regime, allowing a direct identification of vacuum modes and a clear correspondence with the framework developed for uniformly accelerated observers. Within this framework, we compute the quantum entanglement and mutual information of uniformly entangled detector pairs in terms of the quantum parameter $\tilde{\zeta}$, the mode frequency $\tilde{\omega}$, and Bob's radial position $R_0$. The quantum parameter $\tilde{\zeta}$ consistently weakens the horizon-induced loss of correlations. For scalar fields this effect is pronounced, producing clear departures from the classical behavior, whereas for Dirac fields the familiar correlation pattern remains intact but its degradation is noticeably reduced. Overall, $\tilde{\zeta}$ acts as a universal protective factor against gravitational suppression of quantum correlations. The third-type effective quantum black hole therefore provides a controlled and physically transparent arena for probing how quantum-gravity corrections influence relativistic quantum information.</description>

      <title>The conditional probabilities and the empirical laws in a free scalar QFT in curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike QFT in Minkowski spacetime (QFTM), QFT in curved spacetime (QFTCS) suffers from a conceptual obscurity on the empirical (experimentally verifiable/falsifiable) laws. We propose to employ the notion of prior conditional probabilities to describe a part of the empirical laws of QFTCS. This is interpreted as a quantum conditional probability without no information on the initial state. Hence this notion is expected to be free from the inevitable vagueness of the empirical meaning of quantum states in QFTCS. More generally in quantum physics, this notion seems free from the conceptual problems on state reductions. We confine ourselves to the probabilistic laws of the free scalar fields (Klein-Gordon fields) in curved spacetime, which require some reconsideration on the empirical meaning of the canonical commutation relation (CCR). We give some examples of empirical laws in terms of prior conditional probabilities, concerning the CCR and the free scalar QFTCS.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an all-optical quantum-enhanced diagnostic for electric fields in low-temperature plasmas. Trace amounts of rubidium vapor, added to argon plasma, allow us to produce spectrally narrow electric field-sensitive optical resonances via quantum optical effect of Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency, and to non-invasively measure electric field in plasma with sensitivity exceeding 1 V/cm. By collecting fluorescence from the illuminated region of interest, we reconstruct a 2D spatial profile of the electric field magnitude with $30~\mu$m resolution. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we measured the changes in electric field within the plasma sheath surrounding a biased Langmuir probe tip. This method holds significant potential for studying sheath structures in low-temperature plasmas.</description>

      <title>Dyadic-Chaotic Lifting S-Boxes for Enhanced Physical-Layer Security within 6G Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sixth-Generation (6G) wireless networks will interconnect billions of resource-constrained devices and time-critical services, where classical, fixed, and heavy cryptography strains latency and energy budgets and struggles against large-scale, pre-computation attacks. Physical-Layer Security (PLS) is therefore pivotal to deliver lightweight, information-theoretic protection, but still requires strong, reconfigurable confusion components that can be diversified per slice, session, or device to blunt large-scale precomputation and side-channel attacks. In order to address the above requirement, we introduce the first-ever chaos-lifted substitution box (S-box) for PLS that couples a $\beta$-transformation-driven dynamical system with dyadic conditional sampling to generate time-varying, seedable 8-bit permutations on demand. This construction preserves uniformity via ergodicity, yields full 8-bit bijections, and supports on-the-fly diversification across sessions. The resulting S-box attains optimal algebraic degree 7 on every output bit and high average nonlinearity 102.5 (85% of the 8-bit bound), strengthening resistance to algebraic and linear cryptanalysis. Differential and linear profiling report max DDT entry 10 (probability 0.039) and max linear probability 0.648, motivating deployment within a multi-round cipher with a strong diffusion layer, where the security-to-efficiency trade-off is compelling. Our proposed reconfigurable, lightweight S-box directly fulfills key PLS requirements of 6G networks by delivering fast, hardware-amenable confusion components with built-in agility against evolving threats.</description>

      <title>From Laplacian-to-Adjacency Matrix for Continuous Spins on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of spins and particles on graphs has many applications across different fields, from time dynamics on networks to the solution of combinatorial problems. Here, we study the large n limit of the $O(n)$ model on general graphs, which is considerably more difficult than on regular lattices. Indeed, the loss of translational invariance gives rise to an infinite set of saddle point constraints in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the free energy at low and high temperature $T$ is determined by the spectrum of two crucial objects from graph theory: the Laplacian matrix at low $T$ and the Adjacency matrix at high $T$. Their interplay is studied in several classes of graphs. For regular lattices the two coincide. We obtain an exact solution on trees, where the Lagrange multipliers interestingly depend solely on the number of nearest neighbors. For decorated lattices, the singular part of the free energy is governed by the Laplacian spectrum, whereas this is true for the full free energy only in the zero temperature limit. Finally, we discuss a bipartite fully connected graph to highlight the importance of a finite coordination number in these results. Results for quantum spin models on a loopless graph are also presented.</description>

      <title>Vortex states and entanglement properties in multiphoton pair production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the multiphoton pair production in circularly polarized field via two level model. There appears obvious discrete ring structures in the momentum distribution of the created particles, in which the ring radius is mainly controlled by the number of the photons absorbed in the creation with the energy conservation and could also be modulated by the spin of the created pair. These multiphoton rings become narrower when both of the pair particles' spin are aligned with the direction of the field rotation, and become broader if both spin are antiparallel to that direction. This spin-modulation can be simply understood with the angular momentum conservation, as less orbital angular momentum from the absorbed photons would be transferred to the created particles if their spins are aligned with the field rotation. The orbital angular momentum of the created particles is manifested as the vortex structure in the phase of the momentum distribution, and valued as the topological charge of this phase vortex. We also study the spin entanglement between the created particles, and reveal that the entanglement becomes stronger with the increase of the particles' transverse momentum, and gets sharp peak in the transition between different multiphoton rings, where the topological charge of the phase vortex is changed.</description>

      <title>Small clusters of He atoms in finite-cutoff EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small clusters of $^4$He atoms provide a paradigmatic setting for exploring universal phenomena in few-body quantum systems with large scattering length. Their weakly bound states serve as ideal test cases for studying Efimov physics and the emergence of universality beyond the three-body sector. In this work, we investigate few-$^4$He systems within a finite-cutoff effective field theory (EFT) framework. The EFT interactions are calibrated to reproduce low-energy observables obtained from the realistic LM2M2 potential, enabling a direct and systematic comparison between the two approaches. We demonstrate that, for suitably chosen finite cutoffs, the empirical effective range is accurately reproduced already at leading order, achieving next-to-leading-order precision without explicit higher-order corrections. Using these interactions, we solve the Schr\"odinger equation for systems of a few atoms, obtaining binding energies and scattering observables in excellent agreement with results derived from realistic interatomic potentials. In particular, we compute atom--tetramer scattering parameters and binding energies of clusters up to eight atoms, thereby extending the EFT description to larger helium systems. Our findings establish a quantitative bridge between realistic helium potentials and finite-cutoff EFT, showing that the latter provides an efficient and predictive framework for describing few-body universality in weakly bound quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Full counting statistics for boundary driven transport in presence of correlated gain and loss channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the major advances of quantum technology is the engineering of complex quantum channels in lattice systems that paves the way for a variety of novel non-equilibrium phenomena. For a boundary driven lattice with such engineered quantum channels, the analysis of the full counting statistics of current across boundaries has received limited attention. In this work, we consider a boundary driven free fermionic lattice with carefully engineered correlated gain and loss channels and obtain the cumulant generating function of the steady-state particle current. We also discuss the limit for simplifying the correlated gain-loss channel to a local gain-loss channel and obtain the average current and its fluctuation in such cases. Generally, in the presence of gain-loss, the current statistics are different at the two ends of the lattice. Hence, for both local and correlated gain-loss, we devise the conditions for which the statistics can coincide, giving rise to a $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric balanced gain-loss scenario. A striking difference between the correlated gain-loss and their local counterpart is the emergence of nonreciprocity in the system and we observe that it has a dramatic impact in the current as well as fluctuations. Our work therefore provides interesting insights about the importance of engineered dissipators in boundary driven systems.</description>

      <title>Electron Tunneling Enhances Thermal Conductance through Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of interfaces in semiconductor devices substantially hinders thermal transport, contributing disproportionately to the overall thermal resistance. However, approaches to enhance interfacial thermal transport remain scarce without changing the interface structure, as the intrinsic electron and phonon properties of constituent materials set an upper limit. Here, we find a new thermal transport pathway, electronic heat tunneling, to enhance interfacial thermal conductance through metal-insulator-semiconductor junctions. By applying photoexcitation or bias voltage, we observe remarkable thermal conductance increases in operando, opening a new channel for efficient interfacial heat dissipation. The electron quantum tunneling pathway is parallel to conventional phonon-mediated interfacial thermal transport, and violates the Wiedemann-Franz law since this pathway deviates from the paradigm of diffusive transport. Moreover, we develop a tunneling mismatch model to describe the enhanced thermal conductance, originating from tunneling heat flux. Our Letter demonstrates a previously unexplored heat transport mechanism to enhance thermal conductance, bypassing the need for interface engineering. These findings emphasize the essential need to understand semiconductor thermal properties under realistic operating conditions.</description>

      <title>QPU Micro-Kernels for Stencil Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce QPU micro-kernels: shallow quantum circuits that perform a stencil node update and return a Monte Carlo estimate from repeated measurements. We show how to use them to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) explicitly discretized on a computational stencil. From this point of view, the QPU serves as a sampling accelerator. Each micro-kernel consumes only stencil inputs (neighbor values and coefficients), runs a shallow parameterized circuit, and reports the sample mean of a readout rule. The resource footprint in qubits and depth is fixed and independent of the global grid. This makes micro-kernels easy to orchestrate from a classical host and to parallelize across grid points. We present two realizations. The Bernoulli micro-kernel targets convex-sum stencils by encoding values as single-qubit probabilities with shot allocation proportional to stencil weights. The branching micro-kernel prepares a selector over stencil branches and applies addressed rotations to a single readout qubit. In contrast to monolithic quantum PDE solvers that encode the full space-time problem in one deep circuit, our approach keeps the classical time loop and offloads only local updates. Batching and in-circuit fusion amortize submission and readout overheads. We test and validate the QPU micro-kernel method on two PDEs commonly arising in scientific computing: the Heat and viscous Burgers' equations. On noiseless quantum circuit simulators, accuracy improves as the number of samples increases. On the IBM Brisbane quantum computer, single-step diffusion tests show lower errors for the Bernoulli realization than for branching at equal shot budgets, with QPU micro-kernel execution dominating the wall time.</description>

      <title>The role of interaction in matter wave optics with motional states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matter-wave optics is often viewed as a linear analogue of photonics, where noninteracting particles are coherently split, diffracted, and recombined, and interference arises from single-particle coherence. In ultracold quantum gases, however, interactions are intrinsic and can rival or exceed kinetic and optical energy scales. This drives matter-wave optics into a nonlinear regime: diffraction and momentum distributions become interaction-dependent, interference contrast degrades or collapses, and revival dynamics appear. In the mean time, interactions can generate squeezing and entanglement, enabling sensitivities beyond the standard quantum limit. We showcase representative examples - covering diffraction, splitting, and interferometry - that illustrate how interactions reshape the basic elements of matter-wave optics and open new opportunities for nonlinear quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Giant number-parity effect and scalable spin squeezing in Luttinger liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite-size quantum spin systems can be magnetized by the application of a symmetry-breaking field, but in general their symmetry is expected to be restored once the field is turned off adiabatically. Recently (F. Caleca et al., arXiv:2412.15493) we have shown that systems of half-integer spins with an odd number of sites and a parity-preserving Hamiltonian can retain a finite magnetization, hence exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) at finite size. Here we generalize this phenomenon to spin chains whose low-energy physics (in zero field) realizes a Luttinger-liquid phase. We observe that odd-sized chains can exhibit a phenomenon of finite-size quasi-SSB, in which a net sub-extensive magnetization, $M \sim N^{1-1/(4K)}$ is retained, where $N$ is the number of sites and $K$ the Luttinger exponent. Interestingly, the states prepared by turning off the symmetry-breaking field quasi-adiabatically display scalable spin squeezing -- namely stronger the bigger the system -- regardless of the parity of $N$. The scaling of the squeezing parameter is dictated again by the Luttinger exponent, $\xi_R^2 \sim N^{-1+1/(2K)}$. This result shows that scalable quantum correlations with metrological significance, associated typically with high-dimensional systems, can be found as well in gapless one-dimensional ones; and they are a direct consequence of the critical nature of Luttinger liquids.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{PT}$-like phase transitions from square roots of supersymmetric Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for realizing $\mathcal{PT}$-like phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems without imposing explicit parity--time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. The approach is based on constructing a Hamiltonian as the square root of a supersymmetric partner energy-shifted by a constant. This formulation naturally leads to bipartite dynamics with balanced gain and loss and can incorporate non-reciprocal couplings. The resulting systems exhibit entirely real spectra over a finite parameter range precisely when the corresponding passive Hamiltonian lacks a zero mode. As the non-Hermitian parameter representing gain and loss increases, the spectrum undergoes controlled real-to-complex transitions at second-order exceptional points. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework through several examples, including well-known models such as the Hatano--Nelson (HN) and complex Su--Schrieffer--Heeger (cSSH) lattices. Extending the formalism to $q$-commuting matrices further enables the systematic realization of higher-order exceptional points in systems with unidirectional couplings. Overall, this work uncovers new links between non-Hermitian physics and supersymmetry, offering a practical route to engineer photonic arrays with tunable spectral properties beyond what is achievable with explicit $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry.</description>

      <title>Floquet Superheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven many-body systems generally heat towards a featureless 'infinite-temperature' state. As an alternative to uniform heating in a clean system, here we establish a Floquet superheating regime, where fast heating nucleates at ''hot spots" generated by rare fluctuations in the local energy with respect to an appropriate effective Hamiltonian. Striking macroscopic consequences include exceptionally long-lived prethermalization and non-ergodic bimodal distributions of macroscopic observables. Superheating is predicated on a heating rate depending strongly on the local fluctuation; in our example, this is supplied by a sharp state-selective spin-echo, where the energy absorption is strongly suppressed for low-energy states, while thermal fluctuations open up excessive heating channels. A simple phenomenological theory is developed to show the existence of a critical droplet size, which incorporates heating by the driving field as well as the heat current out of the droplet. Our results shine light on a new heating mechanism and suggest new routes towards stabilizing non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases in Non-Hermitian Nonlinear-Eigenvalue Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of topological phases has ushered in a new era of condensed matter physics and revealed a variety of natural and artificial materials. They obey the bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC), which guarantees the emergence of boundary states with non-zero topological invariants in the bulk. A wide attention has been paid to extending topological phases to nonlinear and non-Hermitian systems. However, the BBC and topological invariants of non-Hermitian nonlinear systems remain largely unexplored. Here, we establish a complete BBC and topological characterization of the topological phases in a class of non-Hermitian nonlinear-eigenvalue systems by introducing an auxiliary system. We restore the BBC broken by non-Hermiticity via employing the generalized Brillouin zone on the auxiliary system. Remarkably, we discover that the interplay between non-Hermiticity and nonlinearity creates an exotic complex-band topological phase that coexists with the real-band topological phase. Our results enrich the family of nonlinear topological phases and lay a foundation for exploring novel topological physics in metamaterial systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice spin models featuring kinetic constraints constitute a paradigmatic setting for the investigation of glassiness and localization phenomena. The intricate dynamical behavior of these systems is a result of the dramatically reduced connectivity between many-body configurations. This truncation of transition pathways often leads to a fragmentation of the Hilbert space, yielding highly collective and therefore often slow dynamics. Moreover, this mechanism supports the formation of characteristic elementary excitations, which we investigate here theoretically in a two-dimensional Rydberg lattice gas. We explore their properties as a function of interaction strength and range, and illustrate how they can be experimentally probed via sideband spectroscopy. Here, we show that the transition rate to certain delocalized superposition states of elementary excitations displays collective many-body enhancement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Lieb--Liniger model of interacting one-dimensional bosons coupled to a localized impurity, modeled by a delta barrier. While the Lieb--Liniger gas is integrable, the impurity breaks integrability and induces a transition towards quantum chaos. We show that the low-energy spectrum exhibits random-matrix statistics, in striking contrast to the Bohigas--Giannoni--Schmit conjecture, where chaotic behavior typically emerges at high energy. For two bosons, the odd-parity sector remains integrable, whereas the even-parity sector displays clear signatures of chaos at low energy and a crossover back to quasi-integrable behavior at higher energies. For three bosons, both parity sectors exhibit spectral statistics close to chaos at low energy. We argue that this unconventional form of many-body quantum chaos originates from diffractive processes induced by the impurity.</description>

We prove that the cumulative distributions function of the ballistically scaled position $\mathbb X(n)/{n}$ after $n$ steps converges at a rate of $n^{-1/3}$ in the L\'evy metric as $n\to\infty$. In the special case of step-coin quantum walks with two-dimensional coin space, we recover the same convergence rate for the supremum distance and prove optimality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has attracted growing interest with the rapid parallel advances in large-scale classical machine learning and quantum technologies. Similar to classical machine learning, QML models also face challenges arising from the scarcity of labeled data, particularly as their scale and complexity increase. Here, we introduce self-supervised pretraining of quantum representations that reduces reliance on labeled data by learning invariances from unlabeled examples. We implement this paradigm on a programmable trapped-ion quantum computer, encoding images as quantum states. In situ contrastive pretraining on hardware yields a representation that, when fine-tuned, classifies image families with higher mean test accuracy and lower run-to-run variability than models trained from random initialization. Performance improvement is especially significant in regimes with limited labeled training data. We show that the learned invariances generalize beyond the pretraining image samples. Unlike prior work, our pipeline derives similarity from measured quantum overlaps and executes all training and classification stages on hardware. These results establish a label-efficient route to quantum representation learning, with direct relevance to quantum-native datasets and a clear path to larger classical inputs.</description>

      <title>Density of reflection resonances in one-dimensional disordered Schr\"{o}dinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytic approach to evaluating the density $\rho ({\cal E},\Gamma)$ of complex resonance poles with real energies $\mathcal{E}$ and widths $\Gamma$ in the pure reflection problem from a one-dimensional disordered sample with white-noise random potential. We start with establishing a general link between the density of resonances and the distribution of the reflection coefficient $r=|R(E,L)|^2$, where $R(E,L)$ is the reflection amplitude, at {\it complex} energies $E = {\cal E} +i\eta$, identifying the parameter $\eta&gt;0$ with the uniform rate of absorption within the disordered medium. We show that leveraging this link allows for a detailed analysis of the resonance density in the weak disorder limit. In particular, for a (semi)infinite sample, it yields an explicit formula for $\rho ({\cal E},\Gamma)$, describing the crossover from narrow to broad resonances in a unified way. Similarly, our approach yields a limiting formula for $\rho ({\cal E},\Gamma)$ in the opposite case of a short disordered sample, with size much smaller than the localization length. This regime seems to have not been systematically addressed in the literature before, with the corresponding analysis requiring an accurate and rather non-trivial implementation of WKB-like asymptotics in the scattering problem. Finally, we study the resonance statistics numerically for the one-dimensional Anderson tight-binding model and compare the results with our analytic expressions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard Model through Stochastic Calculus and Girsanov Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the methodology of our recent paper 'The Dynamics of the Hubbard Model through Stochastic Calculus and Girsanov Transformation' [1] to thermodynamic correlation functions in the Fermi-Hubbard model. They can be obtained from a stochastic differential equation (SDE) system. To this SDE system, a Girsanov transformation can be applied. This has the effect that the usual determinant or pfaffian which shows up in a pfaffian quantum Monte Carlo (PfQMC) representation [2] basically gets absorbed into the new integration variables and information from that pfaffian moves into the drift part of the transformed SDE system. While the PfQMC representation depends heavily on the choice of how the quartic interaction has been factorized into quadratic quantities in the beginning, the Girsanov transformed formula has the very remarkable property that it is nearly independent of that choice, the drift part of the transformed SDE system as well as a remaining exponential which has the obvious meaning of energy are always the same and do not depend on the Hubbard-Stratonovich details. The resulting formula may serve as a starting point for further theoretical or numerical investigations. Here we consider the spin-spin correlation at half-filling on a bipartite lattice and obtain an analytical proof that the signs of these correlations have to be of antiferromagnetic type, at arbitrary temperatures. Also, by checking against available benchmark data [3], we find that approximate ground state energies can be obtained from an ODE system. This may even hold for exact ground state energies, but future work would be required to prove or disprove this. As in [1], the methodology is generic and can be applied to arbitrary quantum many body or quantum field theoretical models.</description>

      <title>A High-Efficiency Three-Stroke Quantum Isochoric Heat Engine: From Infinite Potential Wells to Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a three-stroke quantum isochoric cycle that functions as a heat engine operating between two thermal reservoirs. Implemented for a particle confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the cycle's performance is benchmarked against the classical three-stroke triangular and isochoric engines. We find that the quantum isochoric cycle achieves a higher efficiency than both classical counterparts and also surpasses the efficiency of the recently proposed three-stroke quantum isoenergetic cycle. Owing to its reduced number of strokes, the design substantially lowers control complexity in nanoscale thermodynamic devices, offering a more feasible route to experimental realization compared to conventional four-stroke architectures. We further evaluate the cycle in graphene-based systems under an external magnetic field, including monolayer graphene (MLG), AB-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG), and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at both magic and non-magic twist angles. Among these platforms, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) attains the highest efficiency at fixed work output, highlighting its promise for quantum thermodynamic applications.</description>

      <title>Controlled Gate Networks: Theory and Application to Eigenvalue Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13557v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new scheme for quantum circuit design called controlled gate networks. Rather than trying to reduce the complexity of individual unitary operations, the new strategy is to toggle between all of the unitary operations needed with the fewest number of gates. We present the general theory of controlled gate networks and show that, under quite general conditions, it can significantly reduce the number of two-qubit gates needed to produce linear combinations of unitary operators. The first example we consider is a variational subspace calculation for a two-qubit system. The second example is estimating the eigenvalues of a two-qubit Hamiltonian via the rodeo algorithm using operators that we call controlled reversal gates. We use the Quantinuum H1-2 and IBM Perth devices to realize the quantum circuits. The third example is the application of controlled gate networks to the controlled time evolution of a free nucleon on a three-dimensional lattice. For all of the examples, we show very substantial reductions in the number of two-qubit gates required. Our work demonstrates that controlled gate networks are a useful tool for reducing gate complexity in quantum algorithms for quantum many-body problems such as those relevant to nuclear physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05930v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imperfect bit-and-basis encoders compromise the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems via modulation flaws, side channels and inter-pulse correlations, which invalidate standard security proofs. Existing results addressing such imperfections suffer from critical limitations: they either consider only specific flaws, offer an unreasonably poor performance, or require the protocol to be run very slowly. Here, we present a finite-key security proof approach against coherent attacks that incorporates general bit-and-basis encoding imperfections (including modulation flaws, side channels and inter-pulse correlations) while achieving significantly better performances than previous approaches and requiring only partial characterization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph states are central resources for quantum information processing, supporting applications in computation, communication, and error correction. In photonic systems, they are typically assembled from smaller entangled states using probabilistic fusion gates, which demand many photons and suffer from low success rates. We present an optimized scheme for directly generating caterpillar graph states (CGSs) -- essential resource states for constructing high-dimensional lattice graph states -- using only single-photon sources, linear optics, and heralded measurements. Based on the linear quantum graph (LQG) picture, our method produces CGSs efficiently and scalably. For CGSs of length $l\ge 3$, it requires $l-2$ fewer photons and achieves a success rate $2^{l-2}$ times higher than fusion-based approaches. These results demonstrate that the LQG picture provides a powerful and flexible route for realizing complex photonic graph states with minimal resources.</description>

      <title>Extended Wigner's friend paradoxes do not require nonlocal correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extended Wigner's friend no-go theorems provide a modern lens for investigating the measurement problem, by making precise the challenges that arise when one attempts to model agents as dynamical quantum systems. Most such no-go theorems studied to date, such as the Frauchiger-Renner argument and the Local Friendliness argument, are explicitly constructed using quantum correlations that violate Bell inequalities. In this work, we show that such correlations are not necessary for having extended Wigner's friend paradoxes, by constructing a no-go theorem utilizing a proof of the failure of noncontextuality. The argument hinges on a novel metaphysical assumption (which we term Commutation Irrelevance) that is a natural extension of a key assumption going into the Frauchiger and Renner's no-go theorem.</description>

      <title>Monogamy relations for relativistically causal correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-signalling conditions encode minimal requirements that any (quantum) systems must satisfy in order to be consistent with special relativity. Recent works have argued that in scenarios involving more that two parties, correlations compatible with relativistic causality do not have to satisfy all possible non-signalling conditions but only a subset of them. Here we show that correlations satisfying only this subset of constraints have to satisfy highly non-local monogamy relations between the effects of space-like separated random variables. These monogamy relations take the form of entropic inequalities between the various systems and we give a general method to derive them. Using these monogamy relations we refute previous suggestions for physical mechanisms that could lead to relativistically causal correlations, demonstrating that such mechanisms would lead to superluminal signalling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At continuous phase transitions, quantum many-body systems exhibit scale-invariance and complex, emergent universal behavior. Most strikingly, at a quantum critical point, correlations decay as a power law, with exponents determined by a set of universal scaling dimensions. Experimentally probing such power-law correlations is extremely challenging, owing to the complex interplay between decoherence, the vanishing energy gap, and boundary effects. Here, we employ a Rydberg quantum simulator to adiabatically prepare critical ground states of both a one-dimensional ring and a two-dimensional square lattice. By accounting for and tuning the openness of our quantum system, which is well-captured by the introduction of a single phenomenological length scale, we are able to directly observe power-law correlations and extract the corresponding scaling dimensions. Moreover, in two dimensions, we observe a decoupling between phase transitions in the bulk and on the boundary, allowing us to identify two distinct boundary universality classes. Our work demonstrates that direct adiabatic preparation of critical states in quantum simulators can complement recent approaches to studying quantum criticality using the Kibble-Zurek mechanism or digital quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>A Search for Classical Subsystems in Quantum Worlds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoherence and einselection have been effective in explaining several features of an emergent classical world from an underlying quantum theory. However, the theory assumes a particular factorization of the global Hilbert space into constituent system and environment subsystems, as well as specially constructed Hamiltonians. In this work, we take a systematic approach to discover, given a fixed Hamiltonian, (potentially) several factorizations (or tensor product structures) of a global Hilbert space that admit a quasi-classical description of subsystems in the sense that certain states (the "pointer states") are robust to entanglement. We show that every Hamiltonian admits a pointer basis in the factorization where the energy eigenvectors are separable. Furthermore, we implement an algorithm that allows us to discover a multitude of factorizations that admit pointer states and use it to explore these quasi-classical "realms" for both random and structured Hamiltonians. We also derive several analytical forms that the Hamiltonian may take in such factorizations, each with its unique set of features. Our approach has several implications: it enables us to derive the division into quasi-classical subsystems, demonstrates that decohering subsystems do not necessarily align with our classical notion of locality, and challenges ideas expressed by some authors that the propensity of a system to exhibit classical dynamics relies on minimizing the interaction between subsystems. From a quantum foundations perspective, these results lead to interesting ramifications for relative-state interpretations. From a quantum engineering perspective, these results may be useful in characterizing decoherence free subspaces and other passive error avoidance protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16503v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of quantum states at exceptional points and at critical points associated with quantum phase transitions is intriguing yet puzzling. In this study, we present an alternative method for obtaining the Berry potentials using the evolution generator along the parameter induced dimension and demonstrate that they are singular at these critical points. Although these singularities may appear to indicate a breakdown in quantum state evolution, we show that the information carried by quantum states evolving across these critical points is not destroyed. Specifically, when the evolution generator of the full Hilbert space bundle is taken into account, the quantum states remain insensitive to the critical points. In physical terms, it's similar to the classical image of an object smoothly passing through a black hole's event horizon. Further similarities between exceptional points and quantum phase transitions are explored in this work.</description>

Abstract: Measurement-induced quantum computation with continuous-variable cluster states utilizes teleportation propagating the states through the cluster accompanied by non-Gaussian measurements and feedforward control. We analyze such propagation of a quantum non-Gaussian state with nonlinear squeezing through a small cluster state and show that when a nonlinear feedforward is involved in the teleportation protocol, higher nonlinear squeezing can be transferred. In a probabilistic regime, the improvement can be manifested even with current experimental resources. Better processing of non-Gaussian states can bring us closer to the necessary interplay between cluster states and non-Gaussianity required by quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametrized and random unitary (or orthogonal) $n$-qubit circuits play a central role in quantum information. As such, one could naturally assume that circuits implementing symplectic transformations would attract similar attention. However, this is not the case, as $\mathbb{SP} d/2)$ -- the group of $d\times d$ unitary symplectic matrices -- has thus far been overlooked. In this work, we aim at starting to fill this gap. We begin by presenting a universal set of generators $\mathcal{G}$ for the symplectic algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(d/2)$, consisting of one- and two-qubit Pauli operators acting on neighboring sites in a one-dimensional lattice. Here, we uncover two critical differences between such set, and equivalent ones for unitary and orthogonal circuits. Namely, we find that the operators in $\mathcal{G}$ cannot generate arbitrary local symplectic unitaries and that they are not translationally invariant. We then review the Schur-Weyl duality between the symplectic group and the Brauer algebra, and use tools from Weingarten calculus to prove that Pauli measurements at the output of Haar random symplectic circuits can converge to Gaussian processes. As a by-product, such analysis provides us with concentration bounds for Pauli measurements in circuits that form $t$-designs over $\mathbb{SP}(d/2)$. To finish, we present tensor-network tools to analyze shallow random symplectic circuits, and we use these to numerically show that computational-basis measurements anti-concentrate at logarithmic depth.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Quantum States: A Pilot Study on Problem Solving in Quantum Information Science Education</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field of quantum information science and technology, a major obstacle is the need to understand advanced mathematics to solve complex problems. Current findings in educational research suggest that incorporating visualizations into problem-solving settings can have beneficial effects on students' performance and cognitive load compared to relying solely on symbolic problem-solving content. Visualizations like the (dimensional) circle notation enable us to represent not only single-qubit but also more complex multi-qubit states, entanglement, and quantum algorithms. In this pilot study, we aim to take an initial step toward identifying the contexts in which students benefit from the presentation of visualizations of single- and multi-qubit systems in addition to mathematical formalism. For this purpose, we propose a set of test items and a comprehensive methodology to assess students' performance and cognitive load when solving problems. This is a pilot investigation with a large breadth of questions intended to generate hypotheses and guide larger-scale, more focused studies in the future. Specifically, we compare two approaches: using the mathematical-symbolic Dirac Notation alone and using it in combination with the (dimensional) circle notation. In surveys in one-, two- and three-qubit systems, we gather qualitative data from five, five and two think-aloud interviews, identifying problems that students encounter and their problem-solving strategies. In addition, we analyze quantitative data (performance and cognitive load) from 23, 27 and 17 participants in surveys on one-, two- and three-qubit systems recruited mainly from our quantum computing lectures. We find that most of the test items are appropriate for a heterogeneous target group, as they can differentiate between participants in terms of performance and time taken...</description>

      <title>Exploring quantum weight enumerators from the $n$-qubit parallelized SWAP test</title>

Abstract: Quantum weight enumerators are fundamental tools for analyzing quantum error-correcting codes and multipartite entanglement, offering insights into the existence of quantum error-correcting codes and $k$-uniform states. In this work, we establish a connection between quantum weight enumerators and the $n$-qubit parallelized SWAP test. We demonstrate that each shadow enumerator corresponds to a probability derived from this test, providing a physical interpretation for the shadow enumerators. Leveraging the non-negativity of these probabilities, we present an elegant proof for the shadow inequalities. Additionally, we show that the Shor-Laflamme weight enumerators and the Rains unitary enumerators can be calculated using the $n$-qubit parallelized SWAP test. For applications, we utilize this test to compute the distances of quantum error-correcting codes, determine the $k$-uniformity of pure states, and evaluate multipartite entanglement measures. Our results indicate that quantum weight enumerators can be efficiently estimated on quantum computers, opening a path to calculate and verify the distances of quantum error-correcting codes.</description>

      <title>Bayesian mitigation of measurement errors in multiqubit experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Phys. Rev. A 108, L060402 (2023), we introduced a Bayesian measurement error mitigation algorithm, which leveraged complete information from the readout signal, and validated the protocol on a quantum device with five superconducting qubits. Here, we present an improved algorithm's implementation, tailored for multiqubit experiments on near-term superconducting qubit quantum devices. In particular, we provide a detailed algorithm workflow, from calibrating the detector response functions to the postprocessing of measurement outcomes, offering a computationally efficient solution for the output size typical of current quantum computing devices. We show how the numerical representation of the noise function affects the performance of the error mitigation algorithm and test the convergence criteria. We benchmark our protocol on actual quantum computers with superconducting qubits, where the readout signal encodes the measurement information as unprocessed analog data before qubit state assignment. Finally, we compare the performance of our algorithm against other measurement error mitigation methods, such as iterative Bayesian unfolding and the Mthree method, and show how our method can be integrated on top of other readout error mitigation protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05372v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we show that the completeness relation for the eigenvectors, which is an essential assumption of quantum mechanics, remains true if the Hamiltonian, having a discrete spectrum, is modified by a delta potential (to be made precise by a renormalization scheme) supported at a point in two and three-dimensional compact manifolds or Euclidean spaces. The formulation can be easily extended to $N$ center case, and the case where delta interaction is supported on curves in the plane or space. We finally give an interesting application for sudden perturbation of the support of the delta potential.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermalization must occur in translation-invariant systems at high temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum thermalization describes how closed quantum systems can effectively reach thermal equilibrium, resolving the apparent incongruity between the reversibility of Schr\"odinger's equation and the second law of thermodynamics. Despite its ubiquity and conceptual significance, the precise conditions that give rise to quantum thermalization are still not well understood. After nearly a century of efforts, we have yet to find a complete mathematical proof that an effective statistical description naturally emerges the underlying quantum dynamics in generic settings. Here, we prove that quantum thermalization must occur in any qubit system with local interactions under three conditions: (i) high effective temperature, (ii) translation invariance, and (iii) no perfect resonances in the energy spectrum. Specifically, we show that a typical, low-complexity pure state drawn from any ensemble with large entropy and well-defined effective temperature becomes locally indistinguishable from a Gibbs state upon unitary evolution. In this setting, our rigorous results prove the widely anticipated notion that statistical physics should be understood as an emergent phenomenon, explicitly derived from the first principles of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin amplification is the process that ideally increases the number of excited spins when one of them is excited initially. We show that by applying optimal control techniques to design classical drive pulse shapes, spin amplification can be achieved in a previously unexplored fast regime, with amplification times comparable to the intrinsic interaction timescale. This is an order of magnitude faster than the previous protocols and makes spin amplification possible even with significant decoherence and inhomogeneity in the spin system. The initial spin excitation can be delocalized over the entire ensemble, which is a more typical situation when a photon is collectively absorbed by the spins. We focus on the superconducting persistent-current artificial atoms and the Rydberg atoms as spins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method for the transfer of perfect strategies between various classes of two-player, one round cooperative non-local games with quantum inputs and outputs using the simulation paradigm in quantum information theory. We show that such a transfer is possible when canonically associated operator spaces for each game are quantum homomorphic or isomorphic, as defined in the joint work of H. and Todorov (2024). We examine a new class of QNS correlations, needed for the transfer of strategies between games, and characterize them in terms of states on tensor products of canonical operator systems. We define jointly tracial correlations and show they correspond to traces acting on tensor products of canonical ${\rm C}^{*}$-algebras associated with individual game parties. We then make an inquiry into the initial application of such results to the study of concurrent quantum games.</description>

      <title>Boosting thermalization of classical and quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and optimizing the relaxation dynamics of many-body systems is essential both for foundational studies in quantum thermodynamics and for applications such as quantum simulation and quantum computing. Efficient preparation of thermal states of a many-body Hamiltonian is governed by the spectral properties of the associated Lindbladian, in particular its spectral gap, which determines the slowest relaxation rate. In this work, we develop a systematic framework for constructing Lindbladians that prepare thermal states. Our approach reveals a simple relation between the relaxation dynamics at finite and infinite temperatures. The framework is scalable to larger system sizes when implemented using tensor-network methods. We find that efficient thermalization requires that the relaxation dynamics respect the symmetries of the thermal state, which reduces the number of free parameters. By applying gradient-based optimization to the Lindbladians, we enhance the spectral gap and thereby boost thermalization. When applied to both classical and quantum spin models, our method demonstrates a substantial enhancement of the spectral gap. For larger system sizes, our approach provides a variational upper bound and enables a certified lower bound on the minimum relaxation rate.</description>

Abstract: We use operators from generalized equiangular measurements to construct positive maps. Their positivity follows from the inequality for indices of coincidence corresponding to few equiangular tight frames. These maps give rise to entanglement witnesses, which include as special cases many important classes considered in the literature. Additionally, we introduce separability criteria based on the correlation matrix and analyze them for various types of measurements.</description>

      <title>A universal framework for the quantum simulation of Yang-Mills theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a universal framework for the quantum simulation of SU(N) Yang--Mills theories on fault-tolerant digital quantum computers adopting the orbifold lattice formulation. As warm-up examples, we also consider simple models, including scalar field theory and the Yang--Mills matrix model, to illustrate the universality of our formulation, which shows up in the fact that the truncated Hamiltonian can be expressed in the same simple form for any N, any dimension, and any lattice size, in stark contrast to the popular approach based on the Kogut--Susskind formulation. In all these cases, the truncated Hamiltonian can be programmed on a quantum computer using only standard tools well-established in the field of quantum computation. As a concrete application of this universal framework, we consider Hamiltonian time evolution by Suzuki--Trotter decomposition. This turns out to be a straightforward task due to the simplicity of the truncated Hamiltonian. We also provide a simple circuit structure that contains only CNOT and one-qubit gates, independent of the details of the theory investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum-inspired algorithm that utilizes Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD) for efficient community detection. Our approach reformulates the community detection task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, and QHD is deployed to identify optimal community structures. We implement a multi-level algorithm that iteratively refines community assignments by alternating between QUBO problem setup and QHD-based optimization. Benchmarking shows our method achieves up to 5.49\% better modularity scores while requiring less computational time compared to classical optimization approaches. This work demonstrates the potential of hybrid quantum-inspired solutions for advancing community detection in large-scale graph data.</description>

      <title>Quantum Neural Networks in Practice: A Comparative Study with Classical Models from Standard Data Sets to Industrial Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare the performance of randomized classical and quantum neural networks (NNs) as well as classical and quantum-classical hybrid convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the task of supervised binary image classification. We keep the employed quantum circuits compatible with near-term quantum devices and use two distinct methodologies: applying randomized NNs on dimensionality-reduced data and applying CNNs to full image data. We evaluate these approaches on three fully-classical data sets of increasing complexity: an artificial hypercube data set, MNIST handwritten digits and industrial images. Our central goal is to shed more light on how quantum and classical models perform for various binary classification tasks and on what defines a good quantum model. Our study involves a correlation analysis between classification accuracy and quantum model hyperparameters, and an analysis on the role of entanglement in quantum models, as well as on the impact of initial training parameters. We find classical and quantum-classical hybrid models achieve statistically-equivalent classification accuracies across most data sets with no approach consistently outperforming the other. Interestingly, we observe that quantum NNs show lower variance with respect to initial training parameters and that the role of entanglement is nuanced. While incorporating entangling gates seems advantageous, we also observe the (optimizable) entangling power not to be correlated with model performance. We also observe an inverse proportionality between the number of entangling gates and the average gate entangling power. Our study provides an industry perspective on quantum machine learning for binary image classification tasks, highlighting both limitations and potential avenues for further research in quantum circuit design, entanglement utilization, and model transferability across varied applications.</description>

      <title>Unified strategy for non-invertible Fisher information matrix in quantum metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum multi-parameter estimation, the precision of estimating unknown parameters is bounded by the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB), defined via the inverse of the Fisher information matrix (FIM). However, in certain scenarios such as distributed quantum sensing the FIM becomes non-invertible due to parameter redundancy, which depends on the probe state and measurement. This issue is often handled using a weaker form of the CRB, potentially overestimating the uncertainty and underrepresenting achievable precision. Here, we propose an alternative approach by introducing equality constraints to remove redundancy and define the CRB via the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the FIM. This framework enables systematic treatment of both simultaneous estimation and distributed sensing cases. We demonstrate its utility by reanalyzing several known examples within this unified perspective, highlighting improved interpretability and practical relevance. Our results offer a concrete guideline for addressing non-invertible FIMs and enhancing the precision of quantum multi-parameter estimation in realistic scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that universal quantum computation can be concretely made fault-tolerant without mid-circuit measurements. To this end, we introduce a measurement-free deformation protocol of the Bacon-Shor code to realize a logical $\mathit{CCZ}$ gate. Combined with a fold-transversal logical Hadamard gate, this enables a universal set of fault-tolerant operations using only transversal gates and qubit permutations. For the purpose of benchmarking under circuit-level noise, we develop an efficient method to simulate non-Clifford circuits with a small number of Hadamard gates. Separately, we demonstrate that certain CSS codes can be concatenated without measurements or having to rely on a universal logical gate set. This is made possible by means of a resource-efficient gadget -- termed the ``disposable Toffoli gadget'' -- that realizes the error-correcting feedback. Then, under concatenation of the Bacon-Shor code, we observe a fault-tolerance threshold at a circuit-level depolarizing noise rate of approximately $0.12\,\%$. Together, the deformation and concatenation protocols outline a blueprint for a fully fault-tolerant architecture without any feed-forward operation, particularly suited to state-of-the-art neutral-atom platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum compiling, which aims to approximate target qubit gates by finding optimal sequences (braidwords) of basic braid operations, constitutes a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. We develop a genetic algorithm (GA)-enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm (SKA) for approximating single-qubit gates using four elementary braiding matrices (EBMs) derived from Fibonacci anyons. The GA-enhanced SKA demonstrates robust performance, efficiently identifying optimal braidwords within exponentially large search spaces. Notably, the approximation precision achieved by our method surpasses that of Monte Carlo (MC)-enhanced SKA and becomes comparable to deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches when braidword lengths exceed 25. Implementing 2- and 3-order approximations with the GA-enhanced SKA yields optimal braidword (initial braiding lengths l0=50 and 30 respectively) achieving gate distances of 5.9*10-7 - sufficient precision for most quantum computing applications. This work develops an optimized compilation framework for non-Abelian anyon gates, providing an essential methodology for enhancing future topological quantum computation architectures through gate optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally realize a quantum clock by using a charge sensor to count charges tunneling through a double quantum dot (DQD). Individual tunneling events are used as the clock's ticks. We quantify the clock's precision while measuring the power dissipated by the DQD and, separately, the charge sensor in both direct-current and radio-frequency readout modes. This allows us to probe the thermodynamic cost of creating ticks microscopically and recording them macroscopically. Our experiment is the first to explore the interplay between the entropy produced by a microscopic clockwork and its macroscopic measurement apparatus. We show that the latter contribution not only dwarfs the former but also unlocks greatly increased precision, because the measurement record can be exploited to optimally estimate time even when the DQD is at equilibrium. Our results suggest that the entropy produced by the amplification and measurement of a clock's ticks, which has often been ignored in the literature, is the most important and fundamental thermodynamic cost of timekeeping at the quantum scale.</description>

Abstract: We optimize matrix-product state-based algorithms for simulating quantum circuits with finite fidelity, specifically the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) and the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithms, by exploiting the irregular arrangement of entangling operations in circuits. We introduce a variation of the standard TEBD algorithm, we termed "cluster-TEBD", which dynamically arranges qubits into entanglement clusters, enabling the exact contraction of multiple circuit layers in a single time step. Moreover, we enhance the DMRG algorithm by introducing an adaptive protocol, which analyzes the entanglement distribution within each circuit section to be contracted, dynamically adjusting the qubit grouping at each iteration. We analyze the performances of these enhanced algorithms in simulating both stabilizer and nonstabilizer random-structured quantum circuits, with up to 1000 qubits and 100 layers of Clifford and non-Clifford gates, and in simulating Shor's quantum algorithm with up to hundreds of thousands of layers. Our findings show that, even with reasonable computational resources per task, cluster-based approaches can significantly speed up simulations of large-sized quantum circuits and improve the fidelity of the final states.</description>

      <title>Moderate-length lifted quantum Tanner codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce new families of quantum Tanner codes, a class of quantum codes that first appeared in the work of Leverrier and Z\'emor (FOCS 2022). These codes are built from two classical Tanner codes, for which the underlying graphs are extracted from coverings of 2D geometrical complexes, and the local linear codes are tensor-products of cyclic or double-circulant linear codes. The advantage of code lifting is that, for any lift of odd index $t$ of an $[[n,k,d]]$-code, we can adapt the study of the transfer homomorphism arising in cellular homology to describe symmetries of its logical operators and to establish that its dimension is lower bounded by $k$, and its distance is upper bounded by $t\cdot d$. Moreover, when the dimension of the lifted code is equal to $k$, its distance is lower bounded by $d$. These parameter bounds also apply to the previous methods of code lifting of Gu\'emard (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2025). Finally, We present several explicit families, and identify instances of moderate length quantum codes which are degenerate, have low check weight, and whose distance surpasses the square root of the code length. Among them, we report the existence of a $[[96,2,12]]$-code whose distance growth saturates our bound, and for which half of the checks are of weight 8 and the other half of weight 4.</description>

      <title>Cooperative squeezing of internal and collective spins in an atomic ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05446v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating highly spin-squeezed states for quantum metrology surpassing the standard quantum limit is a topic of great interest. Spin squeezing has been achieved by either entangling different atoms in an ensemble, or by controlling the multilevel internal spin state of an atom. Here, we experimentally demonstrate combined internal and collective spin squeezing in a hot atomic ensemble with $\sim 10^{11}$ rubidium atoms. By synergistically combining these two types of squeezing and carefully aligning their squeezing quadratures, we have achieved a metrologically relevant spin squeezing of $-6.21\pm0.84$ dB, significantly outperforming the results obtained by utilizing either type of squeezing alone. Our approach provides a new perspective on fully harnessing the degrees of freedom inherent in quantum states of an atomic ensemble.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the connection between exceptional points (EPs) and optimal parameter estimation, in a simple system consisting of two counter-propagating traveling wave modes in a microring resonator. The unknown parameter to be estimated is the strength of a perturbing cross-coupling between the two modes. Partially reflecting the output of one mode into the other creates a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which exhibits a family of EPs, creating an exceptional surface (ES). We use a fully quantum treatment of field inputs and noise sources to obtain a quantitative bound on the estimation error by calculating the quantum Fisher information (QFI) in the output fields, whose inverse gives the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound on the mean-squared-error of any unbiased estimator. We determine the bounds for two input states, namely, a semiclassical coherent state and a highly nonclassical NOON state. We find that the QFI is enhanced in the presence of an EP for both of these input states and that both states can saturate the Cram\'er-Rao bound. We then identify idealized yet experimentally feasible measurements that achieve the minimum bound for these two input states. We also investigate how the QFI changes for parameter values that do not lie on the ES, finding that these can have a larger QFI, suggesting alternative routes to optimize the parameter estimation for this problem.</description>

      <title>Sacalable architecture for measurement induced squeezed light interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalable interferometers lie at the heart of photonic quantum technologies, but their expansion has been fundamentally limited by optical losses that grow with circuit depth. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a measurement-induced architecture for multimode squeezed-light interferometers that overcomes this barrier. By shifting complexity from deep optical networks to programmable homodyne measurements, we realize effective transformations within a shallow, low-loss platform. We validate the principle with a six-mode device and extend it to a 400-mode interferometer, marking a leap in scale beyond conventional designs. Crucially, this strategy not only enables scalable squeezed light interferometry but also provides a powerful route to the generation of large-scale entangled states - a key requirement for quantum computing, simulation, and communication. Our results establish measurement-induced circuits as a practical pathway toward noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) applications, and future demonstrations of quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Absolutely Maximal Entanglement in Continuous Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore absolutely maximal entanglement (AME) and k-uniformity in continuous-variable (CV) quantum systems, and show that-unlike in qudit systems-such entanglement is readily realizable in both Gaussian and non-Gaussian quantum states of multiple modes. We demonstrate that Gaussian CV cluster states are generically AME, rederiving the results of [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 070501 (2009)] from a generalized stabilizer formalism, and provide explicit constructions based on Cauchy, Vandermonde, totally positive, and real-block-code generator matrices. We further extend AME properties to a family of non-Gaussian states constructed from discrete Zak basis states that incorporate grid states (a.k.a., Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states) as non-Gaussian resources. Realizations of CV AME states enable open-destination multi-party CV teleportation, CV quantum secret sharing, CV majority-agreed key distribution, perfect-tensor networks on arbitrary geometries, and multi-unitary circuits. Our extension to non-Gaussian AME states may further provide robustness to Gaussian noise and benefits to quantum CV information processing.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Optical Responses of a High-Kinetic-Inductance Microwave Resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05899v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the optical response of a high-kinetic-inductance microwave resonator is crucial for applications ranging from single-photon detection to quantum transduction between microwave and optical domains, which is gaining significant attention for scaling up quantum computers. However, interactions between the pump light and the superconducting resonator often induce unintended resonance frequency shifts and linewidth broadening. In this study, we measure the local optical response of a NbTiN nanowire resonator using a laser-scanning microwave spectroscopy system integrated with a dilution refrigerator. The optical response of the resonator shows correlation with the resonance modes and position, which is attributed to the two-level system around the resonator. These findings not only contribute to the design and understanding of quantum transducers and single-photon detectors, but also to the understandings of catastrophic high-energy particle irradiation events that generate unintended phonons in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>ScarFinder: a detector of optimal scar trajectories in quantum many-body dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanisms that give rise to coherent quantum dynamics, such as quantum many-body scars, have recently attracted much interest as a way of controlling quantum chaos. However, identifying the presence of quantum scars in general many-body Hamiltonians remains an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce ScarFinder, a variational framework that reveals possible scar-like dynamics without prior knowledge of scar states or their algebraic structure. By iteratively evolving and projecting states within a low-entanglement variational manifold, ScarFinder isolates scarred trajectories by suppressing thermal contributions. We validate the method on the analytically tractable spin-1 XY model, recovering the known scar dynamics, as well as the mixed field Ising model, where we capture and generalize the initial conditions previously associated with ``weak thermalization''. We then apply the method to the PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, efficiently characterizing its mixed phase space and finding a previously unknown trajectory with nearly-perfect revival dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. Our results establish ScarFinder as a powerful, model-agnostic tool for identifying and optimizing coherent dynamics in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Preparation Circuits for Matrix Product States by Classical Variational Disentanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the classical compilation of quantum circuits for the preparation of matrix product states (MPS), which are quantum states of low entanglement with an efficient classical description. Our algorithm represents a near-term alternative to previous sequential approaches by reverse application of a disentangler, which can be found by minimizing bipartite entanglement measures after the application of a layer of parameterized disentangling gates. Since a successful disentangler is expected to decrease the bond dimension on average, such a layer-by-layer optimization remains classically efficient even for deep circuits. Additionally, as the Schmidt coefficients of all bonds are locally accessible through the canonical $\Gamma$-$\Lambda$ form of an MPS, the optimization algorithm can be heavily parallelized. We discuss guarantees and limitations to trainability and show numerical results for ground states of one-dimensional, local Hamiltonians as well as artificially spread out entanglement among multiple qubits using error correcting codes.</description>

      <title>The construction of a universal quantum gate set for the SU(2)k (k=5,6,7) anyon models via genetic optimized algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study systematically numerical method into constructing a universal quantum gate set for topological quantum computation (TQC) using SU(2)k anyon models. The F-matrices and R-symbol were computed through the q-deformed representation theory of SU(2), enabling precise determination of elementary braiding matrices (EBMs) for SU(2)k anyon systems. Quantum gates were derived from these EBMs. One-qubit gates were synthesized using a genetic algorithm-enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm (GA-enhanced SKA), while two-qubit gates were constructed through brute-force search or GA optimization to approximate local equivalence classes [CNOT]. Implementing this framework for SU(2)5, SU(2)6, and SU(2)7 models successfully generated the canonical universal gate set {H-gate, T-gate, CNOT-gate}. These numerical results provide conclusive verification of the universal quantum computation capabilities inherent in SU(2)k anyon models. Furthermore, we get exact implementations of the local equivalence class [SWAP] using nine EBMs in each model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate parametric excitation and pattern formation in a harmonically trapped two-component Bose-Einstein condensate. We assume the condensate to be in the miscible phase, but near the miscible-immiscible phase transition, where total density and spin density excitations are decoupled. By periodically modulating the atomic scattering lengths, Faraday patterns can be generated in both density and spin channels. In an elongated condensate, the pattern in the spin channel corresponds to a one-dimensional standing wave with the two components exhibiting an out-of-phase density oscillation, where the modulation frequency and the oscillation period are related to the velocity of the spin sound. After the spin pattern is fully developed, the system quickly enters a nonlinear destabilization regime. For a pancake-shaped condensate, a two-dimensional Faraday pattern is generated with an interesting l-fold rotational symmetry. The number of nodes along the radial and angular directions increases with larger modulation frequencies. We also compare the growth rates of spin Faraday patterns generated with different modulation protocols, which are accessible to current experiments.</description>

Abstract: Superposed coherent states are central to quantum technologies, yet their reliable identification remains a challenge, especially in noisy or resource-constrained settings. We introduce a novel, directly measurable criterion for detecting cat-like features in quantum states, rooted in the concept of nonlinear squeezing. This approach bypasses the need for full state tomography and reveals structure where fidelity fails. The numerical results confirm its robustness under loss and its potential for experimental implementation. The method naturally generalizes to more exotic superpositions, including multiheaded cat states.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate an optimal quantum control strategy for the deterministic preparation of entangled harmonic oscillator states in trapped ions. The protocol employs dynamical phase modulation of laser-driven Jaynes-Cummings and anti-Jaynes-Cummings interactions. We prepare Two-Mode Squeezed Vacuum (TMSV) states in the mechanical motions of a trapped ion and characterize the states with phase-space tomography. First, we verify continuous-variable entanglement by measuring an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement parameter of 0.0132(7), which is below the threshold of 0.25 for Reid's EPR criterion. Second, we perform a continuous-variable Bell test and find a violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, measuring 2.26(3), which is above the entanglement threshold of 2. We also demonstrate the flexibility of our method by preparing a non-Gaussian entangled oscillator state--a superposition of TMSV states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell inequalities on local hidden variables were used to test particle entanglement given by the quantum mechanics wavefunction. The experiments on correlated photon pairs showed a clear violation of Bell inequalities and agreement with quantum mechanics. This study revealed that the Bell inequalities on normalized density function is true only for photon polarization at individual instances but it does not hold over the entire population in a given system. The Bell inequalities is not an incompatibility criterion for local hidden variables vs quantum mechanics rather it is a criterion for an individual nature vs population dynamics. The study found that the local variables (photon polarization) described each quantity in Bell test and a complete agreement with the experiments where quantum mechanics was incapable to provide as it is a unified system. The paper concludes with great satisfaction that the simultaneous measurement of two correlated photons at a distance was a local cause (photon-filter interaction did not violate the special theory of relativity) and the nonlocality description given by the wavefunction was not physical.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of quantum coherence and quantum correlations in a two-particle system with deformed symmetries arising from the quantum nature of spacetime. We demonstrate that the deformation of energy-momentum composition induces a momentum-dependent interaction that counteracts the decoherence effects described by the Lindblad equation in quantum spacetime. This interplay leads to the formation of coherence, entanglement and other correlations, which we quantify using concurrence, the $l_1$-norm of coherence, quantum mutual information and Local Quantum Fisher Information. Our analysis reveals that while the openness of quantum spacetime ultimately degrades entanglement, it also facilitates the creation and preservation of both classical and quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantum Capacity of Decohering Channels in Arbitrary Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive exact analytical expressions for the quantum capacity of a broad subclasses of generalized dephasing channels of the form $\Lambda(\rho)=(1-x)\rho + x D(\rho)$, where $D(\rho)$ represents a structured decoherence process. These channels are degradable for all noise parameters and in arbitrary dimensions, yielding closed-form, single-letter capacity formulas. Our analysis includes fully decohering, block-decohering, and weakly decohering channels, the latter involving coherence preservation within overlapping subspaces. Surprisingly, even under maximal decoherence, the channel may retain nonzero capacity due to residual coherence structure. These results provide quantitative role for decoherence-free and partially coherent subspaces in preserving quantum information, offering guidance for encoding strategies in quantum memories and fault-tolerant quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>A continuous variable quantum battery with wireless and remote charging</title>

Abstract: Quantum battery has become one of the hot issues at the research frontiers of quantum physics recently. Charging power, extractable work and wireless charging over long-distance are three important aspects of interest. Non-contact electromagnetic interaction provides an important avenue for wireless charging. In this paper, we design a wireless and remote charging scheme based on the quantized Hamiltonian of two coupled LC circuits, and focus on the charging dynamics of a continuous variable quantum battery. It is found that the quantum entanglement, which is regarded as a significant quantum resource, is not a prerequisite for charging the battery and extracting useful work. On the contrary, all of the energy in the battery could be converted into useful work in the absence of the entanglement for our model. The often overlooked counter-rotating wave coupling in the interacting Hamiltonian is helpful for extracting more useful work from the charger. If the coupling between the battery and the charger is designed to contain both the rotating and counter-rotating wave couplings, the extractable work can be obtained even if the charger is prepared in thermal states, while such effect cannot be achieved in the presence of a rotating or counter-rotating wave coupling alone. Finally, the effect of the system's parameters on the extractable work is discussed, which will provide a reference for full use of the thermal state energy.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum noise reduction in a Raman amplifier via quantum correlation between atom and light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any amplifier requires coupling to its internal degrees of freedom for energy gain. This coupling introduces extra quantum noise to the output. On the other hand, if the internal degree of the amplifier can be accessed and manipulated, we can manage and even reduce the quantum noise of the amplifier's output. In this paper, we present an experiment to reduce the quantum noise of a Raman amplifier by preparing the atomic medium in a correlated state with the Stokes light field. We report an observation of quantum noise reduction of more than 3.5 dB in the atomic Raman amplification process. From another perspective, the Raman amplifier at high gain in turn serves as a measurement tool for the quantum correlation between the atom and light. Furthermore, such a scheme, when viewed as a whole, also forms a quantum-entangled atom-light hybrid interferometer that can lead to quantum-enhanced sensors.</description>

      <title>Encoding molecular structures in quantum machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has great potential for the analysis of chemical datasets. However, conventional quantum data-encoding schemes, such as fingerprint encoding, are generally unfeasible for the accurate representation of chemical moieties in such datasets. In this contribution, we introduce the quantum molecular structure encoding (QMSE) scheme, which encodes the molecular bond orders and interatomic couplings expressed as a hybrid Coulomb-adjacency matrix, directly as one- and two-qubit rotations within parameterised circuits. We show that this strategy provides an efficient and interpretable method in improving state separability between encoded molecules compared to other fingerprint encoding methods, which is especially crucial for the success in preparing feature maps in QML workflows. To benchmark our method, we train a parameterised ansatz on molecular datasets to perform classification of state phases and regression on boiling points, demonstrating the competitive trainability and generalisation capabilities of QMSE. We further prove a fidelity-preserving chain-contraction theorem that reuses common substructures to cut qubit counts, with an application to long-chain fatty acids. We expect this scalable and interpretable encoding framework to greatly pave the way for practical QML applications of molecular datasets.</description>

      <title>Towards Practical Quantum Phase Estimation: A Modular, Scalable, and Adaptive Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cornerstone algorithm in quantum computing, with applications ranging from integer factorization to quantum chemistry simulations. However, the resource demands of standard QPE, which require a large number of coherent qubits and deep circuits, pose significant challenges for current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Windowed Quantum Phase Estimation (AWQPE) algorithm, a novel method designed to address the limitations of standard QPE. AWQPE utilizes small, independent blocks of $m &gt; 1$ control qubits to estimate multiple phase bits simultaneously within a "window,'' thereby significantly reducing the number of iterations required to achieve a desired precision. These independent blocks are amenable to parallelization and, when combined with a robust least-significant-bit (LSB) to most-significant-bit (MSB) ambiguity resolution mechanism, enhance the algorithm's accuracy while mitigating the risk of error propagation. Our numerical simulations demonstrate AWQPE's accuracy and robustness, showcasing a distinct balance between resource efficiency and computational speed. This makes AWQPE particularly well-suited for near-term quantum platforms.</description>

Abstract: We propose a spin-orbit strategy for generating dual-wavelength quantum skyrmions, realized either as entangled photon pairs at dual wavelengths or as heralded single-photon states at a given wavelength -- regimes neither previously conceptualized nor demonstrated. By coupling a two-photon entangled state to an electrically tunable liquid crystal topological defect, we engineer both nonlocal and local skyrmionic topologies in a reconfigurable platform. We highlight with examples how this approach may open new directions for engineered topological quantum states that exploit the topological richness of liquid crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoherence effects for entangled triplet pairs in organic molecular crystals are analyzed for the case when excitons can hop between inequivalent lattice sites. The fluorescence quantum beats caused by quantum interference upon triplet-triplet recombination into an emissive singlet state are predicted as a function of hopping time and magnetic field based on a Monte Carlo analysis. Depending on exciton hopping rates, it is possible to have complete global decoherence and suppression of fluorescence quantum beats in the limit of zero magnetic field, and to have quantum beats that decay at different rates depending on magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>Generalized quantum Chernoff bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the task of distinguishing whether a quantum system is prepared in a state from one of several sets of quantum states. Assuming their convexity and stability under tensor product, we prove that the optimal error exponent for discrimination is precisely given by the regularized quantum Chernoff divergence between the sets, thereby establishing a generalized quantum Chernoff bound for the discrimination of multiple sets of quantum states. This extends the classical and quantum Chernoff bounds to the general setting of composite and correlated quantum hypotheses. Furthermore, leveraging minimax theorems, we show that discriminating between sets of quantum states is no harder than discriminating between their worst-case elements in terms of error probability. This implies the existence of an optimal state-agnostic test that achieves the minimum error probability for all states in the sets, matching the performance of the optimal state-dependent test for the most difficult pair of states. We provide explicit characterizations of the optimal state-agnostic test in the binary composite case. Finally, we show that the maximum overlap between a pure state and a set of free states, a quantity that frequently arises in quantum resource theories, is equal to the quantum Chernoff divergence between the sets, thereby providing an operational interpretation of this quantity in the context of symmetric hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Identify and Quantify Various Dissipation Mechanisms of Josephson Junction in Superconducting Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pinpointing the dissipation mechanisms and evaluating their impacts to the performance of Josephson junction (JJ) are crucial for its application in superconducting circuits. In this work, we demonstrate the junction-embedded resonator (JER) as a platform which enables us to identify and quantify various dissipation mechanisms of JJ. JER is constructed by embedding JJ in the middle of an open-circuit, 1/2 {\lambda} transmission-line resonator. When the 1st and 2nd harmonics of JER are excited, JJ experiences different boundary conditions, and is dominated by internal and external dissipations, respectively. We systematically study these 2 dissipation mechanisms of JJ by varying the JJ area and number. Our results unveil the completely different behaviors of these 2 dissipation mechanisms, and quantitatively characterize their contributions, shedding a light on the direction of JJ optimization in various applications.</description>

      <title>Positive maps and extendibility hierarchies from copositive matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15201v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces and systematically studies a new convex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the cone of COP to PCOP, thereby creating a powerful bridge between the theory of copositive forms and the positive maps. We develop an analogous framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC.
  As a primary application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps $\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as Paley graphs.
  On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes of (symmetric) states. We prove that the SOS hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy}-. In the setting of the DPS hierarchy for separability, we construct a large family of optimal entanglement witnesses that are not certifiable by any level of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy, answering a long standing open question from [DPS04]. Leveraging the duality, we also provide an explicit construction of (mixture of) bipartite Dicke states that are simultaneously entangled and $K_r$-PPT bosonic extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \geq 2$ and local dimension $n \geq 5$.</description>

Abstract: We study the privacy properties of distributed quantum sensing protocols in a Gaussian quantum network, where each node encodes a parameter via a local phase shift. For networks with more than two nodes, achieving perfect privacy is possible only asymptotically, in the limit of large photon numbers. However, we show that optimized fully symmetric Gaussian states enable improved privacy levels while maintaining near-optimal sensing performance. We show that local homodyne detection achieves a quadratic scaling of precision with the total number of photons. We further analyze the impact of thermal noise in the preparation stage on both privacy and estimation precision. Our results pave the way for the development of practical, private distributed quantum sensing protocols in continuous-variable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Hybrid biphoton spectrometer for time-resolved quantum spectroscopy across visible and near-infrared regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joint spectral measurements are a powerful tool for characterising biphoton spectral correlation, which is crucial for quantum information and communication technologies. In these applications, highly pure biphoton states are essential in any time- and frequency-mode, often obviating the need for time-resolved measurements. Conversely, spectroscopy utilising entangled photon pairs is gaining significant attention for its ability to unveil molecular dynamics, a field that critically demands time-resolved capabilities. Here, we introduce a novel methodology for capturing a biphoton spectrum that comprises visible and near-infrared photons, resulting in a three-fold non-degenerate joint spectrum. Our system employs two non-scanning spectrographs: a fibre spectrograph for near-infrared photons and a delay-line-anode single-photon imager for visible photons. We successfully measure the joint spectral intensity by leveraging a time-tagging acquisition strategy. Furthermore, our approach uniquely enables time-resolved joint spectral measurements with a temporal resolution of approximately 150 ps. This methodology bridges the gap between the requirements for pure biphoton states and the need for dynamic insights in quantum spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Observation of Genuine Tripartite Non-Gaussian Entanglement from a Superconducting Three-Photon Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion Source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generation of entangled photons through Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a critical resource for many key experiments and technologies in the domain of quantum optics. Historically, SPDC was limited to the generation of photon pairs. However, the use of the strong nonlinearities in circuit quantum electrodynamics has recently enabled the observation of Three-Photon SPDC (3P-SPDC). Despite great interest in the entanglement structure of the resultant states, entanglement between photon triplets produced by a 3P-SPDC source has still has not been confirmed. Here, we report on the observation of genuine tripartite non-Gaussian entanglement in the steady-state output field of a 3P-SPDC source consisting of a superconducting parametric cavity coupled to a transmission line. We study this non-Gaussian tripartite entanglement using an entanglement witness built from three-mode correlation functions, and observe a maximum violation of the bound by 23 standard deviations of the statistical noise. Furthermore, we find strong agreement between the observed and the analytically predicted scaling of the entanglement witness. We then explore the impact of the temporal function used to define the photon mode on the observed value of the entanglement witness.</description>

      <title>Fast-forwardable Lindbladians imply quantum phase estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum phase estimation (QPE) and Lindbladian dynamics are both foundational in quantum information science and central to quantum algorithm design. In this work, we bridge these two concepts: certain simple Lindbladian processes can be adapted to perform QPE-type tasks. However, unlike QPE, which achieves Heisenberg-limit scaling, these Lindbladian evolutions are restricted to standard quantum limit complexity. This indicates that, different from Hamiltonian dynamics, the natural dissipative evolution speed of such Lindbladians does not saturate the fundamental quantum limit, thereby suggesting the potential for quadratic fast-forwarding. We confirm this by presenting a quantum algorithm that simulates these Lindbladians for time $t$ within an error $\varepsilon$ using $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{t\log(\varepsilon^{-1})}\right)$ cost, whose mechanism is fundamentally different from the fast-forwarding examples of Hamiltonian dynamics. As a bonus, this fast-forwarded simulation naturally serves as a new Heisenberg-limit QPE algorithm. Therefore, our work explicitly bridges the standard quantum limit-Heisenberg limit transition to the fast-forwarding of dissipative dynamics. We also adopt our fast-forwarding algorithm for efficient Gibbs state preparation and demonstrate the counter-intuitive implication: the allowance of a quadratically accelerated decoherence effect under arbitrary Pauli noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology optimization is a key methodology in engineering design for finding efficient and robust structures. Due to the enormous size of the design space, evaluating all possible configurations is typically infeasible. In this work, we present an end-to-end, fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for topology optimization that operates on the exponential Hilbert space representing the design space. We demonstrate the algorithm on the two-dimensional Messerschmitt-B\"olkow-Blohm (MBB) beam problem. By restricting design variables to binary values, we reformulate the compliance minimization task as a combinatorial satisfiability problem solved using Grover's algorithm. Within Grover's oracle, the compliance is computed through the finite-element method (FEM) using established quantum algorithms, including block-encoding of the stiffness matrix, Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) for matrix inversion, Hadamard test, and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE). The complete algorithm is implemented and validated using classical quantum-circuit simulations. A detailed complexity analysis shows that the method evaluates the compliance of exponentially many structures in quantum superposition in polynomial time. In the global search, our approach maintains Grover's quadratic speedup compared to classical unstructured search. Overall, the proposed quantum workflow demonstrates how quantum algorithms can advance the field of computational science and engineering.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the Bohr-Sommerfeld atomic model to explore hydrogen-like ions of Uranium ($Z=92$), Oganesson ($Z=118$), and hypothetical superheavy elements beyond. Although superseded by the Dirac equation and modern quantum electrodynamics, the semiclassical approach offers a historically and pedagogically valuable perspective. Using the Sommerfeld fine structure formula and computer algebra methods, we demonstrate the appearance of self-intersecting orbits in super strong Coulomb fields, beginning with Oganesson and hypothetical elements up to $Z\le137$. These orbits can be classified by their `winding' numbers, providing a simple topological description of Coulomb field strength in this framework. Our results highlight a conceptual bridge between early quantum theory and modern superheavy element physics.</description>

      <title>Higher-order quantum computing with known input states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In higher-order quantum computing (HOQC), one typically considers the universal transformation of unknown quantum operations, treated as blackboxes. It is also implicitly assumed that the resulting operation must act on arbitrary, and thus unknown, input states. In this work, we explore a variant of this framework in which the operation remains unknown, but the input state is fixed and known. We argue that this assumption is well-motivated in certain practical contexts, such as unitary programming, and show that classical knowledge of the input state can significantly enhance performance. We demonstrate that in the SAR protocol, this knowledge leads to an exponential advantage through a repeat-until-success strategy, highlighting the operational power of known-state higher-order transformations. Moreover, this assumption allows us to distinguish between protocols designed for pure, bipartite, and mixed states, which enables us to identify the class of mixed states for which deterministic and exact implementation becomes possible.</description>

      <title>qc-kmeans: A Quantum Compressive K-Means Algorithm for NISQ Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering on NISQ hardware is constrained by data loading and limited qubits. We present \textbf{qc-kmeans}, a hybrid compressive $k$-means that summarizes a dataset with a constant-size Fourier-feature sketch and selects centroids by solving small per-group QUBOs with shallow QAOA circuits. The QFF sketch estimator is unbiased with mean-squared error $O(\varepsilon^2)$ for $B,S=\Theta(\varepsilon^{-2})$, and the peak-qubit requirement $q_{\text{peak}}=\max\{D,\lceil \log_2 B\rceil + 1\}$ does not scale with the number of samples. A refinement step with elitist retention ensures non-increasing surrogate cost. In Qiskit Aer simulations (depth $p{=}1$), the method ran with $\le 9$ qubits on low-dimensional synthetic benchmarks and achieved competitive sum-of-squared errors relative to quantum baselines; runtimes are not directly comparable. On nine real datasets (up to $4.3\times 10^5$ points), the pipeline maintained constant peak-qubit usage in simulation. Under IBM noise models, accuracy was similar to the idealized setting. Overall, qc-kmeans offers a NISQ-oriented formulation with shallow, bounded-width circuits and competitive clustering quality in simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build on the foundational work of Deffner and Zurek [S.~Deffner and W.~H.~Zurek, {New J.~Phys.18, 063013 (2016)}] to demonstrate how the principles of statistical mechanics can be derived from quantum mechanics using the concept of envariance (environment-assisted invariance). In particular, we show how the Binomial, Poisson, and Gaussian distributions naturally emerge from entangled system--environment states. Furthermore, we resolve the Gibbs paradox using entanglement entropy, obtaining the Sackur--Tetrode equation with quantum corrections. Extending this framework, we derive a modified Saha equation for ionization equilibrium and recover Bose--Einstein and Fermi--Dirac statistics from quantum symmetries. Our results reinforce and extend the view that statistical mechanics arises as a direct consequence of quantum information dynamics, rather than being founded on phenomenological postulates.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Repeater Chains with Semiconductor Quantum Dots and Group-IV-Vacancy Color Centers in Diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a hybrid quantum repeater architecture that combines two leading hardware platforms: quantum dots (QDs) as bright, deterministic sources of entangled photon pairs and group-IV-vacancy centers in diamond as efficient, heralded quantum memories. This combination leverages high-rate entanglement generation together with long-lived storage, enabling scalable entanglement distribution over long distances. A key challenge is the large bandwidth mismatch between QD photons and the narrow optical transitions of the memories. We combine a comprehensive model of the spin-photon interface, including full spin-photon coupling dynamics, and explore mitigation strategies such as frequency filtering and optimized magnetic-field orientation. Our results show that with optimized designs, photon-to-memory transfer can be achieved with high efficiency and fidelity, supporting the feasibility of such hybrid systems. Finally, we analyze a full repeater chain using experimentally achievable parameters and find that a network with thousands of memories across several repeater nodes could achieve a secret-key rate of 500 bit/s over 1,000 km, demonstrating the strong potential of this approach for next-generation quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Shallow IQP circuits and graph generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce shallow instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) circuits as generative graph models, using an edge-qubit encoding to map graphs onto quantum states. Focusing on bipartite and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi distributions, we study their expressivity and robustness through simulations and large-scale experiments. Noiseless simulations of $28$ qubits ($8$-node graphs) reveal that shallow IQP models can learn key structural features, such as the edge density and bipartite partitioning. On IBM's Aachen QPU, we scale experiments from $28$ to $153$ qubits ($8$-$18$ nodes) in order to characterize performance on real quantum hardware. Local statistics, such as the degree distributions, remain accurate across scales with total variation distances ranging from $0.04$ to $0.20$, while global properties like strict bipartiteness degrade at the largest system sizes ($91$ and $153$ qubits). Notably, spectral bipartivity, a relaxation of strict bipartiteness, remains comparatively robust at higher qubit counts. These results establish practical baselines for the performance of shallow IQP circuits on current quantum hardware and demonstrate that, even without error mitigation, such circuits can learn and reproduce meaningful structural patterns in graph data, guiding future developments in quantum generative modeling for the NISQ era and beyond.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Remote Magnon-Magnon Entanglement with Quantum Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavity magnonics, owing to its strong magnon-photon coupling and excellent tunability, has attracted significant interest in quantum information science. However, achieving strong and robust macroscopic entanglement remains a long-standing challenge due to the inherently linear nature of the beam-splitter interaction. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to generate and enhance macroscopic entanglement between two remote magnon modes by injecting squeezed vacuum fields (SVFs) into coupled microwave cavities. We demonstrate that even a single SVF applied to one cavity can induce steady magnon-magnon entanglement, while applying two SVFs (the double-squeezed configuration) enables selective activation of two independent entanglement channels associated with the cavity supermodes. Remarkably, quantum interference between the two SVFs allows for phase-controlled enhancement of entanglement, resulting in significantly improved robustness against cavity dissipation and thermal noise. Under realistic parameters, the survival temperature of quantum entanglement increases from approximately $260$ mK to $450$ mK. Our results establish a versatile and controllable approach to generating and enhancing quantum entanglement through double-squeezed-field interference, opening new avenues to study and enhance macroscopic quantum physics in cavity-magnon systems with only beam-splitter interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive quantum systems have emerged as compelling tabletop interface-systems for testing the quantum nature of gravity. However, conventional schemes that focus on directly using gravity to induce entanglement suffer from overwhelming environmental decoherence: maintaining entanglement between two oscillators requires an impractically high mechanical quality factor. In this work, we put forward an alternative reservoir-engineered scheme, whose core function is to quantify how gravity modifies (rather than prepares) the steady-state entanglement. Compared to quantum gravity, classical gravity introduces additional dissipative channels, which in turn give rise to distinct entanglement characteristics and thus enable the discrimination between the two types of gravity. Notably, this entanglement difference can still be maintained even when the mechanical quality factor is far below the threshold required by conventional schemes. Moreover, it demonstrates significant robustness against non-gravitational couplings, specifically, those like Casimir and Coulomb forces that are inherent in experimental setups. Our scheme relaxes the experimental requirements for verifying quantum gravity, thereby paving a new path toward its near-term realization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical shadows are an efficient method for constructing an approximate classical description of a quantum state using very few measurements. In the paper we propose to enhance classical shadow methods using bootstrap resampling methods. We apply nonparametric bootstrapping to assess the variability and accuracy of estimators by repeatedly sampling with replacement from the observed data, i.e. in our case the classical shadow measurements. We show that the bootstrap distributions are very different from the Gaussian approximations. Likewise, the theoretical error bounds are not tight compared to the bootstrap percentiles. Finally, we suggest using resampling tools to make risk assessments.</description>

Abstract: We unravel a deep connection between limits of real numbers and limits in category theory. Using a new variant of the classical characterisation of the real numbers, we characterise the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and linear contractions in terms of simple category-theoretic structures and properties that do not refer to norms, continuity, or real numbers. This builds on Heunen, Kornell, and Van der Schaaf's easier characterisation of the category of all Hilbert spaces and linear contractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We gain quantitative insights on effects of light-matter interactions on correlated quantum matter by quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We introduce a wormhole algorithm for the paradigmatic Dicke-Ising model which combines the light-matter interaction of the Dicke model with Ising interactions. The quantum phase diagram for ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions on the chain and the square lattice is determined. The occurring superradiant phase transitions are in the same universality class as the Dicke model leading to a well-known peculiar finite-size scaling that we elucidate in terms of scaling above the upper critical dimension. For the ferromagnetic case, the transition between the normal and the superradiant phase is of second order with Dicke criticality (first order) for large (small) longitudinal fields separated by a multicritical point. For antiferromagnetic interactions, we establish the light-matter analogue of a lattice supersolid with off-diagonal superradiant and diagonal magnetic order and determine the nature of all transition lines.</description>

Abstract: Quantum complexity quantifies the difficulty of preparing a state or implementing a unitary transformation with limited resources. Applications range from quantum computation to condensed matter physics and quantum gravity. We seek to bridge the approaches of these fields, which define and study complexity using different frameworks and tools. We describe several definitions of complexity, along with their key properties. In quantum information theory, we focus on complexity growth in random quantum circuits. In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), we discuss a geometric definition of complexity in terms of geodesics on the unitary group. In dynamical systems, we explore a definition of complexity in terms of state or operator spreading, as well as concepts from tensor-networks. We also outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models, and QFTs including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we explain the proposed relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the holographic anti-de Sitter (AdS)/CFT correspondence.</description>

Abstract: The recursion method provides a powerful framework for studying quantum many-body dynamics in the Lanczos basis recursively constructed within the Krylov space of operators. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the recursion method, when supplemented by the universal operator growth hypothesis, can effectively compute autocorrelation functions and transport coefficients at infinite temperature. We extend the scope of the recursion method to far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics. We apply the method to spin systems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. In one dimension its usefulness is limited: although it remains accurate at moderate times, it eventually experiences an abrupt breakdown and subsequently yields results that deviate strongly from the true dynamics. In contrast, in two and three dimensions the method proves far more effective, providing a reasonably accurate description of the evolution across all time scales -- from the initial transient regime to thermalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04116v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work analyses the extent to which the "blurred orbits" of the current model for the atom, drafted by Heisenberg in 1926, fits the image of a bunch of wandering electrons around a nucleus. We will deal with early appearances of the concept of indistinguishable particles within the frame of quantum mechanics. There are few studies on the use of this concept in Heisenberg's 1926 papers on helium, in contrast with the large number of them on its use in Bose--Einstein's 1924 papers. We will discuss to what extent Heisenberg's approach leads to a purely statistical interpretation of this concept. We will also study the viewpoint of Dirac, who dealt with the same topic few months later. Although the indistinguishability of the electrons and indeterminacy are common explanations for the blurring of electron orbits, we argue that such an image is an oversimplification which masks interesting aspects of: a) the dynamics of bound electrons and b) the deeper implications of indistinguishability in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and fragmentation of bosons in an optical lattice inside a cavity using Wannier and position bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The atom-cavity system is a versatile platform for emulating light-matter systems and realizing dissipation-induced phases, such as limit cycles (LCs) and time crystals. Here, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) inside an optical cavity with transverse pumping and an additional intracavity optical lattice along the cavity axis. Specifically, we explore the theoretical predictions obtained from expanding the atomic field operators of the second-quantized Hamiltonian in two ways: (i) position basis and (ii) single-band Wannier basis. Both bases agree on the existence of most types of static and dynamical phases. However, the large sea of irregular dynamical phase, captured within the position basis, is absent in the Wannier basis. Moreover, we show that they predict different types of LCs due to the inherent limitation of the single-band Wannier expansion, highlighting the importance of including higher energy bands to correctly capture certain phenomena. Using truncated Wigner approximation, we investigate the fragmentation dynamics of the BEC. We demonstrate that both position and Wannier bases qualitatively agree on the photon-mediated fragmentation dynamics of the BEC in the density-wave phase, despite the absence of interatomic interactions. The presence of interatomic interaction leads to further fragmentation, which can only be observed in larger system sizes. Finally, we predict a sudden increase in the fragmentation behavior for larger pump intensities.</description>

      <title>An Optimally Accurate Lanczos Algorithm in the Matrix Product State Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We improve the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm using the matrix product state representation. As an alternative to the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), the Lanczos algorithm avoids local minima and can directly find multiple low-lying eigenstates. However, its performance and accuracy are affected by the truncation required to maintain the efficiency of the tensor network representation. In this work, we propose the modified thick-block Lanczos method to enhance the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm with MPS representation. We benchmark our method on one-dimensional instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model and the Heisenberg model in an external field, using numerical experiments targeting the first five lowest eigenstates. Across these tests, our approach attains the best possible accuracy permitted by the given bond dimension. This work establishes the Lanczos method as a reliable and accurate framework for finding multiple low-lying states within a tensor-network representation</description>

      <title>Tunable Hilbert space fragmentation and extended critical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systems exhibiting the Hilbert-space fragmentation are nonergodic, and their Hamiltonians decompose into exponentially many blocks in the computational basis. In many cases, these blocks can be labeled by eigenvalues of statistically localized integrals of motion (SLIOM), which play a similar role in fragmented systems as local integrals of motion in integrable systems. While a nonzero perturbation eliminates all nontrivial conserved quantities from integrable models, we demonstrate for the $t$-$J_z$ chain that an appropriately chosen perturbation may gradually eliminate SLIOMs (one by one) by progressively merging the fragmented subspaces. This gradual recovery of ergodicity manifests as an extended critical regime characterized by multiple peaks of the fidelity susceptibility. Each peak signals a change in the number of SLIOMs and blocks, as well as an ultra-slow relaxation of local observables.</description>

      <title>Temporal dynamics in the Bragg reflection of light by cold atoms: flash effect and superradiant decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the temporal dynamics of light interacting with a one-dimensional lattice of cold atoms. In such a system, a photonic band gap opens up, yielding an efficient Bragg reflection for an incident field incoming with the right angle and detuning. Here, we report two new effects appearing in the Bragg reflection. First, for some detunings, there is a ``flash'', i.e., a transient increase of the reflected intensity when the incident field is switched off. Second, the subsequent extinction of the reflected field is clearly superradiant, with decay rates up to height times the natural decay rate of the atomic excited state. Numerical simulations are in qualitative agreement with the observations, which can be explained by a classical photonic model. Our results are a step towards exploiting this photonic band gap in atomic systems for quantum-optical applications.</description>

      <title>MetaTT: A Global Tensor-Train Adapter for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MetaTT, a Tensor Train (TT) adapter framework for fine-tuning of pre-trained transformers. MetaTT enables flexible and parameter-efficient model adaptation by using a single shared TT to factorize transformer sub-modules. This factorization indexes key structural dimensions, including layer and matrix type, and can optionally incorporate heads and tasks. This design allows MetaTT's parameter count to scale with the sum, rather than the product, of the modes, resulting in a substantially more compact adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent state-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning methods. We observe that when tested on single-task standard language modeling benchmarks, MetaTT achieves competitive parameter efficiency to accuracy tradeoff. We further demonstrate that MetaTT performs competitively when compared to state-of-the-art methods on multi-task learning. Finally, we leverage the TT-ansatz to design a rank adaptive optimizer inspired by the DMRG method from many-body physics. Our results demonstrate that integrating this approach with AdamW enhances optimization performance for a specified target rank.</description>

      <title>Topological Signatures of Magnetic Phase Transitions with Majorana Fermions through Local Observables and Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) $J_1-J_2$ quantum spin model can be viewed as a strong-coupling analogue of the Schrieffer-Su-Heeger model with two inequivalent alternating Ising couplings along the wire, associated to the physics of resonating valence bonds. Similar to the quantum Ising model, which differently presents a long-range N\' eel ordered phase, this model also maps onto a p-wave superconducting wire which shows a topological phase transition with the emergence of low-energy Majorana fermions. We show how signatures of the topological phase transition for the p-wave superconducting wire, i.e. a half Skyrmion, are revealed through local (short-range) spin observables and their derivatives related to the capacitance of the pairing fermion model. Then, we present an edge correspondence through the edge spin susceptibility in the $J_1-J_2$ model revealing that the topological phase transition is a metal of Majorana fermions. We justify that the spin magnetization at an edge at very small transverse magnetic field is a good marker of the topological invariant and of Majorana zero modes. We identify a correspondence between the quantum information of resonating valence bonds and the charge fluctuations in a p-wave superconductor through our method "the bipartite fluctuations". Physical properties of this 1D model are in fact robust when including additional interactions, which is optimistic for practical applications e.g. in quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Anderson-skin dualism: A boundary-dependent effect in non-Hermitian disordered coupled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a novel localization phenomenon that emerges in non-Hermitian and quasiperiodic coupled systems, which we dub ``Anderson-Skin (AS) dualism". The emergence of AS dualism is due to the fact that non-Hermitian topological systems provide non-trivial topological transport channels for disordered systems, causing the originally localized Anderson modes to transform into skin modes, i.e., the localized states within the point gap regions have dual characteristics of localization under periodic boundary condition (PBC) and skin effects under open boundary conditions (OBC). As an example, we analytically prove the 1D AS dualism through the transfer matrix method. Moreover, by discussing many-body interacting systems, we confirm that AS dualism is universal.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-Vacancy Emission from Nanodiamond: Size, Depth, and Surroundings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a leading solid-state quantum emitter, offering spin-photon interfaces over a wide temperature range with applications from electromagnetic sensing to bioimaging. While NV centers in bulk diamond are well understood, embedding them in nanodiamond (ND) introduces complexities from size, NV location, and NV polarizations. NVs in ND show altered fluorescence properties including longer lifetimes, lower quantum efficiency, and higher sensitivity to dielectric surroundings, which arise from radiative suppression, surface-induced non-radiative decay, and escape inefficiency at the diamond-background interface. Prior models typically addressed isolated aspects, such as dielectric contrast or surface quenching, without integrating full quantum-optical NV behavior with classical electrodynamics. We present a hybrid framework coupling rigorous electromagnetic simulations with a quantum-optical NV model including phonon sideband dynamics. NV emission is found to depend strongly on ND size, NV position, and surrounding refractive index. Our results explain observations such as shallow NVs in water-coated ND appearing brighter than deeper ones in air. This integrated model provide a unified framework for realistic NV in ND emission scenarios and informs the design of efficient NV-based sensors and quantum devices, advancing understanding of quantum emitter photophysics in nanoscale crystals.</description>

      <title>Isofrequency spin-wave imaging using color center magnetometry for magnon spintronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnon spintronics aims to harness spin waves in magnetic films for information technologies. Color center magnetometry is a promising tool for imaging spin waves, using electronic spins associated with atomic defects in solid-state materials as sensors. However, two main limitations persist: the magnetic fields required for spin-wave control detune the sensor-spin detection frequency, and this frequency is further restricted by the color center nature. Here, we overcome these limitations by decoupling the sensor spins from the spin-wave control fields -selecting color centers with intrinsic anisotropy axes orthogonal to the film magnetization- and by using color centers in diamond and hexagonal boron nitride to operate at complementary frequencies. We demonstrate isofrequency imaging of field-controlled spin waves in a magnetic half-plane and show how intrinsic magnetic anisotropies trigger bistable spin textures that govern spin-wave transport at device edges. Our results establish color center magnetometry as a versatile tool for advancing spin-wave technologies.</description>

      <title>Optical field characterization at the fundamental limit of spatial resolution with a trapped ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical systems capable of generating fields with sub-wavelength spatial features have become standard in science and engineering research and industry. Pertinent examples include atom- and ion-based quantum computers and optical lithography setups. So far, no tools exist to characterize such fields - both intensity and polarization - at sub-wavelength length scales. We use a single trapped atomic ion, confined to approximately 40 nm X 40 nm X 180 nm to sense a laser light field at a wavelength of 370 nm. With its spatial extent smaller than the absorption cross-section of a resonant detector, the ion-sensor operates at the fundamental limit of spatial resolution. Our technique relies on developing an analytical model of the ion-light interaction and using the model to extract the intensity and polarization. An important insight provided in this work is also that the inverse of this model can be learned, in a restricted sense, on a deep neural network, speeding up the intensity and polarization readout by five orders of magnitude. This speed-up makes the technique field-deployable to characterize optical instruments by probing light at the sub-wavelength scale.</description>

      <title>Valley-dependent topological interface states in biased armchair nanoribbons in single-layer graphene for transport applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For nanoscale single-layer graphene-based devices, valley-dependent topological physics may be exploited in device design. To demonstrate the point, we investigate an electrical bias-controlled, topological kind discontinuity in valley polarization, in a two-segment armchair nanoribbon of single-layer graphene, where the discontinuity is created at the interface by applying opposite in-plane, transverse electrical biases to the two segments. In particular, using an efficient tight-binding theoretical formulation, we explicitly obtain energy eigenvalues and probability distributions of discontinuity-induced, interface-confined electron eigenstates, in a reference configuration. Moreover, implications of the confinement for electron transport are explored. A configurational variation is introduced to transform the eigenstates into transport-active, quasi-localized ones. Such states are shown to result in Fano "anti-resonances" in transmission spectra. The resilience of the quasi-localized states and their associated Fano fingerprints is presented with respect to configurational fluctuations. Last, a proof-of-concept electron energy band-stop filter is illustrated, highlighting the potential of the foregoing confinement and, more broadly, valley-dependent topological physics in designing nanoscale single-layer graphene devices.</description>

      <title>Sensitive detection of the Rydberg transition in trapped electrons on liquid helium using radio-frequency reflectometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio-frequency reflectometry, which probes small changes in the electrical impedance of a device, provides a useful method for sensitive and fast detection of dynamic processes in quantum systems. We use this method to detect excitation of the quantized motional (Rydberg) states of trapped electrons on liquid helium. The Rydberg transition in an ensemble of electrons is detected by a change in the impedance of an rf circuit coupled to the microwave-excited electrons. To elucidate the origin of the observed response, the result is compared with an independent impedance measurement on the same electron system modulated by an electrostatic potential and with a numerical simulation using the Green's function method. Additionally, it is found that the rf response to the Rydberg resonance can be strongly enhanced by a resonant mode of the electron collective motion. Our results suggest that the observed response to the Rydberg resonance must be attributed to the lateral motion of the many-electron system rather than the vertical displacement of the individually excited electrons, as was explicate earlier. A theoretical analysis of the expected response due to the vertical displacement is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a solvable one-dimensional spin-1/2 model on the diamond chain featuring three-spin interactions, which displays both, mobile excitations driving a second-order phase transition between an ordered and a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry broken phase, as well as non-trivial fully immobile excitations. The model is motivated by the physics of fracton excitations, which only possess mobility in a reduced dimension compared to the full model. We provide an exact mapping of this model to an arbitrary number of independent transverse-field Ising chain segments with open boundary conditions. The number and lengths of these segments correspond directly to the number of immobile excitations and their respective distances from one another. Furthermore, we demonstrate that multiple immobile excitations exhibit Casimir-like forces between them, resulting in a non-trivial spectrum.</description>

Abstract: Deploying nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as nanoscale quantum sensors for condensed matter and materials physics requires placing the NV centers close to the sensing target. One solution is to fabricate diamond nanostructures and integrate them with materials and devices. However, diamond etching and ion milling can introduce subsurface damage and surface defects that degrade the charge stability and spin coherence of NV centers near the surface. Here we report a procedure for fabricating low-damage nanostructured diamond membranes, and we show that this fabrication scheme preserves the optical and spin properties of state-of-the-art shallow NV center quantum sensors, within nanometers of the diamond surface, while providing significant photonic enhancement. Furthermore, we demonstrate a pick-and-place transfer method, which enables integration with diverse sensing targets.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Gradient Imaging Using a Nonlocal Metasurface System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase imaging enables the analysis of transparent samples with thickness and refractive index variations in scenarios requiring precise measurements under low-light conditions. Recent advances in nonlinear metasurfaces offer compact solutions for quantum light generation and manipulation. Here, we present a compact quantum phase imaging system integrating a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) metasurface for generating spatially entangled photon pairs and a silicon (Si) metasurface for phase gradient extraction. The LiNbO3 metasurface enables efficient spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with angularly dispersed, tunable emission, while the Si metasurface employs a nearly linear optical transfer function (OTF) to differentiate phase and extract phase gradients via spatial quantum correlations. This dual-metasurface enabled combined ghost imaging and all-optical scanning protocols with quantum light achieves phase gradient reconstruction without mechanical tuning. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to resolve phase gradients up to 25 rad/mm with 88% fidelity using a 6x3-pixel proof-of-concept setup. In addition, theoretically, it is confirmed that the resolution of the system is primarily limited by the quality factor of the compact design, leveraging nonlocal resonances and quantum correlations, establishes a new paradigm for portable quantum phase-gradient imaging, with potential applications in sensing, microscopy, and LiDAR. This work highlights the application of metasurface in both generating and detecting quantum states.</description>
