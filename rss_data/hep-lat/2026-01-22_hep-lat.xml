      <title>Acoustic phonons in a magnetized vacuum? First-principle lattice results on the mass spectrum of the electroweak model in a strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use numerical Monte Carlo simulations to determine the mass spectrum of the bosonic sector of the electroweak model in an external magnetic field of the electroweak-scale strength ($10^{20}\,{\rm T}$) at zero temperature. It is known that as the magnetic field gets stronger, the electroweak vacuum undergoes two consecutive crossover-type transitions, passing from (i) the conventional symmetry-broken homogeneous phase to (ii) an intermediate inhomogeneous vortex phase characterized by a (superconducting) condensate of electrically charged $W$ bosons and then to (iii) a homogeneous phase with a restored electroweak symmetry. We show that the spin component of the $W$ boson aligned with the direction of the magnetic field is the lightest excitation in all three phases. Its mass continuously decreases in the low-field broken phase and becomes very small in the intermediate phase. We argue that this nearly massless excitation corresponds to a Goldstone acoustic phonon mode associated with vibrations of the lattice of electroweak vortices. In the high-field symmetry-restored phase, where the vortices disappear, the lightest $W$ mass rises again. Neither Higgs nor $Z$ boson masses vanish across all studied phases and crossover transitions.</description>

      <title>Shear and bulk viscosities of gluon plasma across the transition temperature from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity ($\eta$) and bulk viscosity ($\zeta$) of the gluon plasma using lattice QCD over the range 0.76--2.25 $T_c$, extending from below the transition temperature $T_c$ across the transition region and into the deconfined phase. At each temperature, we employ three large, fine lattices, which enables controlled continuum extrapolations of the energy-momentum tensor correlators. Using gradient flow together with a recently developed blocking technique, we achieve percent level precision for these correlators, providing strong constraints for a model-based spectral analysis. Since the inversion to real-time information is intrinsically ill posed, we extract viscosities by fitting spectral functions whose ultraviolet behavior is matched to the best available perturbative result, while the infrared region is described by a Lorentzian transport peak. The dominant modeling uncertainty associated with the transport-peak width is bracketed by varying it over a physically motivated range set by thermal scales. We find that the shear-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio, $\eta/s$, exhibits a minimum near the transition temperature $T_c$ and increases for $T&gt;T_c$, whereas the bulk-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio, $\zeta/s$, decreases monotonically over the entire temperature range studied.</description>

      <title>Exactly Solvable 1+1d Chiral Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the modified Villain lattice Hamiltonian formulation of the 1+1d compact boson theory, we construct exactly solvable abelian chiral lattice gauge theories in two spacetime dimensions. As a concrete example, we derive an explicit quadratic lattice Hamiltonian for the "34-50" chiral gauge theory. We further show that $N$ copies of the modified Villain theory realize the $O(N,N;\mathbb{Z})$ T-duality transformations, which we then use to solve and analyze these lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Possible Existence of $^3_\phi$H, $^4_\phi$H, $^4_\phi$He, and $^5_\phi$He Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent HAL QCD simulations of the $\phi N$ interaction in the $^4S_{3/2}$ channel and its modification in the $^2S_{1/2}$ channel, we develop a first-principles few-body framework that embeds these potentials into configuration-space Faddeev--Yakubovsky equations. We predict bound $^4_\phi\mathrm{H}$, $^4_\phi\mathrm{He}$, and $^5_\phi\mathrm{He}$ nuclei by performing calculations for $\phi$-mesic $\phi NNN$ and $\phi NNNN$ systems. Both spin-dependent and spin-independent $\phi N$ interactions are considered, leading to deeply and moderately bound states, respectively. The deeply bound states originate from the strong attraction in the $^2S_{1/2}$ $\phi N$ channel. Coulomb shifts of the binding energies are evaluated. Our findings provide the binding mechanism and demonstrate the importance of short-range $\phi N$ attraction.</description>

      <title>$H$ dibaryon and its cousins from SU(6)-constrained baryon-baryon interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We constrain the $S$-wave baryon-baryon interaction using SU(6) symmetry within a nonrelativistic effective field theory. The most general leading-order Lagrangian contains two independent parameters, which we determine using physical $NN$ and lattice QCD $\Omega\Omega$ scattering lengths. This framework allows for parameter-free predictions in the strangeness $S=-2$ sector relevant to the $H$ dibaryon. Solving the coupled-channel scattering problem, we identify two bound states below the $\Lambda\Lambda$ threshold, one deeply bound and one shallow, along with resonances near the $\Sigma\Sigma$ and $\Sigma^*\Sigma^*$ thresholds. We demonstrate that these poles result in distinct enhancements in $\Lambda\Lambda$ invariant mass distributions, suggesting that the $H$ dibaryon exists as a multichannel bound state and providing clear signatures for experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Skewness-dependent moments of the pion GPD from nonlocal quark-bilinear correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present lattice QCD calculations of the odd Mellin moments of pion valence-quark generalized parton distribution (GPD) up to fifth order, $\langle x^4\rangle$, and for the skewness range $[-0.33, 0]$ using operator product expansion of bilocal quark-bilinear operators. The calculations are performed on an ensemble with lattice spacing $a=0.04~\mathrm{fm}$ and valence pion mass $300$ $\mathrm{MeV}$, employing boosted pion states with momenta up to 2.428 GeV and momentum transfers reaching 2.748 GeV$^2$. We employ ratio-scheme renormalization and next-to-leading-logarithmic resummed perturbative matching. At zero skewness, our results are consistent with previous lattice studies. By combining matrix elements at multiple values of skewness and momentum transfer, skewness-dependent moments are obtained through simultaneous polynomiality-constrained fits.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-freedom and massive glueballs in a qubit-regularized SU(2) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) on a plaquette chain serves as a pseudo-one-dimensional toy model for Yang-Mills (YM) theory in three spatial dimensions. We map the chain Hamiltonian to the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) in a uniform magnetic field and demonstrate that it can be tuned to a continuum limit in which the short-distance physics is governed by the asymptotically free Ising conformal field theory (CFT) describing free Majorana fermions, while the long-distance regime contains massive excitations of the $E_8$ quantum field theory (QFT) that can be interpreted as one-dimensional analogues of glueballs. Furthermore, we find $\sqrt{\sigma}/m_1 = 0.249(1)$ where $\sigma$ is the string tension between two static quarks and $m_1$ is the mass of the lightest glueball.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the nature of axial-vector charm-antibottom tetraquark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating the electromagnetic characteristics of unconventional states may offer new insights into their internal structures. In particular, the magnetic moment attributes may serve as a crucial physical observable for differentiating exotic states with disparate configurations or spin-parity quantum numbers. As a promising avenue for research, encompassing both opportunities and challenges, an in-depth examination of the electromagnetic properties of exotic states is crucial for advancing our understanding of unconventional states. Motivated by this, in this study, the magnetic moments of $ \rm{I(J^{P})} = 1(1^{+})$ $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states are analyzed in the framework of QCD light-cone sum rules by considering the diquark-antidiquark approximation, designated as type $3_c \otimes \bar 3_c$. Although the tetraquark states examined in this study have nearly identical masses, their magnetic moment results exhibit noticeable discrepancies. This may facilitate the differentiation between quantum numbers associated with states with identical quark content. The results show that heavy quarks overcoming light quarks can determine both the sign and the magnitude of the magnetic moments of these tetraquark states. The numerical results obtained in this study suggest that the magnetic moments of $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states may reveal aspects of their underlying structure, which could distinguish between their spin-parity quantum numbers and their internal structure. The results obtained regarding the magnetic moments of the $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states may be checked within the context of different phenomenological approaches.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound peak in isospin QCD: a natural prediction of the Medium Separation Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present predictions for the zero-temperature equation of state at finite isospin density using the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model within the medium separation scheme (MSS) -- a scheme that explicitly disentangles medium effects from the ultraviolet divergent vacuum terms. Recent lattice QCD results reveal a nonmonotonic speed of sound ($c_s^2$) as a function of isospin chemical potential ($\mu_I$), exhibiting explicit violation of the conformal bound $c_s^2 = 1/3$. These findings have attracted significant theoretical interest, as established models -- including the NJL model -- failed to anticipate this behavior prior to lattice simulations. Conventional NJL implementations yield unphysical artifacts, often attributed to regularization scale sensitivity stemming from nonrenormalizability. However, in this work, we demonstrate that the standard NJL framework combined with MSS quantitatively reproduces state-of-the-art lattice data for isospin QCD.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Renormalization-Group Evolution for the Nucleon Distribution Amplitude</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine for the first time the two-loop renormalization-group (RG) equation for the nucleon light-cone distribution amplitude, which constitutes the last missing ingredient for the complete next-to-leading-logarithmic corrections to the nucleon form factors in the hard-collinear factorization framework. Applying the conformal expansion for this fundamental nucleon distribution amplitude then enables us to construct an analytic solution that captures the desired scale dependence of phenomenologically interesting series coefficients. Importantly, the two-loop RG evolutions of these central hadronic quantities can bring about noticeable impacts on the corresponding leading-logarithmic results for three sample models of the nucleon distribution amplitude.</description>

      <title>Direct and Indirect Loop Equations in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of Wilson loops are governed by an infinite set of Schwinger-Dyson equations and trace relations. In the context of the lattice positivity bootstrap, a central challenge is determining a dynamically independent basis of these operators within a truncated space. We present a systematic framework to address this problem, utilizing a geometric plaquette-cut and subloop-cut strategy to efficiently generate all (local) direct equations. Furthermore, we identify and analyze "indirect equations", which arise from the elimination of higher-length intermediate loops. We elucidate the origin of these subtle relations and propose a vertex-filtering strategy to construct them. Applying the above framework to SU(2) lattice Yang-Mills theory, we provide explicit counts of independent canonical loops and equations in 2, 3, and 4 dimensions, along with a statistical analysis of their asymptotic growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we scrutinize local gauge-invariant vector operators of dimension four in the adjoint $SU(2)$ Higgs model, which are candidates for interpolating fields of the fundamental excitations of the model due to the so-called FMS mechanism. We use the equations of motion and the properties of the BRST operator to derive a Ward identity that allows us to determine whether a given operator can propagate. To corroborate this analysis, we explicitly compute the two-point function of the non-propagating operator at the one-loop level.</description>
