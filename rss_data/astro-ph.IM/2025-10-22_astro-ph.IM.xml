      <title>Very High Precision Astrometry for Exoplanets and Dark Matter with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrometry, one of the oldest branches of astronomy, has been revolutionized by missions like Hipparcos and especially Gaia, which mapped billions of stars with extraordinary precision. However, challenges such as detecting Earth-like exoplanets in nearby habitable zones and probing the influence of dark matter in galactic environments require sub-microarcsecond accuracy. With a 6--8 meter large-aperture telescope operating across at visible wavelengths, the Habitable Worlds Observatory by NASA can combine astrometry and direct imaging to detect rocky exoplanets within 10 parsecs and study their atmospheres. We consider here the scientific requirements and present a concept for a dedicated astrometric instrument on HWO. It is capable to produce diffraction-limited images of large fields, achieving a point-spread function (PSF) precision of 20 milliarcseconds. Equipped with a detector calibration system, HWO can perform high precision astrometry, and, detect and measure the orbit of Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone of Nearby Solar-type stars. HWO can dramatically improve current constraints on the self- interaction cross-section of heavy dark matter particles (WIMPs) and on the masses of ultra-high dark matter particles, through the study of stellar motions in galactic environments. The visible channel of the instrument features a large CMOS-based focal plane with stitched pixel arrays, enabling a large field of view. The ``Detector Calibration Unit'' system uses interferometric laser fringes to calibrate pixel positions. Using differential astrometry and pointed observations with a stable telescope design enables extended integration times, enhancing sensitivity to sub-microarcsecond precision for detecting exoplanets and studying dark matter through stellar motion.</description>

      <title>Modeling atmospheric phase corruptions in high-frequency VLBI using Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations at (sub)millimeter wavelengths, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) currently achieves the finest angular resolution of any astronomical facility, necessary for imaging the horizon-scale structure around supermassive black holes. A significant calibration challenge for high-frequency VLBI stems from rapid variations in the atmospheric water vapor content above each telescope in the array, which induce corresponding fluctuations in the phase of the correlated signal that limit the coherent integration time and thus the achievable sensitivity. In this paper, we introduce a model that describes station-based phase corruptions jointly with a parameterization for the source structure. We adopt a Gaussian Process (GP) prescription for the time evolution of these phase corruptions, which provides sufficient flexibility to capture even highly erratic phase behavior. The use of GPs permits the application of a Kalman filtering algorithm for numerical marginalization of these phase corruptions, which permits efficient exploration of the remaining parameter space. Our model also removes the need to specify an arbitrary ``reference station'' during calibration, instead establishing a global phase zeropoint by enforcing the GPs at all stations to have fixed mean and finite variance. We validate our method using a real EHT observation of the blazar 3C 279, demonstrating that our approach yields calibration solutions that are consistent with those determined by the EHT Collaboration. The model presented here can be straightforwardly extended to incorporate frequency-dependent phase behavior, such as is relevant for the frequency phase transfer calibration technique.</description>

      <title>Segmentation and Celestial Mapping of Unobservable Regions in Nighttime All-sky Images for the Mephisto Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate identification of unobservable regions in nighttime is essential for autonomous scheduling and data quality control in observations.Traditional methods-such as infrared sensing or photometric extinction-provide only coarse,non-spatial estimates of sky clarity,making them insufficient for real-time decision-making.This not only wastes observing time but also introduces contamination when telescopes are directed toward cloud-covered or moonlight-affected regions.To address these limitations,we propose a deep learning-based segmentation framework that provides pixel-level masks of unobservable areas using all-sky images.Supported by a manually annotated dataset of nighttime images,our method enables precise detection of cloud- and moonlight-affected regions.The segmentation results are further mapped to celestial coordinates through Zenithal Equal-Area projection,allowing seamless integration with observation control systems (OCS) for real-time cloud-aware scheduling.While developed for the Mephisto telescope,the framework is generalizable and applicable to other wide-field robotic observatories equipped with all-sky monitoring.</description>

      <title>Advances in detector response and background modelling in the ANAIS-112 experiment for annual modulation and other rare event searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous astronomical and cosmological observations point to the existence of dark matter, which constitutes about 27% of the Universe. Despite extensive efforts, only the DAMA/LIBRA experiment, using NaI(Tl) detectors at Gran Sasso National Laboratory, has reported a positive dark matter signal. To independently verify this result, using the same NaI target is essential. This is the goal of ANAIS-112, operating with 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl) scintillators since 2017 at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC). This thesis presents work within ANAIS-112, focusing on data analysis and the development of Geant4-based simulations to reduce systematics and increase sensitivity. Efforts have focused on understanding the ANAIS-112 crystals' response to nuclear recoils. Systematic uncertainties related to the scintillation quenching factors (QFs) of sodium and iodine recoiling in NaI(Tl) must be addressed to ensure reliable comparisons with DAMA/LIBRA and other experiments. For that purpose, onsite neutron calibrations in ANAIS-112 have been performed since 2021 at LSC using 252Cf sources. This work has compared calibration data with Geant4-based neutron simulations, which has revealed Geant4 deficiencies in certain decay processes and cross sections in some versions. The simulations have proven highly sensitive to the QF used, favouring models in which the QF increases with energy and disfavouring DAMA values. In parallel, this thesis has contributed to improving the ANAIS-112 background model through a multiparametric fit of its background components. New physics searches have been conducted using ANAIS-112 data, including a reanalysis of the annual modulation signal and a search for solar axions using six years of exposure. Finally, this thesis also includes work within the COSINUS experiment, focused on background modelling and the impact of internal backgrounds on the experiment's sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Singular Value-based Atmospheric Tomography with Fourier Domain Regularization (SAFR)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric tomography, the problem of reconstructing atmospheric turbulence profiles from wavefront sensor measurements, is an integral part of many adaptive optics systems. It is used to enhance the image quality of ground-based telescopes, such as for the Multiconjugate Adaptive Optics Relay For ELT Observations (MORFEO) instrument on the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). To solve this problem, a singular-value decomposition (SVD) based approach has been proposed before. In this paper, we focus on the numerical implementation of the SVD-based Atmospheric Tomography with Fourier Domain Regularization Algorithm (SAFR) and its performance for Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems. The key features of the SAFR algorithm are the utilization of the FFT and the pre-computation of computationally demanding parts. Together, this yields a fast algorithm with less memory requirements than commonly used Matrix Vector Multiplication (MVM) approaches. We evaluate the performance of SAFR regarding reconstruction quality and computational expense in numerical experiments using the simulation environment COMPASS, in which we use an MCAO setup resembling the physical parameters of the MORFEO instrument of the ELT.</description>

      <title>A spectral library and census of near-infrared stellar large-amplitude variables from Palomar Gattini-IR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a near-infrared census of stellar large-amplitude variables (LAVs) observed by the Palomar Gattini-IR (PGIR) surveyor from 2019-2021. Over the three-year time period, PGIR performed a brightness-limited survey of the Northern sky (18,000 sq. deg) to J-band AB magnitudes of $\sim 13$ within and $\sim 15$ outside the Galactic plane. From 70 million stars detected in PGIR reference images, we provide a spectral and photometric library of the 128 largest amplitude stellar variables detected to median SNR &gt; 10 for more than 50 epochs with more than 5 high-amplitude detections, peak-to-peak magnitudes $\geq$ 2, and von Neumann ratios $\leq$ 0.2. We obtained medium-resolution near-infrared spectra with TripleSpec on the 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory and SpeX at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility. The spectral census consists of 82 evolved and dust-obscured Asymptotic Giant Branch stars, 16 R Coronae Borealis stars, 13 young-stellar or pre-main-sequence objects, 8 symbiotic binaries, 7 erratic carbon- and oxygen-rich giants, and 2 RV Tauri supergiants. The spectral and photometric dataset serves as an atlas of near-infrared LAVs and a repository of evolved stars, eruptive variables, and binary systems for future deeper infrared surveys.</description>

      <title>Global time-frequency search for stellar-mass binary black holes in LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete pipeline for detecting and characterising gravitational waves (GWs) produced by the inspiral of stellar-mass binary black holes in data from the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The analysis framework relies on an efficient time-frequency implementation of an adaptive semi-coherent detection statistic, which we show to be robust against non-stationary noise and the presence of gaps of varying duration and cadence. The search is able to detect signals down to a coherent signal-to-noise ratio $\approx$ 11 over the full parameter space of black holes with spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum and orbital eccentricity $\leq$ 0.01 when deployed on the 2-year-long LISA Data Challenge Yorsh. The search can be run within a day using $\approx$ 40 GPUs. The techniques presented here have wider applications in GW astronomy, in particular the search for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals in LISA data.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning Beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning enables powerful cosmological inference but typically requires many high-fidelity simulations covering many cosmological models. Transfer learning offers a way to reduce the simulation cost by reusing knowledge across models. We show that pre-training on the standard model of cosmology, $\Lambda$CDM, and fine-tuning on various beyond-$\Lambda$CDM scenarios -- including massive neutrinos, modified gravity, and primordial non-Gaussianities -- can enable inference with significantly fewer beyond-$\Lambda$CDM simulations. However, we also show that negative transfer can occur when strong physical degeneracies exist between $\Lambda$CDM and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM parameters. We consider various transfer architectures, finding that including bottleneck structures provides the best performance. Our findings illustrate the opportunities and pitfalls of foundation-model approaches in physics: pre-training can accelerate inference, but may also hinder learning new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian latent model to describe the scaling relation between globular cluster populations and their host galaxies, updating the framework proposed in de Souza 2015. GC counts are drawn from a negative-binomial (NB) process linked to host stellar mass, augmented with a newly introduced Gaussian observation layer that enables efficient propagation of measurement errors. The revised formulation preserves the underlying NB process while improving computational tractability. The code snippets, implemented in Nimble and PyMC are released under the MIT license at https://github.com/COINtoolbox/Generalized-Linear-Models-Tutorial/blob/master/Count/readme.md</description>

      <title>Application and development of advanced mathematical tools for population and time series analysis in pulsar astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we introduce novel methods for analyzing pulsar populations using a variety of mathematical techniques. These tools-particularly graph theory-have been thoroughly validated in advanced mathematics, enabling us to overcome some of the constraints (even dimensional) inherent in conventional visualization approaches. This exploration benefits from dimensionality reduction techniques, which not only lessen computational demands but also highlight potential for describing physical characteristics. The resulting structures encode information about pulsar similarities that extend beyond standard spin parameters, revealing relationships that are not readily apparent in traditional diagrams. With a physically motivated topological perspective, we leverage the strengths of these methods and present results that span from prospective source classification and the emergence of new classes to catalog comparison, among other applications. This new approach enables fresh interpretations of longstanding problems, laying a new foundation for visualizing the pulsar population and categorizing sources. Building on this, we identify several sources as likely members of specific binary subclasses and investigate the potential transitional nature of others. Furthermore, we extend the use of graph theory to the boundary of machine learning, demonstrating its capability for binary separation in an unsupervised context. Finally, we introduce and apply an innovative, flexible time-series alignment technique to the field of gamma-ray astrophysics. The method identifies notable similarities among the light curves of gamma-ray pulsars. The results presented here are promising, offering a refreshing direction for the field and new pathways for rigorous mathematical analysis, ultimately providing meaningful alternatives to traditional approaches in high-energy astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Exploring Synergies between Twinkle and Ariel: a Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Launching in 2027 and 2029, respectively, Twinkle and Ariel will conduct the first large-scale homogeneous spectroscopic surveys of the atmospheres of hundreds of diverse exoplanets. This will fundamentally transition the field to an era of population-level characterisation. In this pilot study, we aim to explore possible synergies between Twinkle and Ariel to determine for instance whether prior Twinkle observations can substantially inform the target selection and observing strategy of Ariel. This study primarily aims to encourage further investigation by both consortium communities by showing what a potential scientific synergy would look like on a promising scientific case that requires further exploration. For this aim, we select a small subset of "cool" planets that are also particularly well-suited to be observed by Twinkle and therefore Ariel. By using representative noise estimates for both missions, we compute the number of visits required for an observation. Then, we simulate and retrieve transmission spectra of each target, assuming gaseous, H2/He-dominated atmospheres and various atmospheric models. For all candidates, we find that atmospheric parameters are generally retrieved well within 1-sigma to input values, with Ariel typically achieving tighter constraints. We demonstrate that for a small subset of cool gaseous planets, exploitable synergies exist between Twinkle and Ariel observations and Twinkle may very well provide a vantage point to plan Ariel observations. The true extent of the potential synergies, far beyond our considered sample, will be determined by the final target lists. Once Twinkle is operational and its performance is known, it could reliably inform Ariel's target prioritization and Ariel's capabilities which are already well-established can help define optimal targets and observational approaches for Twinkle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will generate an unprecedented volume of data, including approximately 60 petabytes of raw data and around 30 trillion observed sources, posing a significant challenge for large-scale and end-user scientific analysis. As part of the LINCC Frameworks Project we are addressing these challenges with the development of the HATS (Hierarchical Adaptive Tiling Scheme) format and analysis package LSDB. HATS partitions data adaptively using a hierarchical tiling system to balance the file sizes, enabling efficient parallel analysis. Recent updates include improved metadata consistency, support for incremental updates, and enhanced compatibility with evolving datasets. LSDB complements HATS by providing a scalable, user-friendly interface for large catalog analysis, integrating spatial queries, crossmatching, and time-series tools while utilizing Dask for parallelization. We have successfully demonstrated the use of these tools with datasets such as ZTF and Pan-STARRS data releases on both cluster and cloud environments. We are deeply involved in several ongoing collaborations to ensure alignment with community needs, with future plans for IVOA standardization and support for upcoming Rubin, Euclid and Roman data. We provide our code and materials at lsdb.io.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature Performance of $\mathrm{Gd_3(Ga, Al)_5O_{12}}$:Ce Scintillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The last years have seen the first cryogenic detectors to be proposed for usage on balloon-borne missions. In such missions, the instrument will be exposed to the high radiation environment of the upper atmosphere. This radiation can induce a significant background to the measurements, something which can be mitigated through the use of an anti-coincidence shield. For hard X-ray and gamma-ray detectors such a shield typically consists photomultiplier tubes or, more recently, silicon photomultipliers coupled to scintillators placed around the detector. When using cryogenic detectors, the shield can be placed around the entire cryostat which will make it large, heavy and expensive. For the ASCENT (A SuperConducting ENergetic x-ray Telescope) mission, which uses Transition Edge Detectors, it was therefore considered to instead place the shield inside. This comes with the challenge of operating it at cryogenic temperatures. For this purpose, we tested the performance of 2 different types of GAGG:Ce scintillators down to 15 mK for the first time. Although significant variations of both the decay time and the light yield were found when varying the temperature, at 4 K its performance was found to be similar to that at room temperature. Furthermore, unexpected behavior around 2 K was found for both types of GAGG:Ce, leading to more in depth studies around these temperatures. Overall, the studies show that the combination of materials will allow to produce a functional anti-coincidence shield at several Kelvin.</description>
