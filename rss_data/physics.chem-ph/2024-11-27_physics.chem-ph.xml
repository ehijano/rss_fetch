      <title>MOLPIPx: an end-to-end differentiable package for permutationally invariant polynomials in Python and Rust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present MOLPIPx, a versatile library designed to seamlessly integrate Permutationally Invariant Polynomials (PIPs) with modern machine learning frameworks, enabling the efficient development of linear models, neural networks, and Gaussian process models. These methodologies are widely employed for parameterizing potential energy surfaces across diverse molecular systems. MOLPIPx leverages two powerful automatic differentiation engines -JAX and EnzymeAD-Rust- to facilitate the efficient computation of energy gradients and higher-order derivatives, which are essential for tasks such as force field development and dynamic simulations. MOLPIPx is available at https://github.com/ChemAI-Lab/molpipx.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium relaxation exponentially delays the onset of quantum diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the exact many-body quantum dynamics of polarons in materials with strong carrier-phonon interactions presents a fundamental challenge, often necessitating one to adopt approximations that sacrifice the ability to predict the transition from nonequilibrium relaxation to thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we exploit a recent breakthrough that generalizes the concept of memory beyond its conventional temporal meaning to also encompass space. Specifically, we leverage our discovery that the dynamics of observables in systems with local couplings satisfy Green's functions with kernels that are local in time and space. This enables us to employ the dynamics of small lattices over short times to predict the dynamics of thermodynamically large lattices over arbitrarily long timescales while circumventing the deleterious impacts of finite-size effects. We thus interrogate the \textit{exact} nonequilibrium formation and migration of polarons in one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) systems, revealing that their motion approaches diffusive transport only asymptotically in time and system size. We also compare transport in 1D and 2D systems to investigate the effect of dimension in polaron migration physics, illustrating how energy variations can cause localization -- a phenomenon observable via current microscopy experiments.</description>

      <title>On the Hidden Transient Interphase in Metal Anodes: Dynamic Precipitation Controls Electrochemical Interfaces in Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, SEI, formed on a battery electrode has been a central area of research for decades. This thin, complex layer profoundly impacts the electrochemical deposition morphology and stability of the metal in battery anodes. Departing from conventional approaches, we investigate metal dissolution, the reverse reaction of deposition, in battery environments using a state-of-the-art electroanalytical system combining a rotating-disk electrode and in-operando visualization. Our key finding is the presence of a Transient Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, T-SEI, that forms during fast discharging at high dissolution rates. We attribute T-SEI formation to transient local supersaturation and resultant electrolyte salt deposition. The T-SEI fundamentally alters the dissolution kinetics at the electrochemical interface, leading to a self-limiting morphological evolution and eventually yielding a flat, clean surface. Unlike a classical SEI formed due to electrolyte decomposition, the T-SEI is fully relaxable upon removal of the enforced dissolution current. The formation of T-SEI, surprisingly, plays a critical role in the subsequent electrodeposition. When the metal is redeposited on a fully relaxed T-SEI surface, the morphology is remarkably different from that deposited on pristine or low-rate discharged metal electrodes. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis suggests a homoepitaxial relationship with the original grains in the electrode. This is in stark contrast to the isolated, particulate nuclei seen on standard metal electrodes without T-SEI formation. Our findings provide important insights into the electrochemical kinetics at the metal-electrolyte interface, particularly in concentrated or water-in-salt electrolytes that are close to the salt saturation limit. The results suggest a new dimension for electrochemical engineering in batteries.</description>

      <title>A fluorescent-protein spin qubit</title>

Abstract: Optically-addressable spin qubits form the foundation of a new generation of emerging nanoscale sensors. The engineering of these sensors has mainly focused on solid-state systems such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. However, NVs are restricted in their ability to interface with biomolecules due to their bulky diamond host. Meanwhile, fluorescent proteins have become the gold standard in bioimaging, as they are genetically encodable and easily integrated with biomolecules. While fluorescent proteins have been suggested to possess a metastable triplet state, they have not been investigated as qubit sensors. Here, we realize an optically-addressable spin qubit in the Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein (EYFP) enabled by a novel spin-readout technique. A near-infrared laser pulse allows for triggered readout of the triplet state with up to 44% spin contrast. Using coherent microwave control of the EYFP spin at liquid-nitrogen temperatures, we measure a spin-lattice relaxation time of $(141 \pm 5)$ {\mu}s, a $(16 \pm 2)$ {\mu}s coherence time under Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) decoupling, and a predicted oscillating (AC) magnetic field sensitivity with an upper bound of $183 \, \mathrm{fT}\, \mathrm{mol}^{1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. We express the qubit in mammalian cells, maintaining contrast and coherent control despite the complex intracellular environment. Finally, we demonstrate optically-detected magnetic resonance at room temperature in aqueous solution with contrast up to 3%, and measure a static (DC) field sensitivity with an upper bound of $93 \, \mathrm{pT}\, \mathrm{mol}^{1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. Our results establish fluorescent proteins as a powerful new qubit sensor platform and pave the way for applications in the life sciences that are out of reach for solid-state technologies.</description>

      <title>Fast, accurate, and error-resilient noise spectroscopy via basis optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting and characterizing decoherence-inducing noise sources is critical for developing scalable quantum technologies and deploying quantum sensors that operate at molecular scales. Yet, existing methods for such noise spectroscopy face fundamental difficulties, including their reliance on severe approximations and the need for extensively averaged measurements. Here, we propose an alternative approach that processes the commonly performed dynamical decoupling-based coherence measurements using a novel self-consistent optimization framework to extract the noise power spectrum that characterizes the interaction between a qubit or quantum sensor and its environment. Our approach adopts minimal assumptions and is robust to the presence of measurement errors. We introduce a protocol to quantify confidence intervals and a physically motivated heuristic to determine which new dynamical decoupling measurement can improve spectral reconstruction. We employ our method to reconstruct the noise spectrum of a nitrogen-vacancy sensor in diamond, resolving previously undetected nuclear species at the diamond surface and revealing that the previous measurements of low-frequency noise had overestimated its strength by an order of magnitude. Our method's noise spectrum reconstructions uncover previously unsuspected structure and offer unprecedented accuracy, setting the stage for precision noise spectroscopy-based quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Adsorption of molecular hydrogen on honeycomb ZnO monolayers: A quantum density-functional theory perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the adsorption of molecular hydrogen on pristine zinc oxide (ZnO) platelets. The volumetric and gravimetric hydrogen storage capacities of the ZnO monolayers are evaluated in a broad range of thermodynamic conditions (i.e., for temperatures in the range 77 K &lt; T &lt; 450 K, and for external gas pressures up to 200 bar). The thermodynamic properties and the microscopic spatial distribution of the adsorbed hydrogen fluid are assessed within the density functional theory of liquids for quantum fluids at finite temperature (QLDFT), and the adsorption enthalphies are obtained by fitting the computed adsorption densities to the Toth model isotherm. Compared to graphene platelets, the ZnO sheets impose a rather tighter confinement to the motion of the hydrogen molecules parallel to the surface. The isosteric heat of adsorption approaches 3.2 kJ/mol in the low density regime. This quantity shows a fairly smooth dependence on the hydrogen uptake for temperatures below 100 K, while it is shown to depend quite sensitively on the adsorbate density above this temperature.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy mediated liquid-to-solid nucleation and transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are a powerful tool for studying matter at the atomic scale. However, to simulate solids, an initial atomic structure is crucial for the successful execution of MD simulations, but can be difficult to prepare due to insufficient atomistic information. At the same time Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS) measurements can determine the Radial Distribution Function (RDF) of atomic structures. However, the interpretation of RDFs is often challenging. Here we present an algorithm that can bias MD simulations with RDFs by combining the information of the MD atomic interaction potential and the RDF under the principle of maximum relative entropy. We show that this algorithm can be used to adjust the RDF of one liquid model, e.g., the TIP3P water model, to reproduce the RDF and improve the Angular Distribution Function (ADF) of another model, such as the TIP4P/2005 water model. In addition, we demonstrate that the algorithm can initiate crystallization in liquid systems, leading to both stable and metastable crystalline states defined by the RDF, e.g., crystallization of water to ice and liquid TiO2 to rutile or anatase. Finally, we discuss how this method can be useful for improving interaction models, studying crystallization processes, interpreting measured RDFs, or training machine learned potentials.</description>

      <title>One dimensional chains of nickelocene fragments on Au(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the temperature-dependent deposition of nickelocene (NiCp$_2$) molecules on a single crystal Au(111) substrate, revealing distinct adsorption behaviors and structural formations. At low temperatures (4.2 K), individual NiCp$_2$ molecules adsorb on the herringbone elbows and step edges, forming ordered patterns as molecular coverage increases. However, at 77 K, the molecules dissociate, yielding two main fragments: NiCp fragments that are Ni atoms capped by cyclopentadienyl (Cp) rings, which preferentially adsorb at FCC hollow sites, and Cp radical fragments exhibiting strong substrate interactions. NiCp fragments self-assemble into one-dimensional (1-D) chains along the $\langle 1 1 \bar{2} \rangle$ directions, displaying higher protrusion in STM images. The strain and steric hindrance from the Cp protons induce chiral patterns within the chains, which are well-reproduced by our DFT simulations. In contrast, the Cp fragments maintain distances due to short-range repulsive forces and exhibit low diffusion barriers. Interestingly, the fragments are non-magnetic, as confirmed by both STM measurements and DFT calculations, in contrast to the magnetic signals from intact Nc molecules. In addition to linear chains, dimers of the Ni-Cp fragments form along the $\langle 1 \bar{1} 0\rangle$ directions, requiring gold adatoms for their creation. These results demonstrate the feasibility of constructing complex nanostructures based on metallocenes via on-surface synthesis, opening the possibility for realizing low-dimensional magnetic systems by selecting substrates that preserve the magnetic moment of the fragments.</description>

      <title>Magnetization and Polarization of Coupled Nuclear Spin Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), the bulk magnetization of a sample is commonly assumed to be proportional to spin polarization, with each spin of the same type contributing equally to the measured signal. In this work, we prove the high-field theorem for general spin-I systems (where I is the spin quantum number): the total measurable NMR signal remains unaffected by the grouping of spins into equivalent units (e.g., molecules), provided the system is at thermodynamic equilibrium in the high field limit (hbar\omega_0 &gt;&gt; |H_spin-spin|, where \omega_0 is the Larmor frequency and |H_spin-spin| characterizes internal spin-spin interactions). The results are derived using both magnetization equations and density matrix formalism. The theorem, however, does not extend to conditions far from thermodynamic equilibrium or such as zero- to ultralow-field NMR. We also present three educational problems designed to deepen understanding of the material in classroom settings. This work reinforces established principles in magnetic resonance but also highlights areas for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Solvent Effect on NAPBr Dye's Two-photon Absorption Ability and Non-Radiative Transition in Lipid Droplets Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-photon fluorescence imaging has shown a promising application in biomedical imaging due to its outstanding advantages such as large penetration depth, low photo-damage, and photo-bleaching, etc. Among them, the two-photon fluorescent dye NAPBr, which can effectively select and monitor lipid droplets in living cells and biological tissues, has attracted extensive attention because of its excellent fluorescent properties. However, the research on the fluorescent abilities of two-photon fluorescent dyes in solvent environment is not sufficient. In our work, theoretical analysis reveals the internal mechanism of the solvent effect on geometric structure and photophysical properties of two-photon fluorescent dyes, especially non-radiative transition process, and holes-electrons distribution and transfer. This can provide a reference for the development of efficient two-photon absorption (TPA) molecules with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics. Related data also showed good regularity. Moreover, dye in four solvents have excellent photophysical properties: high fluorescence quantum efficiency (up to 66.60%), large Stokes shift (up to 108696 cm-1), and two-photon absorption cross section (up to 3658 GM). The medium dielectric constant solution environment can achieve a balance between two-photon absorption and fluorescence emission capabilities better, which lays a solid foundation for the study of TPA molecules with AIE functions in terms of solvent effects.</description>

      <title>Aperiodic defects in periodic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To date, computational methods for modeling defects (vacancies, adsorbates, etc.) rely on periodic supercells in which the defect is far enough from its repeated image such that they can be assumed non-interacting. Yet, the relative proximity and periodic repetition of the defect's images may lead to spurious, unphysical artifacts, especially if the defect is charged and/or open-shell, causing a very slow convergence to the thermodynamic limit (TDL). In this Letter, we introduce a "defectless" embedding formalism such that the embedding field is computed in a pristine, primitive-unit-cell calculation. Subsequently, a single (i.e. "aperiodic") defect, which can also be charged, is introduced inside the embedded fragment. By eliminating the need for compensating background charges and periodicity of the defect, we circumvent all associated unphysicalities and numerical issues, achieving a very fast convergence to the TDL. Furthermore, using the toolbox of post-Hartree-Fock methods, this scheme can be straightforwardly applied to study strongly correlated defects, localized excited states and other problems, for which existing periodic protocols do not provide a satisfactory description.</description>
