      <title>The trace formula of GL(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trace formula is an important method to study the Langlands program. In this paper, we will give the explicit coarse trace formula of $\GL(3)$. In general case, Arthur applies the truncation operator on the two sides of trace formula such that they are convergent. In our case, we will prove that the divergent terms of the two sides of the trace formula of $\GL(3)$ are equal. We also obtain the explicit formula for ramified orbits of the geometric side of $\GL(3)$, and show it can be expressed as a limit of distributions of the unramified orbits.</description>

Abstract: Trace formula is an important method to study the Langlands program. Arthur obtains the existence of stable trace formula for connected reductive group. In this paper, we will give the explicit coarse trace formula of GL(4). In general case, Arthur applies the truncation operator on the two sides of trace formula, which is convergent. In our case, we will prove that the divergent terms of the two sides of the trace formula of GL(4)$ are equal. We also obtain the explicit formula for ramified orbits of the geometric side of trace formula of GL(4).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{H}_q$ denote the quaternionic Heisenberg group with $\mathbb{R}^4\times\mathbb{R}^3$ stratification and $K$ a compact subgroup of Automorphism. We construct the spherical Fourier multiplier related to a Gelfand Pairs on the Quaternionic Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}_q$ via the motion group $G=K\ltimes \mathbb{H}_q$ of $\mathbb{H}_q$, where $K\ltimes \mathbb{H}_q$ is the semidirect product of $\mathbb{H}_q$ and its compact subgroup of automorphism $K\in Aut(\mathbb{H}_q)$.</description>

      <title>Classification of silted algebras for two quivers of Dynkin type $\mathbb{D}_{n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Q$ be the Dynkin quiver of type $\mathbb{D}_{n}$ with linear orientation and let $Q'$ be the quiver formed by reversing the arrow at the unique source in $Q$. In this paper, we present a complete classification of both silted algebras and strictly shod algebras associated with these two quivers. Based on the classification, we derive formulas for counting the number of silted algebras and strictly shod algebras.
  Furthermore, we establish that all strictly shod algebras corresponding to $Q$ and $Q'$ are string algebras. As an application, we provide a way to construct examples such that the realization functor which is induced from the $t$-structure does not extend to a derived equivalence.</description>

      <title>Fourier Inversion on the Group of Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this work is to develop a framework for Fourier analysis on the group of signatures, $G_N(\mathbb{R}^d)$. Employing Kirillov's orbit method, we define the Fourier transform on this group via irreducible unitary representations. Our main contribution is the derivation of necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying coadjoint orbits in general position of $G_N(\mathbb{R}^d)$. This enables the computation of the set of \textit{jump-indices} of generic orbits, crucial for the Fourier inversion theorem. We also obtain an explicit construction of a polarization for any linear functional in general position, which allows a concrete description of the Fourier transform of functions on $G_N(\mathbb{R}^d)$. This framework yields an explicit Fourier inversion formula for the group of signatures in arbitrary dimension.
  Furthermore, we show that the theoretical framework developed here extends naturally to a broader class of graded Lie groups, including the group generated by the truncated tensor algebra $T_0^N(\mathbb{R}^d)$.</description>

      <title>K-theoretic Hikita conjecture for quiver gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study variants of Hikita conjecture for Nakajima quiver varieties and corresponding Coulomb branches. First, we derive the equivariant version of the conjecture from the non-equivariant one for a set of gauge theories. Second, we suggest a variant of the conjecture, with K-theoretic Coulomb branches involved. We show that this version follows from the usual (homological) one for a set of theories. We apply this result to prove the conjecture in finite ADE types. In the course of the proof, we show that appropriate completions of K-theoretic and homological (quantized) Coulomb branches are isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Rickard's Derived Morita Theory: Review and Outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey the main results in Jeremy Rickard's seminal papers `Morita theory for derived categories' and `Derived equivalences and derived functors'. These papers catalysed the later development of the Morita theory of (enhanced) compactly generated triangulated categories by Keller in the algebraic setting and by Schwede and Shipley in the topological setting. We also discuss the role of Rickard's notion of splendid equivalence in the context of Brou\'e's abelian defect group conjecture, and indicate an alternative proof of parts of Rickard's Derived Morita Theorem that leverages the notion of completion of a triangulated category.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Plethysm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multiplicities $a^{d\lambda}_{\mu,(dk)}$ of highest weight representations $\mathbb S_{d\lambda}(\mathbb C^n)$, $\lambda\vdash pk$, of length at most $p$, in $\mathbb{S}_{\mu}(S^{dk}(\mathbb C^n))$, $\mu\vdash p$, so called plethysm coefficients, as $d$ tends to $\infty$. These are given by quasi-polynomials, which in the case of $S^p(S^{dk}(\mathbb C^n))$ can explicitly be computed by Pieri's rule. We show that for all but a finite, explicit list of $\lambda$'s the leading term is in fact constant and that $$
  a^{d\lambda}_{\mu,(dk)}\sim \frac{\dim V_\mu}{p!}c^{d\lambda}_{p,dk} $$ as $d\to\infty$. In particular, we answer a conjecture of Kahle and Micha\l ek, going back to Howe.</description>

      <title>Real $C$-, $G$-structures and sign-coherence of cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the theory of integer $C$-, $G$-matrices in cluster algebras to the real case. By a skew-symmetrizing method, we can reduce the problem of skew-symmetrizable patterns to the one of skew-symmetric patterns. In this sense, we extend the sign-coherence of integer $C$-, $G$-matrices proved by Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich to a more general real class called of quasi-integer type. Furthermore, we give a complete classification of this type by a combinatorial method of real weighted quivers. However, the sign-coherence of real $C$-, $G$-matrices does not always hold in general. For this purpose, we classify all the rank $2$ case and the finite type case via the Coxeter diagrams. We also give two conjectures about the real exchange matrices and $C$-, $G$-matrices. Under these conjectures, the dual mutation, $G$-fan structure and synchronicity property hold. As an application, the isomorphism of several kinds of exchange graphs is studied.</description>

      <title>Tropical Toeplitz matrices and parametrisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The set of infinite upper-triangular totally positive Toeplitz matrices has a classical parametrisation proved by Edrei et al and originally conjectured by Schoenberg, that involves pairs of sequences of positive real parameters. These matrices (and their parameters) are central for understanding characters of the infinite symmetric group by work of Thoma. On the other hand there is a very different parametrisation theorem that applies to the finite analogue of this set. These finite Toeplitz matrices and their parameters relate to quantum cohomology of flag varieties and mirror symmetry. In this paper we replace the positive reals by a semifield with valuation to then construct tropical analogues for both parametrisation theorems. In the finite case we tropicalise using positive generalised Puiseaux series. This builds on work of Judd and L\"udenbach. In the infinite case we use a new valued semifield of continuous functions. We arrive at different natural infinite analogues of totally positive Toeplitz matrices, depending on a choice of topology on our valued semifield. We then prove an asymptotic result relating the tropical parameters from the finite case to the tropicalisations of the Schoenberg parameters. Moreover, we show that our finite type tropical parametrisation map is given by Lusztig's weight map from the theory of canonical bases. This results in a surprising connection between the classical Edrei theorem with its Schoenberg parameters and Lusztig's canonical basis parametrisation.</description>

      <title>Explicit Generators for the Unit Group of the Burnside ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To the best of our knowledge, there is no explicit, constructive description of the generating set for the unit group $A(G)^\times$ of the Burnside ring associated with a finite group $G$. We resolve this long-standing open question, proving that $A(G)^\times$ is generated by the set of \emph{basic degrees} -- canonical Burnside ring elements arising from the $G$-equivariant degree of the identity map on irreducible $G$-representations. In particular, we demonstrate that every unit in $A(G)$ is realized as the equivariant degree of a linear $G$-isomorphism on a suitable orthogonal $G$-representation which, in turn, can be described as the Burnside ring product of a finite number of basic degrees, establishing a concrete link between the multiplicative structure of the Burnside ring and the field of equivariant topology.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and explore in-depth the notion of {\it weakly strongly 2-nil-clean rings} as a common non-trivial generalization of both strongly 2-nil-clean rings and strongly weakly nil-clean rings as defined and studied by Chen-Sheibani in the J. Algebra \&amp; Appl. (2017). We, specifically, succeeded to prove that any weakly strongly 2-nil-clean ring is strongly $\pi$-regular and, concretely, it decomposes as the direct product of a strongly 2-nil-clean ring and a ring of the type $\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$ for some $k\geq 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathsf{mod} R$ denote the category of finitely generated $R$-modules for a commutative noetherian ring $R$. In this paper, we investigate KE-closed subcategories of $\mathsf{mod} R$ as a continuation of our previous work. We associate a function on $\mathrm{Spec} R$ with each KE-closed subcategory of $\mathsf{mod} R$, and show that this function completely determines the original subcategory. To classify the functions obtained from KE-closed subcategories, we introduce the notion of an $n$-Bass function for each $n\ge 0$. We obtain a bijection between the set of KE-closed subcategories and the set of $2$-Bass functions provided that $R$ is $(S_2)$-excellent in the sense of \v{C}esnavi\v{c}ius.</description>

Abstract: The row-strict 0-Hecke action on standard immaculate skew tableaux was studied by the present authors, who showed that it gives rise to a bounded poset, called the \emph{skew immaculate Hecke poset}, and consequently to a cyclic 0-Hecke module. It was further shown that the subposet of skew standard extended immaculate tableaux always has a unique maximal element, but may have multiple minimal elements. In this paper we focus on these minimal elements, completely classifying them for a family of skew shapes that we call \emph{lobsters}. Moreover, we prove that when the skew shape is connected, the skew extended Hecke poset does have a unique minimal element, thereby showing that the associated 0-Hecke module is cyclic for both the row-strict and the dual immaculate actions.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Wavefront Sets and Generic $L$-packets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a classical group defined over a local field $F$ of characteristic zero. Let $\pi$ be an irreducible admissible representation $\pi$ of $G(F)$, which is of Casselman-Wallach type if $F$ is archimedean. If $\pi$ has a generic local $L$-parameter, we define the arithmetic wavefront set ${\rm WF_{ari}}(\pi)$ of $\pi$, which is a subset of $F$-rational nilpotent orbits of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}(F)$ of $G(F)$, by means of the arithmetic structures of the enhanced $L$-parameter $(\varphi,\chi)$ of $\pi$. Those arithmetic structures are discovered by using our method of consecutive descents of enhanced $L$-parameters, based on the rationality of the local Langlands correspondence and the local Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture. We study the basic structure of ${\rm WF_{ari}(\pi)}$ and prove that it is an invariant of $\pi$ (Theorem 5.10). Furthermore, those basic structures ${\rm WF_{ari}(\pi)^{max}}$ are expected to yield the precise $F$-rational structure of ${\rm WF_{ari}(\pi)^{max}}$, which has been realized, when $F$ is archimedean, in Theorems 1.3 and 1.4 (Theorems 7.10, 7.14, and 9.2). Based on the local Langlands reciprocity, the Wavefront Set Conjecture (Conjecture 1.2 and Conjecture 5.14) asserts that the wavefront sets on the L-parameter side should be closed related to those on the representation side, namely, \[ {\rm WF_{wm}(\pi)^{max}}={\rm WF_{ari}(\pi)^{max}}={\rm WF_{tr}(\pi)^{max}} \] when $\pi$ has a generic local $L$-parameter, where the algebraic wavefront set ${\rm WF_{wm}}(\pi)$ is defined by Moeglin and Waldspurger in [MW87], using generalized Whittaker models and the analytic wavefront set ${\rm WF_{tr}}(\pi)$ is defined by Howe [H81, Hd85] using distribution characters, and also by [H74, HC78, BV80]. Conjecture 1.2 is verified for families of interesting cases.</description>

Abstract: Denote by $SL_3(\mathbb R)$ the special linear group of degree 3 over the real numbers, $A$ the subgroup consisting of the diagonal matrices with positive entries. In this paper, we study the algebraic and analytic properties of the invariant differential operators on the homogeneous space $SL_3(\mathbb R)/A$. Firstly, we specify the noncommutative algebra of invariant differential operators in terms of generators and their relations. Secondly, we describe the center of this algebra and prove that all of its symmetric elements are essentially self-adjoint. Thirdly, for the first time on homogeneous spaces, we identify several essentially self-adjoint invariant differential operators which do not lie in the center of the algebra of invariant differential operators.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a quantized ($K$-theoretic) BFN Coulomb branch with $G=\mathbb{C}^*$ and any $N$, that is, $\mathcal{A}$ is a generalized Weyl or $q$-Weyl algebra. Let $M$ be an $\mathcal{A}$-$\overline{\mathcal{A}}$ bimodule. Choosing an automorphism $\rho$ of $\mathcal{A}$ we can define the notion of an invariant Hermitian form: $(au,v)=(u,v\rho(a))$ for all $a\in \mathcal{A}$ and $u,v\in M$. We obtain a classification of invariant positive definite forms on $M$ in the case when $M$ is Harish-Chandra in the sense of Losev and quantization parameter is generic.</description>

      <title>Gentle algebras arising from surfaces with orbifold points, Part II: Locally free Caldero-Chapoton functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that in the skew-symmetrizable cluster algebras associated by Felikson-Shapiro-Tumarkin to unpunctured surfaces with orbifold points of order $2$ and a specific choice of weights, the Laurent expansion of any cluster variable with respect to any cluster coincides with the locally free Caldero-Chapoton function of a $\tau$-rigid representation of a gentle algebra. These cluster algebras are typically non-acyclic and of infinite type, whereas for polygons with one orbifold point one recovers cluster algebras of finite type $C$; so, our result is an ample extension of a seminal result established by Geiss-Leclerc-Schr\"oer for skew-symmetrizable cluster algebras of finite type and acyclic initial seeds. As the main means to achieve the result, we provide a generalization of Derksen-Weyman-Zelevinsky's mutation theory of loop-free quivers with potential to the quivers-with-loops with potential we associate to the triangulations of unpunctured surfaces with orbifold points, and study the relation with $\tau$-tilting theory.
  As a result of independent interest, we compute the aforementioned $\tau$-rigid representations explicitly. To this end, we show that the indecomposable $\tau$-rigid string modules arising from arcs on the surface, and the quasi-simple band modules arising from simple closed curves, are well-behaved under the mutations of representations we define in the paper, thus extending results of the first author's Ph.D. thesis.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic Hecke algebra and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reprove the surjectivity statement of Braverman-Kazhdan's spectral description of Lusztig's asymptotic Hecke algebra $J$ in the context of $p$-adic groups. The proof is based on Bezrukavnikov-Ostrik's description of $J$ in terms of equivariant $K$-theory. As a porism, we prove that the action of $J$ extends from the non-strictly positive unramified characters to the complement of a finite union of divisors, and that the trace pairing between the Ciubotaru-He rigid cocentre of an affine Hecke algebra with equal parameters and the rigid quotient of its Grothendieck group is perfect whenever the parameter $q$ is not a root of the Poincar\'{e} polynomial of the finite Weyl group.
  Without recourse to $K$-theory, we prove a weak version of Xi's description of $J$ in type $A$.
  As an application of relationship between $J$ and the rigid cocentre, we prove that the formal degree of a unipotent discrete series representation of a connected reductive $p$-adic group $G$ with a split inner form has denominator dividing the Poincar\'{e} polynomial of the Weyl group of $G$. Additionally, we give formulas for $t_w$ in terms of inverse and spherical Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for $w$ in the lowest cell.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral bounds on the joint spectrum and temperedness of locally symmetric spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a real semisimple connected Lie group $G$ and a discrete subgroup $\Gamma &lt; G$ we prove a precise connection between growth rates of the group $\Gamma$, polyhedral bounds on the joint spectrum of the ring of invariant differential operators, and the decay of matrix coefficients. In particular, this allows us to completely characterize temperedness of $L^2(\Gamma\backslash G)$ in terms of Quint's growth indicator function. As an application of our sharp polyhedral bounds we prove temperedness of $L^2(\Gamma\backslash G)$ for all Borel Anosov subgroups $\Gamma$ in higher rank Lie groups $G$ not locally isomorphic to $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb{K}),\mathbb{K}=\R,\C,\mathbb H,$ or $\mathfrak{e}_{6(-26)}$.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the bounded derived category of the lattice of order ideals of the product of two ordered chains is fractionally Calabi-Yau. We also show that these lattices are derived equivalent to higher Auslander algebras of type A. The proofs involve the study of intervals of the poset that have resolutions described with antichains having rigid properties. These two results combined corroborate a conjecture by Chapoton linking posets to Fukaya-Seidel Categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06346v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an algebraic torus defined over a local (or global) field $F$, a celebrated result of R.P. Langlands establishes a natural homomorphism from the group of continuous cohomology classes of the Weil group, valued in the dual torus, onto the space of complex characters of the rational points of the torus (or automorphic characters in the global case). We expand on this result by detailing its topological aspects. We show that if we topologize the relevant spaces of continuous homomorphisms and continuous cochains using the compact-open topology, Langlands's map becomes a (surjective, finite-to-one) homomorphism of abelian complex Lie groups. Moreover, we demonstrate that, in both the local and global settings, the subset of unramified characters is the identity component of the relevant space of characters. Finally, we compare the group of unramified characters with the Galois (co)invariants of the dual torus.</description>

Abstract: We prove a multiplication formula for cluster characters induced by generating extensions in a gentle algebra A, generalizing a result of Cerulli Irelli, Esposito, Franzen, Reineke. In the case where A is the gentle algebra of a triangulation T of an unpunctured marked surface, this provides a representation-theoretic interpretation of the exchange relations in the cluster algebra with principal coefficients in T. As an application, we interpret a formula that relates cluster variables of type B to cluster variables of type A in the symmetric module category of the algebras arising from special triangulations of a regular polygon.</description>

      <title>A geometric model for the non-$\tau$-rigid modules of type $\widetilde{D}_n$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a geometric model for the non-$\tau$-rigid modules over acyclic path algebras of type $\widetilde{D}_n$. Similar models have been provided for module categories over path algebras of types $A_n, D_n,$ and $\widetilde{A}_n$ as well as the $\tau$-rigid modules of type $\widetilde{D}_n$. A major draw of these geometric models is the "intersection-dimension formulas" they often come with. These formulas give an equality between the intersection number of the curves representing the modules in the geometric model and the dimension of the extension spaces between the two modules. This formula allows us to calculate the homological data between two modules combinatorially. Since there are infinitely many distinct homogeneous stable tubes in the regular component of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of type $\widetilde{D}_n$, all of which are disjoint, our geometric data requires an extra decoration on the admissible edges in our geometric model to prevent intersections between curves corresponding to modules in distinct stable tubes of the Auslander-Reiten quiver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1805.06467v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Six-dimensional superconformal field theories (6D SCFTs) occupy a central place in the study of quantum field theories encountered in high energy theory. This article reviews the top down construction and study of this rich class of quantum field theories, in particular, how they are realized by suitable backgrounds in string / M- / F-theory. We review the recent F-theoretic classification of 6D SCFTs, explain how to calculate physical quantities of interest such as the anomaly polynomial of 6D SCFTs, and also explain recent progress in understanding renormalization group flows for deformations of such theories. Additional topics covered by this review include some discussion on the (weighted and signed) counting of states in these theories via superconformal indices. We also include several previously unpublished results as well as a new variant on the swampland conjecture for general quantum field theories decoupled from gravity. The aim of the article is to provide a point of entry into this growing literature rather than an exhaustive overview.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study uniform bases for the ideal arrangements in all Lie types. Explicit uniform bases are given by Abe-Horiguchi-Masuda-Murai-Sato for types $A,B,C,G$ and we provide them for other types. Combining the explicit uniform bases with the work of Abe-Horiguchi-Masuda-Murai-Sato, we also obtain explicit presentations of the cohomology rings of regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties in all Lie types.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Mutation-Acyclicity of Quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in mathematical research in recent years. This paper applies ML techniques to the study of quivers -- a type of directed multigraph with significant relevance in algebra, combinatorics, computer science, and mathematical physics. Specifically, we focus on the challenging problem of determining the mutation-acyclicity of a quiver on 4 vertices, a property that is pivotal since mutation-acyclicity is often a necessary condition for theorems involving path algebras and cluster algebras. Although this classification is known for quivers with at most 3 vertices, little is known about quivers on more than 3 vertices. We give a computer-assisted proof of a theorem to prove that mutation-acyclicity is decidable for quivers on 4 vertices with edge weight at most 2. By leveraging neural networks (NNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), we then accurately classify more general 4-vertex quivers as mutation-acyclic or non-mutation-acyclic. Our results demonstrate that ML models can efficiently detect mutation-acyclicity, providing a promising computational approach to this combinatorial problem, from which the trained SVM equation provides a starting point to guide future theoretical development.</description>
