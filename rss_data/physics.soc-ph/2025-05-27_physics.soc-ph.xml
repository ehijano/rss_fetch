      <title>On the transmission of texts: written cultures as complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our knowledge of past cultures relies considerably on written material. For centuries, texts have been copied, altered, then transmitted or lost - eventually, from surviving documents, philologists attempt to reconstruct text phylogenies ("stemmata"), and past written cultures. Nonetheless, fundamental questions on the extent of losses, representativeness of surviving artefacts, and the dynamics of text genealogies have remained open since the earliest days of philology. To address these, we radically rethink the study of text transmission through a complexity science approach, integrating stochastic modelling, computer simulations, and data analysis, in a parsimonious mindset akin to statistical physics and evolutionary biology. Thus, we design models that are simple and general, while accounting for diachrony and other key aspects of the dynamical process underlying text phylogenies, such as the extinction of entire branches or trees. On the well-known case study of Medieval French chivalric literature, we find that up to 60% of texts and 99% of manuscripts were lost (consistent with recent synchronic "biodiversity" analyses). We also settle a hundred-year-old controversy on the bifidity of stemmata. Further, our null model suggests that pure chance ("drift") is not the only mechanism at play, and we provide a theoretical and empirical framework for future investigation.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of intra-urban climate fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban-induced changes in local microclimate, such as the urban heat island effect and air pollution, are known to vary with city size, leading to distinctive relations between average climate variables and city-scale quantities (e.g., total population or area). However, these approaches suffer from biases related to the choice of city boundaries and they neglect intra-urban variations of urban characteristics. Here we use high-resolution data of urban temperatures, air quality, population counts, and street intersections from 142 cities worldwide and show that their marginal and joint probability distributions follow universal scaling functions. By using a logarithmic relation between urban spatial features and climate variables, we show that average street network properties are sufficient to characterize the entire variability of the temperature and air pollution fields observed within and across cities. We further demonstrate that traditional models linking climate variables to the distance from the city center fail to reproduce the observed distributions unless the stochasticity of urban structure is fully considered. These findings provide a unified statistical framework for characterizing intra-urban climate variability, with important implications for climate modelling and urban planning.</description>

      <title>On the orientation of historic Christian churches of Fuerteventura: conciliating tradition, winds and topography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of an analysis of the precise spatial orientation of colonial Christian churches located in the Canary Island of Fuerteventura (Spain). Our sample consists of 48 churches, most built during the period between the Castilian conquest led by the Norman Jean de B\'ethencourt in the 15th century and the end of the 19th century. We examine whether the standard tradition was followed regarding the orientation of the apses of historic churches eastwards. While most of the religious constructions in the sample have their main axes oriented within the solar range, the statistical analysis also reveals the presence of two different groups of churches with different possible interpretations. For the first group, mainly composed of churches located in the central part of the island, an anomalous tendency to orientate them towards a declination of c. -14 degrees is detected. We provide some possible explanations for this, which include the date of a traditional Canarian celebration, an eventual imprint of topography, and the possibility of sunset orientations. Also, this particular value of declination is close to -16.3 degrees, the declination of Sirius during the 17th century. Therefore, we provide ethnographic data that might support an eventually controversial 'bright star' orientation. For the second group, meanwhile, we find a pattern of orientation where the apse of the churches points slightly to the north of due east. We propose this might signal constructions that were oriented to the rising Sun on dates close to Easter, one of the most important festivities of Christianity.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Politicizing science funding undermines public trust in science, academic freedom, and the unbiased generation of knowledge"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a commentary published in mid-2024 (to which the present work is a direct response), a number of scientists argue that U.S. funding agencies have "politicized" the process by which grants are awarded, in service of diversifying the scientific workforce. The commentary in question, however, makes numerous unfounded assertions while recycling citations to a fusillade of opinion essays written by the same cabal of authors, in an effort to resemble a work of serious scholarship. Basic fact-checking is provided here, demonstrating numerous claims that are unsupported by the source material and readily debunked. The present work also serves to document the reality of inclusion and diversity plans for scientific grant proposals to U.S. funding agencies, as they existed at the end of 2024. It is intended as a bulwark against retroactive false narratives, as the U.S. moves into a period of intense antagonism towards diversity, equity, and inclusion activities.</description>

      <title>On the class of coding optimality of human languages and the origins of Zipf's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we present a new class of optimality for coding systems. Members of that class are separated linearly from optimal coding and thus exhibit Zipf's law, namely a power-law distribution of frequency ranks. Whithin that class, Zipf's law, the size-rank law and the size-probability law form a group-like structure. We identify human languages that are members of the class. All languages showing sufficient agreement with Zipf's law are potential members of the class. In contrast, there are communication systems in other species that cannot be members of that class for exhibiting an exponential distribution instead but dolphins and humpback whales might. We provide a new insight into plots of frequency versus rank in double logarithmic scale. For any system, a straight line in that scale indicates that the lengths of optimal codes under non-singular coding and under uniquely decodable encoding are separated by a linear function whose slope is the exponent of Zipf's law. For systems under compression and constrained to be uniquely decodable, such a straight line may indicate that the system is coding close to optimality. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that Zipf's law originates from compression.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Fluctuation Relations in UNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last two decades, fluctuation theorems have been proved formally and demonstrated experimentally for several variables (such as entropy production, work, or flux) and different noises causing the fluctuations (of either thermal or other origin; Markovian or non-Markovian). Here we report the observation of a detailed fluctuation relation in a statistical process outside thermodynamics and physics: the card game UNO. As the fluctuating variable, we consider the number of steps $W$ needed for one player's deck to change from $x$ to $y$ number of cards. The other players and the remaining cards play the role of a finite non-Markovian bath. Numerical simulations of runs of the game show that $W$ obeys a fluctuation relation analogous to Crooks' theorem. While the observed behavior shares some common features with infinite random walks, it also exhibits deviations that are clear signatures of non-Markovianity and the finiteness of the bath: Notably, the parameter corresponding to temperature depends strongly on the transition $x\rightarrow y$. Our paper contributes to extending the scope of fluctuation theorems beyond their usual thermodynamic setting.</description>

      <title>Emergence of network communities driven by local rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks with nodes and links. Often the nodes are segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here, by means of numerical simulations, I show that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_\kappa$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. Using the stochastic block model for community detection with correction for degree sequence, I show that networks generated by local rules have finite $r_\kappa$ values while their randomized versions do not have emergent communities. I conjecture that network communities are an emergent property of networks evolving with local rules.</description>

      <title>Effects of uncoordinated electrification on energy burdens for natural gas customers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrification presents opportunities and challenges for household energy affordability. Without careful coordination, the costs of natural gas systems will be borne by a shrinking customer base, driving up bills for those left behind. This affordability issue is worsened by new pipeline investments, which risk locking communities into carbon-intensive infrastructure. Here, we introduce a framework to quantify the effects of uncoordinated electrification on natural gas customers, integrating household energy data with utility financial and planning documents. Applying our framework first to Massachusetts and then nationwide, we show that vulnerable communities face disproportionate affordability risks during heating electrification transitions. Households that do not electrify may bear a 46% increase in energy bills on average over the next 15 years (relative to current costs). Targeted electrification may help to alleviate energy burdens, but an effective heating transition will ultimately require coordinated, neighborhood-scale strategies that consider the high fixed costs of legacy infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Siege of Syracuse: Resources, strategy, and collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Siege of Syracuse (214 - 212 BC) was a decisive event in the Second Punic War, leading to the city's fall to Rome despite its formidable defenses, including the war machines devised by Archimedes. In this work, we propose a mathematical model to describe the dynamics of the siege, incorporating the depletion of resources, the decline of Syracuse's population, and the persistence of the Roman army. Our analysis reveals the existence of a critical threshold $\lambda_c$, which determines the outcome of the siege. This threshold marks a phase transition: if the effectiveness of Syracuse's defenses, represented by $\lambda$, had exceeded $\lambda_c$, the city could have withstood the Roman assault. However, since history records Syracuse's fall, we conclude that $\lambda &lt; \lambda_c$. This result provides a quantitative framework to understand the inevitability of the city's conquest and demonstrates how mathematical modeling can offer new insights into historical military conflicts. We also explore different scenarios and assess the impact of key factors such as siege duration, supply constraints, and defensive capabilities. The results provide insights into how strategic elements influenced the eventual fall of Syracuse and demonstrate the applicability of mathematical modeling in historical military analysis.</description>

      <title>Uncovering complementary information sharing in spider monkey collective foraging using higher-order spatial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collectives are often able to process information in a distributed fashion, surpassing each individual member's processing capacity. In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. We identify sets of individuals whose overlap shows a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Farm Size Matters: A Spatially Explicit Ecological-Economic Framework for Biodiversity and Pest Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intensification of European agriculture, characterized by increasing farm sizes, landscape simplification and reliance on synthetic pesticides, remains a key driver of biodiversity decline. While many studies have investigated this phenomenon, they often focus on isolated elements, resulting in a lack of holistic understanding and leaving policymakers and farmers with unclear priorities. This study addresses this gap by developing a spatially explicit ecological economic model designed to dissect the complex interplay between landscape structure and pesticide application, and their combined effects on natural enemy populations and farmers' economic returns. In particular, the model investigates how these relationships are modulated by farm size (a crucial aspect frequently overlooked in prior research). By calibrating on the European agricultural sector, we explore the ecological and economic consequences of various policy scenarios. We show that the effectiveness of ecological restoration strategies is strongly contingent upon farm size. Small to medium-sized farms can experience economic benefits from reduced pesticide use when coupled with hedgerow restoration, owing to enhanced natural pest control. In contrast, large farms encounter challenges in achieving comparable economic gains due to inherent landscape characteristics. This highlights the need to account for farm size in agri-environmental policies in order to promote biodiversity conservation and agricultural sustainability.</description>
