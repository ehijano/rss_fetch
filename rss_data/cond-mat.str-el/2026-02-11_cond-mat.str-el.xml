      <title>Predicting magnetism with first-principles AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational discovery of magnetic materials remains challenging because magnetism arises from the competition between kinetic energy and Coulomb interaction that is often beyond the reach of standard electronic-structure methods. Here we tackle this challenge by directly solving the many-electron Schr\"odinger equation with neural-network variational Monte Carlo, which provides a highly expressive variational wavefunction for strongly correlated systems. Applying this technique to transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e semicondutors, we predict itinerant ferromagnetism in WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ and an antiferromagnetic insulator in twisted $\Gamma$-valley homobilayer, using the same neural network without any physics input beyond the microscopic Hamiltonian. Crucially, both types of magnetic states are obtained from a single calculation within the $S_z=0$ sector, removing the need to compute and compare multiple $S_z$ sectors. This significantly reduces computational cost and paves the way for faster and more reliable magnetic material design.</description>

      <title>Real-space topology and charge order in the Haldane-Holstein Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the half-filled Haldane-Holstein model, where a paradigmatic Chern insulator is coupled to fully dynamical phonons, and provide an unbiased characterization of how retarded electron-phonon interactions destabilize Chern topology. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo, we find that increasing the coupling drives an abrupt, first-order transition from a Chern insulator to a staggered charge-density wave that acts as a dynamical sublattice (Semenoff) mass. The transition is simultaneously signaled by a nearly quantized many-body Bott index and a real-space local Chern marker constructed from the interacting Green's function, both of which collapse as the charge order parameter becomes extensive. Spectral and open-boundary calculations reveal concomitant gap closing and the loss of boundary spectral weight at the critical coupling. Despite the generic phase problem induced by broken time-reversal symmetry, we show that it remains mild in the low-frequency regime and that the average phase factor sharply tracks the CI-CDW boundary. Our results establish a concrete route by which electron-phonon coupling can trigger a discontinuous collapse of Chern topology and provide experimentally relevant signatures for correlated topological platforms.</description>

      <title>Interaction-driven spin polaron in itinerant flat-band ferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interaction effects are dramatically enhanced in flat-band systems due to quenched kinetics, facilitating the binding of single excitations into composite quasiparticles. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of spin polarons over the entire momentum and energy space within the Mielke-Tasaki model using projected exact diagonalization. We identify distinct low-energy spin polarons at momenta q=0 and q=\pi, and also find multiple high-energy branches of spin polaron. It is demonstrated that the interaction-induced Hartree dispersion plays a decisive role in determining the momentum sector of low-energy spin polarons. Furthermore, by introducing a finite bandwidth, we unravel the underlying binding mechanisms: the formation of low-energy spin polarons is governed by the conventional virtual exchange mechanism, whereas the high-energy spin polarons arise from a joint effect of the effective attraction and virtual exchange. Our results suggest promising avenues for realizing spin polaron crystals and exploring novel superconducting pairing mechanisms in moir\'e materials like twisted WSe2 and MoTe2.</description>

      <title>Raman Spectroscopic Investigation of Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids, a highly topologically entangled, dynamically correlated state where quantum fluctuations preclude any long-range ordering down to absolute zero. In the search for a topologically robust qubit, the scientific community has been in continuous hunt for real quantum spin liquid systems. Alexei Kitaev in his exactly solvable model for a spin-1/2 two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, presented a system that hosts a topologically protected state (Majorana zero-modes). Under an applied external field, the Kitaev spin liquids turn into a topologically non-trivial chiral spin-liquid state with non-abelian anionic excitations, which is crucial for quantum computing. Earlier theoretical predictions advocated that Kitaev physics can be realized in spin-orbit-coupled Mott insulators such as honeycomb irradiates and ruthenates. However, the experimental findings continuously challenge the theoretical aspects, indicating the presence of non-Kitaev interactions in real materials, where the dimensionality, disorder (vacancy), chemical composition, generalized spin-S, and external perturbations (pressure, magnetic field, temperature) can actively tune the Kitaev interactions and the ground state excitations. In this review article, a comprehensive discussion is included with an updated literature survey in the context of the potential of Raman spectroscopy as a probe for Kitaev quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Exceptional nodal rings emerging in spinful Rice-Mele chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weyl exceptional nodal lines usually occur in 3D topological semimetals, but also emerge in the parameter space of 1D systems. In this work, we study the impact of dissipation on the nodal ring in a 3D topological semimetal. We find that the energy spectrum becomes fully complex in the presence of dissipation, and the original nodal ring is split into two exceptional rings. We introduce a vortex field in the momentum space, which is generated from the spectrum, to characterize the topology of the exceptional rings. This provides a clear physical picture of the topological structure. The two exceptional rings act as two vortex filaments of a free vortex flow with opposite circulations. In this context, the 3D topological semimetal is the boundary separating two quantum phases identified by two configurations of exceptional rings. We also propose a 1D model that has the same topological feature in the parameter space. It provides a simple way to measure the topological invariant in a low-dimensional system. Numerical simulations indicate that the topological invariant is robust under the random perturbations of the system parameters.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of $\alpha$-UH$_3$ in U-Hf Hydrides: Structural, Magnetic, Thermodynamic, and Transport Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hf substitution stabilizes the metastable body-centered cubic (bcc) $\alpha$-UH$3$ phase in uranium hydrides, enabling systematic measurements of its magnetic, thermodynamic, and transport properties. (UH$3$)${1-x}$Hf$x$ hydrides ($x = 0.10, 0.15, 0.30, 0.40$) were obtained by hydrogenation of U${1-x}$Hf$x$ precursor alloys. Powder X-ray diffraction shows a progressive suppression of $\beta$-UH$3$ phase with increasing $x$, with $\alpha$-UH$3$ domination at $x = 0.30$ and $\beta$-UH$3$ nearly fully suppressed at $x = 0.40$. Magnetization measurements show ferromagnetic behavior for all compositions with Curie temperatures in the range $T\mathrm{C} \approx 178$--$185$ K and a maximum near $x = 0.15$; however, the spontaneous magnetization is strongly reduced with Hf content, decreasing from $1.0,\mu\mathrm{B}$/U in pure $\beta$-UH$3$ to $0.46,\mu\mathrm{B}$/U for (UH$3$)${0.60}$Hf${0.40}$. Specific-heat data show a broadened Curie anomaly in the $\alpha$-UH$3$ rich hydride samples, consistent with a distribution of $T\mathrm{C}$ values arising from ferromagnetic inhomogeneities. Specific heat also reveals a monotonic decrease in the Sommerfeld coefficient with increasing Hf concentration, reflecting a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, especially in (UH$3$)${0.60}$Hf${0.40}$. The resistivity of (UH$3$)${0.60}$Hf${0.40}$ is very large, exhibits a robust negative temperature coefficient over 2--300 K, and shows only weak magnetoresistance, placing transport in a strongly incoherent, disorder-dominated regime.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean quasicrystals and their topological invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological invariants govern many important physical properties in condensed matter systems. In this work, we obtain the complete set of topological invariants for a family of one-dimensional quasicrystals. The first and best-studied member of the family is the Fibonacci chain, while the successive ones are known in the literature as silver, bronze... and collectively as the metallic mean chains. By considering rational approximants, and by making use of the relationship between these chains and two dimensional Quantum Hall problems, we write down a gap labeling scheme for finite systems, and extend it to the quasiperiodic limit. We show, by numerical computations on open chains, that the proposed scheme correctly yields the winding numbers of edge states in each of the gaps, in all of the quasicrystals. In the strict 1D limit, we discuss properties of a simplified Hofstadter ``butterfly" diagram, with the analogues of Landau levels appearing in the asymptotic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating low-temperature properties of three-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets is challenging due to the sign problem and the system sizes required to mitigate substantial finite-size effects. However, there are many experimental examples of three-dimensional crystals that could host exotic low-temperature states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids. We calculate the ground-state phase diagrams of frustrated quantum spin models on the body-centered cubic lattice using neural quantum states. First, we study the antiferromagnetic $J_1-J_2$ model where we find a direct first-order phase transition between N\'eel and collinear long-range-ordered phases at $(J_2/J_1)_c = 0.705$, consistent with previous studies. Then, in a tetragonally-distorted variant, proposed as a minimal model of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, we find no evidence of a quantum paramagnetic ground state, with a first-order phase transition between N\'eel and chain phases at $(J_{2ab}/J_1)_c = 1.0375$. Therefore, the ground state of the tetragonally-distorted model does not reproduce the low-temperature magnetic properties of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, and the inclusion of other effects is necessary to rationalize experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Orbital piezomagnetic polarizability of pure insulating altermagnets in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distinctive symmetry properties of pure altermagnets make them natural candidates for piezomagnetism. Previous work motivated by the piezomagnetic properties of altermagnets has primarily focused on the spin magnetization response to applied strain. In this paper we study orbital piezomagnetic effects--the orbital magnetization response to applied strain--in minimal lattice models of pure insulating altermagnets in two dimensions. We obtain general microscopic expressions for the orbital magnetization in the presence of strain, as well as the orbital piezomagnetic polarizability, i.e., the defining response characteristic of pure altermagnets. We apply these expressions to three specific tetragonal lattice models, two corresponding to $d$-wave altermagnets and one describing a $g$-wave altermagnet. Whereas the $d$-wave altermagnets are associated with a linear piezomagnetic polarizability, the $g$-wave altermagnet exhibits a nonlinear piezomagnetic effect. Our analysis reveals how the polarizabilities are related to and determined by the Berry curvature of the occupied bands. Connections to materials of current interest are discussed.</description>

      <title>Canonical strong coupling spin wave expansion of Kondo lattice magnets. II. Itinerant ferromagnets and topological magnon bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we apply the canonical spin wave theory developed for itinerant Kondo lattice magnets in the strong coupling regime to Kondo ferromagnets, and address two general questions pertaining to their magnetic excitations. First, we compute corrections to the strong coupling (i.e., double-exchange) spin wave dispersion of itinerant ferromagnets. We show that the spin wave dispersion beyond the strong coupling limit can be mapped to the spin wave dispersion of a Heisenberg ferromagnet with farther neighbor exchange couplings, and discuss how this affects instabilities towards antiferromagnetism. Second, we examine the effect of including electronic spin-orbit coupling in the spin wave theory of Kondo ferromagnets. Including spin-orbit coupling is natural and straightforward in the formulation of the canonical spin wave expansion. Our key result is to demonstrate that the linear spin wave Hamiltonian of the itinerant Kondo ferromagnet can be mapped to the spin wave Hamiltonian of a Heisenberg ferromagnet with easy-axis Ising anisotropy and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interaction. We show that in the case of the Kane-Mele honeycomb lattice Kondo ferromagnet this leads to topological magnon bands, and discuss the implications of this result for itinerant ferromagnets more broadly.</description>

      <title>Simulating superconductivity in mixed-dimensional $t_\parallel$-${J}_\parallel$-${J}_\perp$ bilayers with neural quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) under pressure, we study a mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer $t_\parallel$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model, which has been proposed as an effective low-energy description of LNO. Using neural quantum states (NQS), and in particular Gutzwiller-projected Hidden Fermion Pfaffian State, we access the ground-state properties on large lattices up to $8\times 8\times 2$ sites. We show that this model exhibits superconductivity across a wide range of dopings and couplings, and analyze the pairing behavior in detail. We identify a crossover from tightly bound, Bose-Einstein-condensed interlayer pairs at strong interlayer exchange to more spatially extended Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like pairs as the interlayer exchange is decreased. Furthermore, upon tuning the intralayer exchange, we observe a sharp transition from interlayer $s$-wave pairing to intralayer $d$-wave pairing, consistent with a first-order change in the pairing symmetry. We verify that our simulations are accurate by comparing with matrix product state simulations on coupled ladders. Our results represent the first simulation of a fermionic multi-orbital system with NQS, and provide the first evidence for superconductivity in two-dimensonal bilayers using high-precision numerics. These findings provide insight into superconductivity in bilayer nickelates and cold atom quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Topologically Protected Surface Altermagnetism on Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10108v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM) and its associated spin-transport phenomena are typically linked to spin-split electronic band structures in bulk materials. However, the crystal surface has a reduced symmetry with respect to the bulk, which can induce AM at the surface of conventional antiferromagnets (AFMs) $\unicode{x2013}$ a local effect which cannot be detected using bulk properties. In this work we define the symmetry conditions necessary for surface AM and show how it can be topologically protected, rendering it a robust effect. We provide a minimal model for one trivial and two topological examples of surface AM. We show that the spin spectral density, accessible by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, can exhibit a $d$-wave-like altermagnetic character at the surface, even when the full band structure is completely spin degenerate. Our topological model describes the Dirac semimetal CuMnAs, which provides an existing realization of our theory. Our results identify crystal surfaces as a platform to realize robust, topology- and symmetry-driven unconventional magnetism beyond the bulk classification of magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Average Categorical Symmetries in One-Dimensional Disordered Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional disordered systems with average non-invertible symmetries, where quenched disorder may locally break part of the symmetry while preserving it upon disorder averaging. A canonical example is the random transverse-field Ising model, which at criticality exhibits an average Kramers-Wannier duality. We consider the general setting in which the full symmetry is described by a $G$-graded fusion category $\mathcal{B}$, whose identity component $\mathcal{A}$ remains exact, while the components with nontrivial $G$-grading are realized either exactly or only on average. We develop a topological holographic framework that encodes the symmetry data of the 1D system in a 2D topological order $\mathcal{Z}[\mathcal{A}]$ (the Drinfeld center of $\mathcal{A}$), enriched by an exact or, respectively, average $G$ symmetry. Within this framework, we obtain a complete classification of anomalies and average symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases: when the components with nontrivial $G$-grading are realized only on average, the symmetry is anomaly-free if and only if $\mathcal{Z}[\mathcal{A}]$ admits a magnetic Lagrangian algebra that is invariant under the permutation action of $G$ on anyons. When an anomaly is present, we show that the ground state of a single disorder realization is long-range entangled with probability one in the thermodynamic limit, and is expected to exhibit power-law Griffiths singularities in the low-energy spectrum. Finally, we present an explicit, exactly solvable lattice model based on a symmetry-enriched string-net construction. It yields trivial ground state ensemble in the anomaly-free case, and exhibits exotic low-energy behavior in the presence of an average anomaly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RG flows and IR phases of QFTs can be constrained by generalized symmetries and their anomalies. Broken symmetries act on the space of coupling constants of families of theories, and can also have IR-constraining family anomalies. We generalize family anomaly considerations to cases of broken generalized/categorical symmetries, including higher-group and non-invertible symmetries. We consider the anomaly inflow and SymTFTs of such generalized families of QFTs, and their implications for RG flows and constraints on the IR phases. As examples, we apply family anomalies to study the IR phases of $4d$ QCD-like theories deformed by irrelevant, multi-fermion interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Correlation Dynamics Subjected to Quantum Reset-Driven Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09348v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two central qubits interacting with a transverse-field Ising chain that serves as their environment. The environment is driven linearly in time across its quantum critical points (QCPs) and, during the evolution, is subjected to quantum reset (QR), where it is returned at random times to its initial state. We investigate how such QR of the environmental spin chain modifies the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord between the qubits. Our results show that in the strong-coupling regime, entanglement and discord exhibit pronounced revivals within the interval bounded by the Ising QCPs, but these revivals diminish as the QR rate increases. In contrast, weak coupling leads to a monotonic reduction of quantum correlations. Numerically, we find that the revival peaks of concurrence decay and scale exponentially with the QR rate, while quantum discord shows no clear scaling behavior. In the weak-coupling regime without QR, the correlations decay monotonically as the driven field crosses the second QCP. When QR is applied, however, both entanglement and discord undergo oscillatory suppression, with the oscillation period increasing as either the QR rate or the ramp time scale is reduced.</description>

      <title>Induction of p-wave and d-wave order parameters in s-wave superconductors with light pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a generalized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model to demonstrate the possibility of inducing p- and d-wave components in an originally pure s-wave centrosymmetric superconductor via microwave radiation. In this framework, specializing to $O_h$ point-group symmetry, we introduce gradient terms that couple the s-wave superconducting order parameter with other symmetry-allowed components. The singlet-to-singlet gradient terms are quadratic in spatial derivatives, while, in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, linear-in-derivatives terms coupling singlet and triplet order parameters are also permitted. Through the minimal substitution procedure, these terms enable coupling between different superconducting order parameters via the vector potential, thereby leading to the generation of p-wave, d-wave, and other symmetry-allowed components. Such a manipulation of the superconducting state locally via a microwave beam could be considered as one more facet of the concept of quantum printing.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced superconductivity beyond magnetic quantum criticality in a Kondo ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are an established setting for emergent phenomena driven by strong electronic correlations, including strange metals and unconventional superconductivity. These have been explored extensively in Kondo lattice materials tuned to an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point (QCP), but superconductivity emerging near ferromagnetic quantum criticality is not yet observed, and the conditions under which it occurs in proximity to ferromagnetism are undetermined. Here, we report a new setting for superconductivity in the ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice material Ce5CoGe2, where there is a ferromagnetic ground state at ambient pressure, which evolves to antiferromagnetism under applied pressures. The antiferromagnetic transition is suppressed to a zero-temperature QCP, which is accompanied by strange-metal behavior. Superconductivity does not occur at the QCP, but instead appears at pressures beyond the magnetic instability. These findings suggest that Ce5CoGe2 represents a distinct class of correlated materials exhibiting a unique scenario for the emergence of superconductivity, likely associated with unconventional pairing mechanisms beyond spin-fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Pressure dependent topological, superconducting, optoelectronic and thermophysical properties of Ta2Se chalcogenide: Theoretical insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tetragonal Ta2Se is a layered, Ta-rich chalcogenide that departs from conventional MX2 transition-metal dichalcogenides by hosting dense Ta-Ta networks capped by Se square-net layers. Here, we present a unified first-principles investigation of hydrostatic-pressure tuning in Ta2Se from 0 to 10 GPa, connecting the structural response, mechanical stability, thermophysical indicators, bonding evolution, electronic and optical behavior, lattice dynamics and superconductivity within a single framework. The derived thermophysical descriptors corroborate a pressure-stiffened lattice: density increases, Debye temperature rises, melting temperature is elevated and minimum thermal conductivity increases, whereas the Gr\"uneisen parameter remains within a narrow window, suggesting no anomalous anharmonic softening. Bond population metrics and electron-density-difference analysis revealed a mixed metallic-covalent bonding picture dominated by a robust Ta-Ta metallic backbone, accompanied by pressure-strengthened Ta-Se hybridization. Electronic-structure calculations show persistent metallicity under compression; pressure broadens bands, reduces density of states at the Fermi level, reshapes the Fermi surface and points to a possible Lifshitz-type reconstruction without symmetry breaking. The optical response remained metallic with Drude-like low-energy behavior and pressure-tunable spectral features. The phonon dispersions exhibit no imaginary modes, confirming dynamical stability. Electron-phonon coupling calculations classify Ta2Se as a weak-coupling, phonon-mediated superconductor with Tc around 3.9 K, consistent with available experiments and establish pressure as a practical control knob for stability and superconductivity-relevant descriptors in this metal-rich layered platform.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a special kind of nonreciprocal electromagnetic response which gives rise to backscattering suppression in the bulk, a long-sought feature in topological photonics, as well as nonreciprocal lensing - an effect when the same structure focuses light incident from one direction and defocuses light propagating in the opposite way. We predict this response in spin spirals and in specially designed metamaterials, validating the key predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide explicit constant-depth local unitary circuits that realize general anyon permutations in Kitaev's quantum double models. This construction can be naturally understood through a correspondence between anyon permutation symmetries of two-dimensional topological orders and self-dualities in one-dimensional systems, where local gates implement self-duality transformations on the boundaries of microscopic regions. From this holographic perspective, general anyon permutations in the $D(G)$ quantum double correspond to compositions of three classes of one-dimensional self-dualities, including gauging of certain subgroups of $G$, stacking with $G$ symmetry-protected topological phases, and outer automorphisms of the group $G$. We construct circuits realizing the first class by employing self-dual unitary gauging maps, and present transversal circuits for the latter two classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore topological phases of matter obtained by effectively gauging or fermionizing a system, where the Gauss law constraint is only enforced energetically. In contrast to conventional gauging or fermionization, the symmetry that is effectively gauged at low energies still generates a global symmetry that acts on the whole Hilbert space faithfully. This symmetry turns out to protect a nontrivial topological phase together with other symmetries, or it can carry a nontrivial emergent 't Hooft anomaly. We provide a precise formula for the topological response action involving these symmetries in a general setup, as well as a formula for 't Hooft anomalies. As an application, we apply the general treatment of the procedure to gapless systems and find various new gapless SPT phases, such as the one carrying the Gu-Wen fermionic anomalies at low energy.</description>

Abstract: We explore topological manipulations in one spatial dimension, which are defined for a system with a global symmetry and map the system to another one with a dual symmetry. In particular, we discuss fusion category symmetries enhanced by the invariance of the actions of topological manipulations, i.e., self-$G$-alities for topological manipulations. Based on the self-$G$-ality conditions, we provide LSM-type constraints on the ground states of many-body Hamiltonians. We clarify the relationship between different enhanced symmetries and introduce the notion of $\textit{codimension-two transitions}$. We explore concrete lattice models for such self-$G$-alities and find how the self-$G$-ality structures match the IR critical theories.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical model of magnons in double-layered antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability and magnonic properties of double-layered antiferromagnets are investigated using two model systems, a linear chain (LC) and a more complex chain of railroad trestle (RT) geometry, and the results are confronted with properties of the real material CrN. The spin-paired order ($\cdots{+}{+}{-}{-}\cdots$) in LC requires alternating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchanges, whereas in RT, an analogous order remains stable even when all interactions are AFM within certain analytical constraints. The rock-salt structure of CrN evokes clear magnetic frustration since Cr atoms in a face-centered cubic lattice form links to twelve nearest neighbors (NNs) all equivalent and AFM. Nonetheless, the magnetostructural transition to an orthorhombically distorted phase below $T_\text{N} = 287~\text{K}$ leads to four different NN Cr-Cr distances and consequently, to a large diversification of the exchange strength, which suppresses the frustration and allows for stable double-layered AFM order of CrN. This behavior originates from a competition at each NN link between Cr-Cr direct exchange and 90$^\circ$ Cr-N-Cr superexchange, both exhibiting specific power-law dependences on the interatomic distance. Finally, based on the $\textit{ab initio}$ calculated exchange parameters, the magnon spectrum and temperature evolution of ordered magnetic moments are derived.</description>

      <title>Error-resilient Reversal of Quantum Chaotic Dynamics Enabled by Scramblons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of the arrow of time in quantum many-body systems stems from the inherent tendency of Hamiltonian evolution to scramble quantum information and increase entanglement. While, in principle, one might counteract this temporal directionality by engineering a perfectly inverted Hamiltonian to reverse entanglement growth, such a scenario is fundamentally unstable because even minor imperfections in the backward evolution can be exponentially amplified, a hallmark of quantum many-body chaos. Therefore, successfully reversing quantum many-body dynamics demands a deep understanding of the underlying structure of quantum information scrambling and chaotic dynamics. In this letter, by using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance on a macroscopic ensemble of randomly interacting spins, we measure the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and validate key predictions of scramblon theory, a universal theoretical framework for information scrambling. Crucially, this theory enables us to isolate and mitigate errors in the OTOC caused by imperfections in the backward evolution. As a result, this protocol uncovers the anticipated exponential behavior of quantum many-body chaos and extracts the quantum Lyapunov exponent in a many-body experimental system for the first time. Our results push the fundamental limits of dynamical reversibility of complex quantum systems, with implications for quantum simulation and metrology.</description>

      <title>Mapping Phase Diagrams of Quantum Spin Systems through Semidefinite-Programming Relaxations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying quantum phase transitions poses a significant challenge in condensed matter physics, as this requires methods that both provide accurate results and scale well with system size. In this work, we demonstrate how relaxation methods can be used to generate the phase diagram for one- and two-dimensional quantum systems. To do so, we formulate a relaxed version of the ground-state problem as a semidefinite program, which we can solve efficiently. Then, by taking the resulting vector of moments for different model parameters, we identify all phase transitions based on their cosine similarity. Furthermore, we show how spontaneous symmetry breaking is naturally captured by bounding the corresponding observable. Using these methods, we reproduce the phase transitions for the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model and the two-dimensional frustrated bilayer Heisenberg model. We also illustrate how the phase diagram of the latter changes when a next-nearest-neighbor interaction is introduced. Overall, our work demonstrates how relaxation methods provide a novel framework for studying and understanding quantum phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: The study of quantum Hall effect (QHE) is a foundation of topological physics, inspiring extensive explorations of its high-dimensional generalizations. Notably, the four dimensional (4D) QHE has been experimentally realized in synthetic quantum systems, including cold atoms, photonic lattices, and metamaterials. However, the many-body effect in the 4D QHE system remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore this problem by formulating the microscopic wavefunctions inspired by Laughlin's seminal work. Employing a generalized pseudo-potential framework, we derive an exact microscopic Hamiltonian consisting of two-body projectors that annihilate the microscopic wavefunctions. Diagonalizations on a small size system show that the quasi-hole states remain zero energy while the quasi-particle states exhibit a finite gap, in consistency with an incompressible state. Furthermore, the pairing distribution is calculated to substantiate the liquid-like nature of the wavefunction. Our work provides a preliminary understanding to the fractional topological states in high dimension.</description>

Abstract: Chiral spin liquid (CSL) is a magnetic analogue of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquid. Collective excitations play a vital role in shaping our understanding of these exotic quantum phases of matter and their quantum phase transitions. While the magneto-roton and long-wavelength chiral graviton modes in the FQH liquids have been extensively explored, the collective excitations of CSLs remain elusive. Here we explore the collective excitations in the SU(2) symmetric CSL phase of the spin-1/2 square-lattice $J_1-J_2-J_\chi$ model, where an intriguing quantum phase diagram was recently revealed. Combining exact diagonalization and time-dependent variational principle calculations, we observe two spin-singlet collective modes: a chiral p-wave (low-energy) roton mode at finite momentum and a elliptically polarized d-wave (higher-energy) nematic mode at zero momentum, both of which are prominent across the CSL phase. Such exotic modes exhibit fingerprints distinct from those of FQH liquids, and to the best of our knowledge, are reported for the first time. By tuning $J_2$, we find the nematic mode to be pronouncedly soft, together with the spin-triplet two-spinon bound states, potentially promoting strong nematic and spin stripe instabilities. Our work paves the way for further understanding CSL from the dynamical perspective and provides new spectroscopic signatures for future experiments of CSL candidates.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlation beyond entanglement: Holographic discord and multipartite generalizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum theory and holography, quantum correlations arising from superposition, such as quantum discord, offer a broader perspective that has remained largely unexplored in holography. We construct gravity duals of quantum discord and classical correlation. In both holographic systems and Haar random states, discord exceeds entanglement, revealing an additional quantum correlation linked to the Markov gap and non-distillable entanglement, suggesting holographic states are intrinsically non-bipartite. In black hole setups, discord can increase despite decoherence and persists beyond the sudden death of distillable entanglement. Motivated by the holographic formula, we define reflected discord -- an optimization-free boundary quantity based on reflected entropy -- which remains effective even outside the holographic regime. We also propose several multipartite generalizations of correlation measures. It includes holography-inspired correlations based on multi-entropy, which are shown to be UV-finite and reduce to bipartite measures in the bipartite limit. These results provide new tools for quantifying quantum correlations beyond entanglement in strongly coupled many-body systems and offer a novel approach to multipartite correlation measures.</description>

Abstract: The ambient-pressure superconductivity in $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films via compressive epitaxial strain provides a highly accessible platform for diverse characterization techniques, facilitating the studies of high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we systematically map the phase diagram and reveal the superconducting dome with an electron-hole crossover in compressively strained $\mathrm{La}_{3-x}\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7-\delta}$ thin films by simultaneously tuning Sr doping and oxygen content. The maximum transition temperature (${T}_{c}$) coincides with an anomalous sign change in the Hall coefficient (${R}_{H}$), reminiscent of electron-doped cuprates, which may signal a Fermi surface reconstruction. Beyond the superconducting dome, a $\ln1/T$ insulating regime and a $T$-linear resistivity regime are also resolved, resembling behaviors observed in cuprates and infinite-layer nickelates. This work reveals a dome-shaped relationship between ${T}_{c}$ and ${R}_{H}$ and establishes a key framework for understanding unconventional superconductivity in nickelate systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-Field-Induced Geometric Response of Mean-Field Projectors: Streda Formula and Orbital Magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the magnetic-field response of interacting electron systems within mean-field theory using perturbation theory. We show that the linear response of the mean-field density-matrix to a weak magnetic field is purely geometric: it depends only on wavefunction derivatives, the Berry connections linking the occupied and unoccupied subspaces, and is independent of the interaction potential and the quasiparticle dispersion. This leads to compact, gauge-invariant projector expressions for both the St\v{r}eda formula and the formula for orbital magnetization. Our calculation explicitly elucidates the role of exchange and self-consistency in defining current vertices for orbital magnetization calculations. Our work establishes a direct connection between mean-field theory, quantum geometry and the non-interacting topological band theory.</description>

      <title>Local fermion density in inhomogeneous free-fermion chains: a discrete WKB approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel analytical approach for studying free-fermion (XX) chains with smoothly varying, site-dependent hoppings and magnetic fields. Building on a discrete WKB-like approximation applied directly to the recurrence relation for the single-particle eigenfunctions, we derive a closed-form expression for the local fermion density profile as a function of the Fermi energy, which is valid for arbitrary fillings, hopping amplitudes and magnetic fields. This formula reproduces the depletion and saturation effects observed in previous studies of inhomogeneous free-fermion chains, and provides a theoretical framework to understand entanglement entropy suppression in these models. We demonstrate the accuracy of our asymptotic formula in several chains with different hopping and magnetic field profiles. Our findings are thus the first step towards an analytical treatment of entanglement in free-fermion chains beyond the reach of conventional field-theoretic techniques.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of perfect fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum field theory of zero temperature perfect fluids. Such systems are defined by quantizing a classical field theory of scalar fields $\phi^I$ that act as Lagrange coordinates on an internal spatial manifold of fluid configurations. Invariance under volume preserving diffeomorphisms acting on these scalars implies that the long-wavelength spectrum contains vortex (transverse modes) with an exact $\omega_T=0$ dispersion relation. As a consequence, physically interpreting the results obtained via perturbative quantization of this theory has proven to be challenging. In this paper, we show that correlators evaluated in a class of semi-classical (Gaussian) initial states prepared at $t=0$ are well-defined and accessible via perturbation theory. The width of the initial state effectively acts as an infrared regulator without explicitly breaking diffeomorphism invariance of the classical action. As an application, we compute the stress tensor two-point correlators and show that vortex modes give a non-trivial contribution to the response function, non-local in both space and time.</description>
