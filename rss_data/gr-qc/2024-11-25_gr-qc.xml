      <title>Penrose and super-Penrose energy extraction from a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole spacetime with a cosmological constant through the BSW mechanism: Full story</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Penrose process, a process that transfers energy from a black hole to infinity, together with the BSW mechanism, which uses collisions of ingoing particles at the event horizon of a black hole to locally produce large amounts of energy, is studied in a combined description for a $d$ dimensional extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole spacetime with negative, zero, or positive cosmological constant, i.e., for an asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS), flat, or de Sitter (dS) spacetime. In an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole background, in the vicinity of the horizon, several types of radial collisions between electrically charged particles can be considered. The most interesting one is between a critical particle, with its electric charge adjusted in a specific way, and a usual particle, as it gives a divergent center of mass frame energy locally, this being a favorable but not sufficient condition to extract energy from the black hole. To understand whether energy can be extracted in such a collisional Penrose process, we investigate in detail a collision between ingoing particles 1 and 2, from which particles 3 and 4 emerge, with the possibility that particle 3 can carry energy far out from the black hole horizon. One finds that the mass, energy, electric charge, and initial direction of motion of particle 3 can have different values, depending on the collision internal process, but these values lie within some range. Moreover, the energy of particle 3 can be arbitrarily high but not infinite, characterizing a super-Penrose process. It is also shown that particle 4 has negative energy, living in its own electric ergosphere before being engulfed by the event horizon. For zero cosmological constant the results do not depend on the number of dimensions, but they do for nonzero cosmological constant, which also introduces differences in the lower bound for the energy extracted.</description>

      <title>Advanced LIGO detector performance in the fourth observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On May 24th, 2023, the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), joined by the Advanced Virgo and KAGRA detectors, began the fourth observing run for a two-year-long dedicated search for gravitational waves. The LIGO Hanford and Livingston detectors have achieved an unprecedented sensitivity to gravitational waves, with an angle-averaged median range to binary neutron star mergers of 152 Mpc and 160 Mpc, and duty cycles of 65.0% and 71.2%, respectively, with a coincident duty cycle of 52.6%. The maximum range achieved by the LIGO Hanford detector is 165 Mpc and the LIGO Livingston detector 177 Mpc, both achieved during the second part of the fourth observing run. For the fourth run, the quantum-limited sensitivity of the detectors was increased significantly due to the higher intracavity power from laser system upgrades and replacement of core optics, and from the addition of a 300 m filter cavity to provide the squeezed light with a frequency-dependent squeezing angle, part of the A+ upgrade program. Altogether, the A+ upgrades led to reduced detector-wide losses for the squeezed vacuum states of light which, alongside the filter cavity, enabled broadband quantum noise reduction of up to 5.2 dB at the Hanford observatory and 6.1 dB at the Livingston observatory. Improvements to sensors and actuators as well as significant controls commissioning increased low frequency sensitivity. This paper details these instrumental upgrades, analyzes the noise sources that limit detector sensitivity, and describes the commissioning challenges of the fourth observing run.</description>

      <title>Rapid eccentric spin-aligned binary black hole waveform generation based on deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate waveform templates of binary black holes (BBHs) with eccentric orbits are essential for the detection and precise parameter estimation of gravitational waves (GWs). While SEOBNRE produces accurate time-domain waveforms for eccentric BBH systems, its generation speed remains a critical bottleneck in analyzing such systems. Accelerating template generation is crucial to data analysis improvement and valuable information extraction from observational data. We present SEOBNRE_AIq5e2, an innovative AI-based surrogate model that crafted to accelerate waveform generation for eccentric, spin-aligned BBH systems. SEOBNRE_AIq5e2 incorporates an advanced adaptive resampling technique during training, enabling the generation of eccentric BBH waveforms with mass ratios up to 5, eccentricities below 0.2, and spins $|\chi_z|$ up to 0.6. It achieves an impressive generation speed of 4.3 ms per waveform with a mean mismatch of $1.02 \times 10^{-3}$. With the exceptional accuracy and rapid performance, SEOBNRE_AIq5e2 emerges as a promising waveform template for future analysis of eccentric gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Matter-antimatter (a)symmetry in de Sitter Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the matter-antimatter properties of elementary systems, modeled as free quantum fields, within the global structure of de Sitter spacetime. By leveraging the distinctive causal and analytic properties of de Sitter spacetime, we propose that matter-antimatter asymmetry could emerge as an observer-dependent effect shaped by time orientation within a local causal patch, rather than as a fundamental property of de Sitter Universe itself. This kinematic perspective complements, rather than replaces, standard dynamical processes (such as baryon number violation, $\texttt{CP}$ violation, and nonequilibrium processes) that fulfill Sakharov's criteria. Within this framework, the limited presence of antimatter in our predominantly matter-filled Universe, specifically within the causal patch of de Sitter spacetime under consideration, may arise from these mechanisms, though through pathways distinct from conventional interpretations.</description>

      <title>Inner horizon instability via the trace anomaly effective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum field theory applied to black hole spacetimes, substantial evidence suggests that the Unruh and Hartle-Hawking vacuum states become singular at Cauchy horizons. This raises essential questions regarding the impact of quantum field backreaction on the stability of Cauchy horizons in static scenarios and inner horizons in evolving spacetimes. To approach this problem, we employ analytic approximations to the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) of quantum fields in four dimensions. Specifically, we utilize the anomaly-induced effective action, which generates four-dimensional approximate RSETs through a pair of auxiliary scalar fields that satisfy higher-order equations of motion. The boundary conditions imposed on these auxiliary fields yield RSETs with leading-order terms that mimic the behaviour of different vacuum states. This study presents the first application of the anomaly-induced effective action method to Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole interiors, evaluating its accuracy, applicability, and connections with prior RSET approximations. Among the range of possible states accessible through this method, we found none that remain regular at both the event and Cauchy horizons, aligning with theoretical expectations. The method shows strong agreement with exact four-dimensional RSET results for the Hartle-Hawking state but does not fully capture the unique characteristics of the Unruh state in Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetimes. We conclude by suggesting possible extensions to address these limitations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational self-force with hyperboloidal slicing and spectral methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for calculating the gravitational self-force (GSF) in the Lorenz gauge, employing hyperboloidal slicing and spectral methods. Our method builds on the previous work that applied hyperboloidal surfaces and spectral approaches to scalar-field toy model [Phys. Rev. D 105, 104033 (2022)], extending them to handle gravitational perturbations. Focusing on first-order metric perturbations, we address the construction of the hyperboloidal foliation, detailing the minimal gauge choice. The Lorenz gauge is adopted to facilitate well-understood regularisation procedures, which are essential for obtaining physically meaningful GSF results. We calculate of the Lorenz gauge metric perturbation via a (known) gauge transformation from the Regge-Wheeler gauge. Our approach yields a robust framework for obtaining the metric perturbation components needed to calculate key physical quantities, such as radiative fluxes, the Detweiler redshift, and self-force corrections. Furthermore, the compactified hyperboloidal approach allows us to efficiently calculate the metric perturbation throughout the entire spacetime. This work thus establishes a foundational methodology for future second-order GSF calculations within this gauge, offering computational efficiencies through spectral methods.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Circular Geodesics in Dyonic Dilatonic Black Hole Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates a non-extreme dyonic-like dilatonic charged black hole solution within a four-dimensional gravity model. This model incorporates two scalar (dilaton) fields and two Abelian vector fields, with interactions between the scalar and vector fields mediated by exponential terms involving two dilatonic coupling vectors. The solution is characterized by a dimensionless parameter $a$ (where $0 &lt; a &lt; 2$), which is specifically defined as a function of the dilatonic coupling vectors. The paper further explores solutions for timelike and null circular geodesics, which are crucial for understanding various astrophysical scenarios, including the quasinormal modes of different test fields in the eikonal approximation. For all values of $a$ the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) are found by means of reducing the problem to the solution of fourth order polynomial equation.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Measurements with the Photon Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the universal symmetries of the black hole photon ring in a wide range of non-Kerr spacetimes, including the Kerr-Newman, Kerr-Sen, Kerr-Bardeen, and Kerr-Hayward metrics. The demagnification exponent ($\gamma$) controls the size and flux scaling of higher-order images, which appear in the photon ring, the delay time ($\tau$) determines the timing of their appearance, and the rotation parameter ($\delta$) relates their relative orientations on the image plane. Our investigation reveals distinct responses of these critical parameters to black hole spin, generalized charge, and observer inclination: $\gamma$ is predominantly influenced by charge and spin, $\tau$ is strongly affected by inclination, especially for near-extremal black holes, and $\delta$ is highly sensitive to spin. Notably, we find that the time delay provides an independent constraint on shadow size for polar observers, while the rotation parameter facilitates metric-independent spin measurements. Specifically, for Kerr black holes, the total variation in $\gamma$, $\tau$, and $\delta$ across all possible inclinations is $\lesssim 10\%$, $\lesssim 20\%$, and $\lesssim 60\%$, respectively. In contrast, the Kerr shadow size varies by only $\lesssim 8\%$.</description>

      <title>Matrix moment approach to positivity bounds and UV reconstruction from IR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positivity bounds in effective field theories (EFTs) can be extracted through the moment problem approach, utilizing well-established results from the mathematical literature. We generalize this formalism using the matrix moment approach to derive positivity bounds for theories with multiple field components. The sufficient conditions for obtaining optimal bounds are identified and applied to several example field theories, yielding results that match precisely the numerical bounds computed using other methods. The upper unitarity bounds can also be easily harnessed in the matrix case. Furthermore, the moment problem formulation also provides a means to reverse engineer the UV spectrum from the EFT coefficients, often uniquely, as explicitly demonstrated in examples such as string amplitudes and the $stu$ kink theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze how non-relativistic effective models for the magnetic coupling of a spin to the electromagnetic field (proportional to $\hat{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}\cdot \boldsymbol{B}$) emerge from a full quantum field theoretical description of charged fermionic fields with the quantum electromagnetic field. This allows us to keep track of relativistic corrections to the models commonly used in experimental spin physics. We discuss how this interaction compares to the usual simplified models used in relativistic quantum information.</description>

      <title>De Sitter space constraints on brane tensions and couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue for the existence of bounds on the tensions of $p$-branes in de Sitter space in terms of the Hubble rate and the strength of a class of Chern-Simons-like couplings. The world-volume couplings involve Abelian 1-form gauge fields in the bulk and possibly field strengths intrinsic to the brane. In many cases these couplings are the D-brane Chern-Simons terms present in string theory, while in other cases they are the interactions of axion domain walls with $U(1)$ fields. Our arguments use the same logic and assumptions as the recent Festina Lente proposal (thus utilizing the properties of Nariai de Sitter black holes) and generalize it to extended objects, thereby providing a bottom-up set of constraints independent of any particular UV completion. We compare these bounds to the properties of (wrapped) D-branes in Type II string theory in the weak coupling limit, under the assumption that these properties are not modified significantly in de Sitter constructions. We find that all constraints are satisfied by D-branes, providing further evidence for the Festina Lente conjecture. For the particular case of 2-branes with Chern-Simons interactions we obtain a bound, which however can be evaded if the theory contains a light axion. Similarly, we find the bounds do not apply to axion domain walls due to the presence of the axion.</description>

      <title>Holographic black hole cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe and study a holographic construction of big-bang / big-crunch cosmological spacetimes where the matter consists of a lattice of black holes. The cosmological spacetime is dual to an entangled state of a collection of holographic CFTs associated with the second asymptotic regions of the black holes. For a cosmology with spatial slice geometry $\Sigma$, this state is constructed via a Euclidean path integral for the CFT on a geometry obtained by connecting two copies of $\Sigma$ by a lattice of tubes. In three-dimensional gravity, we describe the cosmological solutions and the associated Euclidean saddles explicitly. For the case of (globally) flat cosmology, we determine when the Euclidean solution associated with the cosmology provides the dominant saddle compared to other natural candidates that preserve the symmetries of the boundary space. We find that the cosmological saddle dominates when the black holes are sufficiently large and close together. Our cosmology has a mixed state version where the physics behind the black hole horizons is unspecified and the Euclidean construction involves a pair of CFTs with an ensemble of operator insertions correlated between the two CFTs. Various purifications (adding second asymptotic regions for the black holes) correspond to various ways to promote this ensemble to an interaction by adding auxiliary degrees of freedom that couple the two CFTs in the Euclidean picture. These auxiliary degrees of freedom provide a Hilbert space for the cosmology in the Lorentzian picture.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy in the cosmic acceleration inferred from supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under the assumption that they are standard(isable) candles, the lightcurves of Type Ia supernovae have been analyzed in the framework of the standard Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmology to conclude that the expansion rate of the Universe is accelerating due to dark energy. While the original claims in the late 1990s were made using overlapping samples of less than 100 supernovae in total, catalogues of nearly 2000 supernovae are now available. In light of recent developments such as the cosmic dipole anomaly and the larger than expected bulk flow in the local Universe (which does not converge to the Cosmic Rest Frame), we analyze the newer datasets using a Maximum Likelihood Estimator and find that the acceleration of the expansion rate of the Universe is unequivocally anisotropic. The associated debate in the literature highlights the artifices of using supernovae as standardisable candles, while also providing deeper insights into a consistent relativistic view of peculiar motions as departures from the Hubble expansion of the Universe. The effects of our being `tilted observers' embedded in a deep bulk flow may have been mistaken for cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>String Theory in a Pinch: Resolving the Gregory-Laflamme Singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin enough black strings are unstable to growing ripples along their length, eventually pinching and forming a naked singularity on the horizon. We investigate how string theory can resolve this singularity. First, we study the string-scale version of the static non-uniform black strings that branch off at the instability threshold: "string-ball strings", which are linearly extended, self-gravitating configurations of string balls obtained in the Horowitz-Polchinski (HP) approach to near-Hagedorn string states. We construct non-uniform HP strings in spatial dimensions $d\leq 6$ and show that, as the inhomogeneity increases, they approach localized HP balls. By examining the thermodynamic properties of the different phases in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles, we find that, for a given mass, the uniform HP string will not evolve into a non-uniform or localized configuration. Building on these results and independent evidence from the evolution of the black string instability with $\alpha'$ corrections, we propose that string theory slows and eventually halts the pinching evolution at a classically stable stringy neck, with details depending on the dimension $d$. The system then enters a slower phase in which the neck gradually evaporates into radiation. We discuss this scenario as a framework for understanding how string theory resolves the formation of naked singularities.</description>

      <title>Outer Solar System spacecraft without drag-free control to probe the $\mu$Hz gravitational wave frontier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microhertz frequency band of gravitational waves probes the merger of supermassive black holes as well as many other gravitational wave phenomena. However, space-interferometry methods that use test masses would require substantial development of test-mass isolation systems to detect anticipated astrophysical events. We propose an approach that avoids inertial test masses by situating spacecraft in the low-acceleration environment of the outer Solar System. We show that for Earth-spacecraft and inter-spacecraft distances of $\gtrsim 10$ AU, the accelerations on the spacecraft would be sufficiently small to potentially achieve sensitivities determined by stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We further argue, for arm lengths of $10-30$ AU and $10$ Watt transmissions, that stable phase locks should be achievable with 20 cm mirrors or 5 m radio dishes. We discuss designs that send both laser beams and radio waves between the spacecraft, finding that despite the $\sim10^4\times$ longer wavelengths, even a design with radio transmissions could reach stochastic background-limited sensitivities at $\lesssim 0.3\times 10^{-4}$ Hz. Operating in the radio significantly reduces many spacecraft design tolerances. Our baseline concept requires two arms to do interferometry. However, if one spacecraft carries a clock with Allan deviations at $10^4$ seconds of $10^{-17}$, a comparable sensitivity could be achieved with a single arm. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of achieving similar gravitational wave sensitivities in a `Doppler tracking' configuration where the single arm is anchored to Earth.</description>

      <title>On the effective spin-mass ratio '$\chi_{\rm eff}-q$' relation of binary black hole mergers that evolved in isolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ground-based measurement of gravitational waves (GW) from merging binary black holes (BBH) uniquely allows determination of spins of stellar-remnant black holes (BH), thereby offering insights into their formation mechanisms. The observed population of BBH mergers exhibits two intriguing peculiarities related to BH spins, namely, a positively biased distribution of effective spin parameter, $\chi_{\rm eff}$, and an apparent anti-correlation between merger mass ratio, $q$, and $\chi_{\rm eff}$. Here we investigate the potential mechanisms for such observed properties, in BBH mergers via isolated binary evolution. We synthesize BBH mergers with the fast binary evolution code BSE. The role of various physical assumptions is explored, including tidal spin-up, compact remnant mass, and mass transfer physics. We compare the properties of WR-BH binaries that formed through stable mass transfer (SMT) and common envelope evolution (CE). We find that both the asymmetry in $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution and the $\chi_{\rm eff}-q$ anti-correlation are natural outcomes of isolated-binary BBH formation with the standard assumptions on mass transfer physics. The anti-correlation is particularly pronounced for SMT-channel BBH mergers that experience a mass-ratio-reversal, i.e., those where the second-born BH is the more massive member. The anti-correlation arises from the dependence of orbital shrinking during mass transfer and the Roche lobe size on the system's mass ratio. This characteristic $\chi_{\rm eff}-q$ trend diminishes with increasing metallicity and when the isolated-binary BBH merger population is mixed with a significant contribution of dynamically formed BBH mergers. Our results demonstrate that isolated massive binary evolution via the SMT sub-channel can reproduce the observable BBH merger population, with characteristic signatures in mass, mass ratio, and spin distributions.[abr.]</description>

      <title>Inferring Interference: Identifying a Perturbing Tertiary with Eccentric Gravitational Wave Burst Timing</title>

Abstract: [Abridged] Binary black holes may form and merge dynamically. These binaries are likely to become bound with high eccentricities, resulting in a burst of gravitational radiation at their point of closest approach. When such a binary is perturbed by a third body, the evolution of the orbit is affected, and gravitational-wave burst times are altered. The bursts times therefore encode information about the tertiary. In order to extract this information, we require a prescription for the relationship between the tertiary properties and the gravitational-wave burst times. In this paper, we demonstrate a toy model for the burst times of a secular three-body system. We show how Bayesian inference can be employed to deduce the tertiary properties when the bursts are detected by next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. We study the bursts from an eccentric binary with a total mass of $60$~M$_\odot$ orbiting an $6 \times 10^{8}$~M$_\odot$ supermassive black hole. When we assume no knowledge of the eccentric binary, we are unable to tightly constrain the existence or properties of the tertiary, and we recover biased posterior probability distributions for the parameters of the eccentric binary. However, when the properties of the binary are already well-known -- as is likely if the late inspiral and merger are also detected -- we are able to more accurately infer the mass of the perturber, $m_3$, and its distance from the binary, $R$. When we assume measurement precision on the binary parameters consistent with expectations for next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, we can be greater than $90\%$ confident that the binary is perturbed.

      <title>An Approximate Kerr-Newman-like Metric Endowed with a Magnetic Dipole and Mass Quadrupole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00270v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate all-terrain spacetimes for astrophysical applications are presented. The metrics possess five relativistic multipole moments, namely mass, rotation, mass quadrupole, charge, and magnetic dipole moment. All these spacetimes approximately satisfy the Einstein-Maxwell field equations. The first metric is generated by means of the Hoenselaers-Perj\'es method from given relativistic multipoles. The second metric is a perturbation of the Kerr-Newman metric, which makes it a relevant approximation for astrophysical calculations. The last metric is an extension of the Hartle-Thorne metric that is important for obtaining internal models of compact objects perturbatively. The electromagnetic field is calculated using Cartan forms for locally nonrotating observers. These spacetimes are relevant to infer properties of compact objects from astrophysical observations. Furthermore, the numerical implementations of these metrics are straightforward, making them versatile for simulating the potential astrophysical applications.</description>

Abstract: Time functions with asymptotically hyperbolic geometry play an increasingly important role in many areas of relativity, from computing black-hole perturbations to analyzing wave equations. Despite their significance, many of their properties remain underexplored. In this expository article, I discuss hyperbolic time functions by considering the hyperbola as the relativistic analog of a circle in two-dimensional Minkowski space and argue that suitably defined hyperboloidal coordinates are as natural in Lorentzian manifolds as spherical coordinates are in Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>The Hadamard condition on a Cauchy surface and the renormalized stress-energy tensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a Cauchy surface in a curved spacetime and a suitably defined quantum state on the CCR algebra of the Klein-Gordon quantum field on that surface, we show, by expanding the squared spacetime geodesic distance and the `$U$' and `$V$' Hadamard coefficients (and suitable derivatives thereof) in sufficiently accurate covariant Taylor expansions on the surface that the renormalized expectation value of the quantum stress-energy tensor on the surface is determined by the geometry of the surface and the first 4 time derivatives of the metric off the surface, in addition to the Cauchy data for the field's two-point function. This result has been anticipated in and is motivated by a previous investigation by the authors on the initial value problem in semiclassical gravity, for which the geometric initial data corresponds {\it a priori} to the metric on the surface and up to 3 time derivatives off the surface, but where it was argued that the fourth derivative can be obtained with aid of the field equations on the initial surface.</description>

Abstract: The future space-borne gravitational wave detector, Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), has the potential of detecting the fundamental fields, such as the charge and mass of ultra-light scalar field. In this paper we study the effect of lighter vector field on the gravitational waveforms from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRI) system, consisting of a stellar-mass object and the massive black hole (MBH) in the Einstein-Proca theory of a massive vector field coupling to gravity. Using the perturbation theory, we compute the energy fluxes including the contributions of the Proca field and the gravitational field, then obtain the adiabatic inspiraling orbits and corresponding waveforms. Our results demonstrate that the vector charge and mass carried by the secondary body lead to detectable effects on EMRI waveform, and LISA has the potential to measure the mass of the Proca field with greater precision.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we extend a construction of [6] to obtain a large class of vacuum cosmological spacetimes that do not contain any CMC Cauchy surfaces. The allowed spatial topologies for these examples are of the form $M \# M$, where $M$ is any closed, oriented, irreducible $3$-manifold which is not spherical. This complements the recent results of [19], where, instead of initial data methods, global spacetime gluing arguments were used. The study of such examples is sure to yield insight into Bartnik's cosmological splitting conjecture [1].</description>

Abstract: A study of the dynamical and thermodynamical stability of a charged thin-shell wormhole built by gluing two Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m geometries is presented. The charge on the shell is linearly related to the matter content. For the dynamical stability, a concise inequality is obtained, valid for any barotropic equation of state that relates the pressure with the energy density at the throat. A thermodynamical description of the system is introduced, which leads to the temperature and the electric potentials. Adopting a linear equation of state for the pressure and a definite form for the entropy function, the set of equilibrium configurations that are both dynamically and thermodynamically stable is found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04172v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research delves into the potential existence of traversable wormholes (WHs) within the framework of modified, curvature based gravity. The modification includes linear perturbations of the matter Lagrangian and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor with specific coupling strengths $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and can thus be viewed as a special case of linear $f(R,T)$-gravity with a variable matter coupling or as the simplest additively separable $f(R,\mathcal{L}_m,T)$-model. A thorough examination of static WH solutions is undertaken using a constant redshift function; therefore, our work can be regarded as the first-order approximation of WH theories in $f(R,\mathcal{L}_m,T)$ . The analysis involves deriving WH shape functions based on non-commutative geometry, with a particular focus on Gaussian and Lorentzian matter distributions $\rho$. Constraints on the coupling parameters are developed so that the shape function satisfies both the flaring-out and asymptotic flatness conditions. Moreover, for positive coupling parameters, violating the null energy condition (NEC) at the WH throat $r_0$ demands the presence of exotic matter. For negative couplings, however, we find that exotic matter can be avoided by establishing the upper bound $\beta+\alpha/2&lt;-\frac{1}{\rho r_0^2}-8\pi$. Additionally, the effects of gravitational lensing are explored, revealing the repulsive force of our modified gravity for large negative couplings. Lastly, the stability of the derived WH solutions is verified using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) formalism.</description>

Abstract: We revise the cosmological interaction between dark energy and dark matter. More precisely, we focus on models that support compartmentalization or co-existence in the dark sector of the universe. Within the framework of a homogeneous and isotropic, spatially flat Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker geometry, we analyse the asymptotic behaviour of the physical parameters for two interacting models, where dark energy and dark matter have constant equations of state parameters, in the presence of dark radiation, when dark energy is described by a quintessence scalar field. For each model, we determine the asymptotic solutions and attempt to understand how the interaction affects the cosmological evolution and history.</description>

      <title>Shadow and accretion disk images of Kerr-Newman black hole in modified gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the shadow and images of the accretion disk of Kerr-Newman (KN) black hole (BH) in modified gravity (MOG) theory by using backward ray-tracing method. And, the influence of spin parameter ($a$), charge ($Q$), and MOG parameter ($\alpha$) on the observed features of BHs are carefully addressed. Interestingly, as $\alpha$ increases, the flat edge of the BH's shadow gradually becomes more rounded, the size of shadow enlarges, and the deviation rate ($\delta s$) correspondingly decreases. By tracing the photon around BH, we observe that the trajectory of photon exhibits distortion behavior, i.e., the formation of two "tails" near the Einstein ring, which elongate as $a$ increases. For the accretion disk, it shows that the inner shadow expands with $\alpha$, while decreases with $Q$. The increase of $\alpha$ exhibits an increasing effect on redshift. At the same parameter level, $\alpha$ has a more obvious effect on inner shadow and image of BH by comparing with that of $Q$. Our study implies that both $\alpha$ and $Q$ have relatively significant effects on the image of the KN-MOG BH with the thin disk accretion, but the influence of $\alpha$ is much greater. So, this indicates that $\alpha$ plays a dominant role in this spacetime.</description>

      <title>Transient dynamics of quasinormal mode sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes of spacetimes with event horizons are typically governed by a non-normal operator. This gives rise to spectral instabilities, a topic of recent interest in the black hole pseudospectrum programme. In this work we show that non-normality leads to the existence of arbitrarily long-lived sums of short-lived quasinormal modes, corresponding to localising packets of energy near the future horizon. There exist sums of $M$ quasinormal modes whose lifetimes scale as $\log{M}$. This transient behaviour results from large cancellations between non-orthogonal quasinormal modes. We provide simple closed-form examples for a massive scalar field in the static patch of dS$_{d+1}$ and the BTZ black hole. We also provide numerical examples for scalar perturbations of Schwarzschild-AdS$_{d+1}$, and gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild in asymptotically flat spacetime, using hyperboloidal foliations. The existence of these perturbations is linked to certain properties of black hole pseudospectra. We comment on implications for thermalisation times in holographic plasmas.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Observing High-redshift Radio-loud Quasars in the SKA Era: Paving the Way for 21-cm Forest Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 21-cm forest is a sensitive probe for the early heating process and small-scale structures during the epoch of reionization (EoR), to be realized with the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Its detection relies on the availability of radio-bright background sources, among which the radio-loud quasars are very promising, but their abundance during the EoR is still poorly constrained due to limited observations. Here, we use a physics-driven model to forecast future radio-loud quasar observations. We fit the parameters of the model using observational data of high-redshift quasars. Assuming Eddington accretion, the model yields an average lifetime of $t_{\rm q} \sim 10^{5.3}$yr for quasars at $z\sim6$, consistent with recent results obtained from quasar proximity zone pre-study. We show that if the radio-loud fraction of quasars evolves with redshift, it will significantly reduce the abundance of observable radio-loud quasars in the SKA era, making 21-cm forest studies challenging. With a constant radio-loud fraction, our model suggests that a one-year sky survey conducted with SKA-LOW has the capability to detect approximately 20 radio-loud quasars at $z\sim 9$, with sufficient sensitivity to resolve individual 21-cm forest lines.</description>

      <title>Breaking the cosmological invariance of the dark matter halos shape as a new probe of modified gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Alimi &amp; Koskas have highlighted in $w$CDM models derived from general relativity (with Dark Energy Universe numerical simulation data), a cosmological invariance of the distribution of dark matter (DM) halo shapes when expressed in terms of the non-linear fluctuations of the cosmic matter field. This paper shows that this invariance persists when tested on numerical simulations performed with a different N-body solver and that it is also robust to adding neutrinos to the cold DM component. However, this discovery raises crucial questions about the validity of this invariance in modified gravity models. Thus, we examine whether the invariance observed by Alimi \&amp; Koskas remains robust in the case of Hu &amp; Sawicki models of modified gravity using DUSTGRAIN-pathfinder numerical simulations. By comparing the results of advanced numerical simulations in these different theoretical frameworks, we found significant deviations from the invariance observed in the framework of $w$CDM models of general relativity (GR). These deviations suggest that the nature of the gravitation significantly influences the shape of the DM halos. We then interpret this deviation observed in the modified gravity models from the GR models as due to the scalar-field screening effect corresponding to such $f(R)$-type theories. This one modifies the sphericization process of DM halos during their formation, precisely because the critical mass at which this scalar field becomes non-negligible is the mass at which the deviation appears. To this extent, the deviation from cosmological invariance in the shape of DM halos is a cosmological probe of the nature of gravity, and the mass scale at which it appears can be used to estimate the $f_{R0}$ parameter of such theories.</description>

      <title>The impact of dark matter on tidal signatures in neutron star mergers with Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If dark matter (DM) accumulates inside neutron stars (NS), it changes their internal structure and causes a shift of the tidal deformability from the value predicted by the dense-matter equation of state (EOS). In principle, this shift could be observable in the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. We investigate the effect of fermionic, non-interacting DM when observing a large number of GW events from DM-admixed BNSs with the precision of the proposed Einstein telescope (ET). Specifically, we study the impact on the recovery of the baryonic EOS and whether DM properties can be constrained. For this purpose, we create event catalogues of BNS mock events with DM fraction up to 1%, from which we reconstruct the posterior uncertainties with the Fisher matrix approach. Using this data, we perform joint Bayesian inference on the baryonic EOS, DM particle mass, and DM particle fraction in each event. Our results reveal that when falsely ignoring DM effects, the EOS posterior is biased towards softer EOSs, though the offset is rather small. Further, we find that within our assumptions of our DM model and population, ET will likely not be able to test the presence of DM in BNSs, even when combining many events and adding Cosmic Explorer (CE) to the next-generation detector network. Likewise, the potential constraints on the DM particle mass will remain weak because of degeneracies with the fraction and EOS.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Time Variation of the Fine-structure Constant with Quasars Detected by LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The [O III] $\lambda\lambda\ 4960,5008$ emission lines in the optical spectra of galaxies and quasars have been widely used to investigate the possible variation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ over cosmic time. In this work, we utilize the Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) quasar survey, for the first time, to measure the relative $\alpha$ variation $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ in time through the [O III] doublet method. From the LAMOST Data Release 9 quasar catalog, we refine a sample of 209 quasar spectra with strong and narrow [O III] emission lines over a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.8$. Analysis on all of the 209 spectra obtains $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = (0.5 \pm 3.7) \times 10^{-4}$, which suggests that there is no evidence of varying $\alpha$ on the explored cosmological timescales. Assuming a linear variation, the mean rate of change in $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is limited to be $(-3.4 \pm 2.4)\times 10^{-13}$ $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ in the last 7.0 Gyr. While our LAMOST-based constraint on $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is not competitive with those of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar observations, our analysis serves to corroborate the results of SDSS with another independent survey.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fefferman-Graham gauge and boundary Weyl structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of AdS/CFT correspondence, the Fefferman--Graham (FG) gauge offers a useful way to express asymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces, allowing a clear identification of their boundary structure. A known feature of this approach is that choosing a particular conformal representative for the boundary metric breaks explicitly the boundary scaling symmetry. Recent developments have shown that it is possible to generalize the FG gauge to restore boundary Weyl invariance by adopting the Weyl--Fefferman--Graham gauge. In this paper, we focus on three-dimensional gravity and study the emergence of a boundary Weyl structure when considering the most general AdS boundary conditions introduced by Grumiller and Riegler. We extend the holographic renormalization scheme to incorporate Weyl covariant quantities, identifying new subleading divergences appearing at the boundary. To address these, we introduce a new codimension-two counterterm, or corner term, that ensures the finiteness of the gravitational action. From here, we construct the quantum-generating functional, the holographic stress tensor, and compute the corresponding Weyl anomaly, showing that the latter is now expressed in a full Weyl covariant way. Finally, we discuss explicit applications to holographic integrable models and accelerating black holes. For the latter, we show that the new corner term plays a crucial role in the computation of the Euclidean on-shell action.</description>

      <title>Post-processing subtraction of tilt-to-length noise in LISA in the presence of gravitational wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be the first space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory. It will measure gravitational wave signals in the frequency regime from 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz. The success of these measurements will depend on the suppression of the various instrument noises. One important noise source in LISA will be tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling. Here, it is understood as the coupling of angular jitter, predominantly from the spacecraft, into the interferometric length readout. The current plan is to subtract this noise in-flight in post-processing as part of a noise minimization strategy. It is crucial to distinguish TTL coupling well from the GW signals in the same readout to ensure that the noise will be properly modeled. Furthermore, it is important that the subtraction of TTL noise will not degrade the GW signals. In the present manuscript, we show on simulated LISA data and for four different GW signal types that the GW responses have little effect on the quality of the TTL coupling fit and subtraction. Also, the GW signal characteristics were not altered by the TTL coupling subtraction.</description>
