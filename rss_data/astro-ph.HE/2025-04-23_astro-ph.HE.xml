      <title>Plasma Instabilities Dominate Radioactive Transients Magnetic Fields: The self-confinement of leptons in Type Ia and Core-Collapse Supernovae, and Kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The light curves of radioactive transients, such as supernovae and kilonovae, are powered by the decay of radioisotopes, which release high-energy leptons through $\beta^+$ and $\beta^-$ decays. These leptons deposit energy into the expanding ejecta. As the ejecta density decreases during expansion, the plasma becomes collisionless, with particle motion governed by electromagnetic forces. In such environments, strong or turbulent magnetic fields are thought to confine particles, though the origin of these fields and the confinement mechanism have remained unclear. Using fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we demonstrate that plasma instabilities can naturally confine high-energy leptons. These leptons generate magnetic fields through plasma streaming instabilities, even in the absence of pre-existing fields. The self-generated magnetic fields slow lepton diffusion, enabling confinement and transferring energy to thermal electrons and ions. Our results naturally explain the positron trapping inferred from late-time observations of thermonuclear and core-collapse supernovae. Furthermore, they suggest potential implications for electron dynamics in the ejecta of kilonovae. We also estimate synchrotron radio luminosities from positrons for Type Ia supernovae and find that such emission could only be detectable with next-generation radio observatories from a Galactic or local-group supernova in an environment without any circumstellar material.</description>

      <title>Are Kronberger 80 and/or Kronberger 82 regions PeVatron candidates for LHAASO J2108+5157?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy gamma rays have been detected in the region of LHAASO~J2108+5157 by the Fermi--LAT, HAWC and LHAASO-KM2A observatories. Cygnus~OB2 in Cygnus--X has been confirmed as the first strong stellar cluster PeVatron in our Galaxy. Thus, the star--forming regions Kronberger~80 and Kronberger~82, located in the field of LHAASO~J2108+5157, are analyzed to evaluate their stellar population and potential as associated PeVatron candidates. A distance of 10~kpc is adopted for Kronberger~80, while $\sim$1.6~kpc is estimated for Kronberger~82. Based on stellar densities, we report that their cluster radii are 2.5$\arcmin$ and 2.0$\arcmin$, while IR photometry reveals poor stellar content in massive O-type stars in both cases. From optical data, the estimation of cluster ages are 5--12.6~Myr and $\lesssim$ 5~Myr, respectively. We conclude that, in contrast to the stellar content of Cygnus~OB2, it is unlikely that Kronberger~80 and Kronberger~82 are PeVatrons associated with LHAASO~J2108+5157. The presence of a PeVatron in this region remains a mystery, but we confirm that the two Kronberger regions are star--forming regions undergoing formation rather than evolution.</description>

      <title>Polarimetric Signatures of Bulk Comptonization from within the Plunging Region of Accreting Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse Compton scattering by the thermal motions of electrons is believed to produce polarized hard X-rays in active galactic nuclei and black-hole binaries. Meanwhile, plasma within the plunging region of the black hole free falls into the event horizon with a bulk relativistic speed, which could also imprint polarization on up-scattered photons but has not been discussed in detail. To examine this, we computed polarimetric signatures via general relativistic ray-tracing of a toy model consisting of an accreting, geometrically thin plasma with moderate optical depth, falling onto the black hole with a bulk relativistic speed within the plunging region. We show that the maximum spatially unresolved linear polarization could be as large as approximately $7 - 8$ percent when the black hole is viewed near edge-on, while the corresponding resolved linear polarization could be roughly $50$ percent. The large discrepancy between the two is due to 1) dilution from the radiation outside the plunging region and 2) substantial cancellations of the Stokes $Q$ and $U$ fluxes. The resultant polarization contributed by bulk Comptonization could nevertheless exceed that of thermal electron scattering in a Novikov-Thorne disk. Our results thus suggest a new model for imprinting considerable polarization on the electromagnetic observables of accreting black holes. Measurements of X-ray polarization from black-hole binaries and the central black hole of active galactic nuclei could provide direct detection of the plunging region and help constrain plasma properties in the immediate vicinity of the event horizon.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Plasma Angular Momentum on Magnetically Arrested Flows and Relativistic Jets in Hot Accretion Flows Around Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In certain scenarios, the accreted angular momentum of plasma onto a black hole could be low; however, how the accretion dynamics depend on the angular momentum content of the plasma is still not fully understood. We present three-dimensional, general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of low angular momentum accretion flows around rapidly spinning black holes (with spin $a = +0.9$). The initial condition is a Fishbone-Moncrief (FM) torus threaded by a large amount of poloidal magnetic flux, where the angular velocity is a fraction $f$ of the standard value. For $f = 0$, the accretion flow becomes magnetically arrested and launches relativistic jets but only for a very short duration. After that, free-falling plasma breaks through the magnetic barrier, loading the jet with mass and destroying the jet-disk structure. Meanwhile, magnetic flux is lost via giant, asymmetrical magnetic bubbles that float away from the black hole. The accretion then exits the magnetically arrested state. For $f = 0.1$, the dimensionless magnetic flux threading the black hole oscillates quasi-periodically. The jet-disk structure shows concurrent revival and destruction while the gas outflow efficiency at the event horizon changes accordingly. For $f \geq 0.3$, we find that the dynamical behavior of the system starts to approach that of a standard accreting FM torus. Our results thus suggest that the accreted angular momentum is an important parameter that governs the maintenance of a magnetically arrested flow and launching of relativistic jets around black holes.</description>

      <title>Reconciling the Waiting Time Peaks Variations of Repeating FRBs with an Eccentric Neutron Star--White Dwarf Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous radio transients with millisecond duration. For some active repeaters, such as FRBs 20121102A and 20201124A, more than a thousand bursts have been detected by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The waiting time (WT) distributions of both repeaters, defined as the time intervals between adjacent (detected) bursts, exhibit a bimodal structure well-fitted by two log-normal functions. Notably, the time scales of the long-duration WT peaks for both repeaters show a decreasing trend over time. These similar burst features suggest that there may be a common physical mechanism for FRBs~20121102A and 20201124A. In this paper, we {revisit} the neutron star (NS)--white dwarf (WD) binary model with an eccentric orbit to account for the observed changes in the long-duration WT peaks. According to our model, the shortening of the WT peaks corresponds to the orbital period decay of the NS-WD binary. We consider two mass transfer modes, namely, stable and unstable mass transfer, to examine how the orbital period evolves. Our findings reveal distinct evolutionary pathways for the two repeaters: for FRB~20121102A, the NS-WD binary likely undergoes a combination of common envelope (CE) ejection and Roche lobe overflow, whereas for FRB~20201124A the system may experience multiple CE ejections. These findings warrant further validation through follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Diffuse X-ray emission in M51: a hierarchical Bayesian spatially-resolved spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray observations can be used to effectively probe the galactic ecosystem, particularly its hot and energetic components. However, existing X-ray studies of nearby star-forming galaxies are limited by insufficient data statistics and a lack of suitable spectral modeling to account for X-ray emission and absorption geometry. We present results from an X-ray spectral study of M51 using 1.3-Ms Chandra data, the most extensive for such a galaxy. This allows the extraction of diffuse X-ray emission spectra from spiral arm phase-dependent regions using a logarithmic spiral coordinate system. A hierarchical Bayesian approach analyzes these spectra, testing models from simple 1-T hot plasma to those including distributed hot plasma and X-ray-absorbing cool gas. We recommend a model fitting the spectra well, featuring a galactic corona with a lognormal temperature distribution and a disk with mixed X-ray emissions and absorption. In this model, only half of the coronal emission is subject to internal absorption. The best-fit absorbing gas column density is roughly twice that inferred from optical extinction of stellar light. The temperature distribution shows a mean temperature of $\sim 0.1$ keV and an average one-dex dispersion that is enhanced on the spiral arms. The corona's radiative cooling might balance the mechanical energy input from stellar feedback. These results highlight the effectiveness of X-ray mapping of the corona and cool gas in spiral galaxies.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-poor Superluminous Supernovae with Bumpy Light Curves Powered by Precessing Magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations and statistical studies have revealed that a significant fraction of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) exhibit light curves that deviate from the smooth evolution predicted by the magnetar-powered model, instead showing one or more bumps after the primary peak. However, the formation mechanisms of these post-peak bumps remain a matter of debate. Furthermore, previous studies employing the magnetar-powered model have typically assumed a fixed magnetic inclination angle and neglected the effects of magnetar precession. However, recent research has shown that the precession of newborn magnetars forming during the collapse of massive stars causes the magnetic inclination angle to evolve over time, thereby influencing magnetic dipole radiation. In this paper, therefore, we incorporate the effects of magnetar precession into the magnetar-powered model to develop the precessing magnetar-powered model. Using this model, we successfully reproduce the multi-band light curves of 6 selected representative SLSNe-I with post-peak bumps. Moreover, the derived model parameters fall within the typical parameter range for SLSNe-I. By combining the precessing magnetars in SLSNe-I and long GRBs, we find that the ellipticity of magnetars is related to the dipole magnetic field strength, which may suggest a common origin for the two phenomena. Our work provides a potential explanation for the origin of post-peak bumps in SLSNe-I and offers evidence for the early precession of newborn magnetars formed in supernova explosions.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray neutrons in magnetized astrophysical structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays are often modeled as charged particles. This allows their non-ballistic propagation in magnetized structures to be captured. In certain situations, a neutral cosmic ray component can arise. For example, cosmic ray neutrons are produced in considerable numbers through hadronic pp and p$\gamma$ interactions. At ultrahigh energies, the decay timescales of these neutrons is dilated, allowing them to traverse distances on the scale of galactic and cosmological structures. Unlike charged cosmic rays, neutrons are not deflected by magnetic fields. They propagate ballistically at the speed of light in straight lines. The presence of a neutral baryonic cosmic ray component formed in galaxies, clusters and cosmological filaments can facilitate the escape and leakage of cosmic rays from magnetic structures that would otherwise confine them. We show that, by allowing confinement breaking, the formation of cosmic-ray neutrons by high-energy hadronic interactions in large scale astrophysical structures can modify the exchange of ultra high-energy particles across magnetic interfaces between galaxies, clusters, cosmological filaments and voids.</description>

      <title>Tracing the imprints of large-scale magnetized structure on $\gamma$ rays from GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for possible GeV-TeV gamma-ray imprints of ultrahigh-energy (UHE; $\gtrsim 0.1$ EeV) cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in the large-scale structures surrounding the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) explosion, GRB 221009A. Using 1.25 years of post-event Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data, we construct a 1 GeV - 1 TeV test-statistic (TS) map within 15 Mpc of the burst. We identify two peaks in the TS map with TS $\geq 9$. The most significant peak, J1911.8+2044, exhibits gamma-ray emission in pre-burst LAT data. The other peak, J1913.2+1901, coincides with a 664.6 GeV photon recorded $\sim191.9$ days after the GRB trigger and located at about $0.75^{\circ}$ from the GRB localization. The per-photon 95% containment angle for the LAT is about $0.25^{\circ}$ in the 100 GeV - 1 TeV energy range. We explore two possible origins for the $\gamma$-ray emission: (1) UHECRs from GRB 221009A propagating through a magnetized cosmological volume in its vicinity, and (2) UHE or very-high-energy (VHE; $\gtrsim 100$ GeV) $\gamma$-ray emission from GRB 221009A, propagating in the same volume. In both cases, electromagnetic cascade emission is induced in the structured region embedding the burst. If any TS features are related to large-scale imprints induced by cosmic rays, it might be further evidence that GRB 221009A accelerated UHECRs. However, our results show that alternative scenarios without invoking UHECRs cannot be ruled out, and the observed high-energy photon could be unrelated to GRB 221009A.</description>

      <title>Leveraging differentiable programming in the inverse problem of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) probe the high-density regime of the nuclear equation of state (EOS). However, inferring the EOS from observations of NSs is a computationally challenging task. In this work, we efficiently solve this inverse problem by leveraging differential programming in two ways. First, we enable full Bayesian inference in under one hour of wall time on a GPU by using gradient-based samplers, without requiring pre-trained machine learning emulators. Moreover, we demonstrate efficient scaling to high-dimensional parameter spaces. Second, we introduce a novel gradient-based optimization scheme that recovers the EOS of a given NS mass-radius curve. We demonstrate how our framework can reveal consistencies or tensions between nuclear physics and astrophysics. First, we show how the breakdown density of a metamodel description of the EOS can be determined from NS observations. Second, we demonstrate how degeneracies in EOS modeling using nuclear empirical parameters can influence the inverse problem during gradient-based optimization. Looking ahead, our approach opens up new theoretical studies of the relation between NS properties and the EOS, while effectively tackling the data analysis challenges brought by future detectors.</description>

      <title>A Novel Relationship Between Gamma Ray Burst Duration And Photospheric Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long Gamma Ray Bursts (lGRBs) are associated with jets in Type Ic broadline supernovae. The Collapsar model provides a theoretical framework for the jet formation from the core collapse of a massive star in such supernovae. The GRB can only be produced after a successful jet break out from the star. Under this formalism the GRB duration ($t_{\rm{90}}$) has been hypothesized to be the difference between the central engine activity duration ($t_{\rm{eng}}$) and the jet breakout time ($t_{\rm{bo}}$), that is $t_{\rm{90}} = t_{\rm{eng}} - t_{\rm{bo}}$. This disallows $t_{\rm{90}} &gt; t_{\rm{eng}}$ and puts a lower bound on successful lGRB jet central engine duration ($t_{\rm{eng}} &gt; t_{\rm{bo}}$), various numerical simulations have shown otherwise. This study considers a photospheric GRB emission from a relativistic jet punching out of a Wolf-Rayet-like star. We use the bolometric lightcurve generated to calculate the lGRB duration ($t_{\rm{90}}$) for varying engine duration. We find for longer engine duration the lGRB lightcurve reflects the jet profile and $t_{\rm{90}} \approx t_{\rm{eng}}$. While for shorter engine duration, the $t_{\rm{90}}$ has photospheric radius ($R_{\rm{ph}}$) dependence. This can be modeled by a relation, $t_{\rm{90}} = t^{\rm{90}}_{\rm{eng}} + 0.03\left(\frac{R_{\rm{ph}}}{c}\right)$, where c is the speed of light, with a lower bound on $t_{\rm{90}}$ for a successful lGRB. This relation should be most relevant for possible low-luminous lGRBs originating from a collapsar with central engine duration comparable to the jet breakout time.</description>

      <title>SN 2023vbg: A Type IIn Supernova Resembling SN 2009ip, with a Long-Duration Precursor and Early-Time Bump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type IIn supernovae (SNe) resembling SN 2009ip (09ip-like SNe) originate from the interaction between circumstellar material (CSM) and the ejecta. This subclass not only shares similar observational properties around the maximum, but is commonly characterized by a long duration precursor before its maximum. Investigating the observed properties of the precursor provides constraints on the mass-loss history of the progenitor.We present observational data of SN 2023vbg, a 09ip-like type IIn SN that displayed unique observational properties compared to other 09ip-like SNe. SN 2023vbg showed a long-duration precursor at $M_g\sim-14$ mag lasting for $\sim100$ days, followed by a bright bump at $M_g\sim-17$ mag at 12-25 days before the maximum. The luminosity of the precursor is similar to those of other 09ip-like SNe, but the bright bump has not been observed in other cases.After reaching the peak luminosity, the light curve exhibited a peculiar smooth decline.While the H$\alpha$ profile displays two velocity components ($\sim 500$ and $3000\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$), a broad component observed in other 09ip-like SNe was not detected. We suggest that these properties are explained by the difference in the CSM structure as compared to other 09ip-like SNe; SN 2023vbg had an inner denser CSM component, as well as generally smooth CSM density distribution in a more extended scale, than in the others. Such diversity of CSM likely reflects the diversity of pre-SN outbursts, which in turn may mirror the range of evolutionary pathways in the final stages of the progenitors.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Clues from Amaterasu: Blazar-Driven Ultrahigh-Energy Cosmic Rays?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of the 244 EeV Amaterasu event by the Telescope Array, one of the most energetic ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs; $E\gtrsim0.1$ EeV) observed to date, invites scrutiny of its potential source. We investigate whether the nearby blazar PKS 1717+177, located within $2.5^\circ$ of the reconstructed arrival direction, could explain the event under a proton-primary hypothesis. Using a one-zone jet model, we fit the multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution of the source, incorporating both leptonic and hadronic cascade emission from photohadronic interactions. Our model supports a cosmic-ray origin of the very-high-energy ($E\gtrsim 100$ GeV) $\gamma$-ray flux and predicts a subdominant neutrino flux, an order of magnitude lower than from TXS 0506+056. Under Lorentz invariance violation, protons above a specific energy can propagate over hundreds of Mpc without significant energy loss for certain parameter choices. In such a scenario, our analysis indicates negligible deflection in the Galactic magnetic field, implying a strong extragalactic magnetic field, placing a lower bound on the field strength. Our findings provide a compelling multi-messenger framework linking UHECRs, $\gamma$ rays, and neutrinos and motivate targeted searches by current and future high-energy neutrino telescopes during increased $\gamma$-ray or X-ray activity of this blazar.</description>

      <title>Modeling Tidal Disruptions with Dynamical Tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when stars pass close enough to supermassive black holes to be torn apart by tidal forces. Traditionally, these events are studied with computationally intensive hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we present a fast, physically motivated two-stage model for TDEs. In the first stage, we model the star's tidal deformation using linear stellar perturbation theory, treating the star as a collection of driven harmonic oscillators. When the tidal energy exceeds a fraction $\gamma$ of the star's gravitational binding energy (with $\gamma \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$), we transition to the second stage, where we model the disrupted material as free particles. The parameter $\gamma$ is determined with a one-time calibration to hydrodynamical simulations. This method enables fast computation of the energy distribution $\mathrm{d}M/\mathrm{d}E$ and fallback rate $\mathrm{d}M/\mathrm{d}T$, while offering physical insight into the disruption process. We apply our model to MESA-generated profiles of middle-age main-sequence stars. Our code is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Exploring non-perturbative effects on quasi-topological black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the impact of non-perturbative quantum corrections to the entropy of both charged and charged rotating quasi-topological black holes, with a focus on their thermodynamic properties. The negative-valued correction to the entropy for small black holes is found to be unphysical. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of these non-perturbative corrections on other thermodynamic quantities, including internal energy, Gibbs free energy, charge density, and mass density, for both types of black holes. Our findings indicate that the sign of the correction parameter plays a crucial role at small horizon radii. Additionally, we assess the stability and phase transitions of these black holes in the presence of non-perturbative corrections. Below the critical point, both the corrected and uncorrected specific heat per unit volume are in an unstable regime. This instability leads to a first-order phase transition, wherein the specific heat transitions from negative to positive values as the system reaches a stable state.</description>

      <title>Questioning Cosmic Acceleration with DESI: The Big Stall of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15635v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most important discoveries in modern cosmology is cosmic acceleration. However, we find that today's universe could decelerate in the statistically preferred Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) scenario over the $\Lambda$CDM model by cosmic microwave background, type Ia supernova and DESI's new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Using various datasets, at a beyond $5\,\sigma$ confidence level, we demonstrate that the universe experiences a triple deceleration during its evolution and finally reaches the state of the ``Big Stall", which predicts that: (i) the universe suddenly comes to a halt in the distant future; (ii) its eventual destiny is dominated by dark matter rather than dark energy ; (iii) it ultimately retains an extremely small fraction of dark energy but exerts an extremely large pressure. Our findings profoundly challenge the established understanding of cosmic acceleration and enrich our comprehension of cosmic evolution.</description>

      <title>A characteristic optical variability time scale in jetted active galactic nuclei: a large gamma-ray emission sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The variability mechanisms from jetted AGNs are still under debate. Here the damped random walk (DRW) model, implemented through Gaussian Processe (GPs), is used to fit the $ZTF$ long-term optical light curves of 1684 $\gamma$-ray emission jetted AGNs. This analysis yields one of the largest samples with characteristic optical variability timescales for jetted AGNs. A single DRW model from GPs can fit the optical light curve of most jetted AGNs well/potentially well, while there are still some jetted AGNs whose light curve can not be fitted well by a single DRW model. After the jet power, proxied by gamma-ray luminosity, is introduced as a new parameter, new relationships among intrinsic variability time scales, black hole mass and jet power are discovered for efficient accretion AGNs ($\tau^{\rm in} \propto M_{\rm BH}^{0.29^{+0.06}_{-0.06}}P_{\rm jet}^{-0.3^{+0.03}_{-0.03}}$ with scatter of approximately 0.09~dex) and for inefficient accretion AGNs ($\tau^{\rm in} \propto M_{\rm BH}^{0.06^{+0.07}_{-0.07}}P_{\rm jet}^{0.37^{+0.11}_{-0.11}}$ with scatter of approximately 0.14~dex), respectively. Our results support that the optical variability of jetted AGNs with efficient accretion may originate within the standard accretion disk at UV emitting radii similar to non-jetted AGNs, and is directly related to the acceleration of shock in the jet and then enhanced through the beaming effect in beamed AGNs. For the jetted AGNs with inefficient accretion, the intrinsic timescale is consistent with the escape timescale of electrons.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation of GRB data to test Lorentz-invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz-invariance violation (LV) at energy scales approaching the Planck regime serves as a critical probe for understanding quantum gravity phenomenology. Astrophysical observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) present a promising avenue for testing LV-induced spectral lag phenomena; however, interpretations are complicated by degeneracies between LV effects and intrinsic emission delays. This study systematically investigates three competing time delay models: Model A (LV delay combined with a constant intrinsic delay), Model B (energy-dependent intrinsic delay without LV), and Model C (LV delay combined with energy-dependent intrinsic delay). We utilize mock GRB datasets generated under distinct delay mechanisms and employ Bayesian parameter estimation on simulated observations of 10 GRBs. Our findings demonstrate that Model C consistently recovers input parameters across all datasets. In contrast, Models A and B struggle to reconcile data generated under alternative mechanisms, particularly when confronted with high-energy TeV photons from GRB 190114C and GRB 221009A. Our analysis confirms that the incorporation of energy-dependent intrinsic delays in Model C is essential for establishing robust LV constraints, effectively resolving prior ambiguities in the interpretation of multi-GeV and TeV photon emissions. The results validate Model C as a generalized framework for future LV searches, yielding a subluminal LV scale of \(E_{\rm LV} \simeq 3 \times 10^{17}\) GeV based on realistic datasets. These findings are consistent with earlier constraints derived from Fermi-LAT datasets. This work underscores the necessity for joint modeling of LV and astrophysical emission processes in next-generation LV studies utilizing observatories such as LHAASO and CTA.</description>

      <title>Eccentric or circular? A reanalysis of binary black hole gravitational wave events for orbital eccentricity signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a reanalysis of 17 gravitational-wave events detected with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo in their first three observing runs, using the new IMRPhenomTEHM model -- a phenomenological time-domain multipolar waveform model for aligned-spin black-hole binaries in elliptical orbits with two eccentric parameters: eccentricity and mean anomaly. We also analyze all events with the underlying quasi-circular model IMRPhenomTHM to study the impact of including eccentricity and compare the eccentric and quasi-circular binary hypotheses. The high computational efficiency of IMRPhenomTEHM enables us to explore the impact of two different eccentricity priors -- uniform and log-uniform -- as well as different sampler and data settings. We find evidence for eccentricity in two publicly available LVK events, GW200129 and GW200208_22, with Bayes factors favoring the eccentric hypothesis over the quasi-circular aligned-spin scenario: $\log_{10}\mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{E/QC}}\in\left[1.30^{+0.15}_{-0.15}, 5.14^{+0.15}_{-0.15}\right]$ and $\log_{10}\mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{E/QC}}\in\left[0.49^{+0.08}_{-0.08}, 1.14^{+0.08}_{-0.08}\right]$, respectively. Additionally, the two high-mass events GW190701 and GW190929 exhibit potential eccentric features. For all four events, we conduct further analyses to study the impact of different sampler settings. We also investigate waveform systematics by exploring the support for spin precession using IMRPhenomTPHM and NRSur7dq4, offering new insights into the formation channels of detected binaries. Our results highlight the importance of considering eccentric waveform models in future observing runs, alongside precessing models, as they can help mitigate potential biases in parameter estimation studies. This will be particularly relevant with the expected increase in the diversity of the binary black hole population with new detectors.</description>

      <title>Infrared and X-ray emission of a supernova remnant in a clumpy medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The infrared (IR) to X-ray luminosity ratio (IRX) is an indicator of the role of the dust plays in cooling of hot gas in supernova remnants (SNR). Using the 3D dynamics of gas and interstellar polydisperse dust grains we analyze the evolution of SNR in the inhomogeneous medium. We obtain spatial distributions of the surface brigthness both of the X-ray emission from hot gas inside SNR and the IR emission from the SNR swept-up shell, as well as, the average gas temperature in the SNR, $T_X$. We find that the IRX changes significantly (by a factor of $\sim 3-30$) as a function of impact distance within the SNR and its age. In a low inhomogeneous medium the IRX drops rapidly during the SNR evolution. On the other hand, if large inhomogeneities are present in the medium, the IRX is maintained at higher levels during the late SNR evolution at radiative phase due to replenishment of dust in the hot gas by incompletely destroyed fragments behind the shock front. We show that the onset of the radiative phase determines the evolution of the $T_X - {\rm IRX}$ diagram. We illustrate that decreasing gas metallicity or density leads to high values of temperature and IRX ratio. We discuss how our results can be applied to the observational data to analyse the SNR older than 10 kyr (i.e. when the mass of the swept-up dust in the shell is expected to exceed that produced in the SNR) in the Galaxy and Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves from merging binary black holes present exciting opportunities for understanding fundamental aspects of gravity, including nonlinearities in the strong-field regime. One challenge in studying and interpreting the dynamics of binary black hole collisions is the intrinsically geometrical nature of spacetime, which in many ways is unlike that of other classical field theories. By exactly recasting Einstein's equations into a set of coupled nonlinear Maxwell equations closely resembling classical electrodynamics, we visualize the intricate dynamics of gravitational electric and magnetic fields during inspiral, merger and ring-down of a binary black hole collision.</description>

      <title>Linking the KM3-230213A Neutrino Event to Dark Matter Decay and Gravitational Waves Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The KM3NeT collaboration recently reported the detection of an ultra-high-energy neutrino event, dubbed KM3-230213A. This is the first observed neutrino event with energy of the order of $\mathcal{O}(100)$PeV, the origin of which remains unclear. We interprete this high energy neutrino event results from the Dirac fermion dark matter (DM) $\chi$ decay through the right-handed (RH) neutrino portal assuming the Type-I seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses and mixings. Fruthermore, dark matter $\chi$ is assumed to charged under $U(1)_X$ dark gauge symmetry, which is sponetaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value of the dark Higgs $\Phi$. In this scenario, the DM can decay into a pair of Standard Model (SM) particles for $v_\Phi \gg m_\chi$, which we assume is the case. If the DM mass is around $440$ PeV with a lifetime $5\times 10^{29}$ sec, it can account for the KM3-230213A event. However, such heavy DM cannot be produced through the thermal freeze-out mechanism due to overproduction and violation of unitarity bounds. We focus on the UV freeze-in production of DM through a dimension-5 operator, which helps in producing the DM dominantly in the early Universe. We have also found a set of allowed parameter values that can correctly account for the DM relic density and decay lifetime required to explain the KM3NeT signal. Moreover, we have generated the neutrino spectra from the two-body decay using the HDMSpectra package, which requires the dark Higgs vacuum expectations value (VEV) to be much larger than the DM mass. Finally, the large value of the dark Higgs field VEV opens up the possibility of generating GW spectra from cosmic strings. We have found a reasonable set of parameter values that can address the KM3NeT signal, yield the correct value of the DM relic density through freeze-in mechanism, and allow for possible detection of GW at future detectors.</description>

      <title>Evidence of mini-jet emission in a large emission zone from a magnetically-dominated gamma-ray burst jet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07205v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The second brightest GRB in history, GRB230307A, provides an ideal laboratory to study the mechanism of GRB prompt emission thanks to its extraordinarily high photon statistics and its single episode activity. Here we demonstrate that the rapidly variable components of its prompt emission compose an overall broad single pulse-like profile. Although these individual rapid components are aligned in time across all energy bands, this overall profile conspires to show a well-defined energy-dependent behavior which is typically seen in single GRB pulses. Such a feature demonstrates that the prompt emission of this burst is from many individual emitting units that are casually linked in a emission site at a large distance from the central engine. Such a scenario is in natural consistency with the internal-collision-induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence framework, which invokes many mini-jets due to local magnetic reconnection that constantly appear and disappear in a global magnetically-dominated jet.</description>

      <title>The 230 GHz Variability of Numerical Models of Sagittarius A* II. The Physical Origins of the Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue our previous work, Chan et al. 2024, to investigate how variations in the electron temperature prescription parameter, $R_{\rm Low}$, influence the $3$-hour variability at $230$\,GHz, $M_{\Delta T}$, in magnetic-arrested disk (MAD) models of Sagittarius~A* (Sgr~A*), through analyzing a series of general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and raytracing simulations. For models with a black hole spin $a &gt; 0$, we discovered that increasing $R_{\rm Low}$ renders the photon ring more optically thick, obscuring the varying accretion flows that contribute to the variability. However, as $R_{\rm Low}$ increases further, MAD flux eruptions become more pronounced, compensating for the decrease in $M_{\Delta T}$. For models with a spin $a &lt; 0$, although a higher $R_{\rm Low}$ also increases the optical thickness of the fluid, voids within the optically thick gas fail to cover the entire photon ring. Similarly, flux eruptions become more prominent as $R_{\rm Low}$ increases further, contributing to the observed rise in $M_{\Delta T}$ relative to $R_{\rm Low}$. For black holes with a spin $a = 0$, although the effect of increasing optical depth is still present, their $230$\,GHz light curves, and hence $M_{\Delta T}$, are insensitive to changes in $R_{\rm Low}$. Furthermore, we found that the variability of the $230$\,GHz light curves at $R_{\rm Low} = 1$ might correlate with fluctuations in the internal energy of the gas near the black hole, and we listed potential causes and solutions to the over-variability problem. Our findings highlight potential approaches for refining $M_{\Delta T}$ to better align with observations when modeling Sgr~A*.</description>

      <title>Cosmology and nuclear-physics implications of a subsolar gravitational-wave event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting a compact subsolar object would have profound implications in physics, the reach of which depends on the nature of the object. Here we explore such consequences for a putative subsolar-mass gravitational wave event detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We forecast that the nature of a subsolar binary (made of light neutron stars, primordial black holes, or more exotic compact objects) can be inferred with a great statistical confidence level already during the ongoing fourth observing run, based on the large tidal deformability effects on the signal. The detection of a primordial black hole would have implications for cosmology and dark matter scenarios, while the measurement of the tidal deformability of a subsolar neutron star could rule out or confirm the existence of strange stars made of quarks.</description>

      <title>NICER Spectral and Timing Analysis of 4U 1630$-$47 and its Heartbeat State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a spectral and timing analysis of NICER observations of the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-47 from 2018 to 2024. We find relativistic reflection features in the hard and soft intermediate states, and disk wind absorption features in the soft intermediate state and soft state. We fit the reflection features with relxillCP and find a stable and untruncated disk in the intermediate states; we fit the wind features with XSTAR and find a stable, highly ionized wind with high column density across different outbursts. Specifically, the heartbeat state is seen in two observations in 2021 and 2023 respectively. Through the phase-resolved spectral fitting, we find the flux of the source to be correlated with the disk parameters while no strong correlation with the coronal parameters is observed, consistent with the scenario given by the inner disk radiation pressure instability. A hard lag on the time scale of 1 s and high coherence is observed near the characteristic frequency of the heartbeat, which can be explained by the viscous propagation of mass accretion fluctuations in the disk. The positive relationship between the heartbeat fractional rms and energy can possibly be explained by a disk-originated oscillation which is then magnified by the corona scattering.</description>

      <title>A two-hump spectrum in the prompt emission of GRB 240825A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An extra hard spectral component that extends to GeV energies, in additional to the typical sub- MeV Band component, appears in several gamma-ray burst (GRBs) detected by Fermi Large Area Telescopes (LAT). Only in one case (i.e., GRB 090926A), a spectral break feature at the high energy end is identified in the extra hard component, but the photon counts are not enough to distinguish between the cutoff model and the broken power law model for the spectral break. In this work, we report the detection of an extra hard component showing the spectral break in GRB 240825A. We find that a broken power-law model fits the spectral data of the extra component better than a single power-law with an exponential cutoff in the time resolved spectrum for the second emission pulse, with a break at about 50 MeV. This spectral feature disfavors the gamma-ray opacity to pair creation as the origin of the spectral break, but points to an intrinsic peak for the extra component. The low ratio between the peak of the extra hard component and that of the Band component challenges the synchrotron self-Compton origin for the extra component. Alternative scenarios, such as the inverse Compton scattering of the photosphere emission, are discussed. In addition, we find a clear transition from the prompt emission to afterglow emission at GeV energies in GRB 240825A, manifested by a temporal steep decay and an unique spectral evolution.</description>

      <title>A Triple Scenario for the Formation of Wide Black Hole Binaries Such As Gaia BH1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, several non-interacting black hole-stellar binaries have been identified in Gaia data. For example, Gaia BH1, where a Sun-like star is in a moderate eccentricity (e=0.44), 185-day orbit around a black hole. This orbit is difficult to explain through binary evolution. The present-day separation suggests the progenitor system would have undergone an episode of common envelope evolution, but a common envelope should shrink the period below the observed one. Since the majority of massive stars form in higher multiplicity systems, a triple evolution scenario is more likely for the progenitors of BH binaries. Here we show that such systems can indeed be more easily explained via evolution in hierarchical triple systems. von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations or instabilities can delay the onset of the common envelope phase in the inner binary of the triple, so that the black hole progenitor and low-mass star are more widely separated when it begins, leading to the formation of wider binaries. There are also systems with similar periods but larger eccentricities, where the BH progenitor is a merger product of the inner binary in the triple. Such mergers lead to a more top-heavy black hole mass function.</description>

      <title>On relativistic dynamical tides: subtleties and calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The response of astrophysical compact objects to external tidal fields carries valuable information on the nature of these objects, on the equation of state of matter, and on the underlying gravitational theory. In this work, we highlight subtleties in describing relativistic dynamical tidal responses that arise from ambiguities in the decomposition of a perturbed metric into external tidal and induced response pieces. Observables are unambiguous. However in practice, differences arising from implicit assumptions in the definition of tidal deformabilities may lead to a bias in constraining nuclear physics or gravitational theories, if not properly tied to observational data. We propose calibration of a tidal response function for any compact objects in vacuum General Relativity. Within this framework, the dynamical tidal Love numbers of a Schwarzschild black hole in both even and odd sectors vanish at any multipole order. The calibration allows one to define dynamical tidal deformabilities of relativistic stars, such as neutron stars, as the difference from the BH values (zero) under the unified definition in a simple manner. As a straightforward extension of our framework, we compute the next-to-leading dissipative tidal response of Schwarzschild black holes for the first time.</description>

      <title>New constraints on singlet scalar dark matter model with LZ, invisible Higgs decay and gamma-ray line observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The singlet scalar dark matter (DM) model is a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM). This model features only two free parameters: the singlet scalar mass $m_S$ and the quartic coupling $a_2$ between the singlet scalar and the SM Higgs doublet. Previous studies have suggested that only the resonant region remains viable under combined constraints. In this work, we revisit and refine the constraints using data from the direct detection experiment LZ, invisible Higgs decay measurements, and gamma-ray line observations conducted by Fermi-LAT and DAMPE. Our findings indicate that the latest results from LZ have significantly strengthened the constraints on the model parameters. We demonstrate that only a narrow parameter region remains viable, specifically $60.5\,\text{GeV}&lt; m_S &lt; 62.5\,\text{GeV}$ and $1.7\times10^{-4}&lt;a_2&lt; 4.7\times10^{-4}$. This suggests that a three-fold improvement in the current LZ results would thoroughly examine the parameter space below $1\,\rm{TeV}$ for the singlet scalar DM model.</description>

      <title>Nyquist-resolving gravitational waves via orbital frequency-based refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive mesh refinement efficiently facilitates the computation of gravitational waveforms in numerical relativity. However, determining precisely when, where, and to what extent to refine when solving the Einstein equations poses challenges; several ad hoc refinement criteria have been explored in the literature. This work introduces an optimized resolution baseline derived in situ from the inspiral trajectory (ORBIT). This method uses the binary's orbital frequency as a proxy for anticipated gravitational waves to dynamically refine the grid, satisfying the Nyquist frequency requirements on grid resolution up to a specified spin weighted spherical harmonic order. ORBIT sustains propagation of gravitational waves while avoiding the more costly alternative of maintaining high resolution across an entire simulation, both spatially and temporally. We find that enabling ORBIT decreases waveform noise by an order of magnitude and better resolves high-order wave amplitudes through merger. Combined with WAMR and other improvements, updates to Dendro-GR decrease waveform noise, decrease constraint violations, and boost refinement efficiency each by factors of $\mathcal{O}(100)$, while reducing computational cost by a factor of four. ORBIT and other recent improvements to Dendro-GR begin to prepare us for gravitational wave science with next-generation detectors.</description>
