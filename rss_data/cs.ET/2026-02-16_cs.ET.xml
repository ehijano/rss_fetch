      <title>Quantum walk inspired JPEG compression of images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a quantum inspired adaptive quantization framework that enhances the classical JPEG compression by introducing a learned, optimized Qtable derived using a Quantum Walk Inspired Optimization (QWIO) search strategy. The optimizer searches a continuous parameter space of frequency band scaling factors under a unified rate distortion objective that jointly considers reconstruction fidelity and compression efficiency. The proposed framework is evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet subsets, using Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Bits Per Pixel (BPP), and error heatmap visual analysis as evaluation metrics. Experimental results show average gains ranging from 3 to 6 dB PSNR, along with better structural preservation of edges, contours, and luminance transitions, without modifying decoder compatibility. The structure remains JPEG compliant and can be implemented using accessible scientific packages making it ideal for deployment and practical research use.</description>

      <title>A consequence of failed sequential learning: A computational account of developmental amnesia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developmental amnesia, featured with severely impaired episodic memory and almost normal semantic memory, has been discovered to occur in children with hippocampal atrophy. This unique combination of characteristics seems to challenge the understanding that early loss of episodic memory may impede cognitive development and result in severe mental retardation. Although a few underlying mechanisms have been suggested, no computational model has been reported that is able to mimic the unique combination of characteristics. In this study, a cognitive system is presented, and developmental amnesia is demonstrated computationally in terms of impaired episodic recall, spared recognition and spared semantic learning. Impaired sequential/spatial learning ability of the hippocampus is suggested to be the cause of such amnesia. Simulation shows that impaired sequential leaning may only result in severe impairment of episodic recall, but affect neither recognition ability nor semantic learning. The spared semantic learning is inline with the view that semantic learning is largely associated with the consolidation of episodic memory, a process in which episodic memory may be mostly activated randomly, instead of sequentially. Furthermore, retrograded amnesia is also simulated, and the result and its mechanism are in agreement with most computational models of amnesia reported previously.</description>
