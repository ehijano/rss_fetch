      <title>Subextension and approximation of $m$-subharmonic functions in weighted energy classes with given boundary values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first study subextensions of m-subharmonic functions in weighted energy classes with given boundary values. The results are used to approximate an m-subharmonic function in weighted energy classes with given boundary values by an increasing sequence of m-subharmonic functions defined on larger domains.</description>

      <title>Hermitian rank in ideal powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the (hermitian) rank of $QP^d$ is bounded from below by the rank of $P^d$ whenever $Q$ is not identically zero and real-analytic in a neighborhood of some point on the zero set of $P$ in $\mathbb{C}^n$ and $P$ is a polynomial of bidegree at most $(1,1)$. This result generalizes the theorem of D'Angelo and the second author which assumed that $P$ was bihomogeneous. Examples show that no hypothesis can be dropped.</description>

      <title>A discrete Schwarzian derivative via circle packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exists an extensive and fairly comprehensive discrete analytic function theory which is based on circle packing. This paper introduces a faithful discrete analogue of the classical Schwarzian derivative to this theory and develops its basic properties. The motivation comes from the current lack of circle packing algorithms in spherical geometry, and the discrete Schwarzian derivative may provide for new approaches. A companion localized notion called an intrinsic schwarzian is also investigated. The main concrete results of the paper are limited to circle packing flowers. A parameterization by intrinsic schwarzians is established, providing an essential packing criterion for flowers. The paper closes with the study of special classes of flowers that occur in the circle packing literature. As usual in circle packing, there are pleasant surprises at nearly every turn, so those not interested in circle packing theory may still enjoy the new and elementary geometry seen in these flowers.</description>

      <title>Tangent Currents, King's Residue Formula and Intersection Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the intersection of positive closed currents on domains. We use the theory of tangent currents in connection with King's residue formula. We find a sufficient condition for the local existence of tangent currents, and express the shadow of tangent currents and the $h$-dimension of tangent currents in terms of the complex Monge-Amp\`ere type current. Further, a reasonable integrability condition for the existence of the unique tangent current with minimal $h$-dimension is introduced. We apply it to the study of the intersection of positive closed currents, find a sufficient condition for the intersection of positive closed currents on domains and describe the intersection in terms of the complex Monge-Amp\`ere type current. At the same time, we obtain regularizations of positive closed currents that work well with the suggested intersection of positive closed currents. In particular, the standard regularization of currents by convolution actually produces the convergence towards the intersection of positive closed currents. In this sense, our approach generalizes King's work on currents defined by analytic varieties, which is obtained from Federer's slicing theory. Some classical examples are computed. Our work is applicable to general complex manifolds not necessarily compact or K\"ahler.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness sets with angular density for spaces of entire functions, I. Basics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first part of our work which is devoted to the uniqueness sets for spaces of entire functions. In this part we consider a set $\Lambda$ with angular density with respect to the order $\rho&gt;0,$ satisfying the Lindel\"of condition. We find the value of the critical zero set type for $\Lambda$ in geometrical terms. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the coincidence of the critical zero set type and the critical uniqueness set type.
  At the end of the paper we present an application of our results to random zero sets in Fock-type spaces.</description>

      <title>Singularities vs non-pluripolar Monge--Amp\`{e}re masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to compare singularities of closed positive currents whose non-pluripolar complex Monge--Amp\`ere masses equal. We also provide a short alternative proof for the monotonicity of non-pluripolar complex Monge--Amp\`ere masses, generalizing results of Witt-Nystr\"om, Darvas--Di Nezza--Lu, Lu--Nguy\^en and Vu.</description>

      <title>Vanishing theorems for Hodge numbers and the Calabi curvature operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that a compact $n$-dimensional K\"ahler manifold with $\frac{n}{2}$-positive Calabi curvature operator has the rational cohomology of complex projective space. For even $n,$ this is sharp in the sense that the complex quadric with its symmetric metric has $\frac{n}{2}$-nonnegative Calabi curvature operator, yet $b_n =2.$ Furthermore, the compact K\"ahler manifolds with $\frac{n}{2}$-nonnegative Calabi curvature operator are completely classified. In addition, the previously known results for the K\"ahler curvature operator are improved when the metric is K\"ahler-Einstein.</description>

      <title>On Toeplitz operators on $H^1(\mathbb{C}^+)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider Toeplitz operators with anti-analytic symbols on $H^1(\mathbb{C}^+)$. It is well known that there are no bounded Toeplitz operators $T_{\overline{\Theta}}\colon H^1(\mathbb{C}^+) \to H^1(\mathbb{C}^+)$, where $\Theta \in H^\infty(\mathbb{C}^+)$. We consider the subspace $H^1_{\Theta}=\left\lbrace f \in H^1(\mathbb{C}^+)\colon \int_{\mathbb{R}}f \overline{\Theta}=0\right\rbrace$ and show that it is natural to study the boundedness of $T_{\overline{\Theta}}\colon H^1_\Theta \to H^1(\mathbb{C}^+)$. We provide several different conditions equivalent to such boundedness. We prove that when $\Theta=e^{i\tau (\cdot)}$, with $\tau&gt;0$ $T_{\overline{\Theta}}\colon H^1_\Theta \to H^1(\mathbb{C}^+)$ is bounded. Finally, we discuss a number of related open questions.</description>

      <title>Criteria for a fiberwise Fujiki/K\"ahler family to be locally Moishezon/projective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by certain topics in local deformation theory, we primarily utilize F. Campana's methods to investigate how far a fiberwise Fujiki family is from being locally Moishezon and how far a fiberwise K\"ahler family is from being locally projective.
  We investigate these questions from two main perspectives: cohomological data and global semi-positivity data on the total space.</description>
