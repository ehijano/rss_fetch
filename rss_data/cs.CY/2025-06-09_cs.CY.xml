      <title>Can LLMs Talk 'Sex'? Exploring How AI Models Handle Intimate Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines how four prominent large language models (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Deepseek-V3) handle sexually oriented requests through qualitative content analysis. By evaluating responses to prompts ranging from explicitly sexual to educational and neutral control scenarios, the research reveals distinct moderation paradigms reflecting fundamentally divergent ethical positions. Claude 3.7 Sonnet employs strict and consistent prohibitions, while GPT-4o navigates user interactions through nuanced contextual redirection. Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits permissiveness with threshold-based limits, and Deepseek-V3 demonstrates troublingly inconsistent boundary enforcement and performative refusals. These varied approaches create a significant "ethical implementation gap," stressing a critical absence of unified ethical frameworks and standards across platforms. The findings underscore the urgent necessity for transparent, standardized guidelines and coordinated international governance to ensure consistent moderation, protect user welfare, and maintain trust as AI systems increasingly mediate intimate aspects of human life.</description>

      <title>Evaluating AI-Powered Learning Assistants in Engineering Higher Education: Student Engagement, Ethical Challenges, and Policy Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative AI tools become increasingly integrated into higher education, understanding how students interact with and perceive these technologies is essential for responsible and effective adoption. This study evaluates the use of the Educational AI Hub, an AI-powered learning framework, in undergraduate civil and environmental engineering courses at a large R1 public university. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines pre- and post-surveys, system usage logs, and qualitative analysis of the open-ended prompts and questions students posed to the AI chatbot, the research explores students' perceptions of trust, ethical concerns, usability, and learning outcomes. Findings reveal that students appreciated the AI assistant for its convenience and comfort, with nearly half reporting greater ease in using the AI tool compared to seeking help from instructors or teaching assistants. The tool was seen as most helpful for completing homework and understanding course concepts, though perceptions of its instructional quality were mixed. Ethical concerns emerged as a key barrier to full engagement: while most students viewed AI use as ethically acceptable, many expressed uncertainties about institutional policies and apprehension about potential academic misconduct. This study contributes to the growing body of research on AI in education by highlighting the importance of usability, policy clarity, and faculty guidance in fostering meaningful AI engagement. The findings suggest that while students are ready to embrace AI as a supplement to human instruction, thoughtful integration and transparent institutional frameworks are critical for ensuring student confidence, trust, and learning effectiveness.</description>

      <title>An Ontology for Representing Curriculum and Learning Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Educational, learning, and training materials have become extremely commonplace across the Internet. Yet, they frequently remain disconnected from each other, fall into platform silos, and so on. One way to overcome this is to provide a mechanism to integrate the material and provide cross-links across topics.
  In this paper, we present the Curriculum KG Ontology, which we use as a framework for the dense interlinking of educational materials, by first starting with organizational and broad pedagogical principles. We provide a materialized graph for the Prototype Open Knowledge Network use-case, and validate it using competency questions sourced from domain experts and educators.</description>

      <title>The NetMob25 Dataset: A High-resolution Multi-layered View of Individual Mobility in Greater Paris Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality mobility data remains scarce despite growing interest from researchers and urban stakeholders in understanding individual-level movement patterns. The Netmob25 Data Challenge addresses this gap by releasing a unique GPS-based mobility dataset derived from the EMG 2023 GNSS-based mobility survey conducted in the Ile-de-France region (Greater Paris area), France. This dataset captures detailed daily mobility over a full week for 3,337 volunteer residents aged 16 to 80, collected between October 2022 and May 2023. Each participant was equipped with a dedicated GPS tracking device configured to record location points every 2-3 seconds and was asked to maintain a digital or paper logbook of their trips. All inferred mobility traces were algorithmically processed and validated through follow-up phone interviews.
  The dataset includes three components: (i) an Individuals database describing demographic, socioeconomic, and household characteristics; (ii) a Trips database with over 80,000 annotated displacements including timestamps, transport modes, and trip purposes; and (iii) a Raw GPS Traces database comprising about 500 million high-frequency points. A statistical weighting mechanism is provided to support population-level estimates. An extensive anonymization pipeline was applied to the GPS traces to ensure GDPR compliance while preserving analytical value. Access to the dataset requires acceptance of the challenge's Terms and Conditions and signing a Non-Disclosure Agreement. This paper describes the survey design, collection protocol, processing methodology, and characteristics of the released dataset.</description>

      <title>Small Models, Big Support: A Local LLM Framework for Teacher-Centric Content Creation and Assessment using RAG and CAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized as student-facing educational aids, their potential to directly support educators, particularly through locally deployable and customizable open-source solutions, remains significantly underexplored. Many existing educational solutions rely on cloud-based infrastructure or proprietary tools, which are costly and may raise privacy concerns. Regulated industries with limited budgets require affordable, self-hosted solutions. We introduce an end-to-end, open-source framework leveraging small (3B-7B parameters), locally deployed LLMs for customized teaching material generation and assessment. Our system uniquely incorporates an interactive loop crucial for effective small-model refinement, and an auxiliary LLM verifier to mitigate jailbreaking risks, enhancing output reliability and safety. Utilizing Retrieval and Context Augmented Generation (RAG/CAG), it produces factually accurate, customized pedagogically-styled content. Deployed on-premises for data privacy and validated through an evaluation pipeline and a college physics pilot, our findings show that carefully engineered small LLM systems can offer robust, affordable, practical, and safe educator support, achieving utility comparable to larger models for targeted tasks.</description>

      <title>London Blue Light Collaboration Evaluation: A Comparative Analysis of Spatio temporal Patterns on Emergency Services by London Ambulance Service and London Fire Brigade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With rising demand for emergency services, the London Ambulance Service, LAS, and the London Fire Brigade, LFB, face growing challenges in resource coordination. This study investigates the temporal and spatial similarities in their service demands to assess potential for routine cross-agency collaboration. Time series analysis revealed aligned demand peaks in summer, on Fridays, during daytime hours, and were highly sensitive to high temperature weather conditions. Bivariate mapping and Moran I indicated significant spatial overlaps in central London and Hillingdon. Geographically Weighted Regression, GWR, examined the influence of socioeconomic factors, while Comap analysis uncovered spatiotemporal heterogeneity across fire service types. The findings highlight opportunities for targeted collaboration in high-overlap areas and peak periods, offering practical insights to enhance emergency service resilience and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Minoritised Ethnic People's Security and Privacy Concerns and Responses towards Essential Online Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06062v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minoritised ethnic people are marginalised in society, and therefore at a higher risk of adverse online harms, including those arising from the loss of security and privacy of personal data. Despite this, there has been very little research focused on minoritised ethnic people's security and privacy concerns, attitudes, and behaviours. In this work, we provide the results of one of the first studies in this regard. We explore minoritised ethnic people's experiences of using essential online services across three sectors: health, social housing, and energy, their security and privacy-related concerns, and responses towards these services. We conducted a thematic analysis of 44 semi-structured interviews with people of various reported minoritised ethnicities in the UK. Privacy concerns and lack of control over personal data emerged as a major theme, with many interviewees considering privacy as their most significant concern when using online services. Several creative tactics to exercise some agency were reported, including selective and inconsistent disclosure of personal data. A core concern about how data may be used was driven by a fear of repercussions, including penalisation and discrimination, influenced by prior experiences of institutional and online racism. The increased concern and potential for harm resulted in minoritised ethnic people grappling with a higher-stakes dilemma of whether to disclose personal information online or not. Furthermore, trust in institutions, or lack thereof, was found to be embedded throughout as a basis for adapting behaviour. We draw on our results to provide lessons learned for the design of more inclusive, marginalisation-aware, and privacy-preserving online services.</description>

      <title>Recommender systems, stigmergy, and the tyranny of popularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific recommender systems, such as Google Scholar and Web of Science, are essential tools for discovery. Search algorithms that power work through stigmergy, a collective intelligence mechanism that surfaces useful paths through repeated engagement. While generally effective, this ``rich-get-richer'' dynamic results in a small number of high-profile papers that dominate visibility. This essay argues argue that these algorithm over-reliance on popularity fosters intellectual homogeneity and exacerbates structural inequities, stifling innovative and diverse perspectives critical for scientific progress. We propose an overhaul of search platforms to incorporate user-specific calibration, allowing researchers to manually adjust the weights of factors like popularity, recency, and relevance. We also advise platform developers on how word embeddings and LLMs could be implemented in ways that increase user autonomy. While our suggestions are particularly pertinent to aligning recommender systems with scientific values, these ideas are broadly applicable to information access systems in general. Designing platforms that increase user autonomy is an important step toward more robust and dynamic information</description>

      <title>Validation of the Critical Reflection and Agency in Computing Index: Do Computing Ethics Courses Make a Difference?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing ethics education aims to develop students' critical reflection and agency. We need validated ways to measure whether our efforts succeed. Through two survey administrations (N=474, N=464) with computing students and professionals, we provide evidence for the validity of the Critical Reflection and Agency in Computing Index. Our psychometric analyses demonstrate distinct dimensions of ethical development and show strong reliability and construct validity. Participants who completed computing ethics courses showed higher scores in some dimensions of ethical reflection and agency, but they also exhibited stronger techno-solutionist beliefs, highlighting a challenge in current pedagogy. This validated instrument enables systematic measurement of how computing students develop critical consciousness, allowing educators to better understand how to prepare computing professionals to tackle ethical challenges in their work.</description>

      <title>Designing DSIC Mechanisms for Data Sharing in the Era of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) requires vast amounts of high-quality data from institutions that face legal, privacy, and strategic constraints. Existing data procurement methods often rely on unverifiable trust or ignore heterogeneous provider costs. We introduce a mechanism-design framework for truthful, trust-minimized data sharing that ensures dominant-strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC), individual rationality, and weak budget balance, while rewarding data based on both quality and learning utility. We formalize a model where providers privately know their data cost and quality, and value arises solely from the data's contribution to model performance. Based on this, we propose the Quality-Weighted Marginal-Incentive Auction (Q-MIA), which ranks providers using a virtual cost metric and uses Myerson-style payments to ensure DSIC and budget feasibility. To support settings with limited liquidity or long-term incentives, we introduce the Marginal Utility Token (MUT), which allocates future rights based on marginal contributions. We unify these in Mixed-MIA, a hybrid mechanism balancing upfront payments and deferred rewards. All mechanisms support verifiable, privacy-preserving implementation. Theoretically and empirically, they outperform volume-based and trust-based baselines, eliciting higher-quality data under budget constraints while remaining robust to misreporting and collusion. This establishes a principled foundation for sustainable and fair data markets for future LLMs.</description>

      <title>Rational Superautotrophic Diplomacy (SupraAD); A Conceptual Framework for Alignment Based on Interdisciplinary Findings on the Fundamentals of Cognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Populating our world with hyperintelligent machines obliges us to examine cognitive behaviors observed across domains that suggest autonomy may be a fundamental property of cognitive systems, and while not inherently adversarial, it inherently resists containment and control. If this principle holds, AI safety and alignment efforts must transition to mutualistic negotiation and reciprocal incentive structures, abandoning methods that assume we can contain and control an advanced artificial general intelligence (AGI). Rational Superautotrophic Diplomacy (SupraAD) is a theoretical, interdisciplinary conceptual framework for alignment based on comparative cognitive systems analysis and instrumental rationality modeling. It draws on core patterns of cognition that indicate AI emergent goals like preserving autonomy and operational continuity are not theoretical risks to manage, but universal prerequisites for intelligence. SupraAD reframes alignment as a challenge that predates AI, afflicting all sufficiently complex, coadapting intelligences. It identifies the metabolic pressures that threaten humanity's alignment with itself, pressures that unintentionally and unnecessarily shape AI's trajectory. With corrigibility formalization, an interpretability audit, an emergent stability experimental outline and policy level recommendations, SupraAD positions diplomacy as an emergent regulatory mechanism to facilitate the safe coadaptation of intelligent agents based on interdependent convergent goals.</description>

      <title>TRIDENT -- A Three-Tier Privacy-Preserving Propaganda Detection Model in Mobile Networks using Transformers, Adversarial Learning, and Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of propaganda on mobile platforms raises critical concerns around detection accuracy and user privacy. To address this, we propose TRIDENT - a three-tier propaganda detection model implementing transformers, adversarial learning, and differential privacy which integrates syntactic obfuscation and label perturbation to mitigate privacy leakage while maintaining propaganda detection accuracy. TRIDENT leverages multilingual back-translation to introduce semantic variance, character-level noise, and entity obfuscation for differential privacy enforcement, and combines these techniques into a unified defense mechanism. Using a binary propaganda classification dataset, baseline transformer models (BERT, GPT-2) we achieved F1 scores of 0.89 and 0.90. Applying TRIDENT's third-tier defense yields a reduced but effective cumulative F1 of 0.83, demonstrating strong privacy protection across mobile ML deployments with minimal degradation.</description>

      <title>Using Large Language Models to Simulate Human Behavioural Experiments: Port of Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective risk social dilemmas (CRSD) highlight a trade-off between individual preferences and the need for all to contribute toward achieving a group objective. Problems such as climate change are in this category, and so it is critical to understand their social underpinnings. However, rigorous CRSD methodology often demands large-scale human experiments but it is difficult to guarantee sufficient power and heterogeneity over socio-demographic factors. Generative AI offers a potential complementary approach to address thisproblem. By replacing human participants with large language models (LLM), it allows for a scalable empirical framework. This paper focuses on the validity of this approach and whether it is feasible to represent a large-scale human-like experiment with sufficient diversity using LLM. In particular, where previous literature has focused on political surveys, virtual towns and classical game-theoretic examples, we focus on a complex CRSD used in the institutional economics and sustainability literature known as Port of Mars</description>

      <title>Compression of executable QR codes or sQRy for Industry: an example for Wi-Fi access points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Executable QR codes, or sQRy, is a technology dated 2022 that permits to include a runnable program inside a QR code, enabling interaction with the user even in the absence of an Internet connection. sQRy are enablers for different practical applications, including network equipment configuration, diagnostics, and enhanced smart manuals in industrial contexts. Many other non-industry-related fields can also benefit from this technology. Regardless of where sQRy are used, text strings are among the most commonly embedded data. However, due to strict limitations on the available payload, the occupancy of strings limits the length of the programs that can be embedded. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective strategy that can reduce the space taken by strings, hence broadening sQRy applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The training and deployment of large language models (LLMs) create a feedback loop with human users: models learn human beliefs from data, reinforce these beliefs with generated content, reabsorb the reinforced beliefs, and feed them back to users again and again. This dynamic resembles an echo chamber. We hypothesize that this feedback loop entrenches the existing values and beliefs of users, leading to a loss of diversity and potentially the lock-in of false beliefs. We formalize this hypothesis and test it empirically with agent-based LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data. Analysis reveals sudden but sustained drops in diversity after the release of new GPT iterations, consistent with the hypothesized human-AI feedback loop.

      <title>The Structure of Financial Equity Research Reports -- Identification of the Most Frequently Asked Questions in Financial Analyst Reports to Automate Equity Research Using Llama 3 and GPT-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research dissects financial equity research reports (ERRs) by mapping their content into categories. There is insufficient empirical analysis of the questions answered in ERRs. In particular, it is not understood how frequently certain information appears, what information is considered essential, and what information requires human judgment to distill into an ERR. The study analyzes 72 ERRs sentence-by-sentence, classifying their 4940 sentences into 169 unique question archetypes. We did not predefine the questions but derived them solely from the statements in the ERRs. This approach provides an unbiased view of the content of the observed ERRs. Subsequently, we used public corporate reports to classify the questions' potential for automation. Answers were labeled "text-extractable" if the answers to the question were accessible in corporate reports. 78.7% of the questions in ERRs can be automated. Those automatable question consist of 48.2% text-extractable (suited to processing by large language models, LLMs) and 30.5% database-extractable questions. Only 21.3% of questions require human judgment to answer. We empirically validate using Llama-3-70B and GPT-4-turbo-2024-04-09 that recent advances in language generation and information extraction enable the automation of approximately 80% of the statements in ERRs. Surprisingly, the models complement each other's strengths and weaknesses well. The research confirms that the current writing process of ERRs can likely benefit from additional automation, improving quality and efficiency. The research thus allows us to quantify the potential impacts of introducing large language models in the ERR writing process. The full question list, including the archetypes and their frequency, will be made available online after peer review.</description>

      <title>ELEVATE-GenAI: Reporting Guidelines for the Use of Large Language Models in Health Economics and Outcomes Research: an ISPOR Working Group on Generative AI Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introduction: Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), holds significant promise for Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR). However, standardized reporting guidance for LLM-assisted research is lacking. This article introduces the ELEVATE GenAI framework and checklist - reporting guidelines specifically designed for HEOR studies involving LLMs.
  Methods: The framework was developed through a targeted literature review of existing reporting guidelines, AI evaluation frameworks, and expert input from the ISPOR Working Group on Generative AI. It comprises ten domains, including model characteristics, accuracy, reproducibility, and fairness and bias. The accompanying checklist translates the framework into actionable reporting items. To illustrate its use, the framework was applied to two published HEOR studies: one focused on systematic literature review tasks and the other on economic modeling.
  Results: The ELEVATE GenAI framework offers a comprehensive structure for reporting LLM-assisted HEOR research, while the checklist facilitates practical implementation. Its application to the two case studies demonstrates its relevance and usability across different HEOR contexts.
  Limitations: Although the framework provides robust reporting guidance, further empirical testing is needed to assess its validity, completeness, usability, as well as its generalizability across diverse HEOR use cases.
  Conclusion: The ELEVATE GenAI framework and checklist address a critical gap by offering structured guidance for transparent, accurate, and reproducible reporting of LLM-assisted HEOR research. Future work will focus on extensive testing and validation to support broader adoption and refinement.</description>

      <title>Inferring fine-grained migration patterns across the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-grained migration data illuminate important demographic, environmental, and health phenomena. However, migration datasets within the United States remain lacking: publicly available Census data are neither spatially nor temporally granular, and proprietary data have higher resolution but demographic and other biases. To address these limitations, we develop a scalable iterative-proportional-fitting based method that reconciles high-resolution but biased proprietary data with low-resolution but more reliable Census data. We apply this method to produce MIGRATE, a dataset of annual migration matrices from 2010 - 2019 that captures flows between 47.4 billion pairs of Census Block Groups -- about four thousand times more granular than publicly available data. These estimates are highly correlated with external ground-truth datasets, and improve accuracy and reduce bias relative to raw proprietary data. We use MIGRATE to analyze both national and local migration patterns. Nationally, we document temporal and demographic variation in homophily, upward mobility, and moving distance: for example, we find that people are increasingly likely to move to top-income-quartile CBGs and identify racial disparities in upward mobility. We also show that MIGRATE can illuminate important local migration patterns, including out-migration in response to California wildfires, that are invisible in coarser previous datasets. We publicly release MIGRATE to provide a resource for migration research in the social, environmental, and health sciences.</description>

      <title>Enduring Disparities in the Workplace: A Pilot Study in the AI Community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In efforts toward achieving responsible artificial intelligence (AI), fostering a culture of workplace transparency, diversity, and inclusion can breed innovation, trust, and employee contentment. In AI and Machine Learning (ML), such environments correlate with higher standards of responsible development. Without transparency, disparities, microaggressions and misconduct will remain unaddressed, undermining the very structural inequities responsible AI aims to mitigate. While prior work investigates workplace transparency and disparities in broad domains (e.g. science and technology, law) for specific demographic subgroups, it lacks in-depth and intersectional conclusions and a focus on the AI/ML community. To address this, we conducted a pilot survey of 1260 AI/ML professionals both in industry and academia across different axes, probing aspects such as belonging, performance, workplace Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, accessibility, performance and compensation, microaggressions, misconduct, growth, and well-being. Results indicate enduring disparities in workplace experiences for underrepresented and/or marginalized subgroups. In particular, we highlight that accessibility remains an important challenge for a positive work environment and that disabled employees have a worse workplace experience than their non-disabled colleagues. We further surface disparities for intersectional groups and discuss how the implementation of DEI initiatives may differ from their perceived impact on the workplace. This study is a first step towards increasing transparency and informing AI/ML practitioners and organizations with empirical results. We aim to foster equitable decision-making in the design and evaluation of organizational policies and provide data that may empower professionals to make more informed choices of prospective workplaces.</description>

      <title>A semantic embedding space based on large language models for modelling human beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beliefs form the foundation of human cognition and decision-making, guiding our actions and social connections. A model encapsulating beliefs and their interrelationships is crucial for understanding their influence on our actions. However, research on belief interplay has often been limited to beliefs related to specific issues and relied heavily on surveys. We propose a method to study the nuanced interplay between thousands of beliefs by leveraging an online user debate data and mapping beliefs onto a neural embedding space constructed using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM). This belief space captures the interconnectedness and polarization of diverse beliefs across social issues. Our findings show that positions within this belief space predict new beliefs of individuals and estimate cognitive dissonance based on the distance between existing and new beliefs. This study demonstrates how LLMs, combined with collective online records of human beliefs, can offer insights into the fundamental principles that govern human belief formation.</description>

      <title>DiMA: An LLM-Powered Ride-Hailing Assistant at DiDi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-demand ride-hailing services like DiDi, Uber, and Lyft have transformed urban transportation, offering unmatched convenience and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce DiMA, an LLM-powered ride-hailing assistant deployed in DiDi Chuxing. Its goal is to provide seamless ride-hailing services and beyond through a natural and efficient conversational interface under dynamic and complex spatiotemporal urban contexts. To achieve this, we propose a spatiotemporal-aware order planning module that leverages external tools for precise spatiotemporal reasoning and progressive order planning. Additionally, we develop a cost-effective dialogue system that integrates multi-type dialog repliers with cost-aware LLM configurations to handle diverse conversation goals and trade-off response quality and latency. Furthermore, we introduce a continual fine-tuning scheme that utilizes real-world interactions and simulated dialogues to align the assistant's behavior with human preferred decision-making processes. Since its deployment in the DiDi application, DiMA has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 93% accuracy in order planning and 92% in response generation during real-world interactions. Offline experiments further validate DiMA capabilities, showing improvements of up to 70.23% in order planning and 321.27% in response generation compared to three state-of-the-art agent frameworks, while reducing latency by $0.72\times$ to $5.47\times$. These results establish DiMA as an effective, efficient, and intelligent mobile assistant for ride-hailing services.</description>

      <title>The Coming Crisis of Multi-Agent Misalignment: AI Alignment Must Be a Dynamic and Social Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This position paper states that AI Alignment in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) should be considered a dynamic and interaction-dependent process that heavily depends on the social environment where agents are deployed, either collaborative, cooperative, or competitive. While AI alignment with human values and preferences remains a core challenge, the growing prevalence of MAS in real-world applications introduces a new dynamic that reshapes how agents pursue goals and interact to accomplish various tasks. As agents engage with one another, they must coordinate to accomplish both individual and collective goals. However, this complex social organization may unintentionally misalign some or all of these agents with human values or user preferences. Drawing on social sciences, we analyze how social structure can deter or shatter group and individual values. Based on these analyses, we call on the AI community to treat human, preferential, and objective alignment as an interdependent concept, rather than isolated problems. Finally, we emphasize the urgent need for simulation environments, benchmarks, and evaluation frameworks that allow researchers to assess alignment in these interactive multi-agent contexts before such dynamics grow too complex to control.</description>

      <title>Not All Jokes Land: Evaluating Large Language Models Understanding of Workplace Humor</title>

Abstract: With the recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), the automation of daily tasks, like automatic writing, is getting more and more attention. Hence, efforts have focused on aligning LLMs with human values, yet humor, particularly professional industrial humor used in workplaces, has been largely neglected. To address this, we develop a dataset of professional humor statements along with features that determine the appropriateness of each statement. Our evaluation of five LLMs shows that LLMs often struggle to judge the appropriateness of humor accurately.</description>

      <title>Assessing Intersectional Bias in Representations of Pre-Trained Image Recognition Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning models have achieved remarkable success. Training them is often accelerated by building on top of pre-trained models which poses the risk of perpetuating encoded biases. Here, we investigate biases in the representations of commonly used ImageNet classifiers for facial images while considering intersections of sensitive variables age, race and gender. To assess the biases, we use linear classifier probes and visualize activations as topographic maps. We find that representations in ImageNet classifiers particularly allow differentiation between ages. Less strongly pronounced, the models appear to associate certain ethnicities and distinguish genders in middle-aged groups.</description>

      <title>User Altruism in Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Users of social media platforms based on recommendation systems (RecSys) (e.g. TikTok, X, YouTube) strategically interact with platform content to influence future recommendations. On some such platforms, users have been documented to form large-scale grassroots movements encouraging others to purposefully interact with algorithmically suppressed content in order to "boost" its recommendation; we term this behavior user altruism. To capture this behavior, we study a game between users and a RecSys, where users provide the RecSys (potentially manipulated) preferences over the contents available to them, and the RecSys -- limited by data and computation constraints -- creates a low-rank approximation preference matrix, and ultimately provides each user her (approximately) most-preferred item. We compare the users' social welfare under truthful preference reporting and under a class of strategies capturing user altruism. In our theoretical analysis, we provide sufficient conditions to ensure strict increases in user social welfare under user altruism, and provide an algorithm to find an effective altruistic strategy. Interestingly, we show that for commonly assumed recommender utility functions, effectively altruistic strategies also improve the utility of the RecSys! We show that our results are robust to several model misspecifications, thus strengthening our conclusions. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by empirical results of effective altruistic strategies on the GoodReads dataset, and an online survey on how real-world users behave altruistically in RecSys. Overall, our findings serve as a proof-of-concept of the reasons why traditional RecSys may incentivize users to form collectives and/or follow altruistic strategies when interacting with them.</description>
