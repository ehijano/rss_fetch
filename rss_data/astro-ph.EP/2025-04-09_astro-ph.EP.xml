      <title>A Particle-based Approach to Dust Dynamics in External Photoevaporative Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet-forming discs in sufficiently strong UV environments lose gas in external photoevaporative winds. Dust can also be entrained within these winds, which has consequences for the possible solids reservoir for planet formation, and determines the shielding of the disc by the wind. This has previously been studied in 1D models, with predictions for the maximum entrained size, as well as a predicted population of stalled dust of decreasing grain size with distance from the disc. We wrote and tested a new dust particle solver to make the first study of the entrainment and dynamics of dust, using steady state solutions of state-of-the-art 1D and 2D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of externally photoevaporating discs. In our 1D models, we only consider the outer disc at the midplane, verifying previous studies. In our 2D simulations, the wind is launched from the disc surface, as well as the disc edge. In 2D we find that the maximum entrained grain size varies substantially with angle relative to the plane of the disc, from $\sim100$$\mu$m near the disc outer edge down to $\sim1$$\mu$m or even sub-micron in the weaker wind from the disc surface. The gradient of stalled dust seen in 1D also only appears near the disc outer edge in 2D, but not from the disc surface. This agrees qualitatively with observations of silhouette discs in the Orion Nebula Cluster. Despite the spatial variation of the dust, the extinction of the UV radiation remains fairly uniform due to the opacity being dominated by the small grains, and depends more on the dust distribution within the disc itself.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Wavelength Study of the Dynamic Environment surrounding the FUor V960 Mon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of young stars and planet-forming environments is intrinsically linked to their nascent surroundings. This is particularly evident for FU Orionis (FUor) objects$-$a class of young protostars known for dramatic outbursts resulting in significant increases in brightness. We present a case study of V960 Mon, an FUor that has recently been found to show signs of a fragmenting spiral arm, potentially connected to planet formation. Our study explores the large-scale environment ($10^3-10^4$ au) and incorporates ALMA band 3, band 4 and band 6 continuum data, molecular emissions from $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, SiO, DCO$^+$, N$_2$D$^+$ and DCN, alongside optical and near-infrared observations from VLT/MUSE and VLT/SPHERE. We map a region of 20" across where we find tantalizing emissions that provide a unique view of a young group of protostars, including the discovery of a class-0 protostar to the east of the FUor. The $^{12}$CO and SiO tracers suggest that this object is at the base of an outflow, potentially impacting the surrounding medium. The MUSE and SPHERE observations indicate the presence of an elongated feature towards a prominent source to the southeast that may represent interaction between V960 Mon and its surrounding. Moreover, the C$^{18}$O emission overlaps with the clumps of the detected fragmenting spiral arm. These findings provide the strongest evidence to date for a connection between infalling material, fragmentation, and the intensity outburst of a protostar. Our case study highlights the complex interactions between young stars and their surroundings that drive the evolution of the planet forming environment.</description>

      <title>A targeted search for Planet Nine in the CNEOS14 field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hypothesized Planet Nine is thought to reside in the distant outer solar system, potentially explaining various anomalies in the orbits of extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs). In this work, we present a targeted observational search for Planet Nine, motivated by a possible gravitational interaction with the interstellar meteoroid responsible for the CNEOS14 bolide. Our observations span two campaigns over 2022 and 2023, covering a 98-square-degree region where Planet Nine's position is most likely if the messenger hypothesis holds. Our data and search methodology, based on the detection of parallax position shifts between consecutive nights, provide 85% confidence exclusion limits for objects with Sloan r-band magnitudes brighter than between 21.0 and 21.4, with an average sensitivity limit of 21.3. No credible Planet Nine candidates were identified within this field and magnitude limits. A caveat to our approach is that it would miss a candidate if its position were affected by scattered light from bright stars in at least one of the nights. However, we estimate that the probability for this is very low, around 0.4%. We discuss several possible reasons for our Planet Nine non-detection. Our study complements prior searches, particularly those using archival survey data that are limited in the Galactic plane or at fainter brightness limits. While our consecutive-night observation approach offers high sensitivity to minimal motion, extending the search for Planet Nine to fainter magnitudes (which may be crucial, according to recent predictions), will require higher sensitivity instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Investigating the eccentricity distribution of transiting, long-period giant planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eccentric giant planets are predicted to have acquired their eccentricity through two major mechanisms: the Kozai-Lidov effect or planet-planet scattering, but it is normally difficult to separate the two mechanisms and determine the true eccentricity origin for a given system. In this work, we focus on a sample of 92 transiting, long-period giant planets (TLGs) as part of an eccentricity distribution study for this planet population in order to understand their eccentricity origin. Using archival high-contrast imaging observations, public stellar catalogs, precise Gaia astrometry, and the NASA Exoplanet Archive database, we explored the eccentricity distribution correlation with different planet and host-star properties of our sample. We also homogeneously characterized the basic stellar properties for all 86 host-stars in our sample, including stellar age and metallicity. We found a correlation between eccentricity and stellar metallicity, where lower-metallicity stars ([Fe/H] &lt;= 0.1) did not host any planets beyond e &gt; 0.4, while higher-metallicity stars hosted planets across the entire eccentricity range. Interestingly, we found no correlation between the eccentricity distribution and the presence of stellar companions, indicating that planet-planet scattering is likely a more dominant mechanism than the Kozai-Lidov effect for TLGs. This is further supported by an anti-correlation trend found between planet multiplicity and eccentricity, as well as a lack of strong tidal dissipation effects for planets in our sample, which favor planet-planet scattering scenarios for the eccentricity origin.</description>

      <title>Oligarchic growth of protoplanets in planetesimal rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard planet formation scenario, planetesimals are assumed to form throughout the protoplanetary disk and to be smoothly distributed in the radial direction except for the snowline. Planetesimal growth has been investigated using this assumption, and the oligarchic growth model is widely accepted. However, recent simulations of gas and dust evolution have shown that planetesimals form only in radially limited locations -- such as at gas pressure bumps and snowlines -- and are concentrated in ring-like regions. When planetesimals are distributed in a ring-like region, scattered ones leak from the ring edge, resulting in planetesimal diffusion. To investigate protoplanet growth in expanding planetesimal rings, we perform a series of $\textit{ N}$-body simulations. In all the simulations, protoplanet growth is well explained by oligarchic growth, while the ring width expands due to planetesimal scattering by the protoplanets. Massive protoplanets tend to form near the ring center, and protoplanets that form far from the ring center are less massive than those in the center. The scaled orbital separations depend on neither the initial ring width nor on the total mass, and they are consistent with estimates based on the oligarchic growth model and the diffused planetesimal distribution. The width of the expanded planetesimal ring does not depend on its initial width, but it does depend on its total mass. The maximum mass of protoplanets depends strongly on the total ring mass and weakly on its initial width.</description>

      <title>Strong Evidence That Abiogenesis Is a Rapid Process on Earth Analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early start to life naively suggests that abiogenesis is a rapid process on Earth-like planets. However, if evolution typically takes ~4Gyr to produce intelligent life-forms like us, then the limited lifespan of Earth's biosphere (~5-6Gyr) necessitates an early (and possibly highly atypical) start to our emergence - an example of the weak anthropic principle. Our previously proposed objective Bayesian analysis of Earth's chronology culminated in a formula for the minimum odds ratio between the fast and slow abiogenesis scenarios (relative to Earth's lifespan). Timing from microfossils (3.7Gya) yields 3:1 odds in favor of rapid abiogenesis, whereas evidence from carbon isotopes (4.1Gya) gives 9:1, both below the canonical threshold of "strong evidence" (10:1). However, the recent result of a 4.2Gya LUCA pushes the odds over the threshold for the first time (nominally 13:1). In fact, the odds ratio is &gt;10:1 for all possible values of the biosphere's ultimate lifespan and speculative hypotheses of ancient civilizations. For the first time, we have formally strong evidence that favors the hypothesis that life rapidly emerges in Earth-like conditions (although such environments may themselves be rare).</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Signatures of Warps in Edge-on Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks observed edge-on commonly show asymmetries that can be caused by shadows cast from a warp. With the growing amount of these observations, methods to constrain warp parameters are urgently needed. In this work, we investigate observational signatures of warps in edge-on disks with the aim to find limits on the observability of warps. We perform radiative transfer simulations in scattered light (near-/mid-infrared) of edge-on disks containing warps of different amplitudes and varying sizes of the misaligned inner region. We analyze the effect of these parameters at 0.8 micron, but also compare models for specific parameters at wavelengths up to 21 micron. In all models, we quantify the apparent asymmetry. We find that under optimal conditions, an asymmetry due to slight warps can be visible. The visibility depends on the viewing angle, as warped disks are not axisymmetric. For optimal azimuthal orientation, misalignments between inner and outer disk regimes as low as 2{\deg} can lead to significant asymmetries. On the other hand, we find that larger misalignments of about 10{\deg} are needed in order to observe a change in the brightest nebula as a function of wavelength, which is observed in a few protoplanetary disks. In order to link our results to observations, we investigate potential misalignments between the inner and outer disk of edge-on systems showing asymmetries. We compare the jet geometry, which traces the inner region of the disk, to the outer disk orientation and find that a misalignment of a few degrees could be present, such that warped disks could explain the apparent lateral asymmetries. There are many factors that can influence the appearance of the shadows and asymmetries in warped disks. Although it is still challenging to infer exact warp parameters from observations, this work presents a promising step toward better constraints.</description>

      <title>The UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) Large Director's Discretionary Program with Hubble. I. Goals, Design, and Initial Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Specifically selected to leverage the unique ultraviolet capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope, the Hubble Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) is a Director's Discretionary program of approximately 1000 orbits - the largest ever executed - that produced a UV spectroscopic library of O and B stars in nearby low metallicity galaxies and accreting low mass stars in the Milky Way. Observations from ULLYSES combined with archival spectra uniformly sample the fundamental astrophysical parameter space for each mass regime, including spectral type, luminosity class, and metallicity for massive stars, and the mass, age, and disk accretion rate for low-mass stars. The ULLYSES spectral library of massive stars will be critical to characterize how massive stars evolve at different metallicities; to advance our understanding of the production of ionizing photons, and thus of galaxy evolution and the re-ionization of the Universe; and to provide the templates necessary for the synthesis of integrated stellar populations. The massive star spectra are also transforming our understanding of the interstellar and circumgalactic media of low metallicity galaxies. On the low-mass end, UV spectra of T Tauri stars contain a plethora of diagnostics of accretion, winds, and the warm disk surface. These diagnostics are crucial for evaluating disk evolution and provide important input to assess atmospheric escape of planets and to interpret powerful probes of disk chemistry, as observed with ALMA and JWST. In this paper we motivate the design of the program, describe the observing strategy and target selection, and present initial results.</description>

      <title>A deep search for Complex Organic Molecules toward the protoplanetary disk of V883 Ori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in the form of prebiotic molecules are potentially building blocks of life. Using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 7 observations in spectral scanning mode, we carried out a deep search for COMs within the disk of V883 Ori, covering frequency ranges of $\sim$ 348 - 366 GHz. V883 Ori is an FUor object currently undergoing an accretion burst, which increases its luminosity and consequently increases the temperature of the surrounding protoplanetary disk, facilitating the detection of COMs in the gas phase. We identified 26 molecules, including 14 COMs and 12 other molecules, with first detection in this source of the molecules: CH3OD, H2C17O, and H213CO. We searched for multiple nitrogen-bearing COMs, as CH3CN had been the only nitrogen-bearing COM that has been identified so far in this source. We also detected CH3CN, and tentatively detect CH3CH2CN, CH2CHCN, CH3OCN, CH3NCO, and NH2CHO. We compared the abundances relative to CH3OH with those in the handful of objects with previous detections of these species: the Class 0 protostars IRAS 16293-2422 A, IRAS 16293-2422 B and B1-c, the high-mass star-forming region Sagittarius B2 (North), the Solar System comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and the protoplanetary disk of Oph-IRS 48. We report $\sim$ 1 to 3 orders of magnitude higher abundances compared to Class 0 protostars and $\sim$ 1 to 3 orders of magnitude lower abundances compared to the protoplanetary disk, Sagittarius B2 (North), and 67P/C-G. These results indicate that the protoplanetary disk phase could contribute to build up of COMs.</description>

      <title>Using Machine Learning for Lunar Mineralogy-I: Hyperspectral Imaging of Volcanic Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the mineral composition of volcanic samples similar to lunar materials, focusing on olivine and pyroxene. Using hyperspectral imaging from 400 to 1000 nm, we created data cubes to analyze the reflectance characteristics of samples from samples from Vulcano, a volcanically active island in the Aeolian Archipelago, north of Sicily, Italy, categorizing them into nine regions of interest and analyzing spectral data for each. We applied various unsupervised clustering algorithms, including K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, GMM, and Spectral Clustering, to classify the spectral profiles. Principal Component Analysis revealed distinct spectral signatures associated with specific minerals, facilitating precise identification. Clustering performance varied by region, with K-Means achieving the highest silhouette-score of 0.47, whereas GMM performed poorly with a score of only 0.25. Non-negative Matrix Factorization aided in identifying similarities among clusters across different methods and reference spectra for olivine and pyroxene. Hierarchical clustering emerged as the most reliable technique, achieving a 94\% similarity with the olivine spectrum in one sample, whereas GMM exhibited notable variability. Overall, the analysis indicated that both Hierarchical and K-Means methods yielded lower errors in total measurements, with K-Means demonstrating superior performance in estimated dispersion and clustering. Additionally, GMM showed a higher root mean square error compared to the other models. The RMSE analysis confirmed K-Means as the most consistent algorithm across all samples, suggesting a predominance of olivine in the Vulcano region relative to pyroxene. This predominance is likely linked to historical formation conditions similar to volcanic processes on the Moon, where olivine-rich compositions are common in ancient lava flows and impact melt rocks.</description>

      <title>The Two-component Model of the 'spokes' in Saturn's Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spokes observed in Saturn's rings have been a subject of scientific debate since their discovery by Stephen J. O'Meara in the 1970s and their confirmation by the Voyager flybys in the early 1980s (Smith et al., 1982). While the Cassini spacecraft confirmed that the spokes are linked to Saturn's magnetosphere, their exact formation mechanism remains uncertain. This paper proposes that the spokes in Saturn's rings consist of two distinct components: (1) carbonaceous materials, namely pyrolytic carbon with diamagnetic properties and potentially other various forms of carbon-bearing compounds, which persist over longer timescales, and (2) rapidly forming and dissipating diamagnetic ice grains, which interact with Saturn's magnetosphere on much shorter timescales. We suggest that the spokes consist of diamagnetic pyrolytic carbon that has coated silicates through the process of high-temperature Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) during the formation of Saturn's protoplanetary disk. Additionally, the spokes consist of diamagnetic ice particles that can disappear within minutes to hours due to sublimation. The photoelectric effect causes the pyrolytic carbon grains to lose electrons, thus becoming paramagnetic, which results in their attraction back to the main B ring structure. We suggest that Saturn's rings are charged by the solar wind, generating a magnetic field that emanates orthogonally above and below the B ring plane due to the movement of charged particles in the rings. Statistical analysis of Cassini data reveals significant correlations between spoke activity and both Saturn's magnetospheric rotation and solar elevation angle, providing strong support for an electromagnetic mechanism in spoke formation. This hypothesis suggests that the visibility of the spokes is dictated by illumination conditions and electromagnetic effects.</description>

Abstract: Future telescopes will characterize rocky exoplanets in reflected light, revealing their albedo, which depends on surface, cloud, and atmospheric properties. Identifying these features is crucial for assessing habitability. We present reference spectra and phase curves for an unresolved Earth-like exoplanet in reflected and polarized light, showing how phase- and wavelength-dependent reflectance reveals key planetary properties. Using the 3D radiative transfer code MYSTIC, we enhance surface and cloud modeling with validated, wavelength-dependent albedo maps of Earth's seasonal and spectral features, alongside a novel treatment of sub-grid cloud variability using ERA5 reanalysis data. Our models, incorporating high-resolution 3D cloud structures, show that sub-grid cloud variability reduces total reflectance and increases phase curve variability, especially at large phase angles where ocean glint dominates. We also find that neglecting wavelength-dependent albedo maps overestimates the vegetation red edge in spectra. Comparing an Ocean planet to an Earth-like planet with seasonal cloud variability, we show that polarization is more sensitive than intensity alone in distinguishing both cases. Moreover, polarization captures richer surface details, making it a crucial tool for resolving retrieval degeneracies. Our simulations serve as a reference for observing Earth as an exoplanet and provide benchmarks for optimizing observational strategies and retrieval frameworks for future telescopes targeting small, rocky exoplanets.</description>

      <title>The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs. Occurrence rates of Earth-like planets around very low-mass stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims: Previous estimates of planet occurrence rates in the CARMENES survey indicated increased numbers of planets on short orbits for M dwarfs with masses below 0.34\,M$_\odot$. Here we focused on the lowest-mass stars in the survey, comprising 15 inactive targets with masses under 0.16\,M$_\odot$.
  Methods: To correct for detection biases, we determined detection sensitivity maps for individual targets and the entire sample. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimated planet occurrence rates for orbital periods of 1\,d to 100\,d and minimum masses from 0.5\,M$_\oplus$ to 10\,M$_\oplus$.
  Results: The radial velocity (RV) data from CARMENES reveal four new planets around three stars in our sample, namely G~268--110\,b, G~261--6\,b, and G~192--15\,b and c. All three b planets have minimum masses of 1.03--1.52\,M$_\oplus$ and orbital periods of 1.43--5.45\,d, while G~192--15\,c is a 14.3\,M$_\oplus$ planet on a wide, eccentric orbit with $P \approx 1218$\,d and $e \approx 0.68$.
  Our occurrence rates suggest considerable dependencies with respect to stellar masses. For planets below 3\,M$_\oplus$ we found rates consistent with one planet per star across all investigated periods, but the rates decrease almost by an order of magnitude for larger planet masses up to 10\,M$_\oplus$. Compared to previous studies,
  low-mass stars tend to harbor more planets with $P &lt;10$\,d. We also demonstrate that synthetic planet populations based on the standard core accretion scenario predict slightly more massive planets on wider orbits than observed.
  Conclusions: Our findings confirm that planet occurrence rates vary with stellar masses even among M dwarfs, as we found more planets with lower masses and on shorter orbits in our subsample of very low-mass stars compared to more massive M dwarfs. Therefore, we emphasize the need for additional differentiation in future studies.</description>

      <title>REMIX SPH -- improving mixing in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations using a generalised, material-independent approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present REMIX, a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme designed to alleviate effects that typically suppress mixing and instability growth at density discontinuities in SPH simulations. We approach this problem by directly targeting sources of kernel smoothing error and discretisation error, resulting in a generalised, material-independent formulation that improves the treatment both of discontinuities within a single material, for example in an ideal gas, and of interfaces between dissimilar materials. This approach also leads to improvements in capturing wider hydrodynamic behaviour unrelated to mixing. We demonstrate marked improvements in three-dimensional test scenarios, focusing on cases with particles of equal mass across the simulation. This choice is particularly relevant for use cases in astrophysics and engineering -- specifically those in which particles are free to evolve over a large range of density scales -- where bespoke choices of unequal particle masses in the initial conditions cannot easily be used to address emergent and evolving density discontinuities. We achieve these improvements while maintaining sharp discontinuities; without introducing additional equation of state dependence in, for example, particle volume elements; and without contrived or targeted corrections. Our methods build upon a fully compressible and thermodynamically consistent core-SPH construction, retaining Galilean invariance as well as conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. REMIX is integrated in the open-source, state-of-the-art SWIFT code and is designed with computational efficiency also in mind, meaning that its improved hydrodynamic treatment can be used for high-resolution simulations without prohibitive cost to run-speed.</description>

      <title>Ball Lightning as a profound manifestation of the Dark Matter physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02653</link>

Abstract: Ball lighting (BL) has been observed for centuries. There are large number of books, review articles, and original scientific papers devoted to different aspects of BL phenomenon. Yet, the basic features of this phenomenon have never been explained by known physics. The main problem is the source which could power the dynamics of the BL. We advocate an idea that the dark matter (DM) in form of the axion quark nuggets (AQN) made of standard model quarks and gluons (similar to the old idea of the Witten's strangelets) could internally generate the required power. The AQN model was invented long ago without any relation to the BL physics. It was invented with a single motivation to explain the observed similarity $\Omega_{\rm DM}\sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$ between visible and DM components. This relation represents a very generic feature of this framework, not sensitive to any parameters of the construction. However, with the same set of parameters being fixed long ago this model is capable to address the key elements of the BL phenomenology, including the source of the energy powering the BL events.
  In particular, we argue that the visible size of BL, its typical life time, the frequency of appearance, etc are all consistent with suggested proposal when BL represents a profound manifestation of the DM physics represented by the AQN objects. We also argue that some of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) might be closely related to BL events, and therefore also represent profound manifestations of the DM physics within AQN framework. We also formulate a number of specific possible tests which can refute or unambiguously substantiate this unorthodox proposal on nature of BL and UAP.</description>

      <title>Dust in the wind of outbursting young stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) are observed to undergo powerful accretion events known as FU Orionis outbursts (FUors). Such events of episodic accretion are now considered to be common during low mass star formation, wherein the accretion onto the protostar occurs through a surrounding centrifugal disk. Increasing evidence suggests that the magnetic disk winds are crucial for driving disk accretion, as they carry both mass and momentum away from the disk. Aims. We aim to investigate the phenomenon of the ejection of magnetic disk winds during episodic accretion, with a focus on the dust contained within these winds. Methods. We conduct magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of formation and evolution of protoplanetary disk (PPD) in the thin-disk limit. We include evolution of dust with two populations and a realistic prescription for viscosity during outbursts, which depends on the local thermal ionization fraction. The disk evolves with the concurrent action of viscosity, self-gravity and magnetic disk winds. Results. The simulated disk displays outbursting behavior in the early stages, with the duration and frequency of the bursts, their rise times, and brightness amplitudes resembling the observations of FUors. We find that during the outbursts, the winds are over an order of magnitude more dusty, as compared to in quiescence. However, despite this increased dust content, the winds are still dust-depleted as the dust-to-gas ratio is about an order of magnitude lower than the canonical interstellar value of 0.01. The results of our numerical experiments are in general agreement with the available observational findings and they shed a light on the mechanism behind production of dusty winds during outbursting events in YSOs.</description>
