      <title>Electron Hydrodynamics in Graphene : Experimental and Theoretical Status</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work comprehensively reviews electron hydrodynamics in graphene, highlighting both experimental observations and theoretical developments. Key experimental signatures such as negative vicinity resistance, Poiseuille flow, and significant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law have been discussed, with special emphasis on Lorenz ratio measurements. In the theoretical direction, recent efforts have focused on developing hydrodynamic frameworks for calculating the thermodynamic and transport coefficients of electrons in graphene. The present work has briefly addressed the theoretical framework adopted by our group.</description>

      <title>Isoscalar Giant Resonances in Highly-Deformed $^{172}$Yb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To study the isoscalar giant resonances in a deformed case, background-free $\alpha$-particle inelastic scattering measurements using a 386 MeV $\alpha$ beam were performed on the highly-deformed $^{172}$Yb nucleus using the Grand Raiden spectrometer at the Research Center for Nuclear Physics (RCNP) at very forward angles, including $0^\circ$. The strength distributions for the isoscalar giant resonances up to $L \leq 3$ were obtained using multipole decomposition analysis. The isoscalar giant monopole resonance (ISGMR) strength exhibits a splitting into two components, interpreted as the coupling of the ISGMR with the $K=0$ component of the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance (ISGQR). A \textit{bimodal} structure is observed in the strength distribution of the isoscalar giant dipole resonance. The ISGQR strength shows an enhancement near 25 MeV, attributed to the excitation of an overtone mode, while the broadening of the main-tone peak is associated with nuclear deformation. The experimental results are well reproduced by theoretical strength distributions calculated using the quasiparticle finite amplitude method for $L \leq 3$.</description>

      <title>Formulation of Relativistic Dissipative Spin Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary objective of this thesis is to develop a consistent theoretical framework of dissipative hydrodynamics for a relativistic fluid with spin - hereafter referred to as relativistic dissipative spin hydrodynamics. In this framework, the dynamical description of a relativistic fluid requires a new macroscopic variable, the spin density, which is associated with a spin tensor. This tensor, defined as the expectation value of a rank-3 tensor operator in quantum field theory, contributes to the system's total angular momentum. The need for such a theory is motivated by recent measurements of spin polarization of hadrons produced in non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
  Two distinct formulation methods are employed. The first is grounded in covariant thermodynamics and extends the conventional Navier-Stokes and M\"uller-Israel-Stewart theories of relativistic hydrodynamics by incorporating a spin tensor. The second is based on principles of relativistic quantum statistical mechanics, building upon and generalizing the foundational Zubarev approach. Both formulations aim to construct a closed system of evolution equations for the macroscopic variables and, via an entropy-current analysis, to identify the dissipative currents and their associated transport coefficients.
  These two approaches provide different perspectives for future applications focused on spin polarization measurements. Beyond its phenomenological relevance, the theory also opens several avenues for further theoretical developments. These include the verification of the thermodynamic relations employed in the first formulation method using microscopic frameworks, as well as a deeper understanding of the emerging transport coefficients - particularly those associated with the spin tensor - through microscopic modeling or data-driven parameter extraction.</description>

      <title>Universal relations between the quasinormal modes of neutron stars and magnetic tidal deformability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal deformabilities are one of the observable quantities characterizing neutron stars, which are strongly associated with the stellar compactness, the ratio of the stellar mass to the radius. In addition to the tidal deformability, the quasinormal modes excited in a neutron star are also an important property for extracting information about the neutron star interior, adopting gravitational wave asteroseismology. In this study, we especially focus on the magnetic tidal deformability, which acts on the gravitational waveform from a neutron star binary merger as a higher-order effect than the electric tidal deformability, and derive the universal relations expressing the quasinormal modes, such as the fundamental ($f$-), 1st pressure ($p_1$-), and 1st spacetime ($w_1$-) modes, as a function of the magnetic tidal deformability. The universal relations derived in this study exhibit accuracy more or less comparable to those of the electric tidal deformability.</description>

      <title>Study of SIDIS Unpolarized Cross Sections from a $^3$He Target with the Solenoidal Large Intensity Device at JLab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a detailed impact study of semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering unpolarized cross sections' measurements using the proposed SoLID apparatus at Jefferson Lab. This type of data, collected at large Bjorken $x_{bj}$, moderate values of $Q^2$ and small values of the transverse momentum of produced hadrons, $P_{hT}$, allows to study transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton distribution and fragmentation functions in a still poorly explored region. We present the projected results for charged light mesons based on simulated data. For the azimuthal-angle integrated cross sections we adopt the TMD framework up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (N3LL) accuracy, while a simpler TMD parton model is employed for the study of azimuthal angular dependencies.</description>

      <title>Electron spectral shape of the third-forbidden $\beta$-decay of $^{87}$Rb measured using a Rb$_2$ZrCl$_6$ crystal scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, interest in experimental studies of $\beta$-decay electron spectra -- often referred to as $\beta$ spectra -- has been growing. This is particularly true for $\beta$ transitions where the electron spectra are sensitive to the effective value of the weak axial coupling, $g_{\rm A}$. Such measurements serve as important benchmarks for nuclear physics calculations and can also be used to characterize background in astroparticle physics experiments. In this work, a dedicated experiment has been carried out to investigate the spectral shape of the third-forbidden $^{87}$Rb $\beta$-decays, with the goal of estimating the effective $g_{\rm A}$ value for this transition and of deriving the T$_{1/2}$ value. This was done by comparing the experimental spectral shape with the estimates from various phenomenological models. The $^{87}$Rb source was embedded directly within the detector material of a new Rb$_2$ZrCl$_6$ crystal scintillator; the data taking was performed deep underground at Gran Sasso National Laboratory. The obtained experimental half-life value for the studied process is T$_{1/2} = 5.08(13) \times$ 10$^{10}$ yr; while a $g_{\rm A}$ value in the range 0.4 to 0.6 is obtained when accounting for uncertainties and depending on the model adopted as discussed in detail in the text.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement between partons in a strongly coupled quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a first-principles, non-perturbative investigation of quantum entanglement between partonic constituents in a strongly coupled 3+1-dimensional scalar Yukawa theory, using light-front Hamiltonian methods with controlled Fock-space truncations. By explicitly constructing reduced density matrices for (mock) nucleon, pion, and anti-nucleon subsystems from light-front wave functions, we compute key entanglement witnesses, including von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and linear entropy, in both quenched (no sea pairs) and unquenched frameworks. We find that the entanglement entropy is closely related to the Shannon entropy of the transverse momentum dependent distribution, establishing a link between quantum information and parton structure. In contrast, the unquenched theory reveals genuinely non-classical correlations: the entanglement entropy cannot be reduced to any Shannon entropy of normalized parton distributions, demonstrating that the full hadronic wave function encodes quantum information beyond classical probabilities. Our findings highlight the role of entanglement as a fundamental probe of non-perturbative dynamics in relativistic quantum field theory and lay the groundwork for extending these concepts to QCD and future collider phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In relativistic field theories, the mass spectrum is given by the difference between the energy of the vacuum and the excited states. Near the continuum limit, the cancellation between these two values leads to loss of precision. We propose a method to extract the mass gap directly using quantum computers and apply it to a particular version of the nonlinear $\sigma$-model with the correct continuum limit and perform calculations in quantum hardware (at strong coupling) and simulation in classical computers (at weak coupling).</description>

      <title>Relativistic orbital-free kinetic energy density functional for one-particle nuclear systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter aims to derive the exact relativistic orbital-free kinetic energy density functional for one-particle nuclear systems in one-dimensional case. The kinetic energy is expressed as a functional of both vector and scalar densities. The functional derivatives of the kinetic energy density functional are also derived. Both the kinetic energy density functional and its functional derivatives are validated to be correct. This serves as a foundation for further exploration of more general relativistic orbital-free kinetic energy density functionals.</description>

      <title>Properties of hyperons in nuclear matter from chiral hyperon-nucleon interactions at next-to-next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma$ single-particle potentials in infinite nuclear matter are analyzed within a recently established chiral hyperon-nucleon ($YN$) interaction up to N$^2$LO in combination with an nucleon-nucleon interaction derived in the same scheme. The self-consistent Brueckner-Hartree-Fock method with the continuous choice of the single-particle potential is employed. It is found that the $\Lambda$ single-particle potential is comparable to the results achieved with the NLO $YN$ interaction from 2019. The resulting $\Sigma$ potential becomes more attractive compared to the previous NLO results due to the constraint from the recent $\Sigma N$ differential cross section data measured in the J-PARC E40 experiment. An estimate of the theoretical uncertainty of the single-particle potentials is provided in terms of the truncation error in the chiral expansion.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a constraint on the speed of sound, $c_s^2$, derived from relativistic kinetic theory and show how it can be expressed in terms of the average sound speed, $\langle c_s^2 \rangle$. This reformulation highlights the interplay between instantaneous and integrated stiffness of the equation of state and allows the kinetic-theory bound to be visualized as a restriction in the $c_s^2$-$\langle c_s^2 \rangle $ plane.</description>

      <title>Reflections on Noether's second theorem and the energy-momentum tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through symmetry of the action under global spacetime translations, Noether's first theorem infamously entails an energy-momentum tensor (EMT) that is neither symmetric nor gauge-invariant. In a prior work [Phys. Rev. D 106, 125012 (2022)], I had obtained a symmetric and gauge-invariant EMT by using Noether's second theorem instead, with local spacetime translations as the symmetry group. However, the derivation therein was flawed, containing a faulty assumption about the transformation rule for spinor fields. In this work, I revisit the derivation of [Phys. Rev. D 106, 125012 (2022)], both correcting the faulty step and simplifying the derivation for broader accessibility. The end result is an EMT for quantum chromodynamics that is gauge-invariant, but not symmetric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: QCD at large densities exhibits a moat regime in the scalar-pseudoscalar sector. The resolution of its dynamics is pivotal for the access to the onset of new phases including the potential critical endpoint of QCD. In this work we present the first selfconsistent analysis of this regime with the functional renormalisation group approach to QCD. We map out the moat regime, including a first analysis of potential inhomogeneous instabilities at baryon chemical potential $\mu_B\gtrsim 600$ MeV on the chiral crossover line.</description>
