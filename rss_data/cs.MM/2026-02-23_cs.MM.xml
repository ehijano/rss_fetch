      <title>MusicSem: A Semantically Rich Language--Audio Dataset of Natural Music Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music representation learning is central to music information retrieval and generation. While recent advances in multimodal learning have improved alignment between text and audio for tasks such as cross-modal music retrieval, text-to-music generation, and music-to-text generation, existing models often struggle to capture users' expressed intent in natural language descriptions of music. This observation suggests that the datasets used to train and evaluate these models do not fully reflect the broader and more natural forms of human discourse through which music is described. In this paper, we introduce MusicSem, a dataset of 32,493 language-audio pairs derived from organic music-related discussions on the social media platform Reddit. Compared to existing datasets, MusicSem captures a broader spectrum of musical semantics, reflecting how listeners naturally describe music in nuanced and human-centered ways. To structure these expressions, we propose a taxonomy of five semantic categories: descriptive, atmospheric, situational, metadata-related, and contextual. In addition to the construction, analysis, and release of MusicSem, we use the dataset to evaluate a wide range of multimodal models for retrieval and generation, highlighting the importance of modeling fine-grained semantics. Overall, MusicSem serves as a novel semantics-aware resource to support future research on human-aligned multimodal music representation learning.</description>

      <title>DesignAsCode: Bridging Structural Editability and Visual Fidelity in Graphic Design Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphic design generation demands a delicate balance between high visual fidelity and fine-grained structural editability. However, existing approaches typically bifurcate into either non-editable raster image synthesis or abstract layout generation devoid of visual content. Recent combinations of these two approaches attempt to bridge this gap but often suffer from rigid composition schemas and unresolvable visual dissonances (e.g., text-background conflicts) due to their inexpressive representation and open-loop nature. To address these challenges, we propose DesignAsCode, a novel framework that reimagines graphic design as a programmatic synthesis task using HTML/CSS. Specifically, we introduce a Plan-Implement-Reflect pipeline, incorporating a Semantic Planner to construct dynamic, variable-depth element hierarchies and a Visual-Aware Reflection mechanism that iteratively optimizes the code to rectify rendering artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DesignAsCode significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both structural validity and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, our code-native representation unlocks advanced capabilities, including automatic layout retargeting, complex document generation (e.g., resumes), and CSS-based animation.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Fine-Grained Knowledge Capabilities of Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made substantial progress across a wide range of visual question answering benchmarks, spanning visual reasoning, document understanding, and multimodal dialogue. These improvements are evident in a wide range of VLMs built on a variety of base models, alignment architectures, and training data. However, recent works show that these models trail behind in traditional image classification benchmarks, which test fine-grained visual knowledge. We test a large number of recent VLMs on fine-grained classification benchmarks and identify potential factors in the disconnect between fine-grained knowledge and other vision benchmarks. Through a series of ablation experiments, we find that using a better LLM improves all benchmark scores equally, while a better vision encoder disproportionately improves fine-grained classification performance. Furthermore, we find that the pretraining stage is also vital to fine-grained performance, particularly when the language model weights are unfrozen during pretraining. These insights pave the way for enhancing fine-grained visual understanding and vision-centric capabilities in VLMs.</description>
