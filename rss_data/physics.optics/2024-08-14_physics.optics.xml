      <title>Transport measurements of majorization order for wave coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the majorization order for comparing wave coherence and reveal its fundamental consequences in transport measurements, including power distribution, absorption, transmission, and reflection. We prove that all these measurements preserve the majorization order under unitary control, enabling direct experimental characterization of the majorization order. Specifically, waves with lower coherence in the majorization order exhibit more restricted ranges of achievable measurement values. Our results deepen the understanding of coherence in transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Open whispering gallery modes resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are some issues with traditional whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators like poor light extraction and a dense mode spectrum. In this paper we introduce a solution to these limitations by proposing open WGM (OWGM) resonators that effectively reduce the mode density and enable directional radiation through a connected waveguide at the expense of some lowering in Q-factor. Numerical simulations of two-dimensional metallic and dielectric disk resonators with holes reveal a significant increase in intermode distance. The study also extends to three-dimensional dielectric OWGM resonators, demonstrating the formation of sparse spectra suitable for photonics applications. Additionally, the design of a cylindrical Bragg microresonator connected to a single-mode fiber via an optimized topology-based connector achieves near-unity transmission and efficient coupling. This approach enhances the development of new photonic devices, addressing the limitations of traditional high Q-factor WGM resonators and offering potential advancements in laser technology and optical communications, where compactness and manufacturability are prioritized over ultra-high Q-factors.</description>

      <title>Si-waveguide-based optical power monitoring of 2$\times$2 Mach$\unicode{x2013}$Zehnder interferometer based on InGaAsP/Si hybrid MOS optical phase shifter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transparent in-line optical power monitoring in Si programmable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) is indispensable for calibrating integrated optical devices such as optical switches and resonators. A Si waveguide (WG) photodetector (PD) based on defect-mediated photodetection is a promising candidate for a transparent in-line optical power monitor owing to its simplicity and ease of integration with a fully complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible process. Here, we propose a simple optical power monitoring scheme for a 2$\times$2 Mach$\unicode{x2013}$Zehnder interferometer (MZI) optical switch based on InGaAsP/Si hybrid MOS optical phase shifters. In the proposed scheme, a low-doped p-type Si WG PD with a response time of microseconds is utilized as a transparent in-line optical power monitor and the ground terminal of the MOS optical phase shifter is shared with that of the Si WG PD to enable the simple monitoring of the output optical power of the MZI. Based on this scheme, we experimentally demonstrate that the output optical power of a 2$\times$2 MZI can be simply monitored by applying a bias voltage to the Si slabs formed at the output WGs of the MZI without excess optical insertion loss.</description>

      <title>Coherence Awareness in Diffractive Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffractive neural networks hold great promise for applications requiring intensive computational processing. Considerable attention has focused on diffractive networks for either spatially coherent or spatially incoherent illumination. Here we illustrate that, as opposed to imaging systems, in diffractive networks the degree of spatial coherence has a dramatic effect. In particular, we show that when the spatial coherence length on the object is comparable to the minimal feature size preserved by the optical system, neither the incoherent nor the coherent extremes serve as acceptable approximations. Importantly, this situation is inherent to many settings involving active illumination, including reflected light microscopy, autonomous vehicles and smartphones. Following this observation, we propose a general framework for training diffractive networks for any specified degree of spatial and temporal coherence, supporting all types of linear and nonlinear layers. Using our method, we numerically optimize networks for image classification, and thoroughly investigate their performance dependence on the illumination coherence properties. We further introduce the concept of coherence-blind networks, which have enhanced resilience to changes in illumination conditions. Our findings serve as a steppingstone toward adopting all-optical neural networks in real-world applications, leveraging nothing but natural light.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond laser written low-loss multiscan waveguides in fused silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report low-loss multiscan waveguides fabricated in fused silica using femtosecond laser writing technology. The multiscan principle allows to tailor the writing regime to excel at key features of any integrated photonic platform: coupling losses and propagation losses. We optimized the writing parameters for different sizes of square-shaped waveguides and reached the mode overlap value with a standard single-mode optical fiber of above 98.8\% and demonstrated very low coupling losses of 0.2 dB/facet on average. Propagation losses in the fabricated waveguides amounted to 0.07 dB/cm. We applied the developed recipe to the fabrication of a fiber-coupled 25-channel interferometer with total insertion losses below 1 dB. The findings of this work are of interest for broad range of applications and in particular for optical information processing and quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Polarization entanglement enabled by orthogonally stacked van der Waals NbOCl2 crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization entanglement holds significant importance for photonic quantum technologies. Recently emerging subwavelength nonlinear quantum light sources, e.g., GaP and LiNbO3 thin films, benefiting from the relaxed phase-matching constraints and volume confinement, has shown intriguing properties, such as high-dimensional hyperentanglement and robust entanglement anti-degradation. Van der Waals (vdW) NbOCl2 crystal, renowned for its superior optical nonlinearities, has emerged as one of ideal candidates for ultrathin quantum light sources [Nature 613, 53 (2023)]. However, polarization-entanglement is inaccessible in NbOCl2 crystal due to its unfavorable nonlinear susceptibility tensor. Here, by leveraging the twist-stacking degree of freedom inherently in vdW systems, we showcase the preparation of tunable polarization entanglement and quantum Bell states. Our work not only provides a new and tunable polarization-entangled vdW photon-pair source, but also introduces a new knob in engineering the entanglement state of quantum light at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Time-Domain Bound States in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06771v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the concept of time-domain bound states in continuum. We show that a rapid judiciously-designed temporal modulation of the refractive index in a spatially homogenous medium gives rise to a bound state in time embedded in a continuum of wavenumbers. Mathematically, these bound states in the continuum (BIC) are analytic solutions of the Maxwell equations in time and one-dimensional space. Our results show the potential to extend known wave phenomena in space to the temporal domain, providing new avenues for light-matter interactions in time-varying media.</description>

      <title>Broadband localization of light at the termination of a topological photonic waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localized optical field enhancement enables strong light-matter interactions necessary for efficient manipulation and sensing of light. Specifically, tunable broadband energy localization in nanoscale hotspots offers a wide range of applications in nanophotonics and quantum optics. We experimentally demonstrate a novel principle for the local enhancement of electromagnetic fields, based on strong suppression of backscattering. This is achieved at a designed termination of a topologically non-trivial waveguide that nearly preserves the valley degree of freedom. The symmetry origin of the valley degree of freedom prevents edge states to undergo intervalley scattering at waveguide discontinuities that obey the symmetry of the crystal. Using near-field microscopy, we reveal that this can lead to strong confinement of light at the termination of a topological photonic waveguide, even without breaking time-reversal symmetry. We emphasize the importance of symmetry conservation by comparing different waveguide termination geometries, confirming that the origin of suppressed backscattering lies with the near-conservation of the valley degree of freedom, and show the broad bandwidth of the effect.</description>

      <title>The role of the inverse Cherenkov effect in the formation of ultrashort Raman solitons in silica microspheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate a new regime of the formation of ultrashort optical solitons in spherical silica microresonators with whispering gallery modes.The solitons are driven by a coherent CW pump at the frequency in the range of normal dispersion, and the energy is transferred from this pump to the solitons via two channels: Raman amplification and the inverse Cherenkov effect. We discuss three different regimes of soliton propagation and we also show that these Raman solitons can be controlled by weak coherent CW signals.</description>

      <title>Complexity of chaotic optical frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06861v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of a single-mode semiconductor laser induced by the optical injection of a frequency comb are analyzed through the lens of complexity. In particular, the focus is dynamics outside the injection-locking region. Permutation entropy (P.E.) and chaos bandwidth (CBW) are used to quantify complexity. Various numerically simulated system outputs across the frequency detuning range and for different injection strengths are considered. Numerically simulated outputs from a single-mode injection system in the absence of comb injection are compared to comment on the origin of the reported complexity. Furthermore, experimental outputs are used to confirm the findings. Despite the presence of periodic dynamics originating from the frequency comb, the presented system generates remarkably high complex outputs with P.E. up to 0.99 maintained over an extended period of observation and long timescales with CBW up to 25 GHz.</description>

      <title>Atomic fluorescence collection into planar photonic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescence collection from individual emitters plays a key role in state detection and remote entanglement generation, fundamental functionalities in many quantum platforms. Planar photonics have been demonstrated for robust and scalable addressing of trapped-ion systems, motivating consideration of similar elements for the complementary challenge of photon collection. Here, using an argument from the reciprocity principle, we show that far-field photon collection efficiency can be simply expressed in terms of the fields associated with the collection optic at the emitter position alone. We calculate collection efficiencies into ideal paraxial and fully vectorial focused Gaussian modes parameterized in terms of focal waist, and further quantify the modest enhancements possible with more general beam profiles, establishing design requirements for efficient collection. Towards practical implementation, we design, fabricate, and characterize a diffractive collection element operating at $\lambda=397$ nm predicted to offer a total 0.25\% collection efficiency into a single waveguide mode. A more efficient design with more demanding fabrication requirements would offer $1.14\%$, and we indicate avenues to improved devices approaching the limits predicted for ideal beams. We point out a particularly simple integrated waveguide configuration for polarization-based remote entanglement generation enabled by integrated collection.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Singularities in Scattering Spectra of Mie Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems are known to possess unique singularities in the scattering spectra such as exceptional points, bound states in the continuum, Diabolic points, and anapole states, which are usually considered to be independent. Here, we demonstrate the fundamental relationships between non-Hermitian singularities and observe them experimentally in the scattering spectra. We reveal that exceptional points appear in the anapole regime, and diabolic points are associated with superscattering. We confirm our findings with microwave experiments by measuring the scattering spectra of subwavelength Mie-resonant ceramic rings. Our study underpins the generic behavior of non-Hermitian singularities in the scattering spectra of subwavelength resonators, uncovering their novel applications in non-Hermitian nonlinear optics and topological photonics.</description>

      <title>Integrated astrophotonic phase control for high resolution optical interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long baseline optical interferometry and aperture synthesis using ground-based telescopes can enable unprecedented angular resolution astronomy in the optical domain. However, atmospheric turbulence leads to large, dynamic phase errors between participating apertures that limit fringe visibility using telescopes arrays or subaperture configurations in a single large telescope. Diffraction limited optics or adaptive optics can be used to ensure coherence at each aperture, but correlating the phase between apertures requires high speed, high stroke phase correction and recombination that is extremely challenging and costly. As a solution, we show an alternative phase correction and beam combination method using a centimeter-scale silicon astrophotonic chip optimized for H-band operation. The 4.7x10mm silicon photonic chip is fabricated using electron beam lithography with devices with 2 up to 32 independent channels. Light is coupled into the chip using single mode fiber ribbons. An array of microheaters is used to individually tune the effective index of each spiral delay waveguides. Narrowband spectral splitters at each spatial channel divert a modulated digital reference signal from an artificial guide star off-chip for phase measurement. Science light from other wavelengths is coherently combined using on-chip beam combiners and outputted to a single waveguide. We described the role, design, fabrication and characterization of the photonic chip. This photonic phase control scheme can be applied in astronomical interferometry or optical satellite communications.</description>

      <title>Observation of anomalous classical-to-quantum transitions in many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correspondence principle bridges the quantum and classical worlds by establishing a direct link between their dynamics. This well-accepted tenant of quantum physics has been explored in quantum systems wherein the number of particles is increased to macroscopic scales. However, theoretical investigations of nanoscale structures have revealed discrepancies when attempting to bridge classical and quantum physics. Here, we report on the experimental observation of anomalous classical-to-quantum transitions in open many-body optical systems. We demonstrate, for the first time, the lack of classical-to-quantum correspondence between a macroscopic optical system and its constituent quantum multiphoton subsystems. In contrast to common belief, we demonstrate that the coherence dynamics of many-body quantum subsystems with up to forty particles can indeed be opposite to that exhibited by the hosting macroscopic system. By employing complex-Gaussian statistics, we show that these effects are universal for open many-body systems. Consequently, our work can have important implications for other fields of physics ranging from condensed matter to nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Search for QCD Axions in light of String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion stands as one of the most promising candidates for resolving the strong CP problem. However, the value of the axion's decay constant $f_a$ and, by extension, its mass $m_a$, remain uncertain within the framework of effective field theory, posing a challenge for experimental detection. Fortunately, fields such as cosmology and astrophysics can offer crucial clues about potential mass ranges. Additionally, string theory and the more recent swampland principles might shed some light on the subject. The most straightforward string theory compactifications suggest that $f_a$ is around the GUT scale, leading to an anthropic abundance of dark matter. We found that this range can be detected through hydrogen atomic transitions. The recent concept of the dark dimension scenario introduces an alternative possibility. If axions are confined to the four-dimensional Standard Model brane, their decay constant $f_a$ would be on the order of $10^{10}$ GeV. In this scenario, where axions constitute only a minor portion of dark matter, we show that a laser-interferometry setup would be an effective detection method.</description>

      <title>Optical Control of Ultrafast Photocurrent in Graphene</title>

Abstract: The ability to manipulate electrons with the intense laser pulse enables an unprecedented control over the electronic motion on its intrinsic timescale. Present work explores the desired control of photocurrent generation in monolayer graphene on ultrafast timescale. The origin of photocurrent is attributed to the asymmetric residual electronic population in the conduction band after the end of the laser pulse, which also facilitates valley polarization. Present study offers a comprehensive analysis of the differences between these two observables, namely photocurrent and valley polarization. It is found that the corotating circularly polarized $\omega-2\omega$ laser pulses allow the generation of photocurrent but no valley polarization, whereas counterrotating circularly polarized $\omega-2\omega$ laser pulses yield significant valley polarization without any photocurrent in graphene. Different laser parameters, such as subcycle phase, wavelength, and intensity provide different knobs to control the generation of the photocurrent. In addition, threefold increase in the photocurrent's amplitude can be achieved by altering electronic properties of graphene via strain engineering. Our findings reveal intriguing underlying mechanisms into the interplay between the symmetries of the graphene's electronic structure and the driving laser pulses, shedding light on the potential for harnessing graphene's properties for novel applications in ultrafast photonics, optoelectronic devices, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Forward Multiple Scattering for Optical Imaging Deep Inside an Opaque Medium</title>

Abstract: As light travels through a disordered medium such as biological tissues, it undergoes multiple scattering events. This phenomenon is detrimental to in-depth optical microscopy, as it causes a drastic degradation of contrast, resolution and brightness of the resulting image beyond a few scattering mean free paths. However, the information about the inner reflectivity of the sample is not lost; only scrambled. To recover this information, a matrix approach of optical imaging can be fruitful. Here, we report on a de-scanned measurement of a high-dimension reflection matrix R via low coherence interferometry. Then, we show how a set of independent focusing laws can be extracted for each medium voxel through an iterative multi-scale analysis of wave distortions contained in R. It enables an optimal and local compensation of forward multiple scattering paths and provides a three-dimensional confocal image of the sample as the latter one had become digitally transparent. The proof-of-concept experiment is performed on a human opaque cornea and an extension of the penetration depth by a factor five is demonstrated compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Quantum and classical Fisher information in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the quantum limit of sensitivity in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM), which has emerged as a favored technique for imaging the structure of a wide variety of materials, including biological and other radiation-sensitive materials. 4D-STEM is an indirect (computational) imaging technique, which uses a scanning beam, and records the scattering distribution in momentum (diffraction) space for each beam position. We find that, in measuring a sample's electrostatic potential, the quantum Fisher information from 4D-STEM can match that from real-space phase-contrast imaging. Near-optimum quantum Fisher information is achieved using a delocalized speckled probe. However, owing to the detection in the diffraction plane, 4D-STEM ultimately enables only about half of the quantum limit, whereas Zernike phase-contrast imaging enables the quantum limit for all spatial frequencies admitted by the optical system. On the other hand, 4D-STEM can yield information on spatial frequencies well beyond those accessible by phase-contrast TEM. Our conclusions extend to analogous imaging modalities using coherent scalar visible light and x-rays.</description>

      <title>Occupancy-driven Zeeman suppression and inversion in trapped polariton condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the magneto-photoluminescence of an optically trapped exciton-polariton condensate in a planar semiconductor microcavity with multiple In0.08Ga0.92As quantum wells. Extremely high condensate coherence time and continuous control over the polariton confinement are among the advantages provided by optical trapping. This allows us to resolve magnetically induced {\mu}eV fine-energy shifts in the condensate and identify unusual dynamical regions in its parameter space. We observe polariton Zeeman splitting and, in small traps with tight confinement, demonstrate its full parametric screening when the condensate density exceeds a critical value, reminiscent of the spin-Meissner effect. For larger optical traps, we observe a complete inversion in the Zeeman splitting as a function of power, underlining the importance of condensate confinement and interactions with its background reservoir excitons.</description>

      <title>Characterising and tackling thermally induced zero-drift in displacement measuring interferometry using temperature-controlled enclosure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our research efforts in displacement measurement interferometry focused on long-term drifts initiated an extended experimental investigation in the interferometric assemblies of our design. We aimed to analyze, characterize and tackle the long-term measurement stability, expressed as the zero-drift, with particular attention to the thermal effects. For the experimentation, we developed a thermostatic chamber equipped with active temperature regulation, an array of sensors and control electronics. With either the finely stabilized temperature or with the thermal cycling, we can carry out a range of investigations: verification of modified design or prototype interferometers, testing of production pieces, characterization of integrated assemblies and units in terms of the zero drift and the susceptibility to thermal effects -- the temperature sensitivity ($\delta L / \delta T$, expressed in nm.K$^{-1}$). With these experimental studies, we demonstrate the potential of the zero drift studies to contribute to the development and broader expansion of interferometric instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission from InAs/GaAs quantum dots coupled to broadband cylindrical nanocavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-chip emitters that generate single and entangled photons are essential for photonic quantum information processing technologies. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are attractive candidates that emit high-quality quantum states of light, however at a rate limited by their spontaneous radiative lifetime. In this study, we utilize the Purcell effect to demonstrate up to a 38-fold enhancement in the emission rate of InAs QDs by coupling them to metal-clad GaAs nanopillars. These cavities, featuring a sub-wavelength mode volume of 4.5x10-4 ({\lambda}/n)3 and quality factor of 62, enable Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission across a large bandwidth of 15 nm with a multi-photon emission probability as low as 0.5 %. The broadband nature of the cavity eliminates the need for implementing tuning mechanisms typically required to achieve QD-cavity resonance, thus relaxing fabrication constraints. Ultimately, this QD-cavity architecture represents a significant stride towards developing solid-state quantum emitters generating near-ideal single-photon states at GHz-level repetition rates.</description>
