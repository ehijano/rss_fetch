      <title>On the closest pair of points problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two novel algorithms for the problem of finding the closest pair in a cloud of $n$ points based on findings from mathematical optimal packing theory. Both algorithms are deterministic, show fast effective runtimes, and are very easy to implement. For our main algorithm, cppMM, we prove $O(n)$ time complexity for the case of uniformly distributed points. Our second algorithm, cppAPs, is almost as simple as the brute-force approach, but exhibits an extremely fast empirical running time, although its worst-case time complexity is also $O(n^2)$. We embed the new algorithms in a review of the most prominent contenders and empirically demonstrate their runtime behavior for problem sizes up to $n =$ 33,554,432 points observed in our C++ test environment. For large $n$, cppMM dominates the other algorithms under study.</description>

      <title>Spectral Clustering in Birthday Paradox Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a vertex in a $(k, \varphi, \epsilon)$-clusterable graph, i.e. a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into a disjoint union of $\varphi$-expanders of size $\approx n/k$ with outer conductance bounded by $\epsilon$, can one quickly tell which cluster it belongs to? This question goes back to the expansion testing problem of Goldreich and Ron'11. For $k=2$ a sample of $\approx n^{1/2+O(\epsilon/\varphi^2)}$ logarithmic length walks from a given vertex approximately determines its cluster membership by the birthday paradox: two vertices whose random walk samples are `close' are likely in the same cluster.
  The study of the general case $k&gt;2$ was initiated by Czumaj, Peng and Sohler [STOC'15], and the works of Chiplunkar et al. [FOCS'18], Gluch et al. [SODA'21] showed that $\approx \text{poly}(k)\cdot n^{1/2+O(\epsilon/\varphi^2)}$ random walk samples suffice for general $k$. This matches the $k=2$ result up to polynomial factors in $k$, but creates a conceptual inconsistency: if the birthday paradox is the guiding phenomenon, then the query complexity should decrease with the number of clusters $k$! Since clusters have size $\approx n/k$, we expect to need $\approx (n/k)^{1/2+O(\epsilon/\varphi^2)}$ random walk samples, which decreases with $k$.
  We design a novel representation of vertices in a $(k, \varphi, \epsilon)$-clusterable graph by a mixture of logarithmic length walks. This representation uses the optimal $\approx (n/k)^{1/2+O(\epsilon/\varphi^2)}$ walks per vertex, and allows for a fast nearest neighbor search: given $k$ vertices representing the clusters, we can find the cluster of a given query vertex $x$ using nearly linear time in the representation size of $x$. This gives a clustering oracle with query time $\approx (n/k)^{1/2+O(\epsilon/\varphi^2)}$ and space complexity $k\cdot (n/k)^{1/2+O(\epsilon/\varphi^2)}$, matching the birthday paradox bound.</description>

      <title>A General Metric-Space Formulation of the Time Warp Edit Distance (TWED)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This short technical note presents a formal generalization of the Time Warp Edit Distance (TWED) proposed by Marteau (2009) to arbitrary metric spaces. By viewing both the observation and temporal domains as metric spaces $(X, d)$ and $(T, \Delta)$, we define a Generalized TWED (GTWED) that remains a true metric under mild assumptions. We provide self-contained proofs of its metric properties and show that the classical TWED is recovered as a special case when $X = \mathbb{R}^d$, $T \subset \mathbb{R}$, and $g(x) = x$. This note focuses on the theoretical structure of GTWED and its implications for extending elastic distances beyond time series, which enables the use of TWED-like metrics on sequences over arbitrary domains such as symbolic data, manifolds, or embeddings.</description>

      <title>Parallel Dynamic Spatial Indexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maintaining spatial data (points in two or three dimensions) is crucial and has a wide range of applications, such as graphics, GIS, and robotics. To handle spatial data, many data structures, called spatial indexes, have been proposed, e.g. kd-trees, oct/quadtrees (also called Orth-trees), R-trees, and bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs). In real-world applications, spatial datasets tend to be highly dynamic, requiring batch updates of points with low latency. This calls for efficient parallel batch updates on spatial indexes. Unfortunately, there is very little work that achieves this.
  In this paper, we systematically study parallel spatial indexes, with a special focus on achieving high-performance update performance for highly dynamic workloads. We select two types of spatial indexes that are considered optimized for low-latency updates: Orth-tree and R-tree/BVH. We propose two data structures: the P-Orth tree, a parallel Orth-tree, and the SPaC-tree family, a parallel R-tree/BVH. Both the P-Orth tree and the SPaC-tree deliver superior performance in batch updates compared to existing parallel kd-trees and Orth-trees, while preserving better or competitive query performance relative to their corresponding Orth-tree and R-tree counterparts. We also present comprehensive experiments comparing the performance of various parallel spatial indexes and share our findings at the end of the paper.</description>

      <title>Weisfeiler-Leman on graphs of small twin-width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twin-width is a graph parameter introduced in the context of first-order model checking, and has since become a central parameter in algorithmic graph theory. While many algorithmic problems become easier on arbitrary classes of bounded twin-width, graph isomorphism on graphs of twin-width 4 and above is as hard as the general isomorphism problem. For each positive number $k$, the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm is an iterative color refinement algorithm that encodes structural similarities and serves as a fundamental tool for distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs. We show that the graph isomorphism problem for graphs of twin-width 1 can be solved by the purely combinatorial 3-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, while there is no fixed $k$ such that the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm solves the graph isomorphism problem for graphs of twin-width 4.
  Moreover, we prove the conjecture of Bergougnoux, Gajarsk\'y, Guspiel, Hlinen\'y, Pokr\'yvka, and Sokolowski that stable graphs of twin-width 2 have bounded rank-width. This in particular implies that isomorphism of these graphs can be decided by a fixed dimension of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Parameters in Ranking Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How important is the weight of a given column in determining the ranking of tuples in a table? To address such an explanation question about a ranking function, we investigate the computation of SHAP scores for column weights, adopting a recent framework by Grohe et al.[ICDT'24]. The exact definition of this score depends on three key components: (1) the ranking function in use, (2) an effect function that quantifies the impact of using alternative weights on the ranking, and (3) an underlying weight distribution. We analyze the computational complexity of different instantiations of this framework for a range of fundamental ranking and effect functions, focusing on probabilistically independent finite distributions for individual columns.
  For the ranking functions, we examine lexicographic orders and score-based orders defined by the summation, minimum, and maximum functions. For the effect functions, we consider global, top-k, and local perspectives: global measures quantify the divergence between the perturbed and original rankings, top-k measures inspect the change in the set of top-k answers, and local measures capture the impact on an individual tuple of interest. Although all cases admit an additive fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS), we establish the complexity of exact computation, identifying which cases are solvable in polynomial time and which are #P-hard. We further show that all complexity results, lower bounds and upper bounds, extend to a related task of computing the Shapley value of whole columns (regardless of their weight).</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms to Compute Closed Substrings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A closed string $u$ is either of length one or contains a border that occurs only as a prefix and as a suffix in $u$ and nowhere else within $u$. In this paper, we present fast $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ time algorithms to compute all $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ closed substrings by introducing a compact representation for all closed substrings of a string $ w[1..n]$, using only $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ space. These simple and space-efficient algorithms also compute maximal closed strings. Furthermore, we compare the performance of these algorithms and identify classes of strings where each performs best. Finally, we show that the exact number of MCSs ($M(f_n)$) in a Fibonacci word $ f_n $, for $n \geq 5$, is $\approx \left(1 + \frac{1}{\phi^2}\right) F_n \approx 1.382 F_n$, where $ \phi $ is the golden ratio.</description>

      <title>A Truly Subcubic Combinatorial Algorithm for Induced 4-Cycle Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first truly subcubic, combinatorial algorithm for detecting an induced $4$-cycle in a graph. The running time is $O(n^{2.84})$ on $n$-node graphs, thus separating the task of detecting induced $4$-cycles from detecting triangles, which requires $n^{3-o(1)}$ time combinatorially under the popular BMM hypothesis.
  Significant work has gone into characterizing the exact time complexity of induced $H$-detection, relative to the complexity of detecting cliques of various sizes. Prior work identified the question of whether induced $4$-cycle detection is triangle-hard as the only remaining case towards completing the lowest level of the classification, dubbing it a "curious" case [Dalirrooyfard, Vassilevska W., FOCS 2022]. Our result can be seen as a negative resolution of this question.
  Our algorithm deviates from previous techniques in the large body of subgraph detection algorithms and employs the trendy topic of graph decomposition that has hitherto been restricted to more global problems (as in the use of expander decompositions for flow problems) or to shaving subpolynomial factors (as in the application of graph regularity lemmas). While our algorithm is slower than the (non-combinatorial) state-of-the-art $\tilde{O}(n^{\omega})$-time algorithm based on polynomial identity testing [Vassilevska W., Wang, Williams, Yu, SODA 2014], combinatorial advancements often come with other benefits. In particular, we give the first nontrivial deterministic algorithm for detecting induced $4$-cycles.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Analysis of Online Metric Matching with a Single Sample: Beyond Metric Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20288v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the online metric matching problem, $n$ servers and $n$ requests lie in a metric space. Servers are available upfront, and requests arrive sequentially. An arriving request must be matched immediately and irrevocably to an available server, incurring a cost equal to their distance. The goal is to minimize the total matching cost.
  We study this problem in the Euclidean metric $[0, 1]^d$, when servers are adversarial and requests are independently drawn from distinct distributions that satisfy a mild smoothness condition. Our main result is an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm for $d \neq 2$ that requires no distributional knowledge, relying only on a single sample from each request distribution. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to achieve an $o(\log n)$ competitive ratio for non-trivial metrics beyond the i.i.d. setting. Our approach bypasses the $\Omega(\log n)$ barrier introduced by probabilistic metric embeddings: instead of analyzing the embedding distortion and the algorithm separately, we directly bound the cost of the algorithm on the target metric of a simple deterministic embedding. We then combine this analysis with lower bounds on the offline optimum for Euclidean metrics, derived via majorization arguments, to obtain our guarantees.</description>

      <title>Fully Dynamic Spectral Sparsification for Directed Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in spectral hypergraph sparsification, a natural generalization of spectral sparsification for graphs. In this paper, we present a simple fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining spectral hypergraph sparsifiers of \textit{directed} hypergraphs. Our algorithm achieves a near-optimal size of $O(n^2 / \varepsilon ^2 \log ^7 m)$ and amortized update time of $O(r^2 \log ^3 m)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices, and $m$ and $r$ respectively upper bound the number of hyperedges and the rank of the hypergraph at any time.
  We also extend our approach to the parallel batch-dynamic setting, where a batch of any $k$ hyperedge insertions or deletions can be processed with $O(kr^2 \log ^3 m)$ amortized work and $O(\log ^2 m)$ depth. This constitutes the first spectral-based sparsification algorithm in this setting.</description>

      <title>A data structure for monomial ideals with applications to signature Gr\"obner bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce monomial divisibility diagrams (MDDs), a data structure for monomial ideals that supports insertion of new generators and fast membership tests. MDDs stem from a canonical tree representation by maximally sharing equal subtrees, yielding a directed acyclic graph. We establish basic complexity bounds for membership and insertion, and study empirically the size of MDDs. As an application, we integrate MDDs into the signature Gr\"obner basis implementation of the Julia package AlgebraicSolving.jl. Membership tests in monomial ideals are used to detect some reductions to zero, and the use of MDDs leads to substantial speed-ups.</description>
