      <title>Modeling Adaptive Tracking of Predictable Stimuli in Electric Fish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weakly electric fish \emph{Eigenmannia virescens} naturally swims back and forth to stay within a moving refuge, tracking its motion using visual and electrosensory feedback. Previous experiments show that when the refuge oscillates as a low-frequency sinusoid (below about 0.5 Hz), the tracking is nearly perfect, but phase lag increases and gain decreases at higher frequencies. Here, we model this nonlinear behavior as an adaptive internal model principle (IMP) system. Specifically, an adaptive state estimator identifies the \emph{a priori} unknown frequency, and feeds this parameter estimate into a closed-loop IMP-based system built around a lightly damped harmonic oscillator. We prove that the closed-loop tracking error of the IMP-based system, where the online adaptive frequency estimate is used as a surrogate for the unknown frequency, converges exponentially to that of an ideal control system with perfect information about the stimulus. Simulations further show that our model reproduces the fish refuge tracking Bode plot across a wide frequency range. These results establish the theoretical validity of combining the IMP with an adaptive identification process and provide a basic framework in adaptive sensorimotor control.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Congestion Management with Capacity Limitation Contracts and Redispatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the coordination of two congestion management instruments - capacity limitation contracts (CLCs) and redispatch contracts (RCs) - as a risk-aware resource allocation problem. We propose that the advantages and drawbacks of these instruments can be represented as operational risk profiles and can be balanced through coordination. To this end, we develop a chance-constrained two-stage stochastic mixed-integer program for a system operator procuring flexibility from an aggregator managing a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs). The model captures uncertainty in EV charging and redispatch market conditions, using real order book data from the Dutch redispatch market (GOPACS).
  Results indicate that combining CLCs and RCs is generally the most cost-effective approach to mitigate risks associated with each instrument, but the optimal mix depends on fleet size and RC activation timing. Large uncertainty about EV loading increases RC activation intraday to correct for forecasting errors at the earlier CLC stage. For large fleet sizes (e.g. 25.000) the optimal policy limits redispatch due to market liquidity risks in the immature redispatch market. This risk increases for later redispatch activation due to shrinking trading windows for redispatch products. These findings highlight how various sources of uncertainty can impact the optimal trade-off between congestion management instruments.</description>

      <title>Inverse Source Method for Constrained Phased Array Synthesis through Null-Space Exploitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A versatile approach for the synthesis of phased array (PA) antennas able to fit user-defined power pattern masks, while fulfilling additional geometrical and/or electrical constraints on the geometry of the array aperture and/or on the array excitations is presented. Such a synthesis method is based on the inverse source (IS) formulation and exploits the null-space of the radiation operator that causes the non-uniqueness of the IS problem at hand. More in detail, the unknown element excitations of the PA are expressed as the linear combination of a minimum-norm or radiating (RA) term and a suitable non-radiating (NR) component. The former, computed via the truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) of the array radiation operator, is devoted to generate a far-field power pattern that fulfills user-defined pattern masks. The other one belongs to the null-space of the radiation operator and allows one to fit additional geometrical and/or electrical constraints on the geometry of the array aperture and/or on the beam-forming network (BFN) when determined with a customized global optimization strategy. A set of numerical examples, concerned with various array arrangements and additional design targets, is reported to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>All-Electric Heavy-Duty Robotic Manipulator: Actuator Configuration Optimization and Sensorless Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that integrates modeling, optimization, and sensorless control of an all-electric heavy-duty robotic manipulator (HDRM) driven by electromechanical linear actuators (EMLAs). An EMLA model is formulated to capture motor electromechanics and direction-dependent transmission efficiencies, while a mathematical model of the HDRM, incorporating both kinematics and dynamics, is established to generate joint-space motion profiles for prescribed TCP trajectories. A safety-ensured trajectory generator, tailored to this model, maps Cartesian goals to joint space while enforcing joint-limit and velocity margins. Based on the resulting force and velocity demands, a multi-objective Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is employed to select the optimal EMLA configuration. To accelerate this optimization, a deep neural network, trained with EMLA parameters, is embedded in the optimization process to predict steady-state actuator efficiency from trajectory profiles. For the chosen EMLA design, a physics-informed Kriging surrogate, anchored to the analytic model and refined with experimental data, learns residuals of EMLA outputs to support force and velocity sensorless control. The actuator model is further embedded in a hierarchical virtual decomposition control (VDC) framework that outputs voltage commands. Experimental validation on a one-degree-of-freedom EMLA testbed confirms accurate trajectory tracking and effective sensorless control under varying loads.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Low-Level MPC for Multi-Agent Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving safe and coordinated behavior in dynamic, constraint-rich environments remains a major challenge for learning-based control. Pure end-to-end learning often suffers from poor sample efficiency and limited reliability, while model-based methods depend on predefined references and struggle to generalize. We propose a hierarchical framework that combines tactical decision-making via reinforcement learning (RL) with low-level execution through Model Predictive Control (MPC). For the case of multi-agent systems this means that high-level policies select abstract targets from structured regions of interest (ROIs), while MPC ensures dynamically feasible and safe motion. Tested on a predator-prey benchmark, our approach outperforms end-to-end and shielding-based RL baselines in terms of reward, safety, and consistency, underscoring the benefits of combining structured learning with model-based control.</description>

      <title>Bandwidth-Constrained Sensor Scheduling: A Trade-off between Fairness and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address fair sensor scheduling over bandwidth-constrained communication channels. While existing literature on fair scheduling overlooks overall system efficiency, we introduce a novel $q$-fairness framework to balance efficiency and fairness by adjusting the parameter $q$. Specifically, for two communication scenarios, we: (i) derive the optimal schedule under limited communication rates, and (ii) propose two suboptimal algorithms under limited simultaneous sensor transmissions and analyze their performance gaps relative to the optimal strategy. Simulations demonstrate that our algorithms effectively balance efficiency and fairness in both cases.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Uncertainty Modeling for Robust Feedback Active Noise Control in Headphones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active noise control (ANC) has become popular for reducing noise and thus enhancing user comfort in headphones. While feedback control offers an effective way to implement ANC, it is restricted by uncertainty of the controlled system that arises, e.g., from differing wearing situations. Widely used unstructured models which capture these variations tend to overestimate the uncertainty and thus restrict ANC performance. As a remedy, this work explores uncertainty models that provide a more accurate fit to the observed variations in order to improve ANC performance for over-ear and in-ear headphones. We describe the controller optimization based on these models and implement an ANC prototype to compare the performances associated with conventional and proposed modeling approaches. Extensive measurements with human wearers confirm the robustness and indicate a performance improvement over conventional methods. The results allow to safely increase the active attenuation of ANC headphones by several decibels.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Control Nodes of Threshold and XOR Boolean Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boolean networks (BNs) are important models for gene regulatory networks and many other biological systems. In this paper, we study the minimal controllability problem of threshold and XOR BNs with degree constraints. Firstly, we derive lower-bound-related inequalities and some upper bounds for the number of control nodes of several classes of controllable majority-type threshold BNs. Secondly, we construct controllable majority-type BNs and BNs involving Boolean threshold functions with both positive and negative coefficients such that these BNs are associated with a small number of control nodes. Thirdly, we derive a linear-algebraic necessary and sufficient condition for the controllability of general XOR-BNs, whose update rules are based on the XOR logical operator, and construct polynomial-time algorithms for computing control-node sets and control signals for general XOR-BNs. Lastly, we use ring theory and linear algebra to establish a few best-case upper bounds for a type of degree-constrainted XOR-BNs called $k$-$k$-XOR-BNs. In particular, we show that for any positive integer $m \geq 2$ and any odd integer $k \in [3, 2^{m} - 1]$, there exists a $2^{m}$-node controllable $k$-$k$-XOR-BN with 1 control node. Our results offer theoretical insights into minimal interventions in networked systems such as gene regulatory networks.</description>

      <title>On-Policy Reinforcement-Learning Control for Optimal Energy Sharing and Temperature Regulation in District Heating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16083v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of temperature regulation and optimal energy sharing in district heating systems (DHSs) where the demand and system parameters are unknown. We propose a temperature regulation scheme that employs data-driven on-policy updates that achieve these objectives. In particular, we show that the proposed control scheme converges to an optimal equilibrium point of the system, while also having guaranteed convergence to an optimal LQR control policy, thus providing good transient performance. The efficiency of our approach is also demonstrated through extensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Thermal State Estimation and Forecasting in Laser Powder Bed Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) is a widely adopted additive manufacturing process for fabricating complex metallic parts layer by layer. Effective thermal management is essential to ensure part quality and structural integrity, as thermal gradients and residual stresses can lead to defects such as warping and cracking. However, existing experimental or computational techniques lack the ability to forecast future temperature distributions in real time, an essential capability for proactive process control. This paper presents a real-time thermal state forecasting framework for L-PBF, based on a physics-informed reduced-order thermal model integrated with a Kalman filtering scheme. The proposed approach efficiently captures inter-layer heat transfer dynamics and enables accurate tracking and forecasting of spatial and temporal temperature evolution. Validation across multiple part geometries using measured data demonstrates that the method reliably estimates and forecasts peak temperatures and cooling trends. By enabling predictive thermal control, this framework offers a practical and computationally efficient solution for thermal management in L-PBF, paving the way toward closed-loop control in L-PBF.</description>

      <title>Polymatroidal Representations of Aggregate EV Flexibility Considering Network Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces significant flexibility potential to power systems. However, uncoordinated or synchronous charging can lead to overloading of distribution networks. Extending recent approaches that utilize generalized polymatroids, a family of polytopes, to represent the aggregate flexibility of EV populations, we show how to integrate network constraints into this representation to obtain network-constrained aggregate flexibility sets. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to optimize over these network-constrained aggregate flexibility sets, and propose a disaggregation procedure that maps an aggregate load profile to individual EV dispatch instructions, while respecting both device-level and network constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized filter-function framework that treats noise coupling strength as a tunable control parameter, enabling target noise suppression across user-defined frequency bands. By optimizing this generalized filter function, we design band-selective control pulses that achieve $0.9999$ fidelity of single- and two-qubit gates under strong noise with diverse spectral profiles. We further extend the method to selectively enhance the signal-to-noise ratio for quantum sensing of AC signals with an enhanced precision of up to $10$ dB. The resulting control pulses are experimentally feasible, offering a practical pathway toward robust quantum operations and high-precision signal processing under spectrally complex noises.</description>

      <title>Post crisis Strategies: Antifragility Principles as Catalysts for Urban Evolution Towards Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban crises reveal the true essence of cities: their ability to either withstand disorder or collapse under its pressure. This article explores how antifragility principles can transforms urban disruption into levers for reinforcement and innovation. While resilience seeks to restore a lost balance, antifragility goes further: it pushes cities to improve through shocks. Across a critical analysis of post-crisis strategies and the identification of fifteen fundamental theoretical principles, this work proposes a new framework, structuring a proactive and evolutionary approach to urban development. Medell\'in, Singapore and Fukushima already illustrate this dynamic, showing that adversity can catalyse profound transformations. By integrating institutional flexibility, strategic diversity and self-organization, antifragility poses itself as an alternative to the limits of resilience. Can this model really redefine the way cities adapt to crises? This article paves the way for a decisive reflection to rethink urban planning in an uncertain world.</description>

      <title>The Distribution Shift Problem in Transportation Networks using Reinforcement Learning and AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in smart transportation networks has increased significantly in the last few years. Among these ML and AI approaches, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to be a very promising approach by several authors. However, a problem with using Reinforcement Learning in Traffic Signal Control is the reliability of the trained RL agents due to the dynamically changing distribution of the input data with respect to the distribution of the data used for training. This presents a major challenge and a reliability problem for the trained network of AI agents and could have very undesirable and even detrimental consequences if a suitable solution is not found. Several researchers have tried to address this problem using different approaches. In particular, Meta Reinforcement Learning (Meta RL) promises to be an effective solution. In this paper, we evaluate and analyze a state-of-the-art Meta RL approach called MetaLight and show that, while under certain conditions MetaLight can indeed lead to reasonably good results, under some other conditions it might not perform well (with errors of up to 22%), suggesting that Meta RL schemes are often not robust enough and can even pose major reliability problems.</description>

      <title>Sym2Real: Symbolic Dynamics with Residual Learning for Data-Efficient Adaptive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Sym2Real, a fully data-driven framework that provides a principled way to train low-level adaptive controllers in a highly data-efficient manner. Using only about 10 trajectories, we achieve robust control of both a quadrotor and a racecar in the real world, without expert knowledge or simulation tuning. Our approach achieves this data efficiency by bringing symbolic regression to real-world robotics while addressing key challenges that prevent its direct application, including noise sensitivity and model degradation that lead to unsafe control. Our key observation is that the underlying physics is often shared for a system regardless of internal or external changes. Hence, we strategically combine low-fidelity simulation data with targeted real-world residual learning. Through experimental validation on quadrotor and racecar platforms, we demonstrate consistent data-efficient adaptation across six out-of-distribution sim2sim scenarios and successful sim2real transfer across five real-world conditions.

      <title>Online Slip Detection and Friction Coefficient Estimation for Autonomous Racing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15423v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the tire-road friction coefficient (TRFC) is essential for vehicle safety, stability, and performance, especially in autonomous racing, where vehicles often operate at the friction limit. However, TRFC cannot be directly measured with standard sensors, and existing estimation methods either depend on vehicle or tire models with uncertain parameters or require large training datasets. In this paper, we present a lightweight approach for online slip detection and TRFC estimation. Our approach relies solely on IMU and LiDAR measurements and the control actions, without special dynamical or tire models, parameter identification, or training data. Slip events are detected in real time by comparing commanded and measured motions, and the TRFC is then estimated directly from observed accelerations under no-slip conditions. Experiments with a 1:10-scale autonomous racing car across different friction levels demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves accurate and consistent slip detections and friction coefficients, with results closely matching ground-truth measurements. These findings highlight the potential of our simple, deployable, and computationally efficient approach for real-time slip monitoring and friction coefficient estimation in autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI-Enhanced Supervisory Control for Robust Multi-Agent Robotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an explainable AI-enhanced supervisory control framework for multi-agent robotics that combines (i) a timed-automata supervisor for safe, auditable mode switching, (ii) robust continuous control (Lyapunov-based controller for large-angle maneuver; sliding-mode controller (SMC) with boundary layers for precision and disturbance rejection), and (iii) an explainable predictor that maps mission context to gains and expected performance (energy, error). Monte Carlo-driven optimization provides the training data, enabling transparent real-time trade-offs.
  We validated the approach in two contrasting domains, spacecraft formation flying and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Despite different environments (gravity/actuator bias vs. hydrodynamic drag/currents), both share uncertain six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) rigid-body dynamics, relative motion, and tight tracking needs, making them representative of general robotic systems. In the space mission, the supervisory logic selects parameters that meet mission criteria. In AUV leader-follower tests, the same SMC structure maintains a fixed offset under stochastic currents with bounded steady error. In spacecraft validation, the SMC controller achieved submillimeter alignment with 21.7% lower tracking error and 81.4% lower energy consumption compared to Proportional-Derivative PD controller baselines. At the same time, in AUV tests, SMC maintained bounded errors under stochastic currents. These results highlight both the portability and the interpretability of the approach for safety-critical, resource-constrained multi-agent robotics.</description>

      <title>KoopCast: Trajectory Forecasting via Koopman Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present KoopCast, a lightweight yet efficient model for trajectory forecasting in general dynamic environments. Our approach leverages Koopman operator theory, which enables a linear representation of nonlinear dynamics by lifting trajectories into a higher-dimensional space. The framework follows a two-stage design: first, a probabilistic neural goal estimator predicts plausible long-term targets, specifying where to go; second, a Koopman operator-based refinement module incorporates intention and history into a nonlinear feature space, enabling linear prediction that dictates how to go. This dual structure not only ensures strong predictive accuracy but also inherits the favorable properties of linear operators while faithfully capturing nonlinear dynamics. As a result, our model offers three key advantages: (i) competitive accuracy, (ii) interpretability grounded in Koopman spectral theory, and (iii) low-latency deployment. We validate these benefits on ETH/UCY, the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, and nuScenes, which feature rich multi-agent interactions and map-constrained nonlinear motion. Across benchmarks, KoopCast consistently delivers high predictive accuracy together with mode-level interpretability and practical efficiency.</description>

      <title>Universal Learning of Stochastic Dynamics for Exact Belief Propagation using Bernstein Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the distribution of future states in a stochastic system, known as belief propagation, is fundamental to reasoning under uncertainty. However, nonlinear dynamics often make analytical belief propagation intractable, requiring approximate methods. When the system model is unknown and must be learned from data, a key question arises: can we learn a model that (i) universally approximates general nonlinear stochastic dynamics, and (ii) supports analytical belief propagation? This paper establishes the theoretical foundations for a class of models that satisfy both properties. The proposed approach combines the expressiveness of normalizing flows for density estimation with the analytical tractability of Bernstein polynomials. Empirical results show the efficacy of our learned model over state-of-the-art data-driven methods for belief propagation, especially for highly non-linear systems with non-additive, non-Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>Uniform Sampling from the Reachable Set Using Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding the reachable set of a system has a wide range of applications, but is a fundamental challenge in control theory, especially when controls are bounded. Although one can simply integrate the system samples forward in time by applying random admissible control to approximate the reachable set, the samples typically cluster near an attractor (if one is present) -- yielding a poor representation of the reachable set. A better representation can be found by applying controls that specifically lead to a uniform terminal state distribution, however, finding such controls is non-trivial. To find such controls, one must solve an Optimal Transport (OT) problem with uniform measure as the target distribution, which is difficult since the reachable set is not know \emph{a priori}.
  We can overcome this difficulty by softening the terminal measure constraint via the introduction of a $L_2$-entropy function in the objective and can further reduce this infinite-dimensional regularized OT to a finite-dimensional particle-based optimal control problem by using a nonlocal kernel regularization of the entropy. This leads to a hierarchy of optimization problems whose solutions converge to the original reachability sampling OT problem, as proved by $\Gamma$-convergence. The effectiveness of this entropy-regularized particle-based approach for uniform sampling of reachable set is demonstrated using numerical examples.</description>

      <title>SMART: Scalable Multi-Agent Reasoning and Trajectory Planning in Dense Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-vehicle trajectory planning is a non-convex problem that becomes increasingly difficult in dense environments due to the rapid growth of collision constraints. Efficient exploration of feasible behaviors and resolution of tight interactions are essential for real-time, large-scale coordination. This paper introduces SMART, Scalable Multi-Agent Reasoning and Trajectory Planning, a hierarchical framework that combines priority-based search with distributed optimization to achieve efficient and feasible multi-vehicle planning. The upper layer explores diverse interaction modes using reinforcement learning-based priority estimation and large-step hybrid A* search, while the lower layer refines solutions via parallelizable convex optimization. By partitioning space among neighboring vehicles and constructing robust feasible corridors, the method decouples the joint non-convex problem into convex subproblems solved efficiently in parallel. This design alleviates the step-size trade-off while ensuring kinematic feasibility and collision avoidance. Experiments show that SMART consistently outperforms baselines. On 50 m x 50 m maps, it sustains over 90% success within 1 s up to 25 vehicles, while baselines often drop below 50%. On 100 m x 100 m maps, SMART achieves above 95% success up to 50 vehicles and remains feasible up to 90 vehicles, with runtimes more than an order of magnitude faster than optimization-only approaches. Built on vehicle-to-everything communication, SMART incorporates vehicle-infrastructure cooperation through roadside sensing and agent coordination, improving scalability and safety. Real-world experiments further validate this design, achieving planning times as low as 0.014 s while preserving cooperative behaviors.</description>

      <title>Bridging Batch and Streaming Estimations to System Identification under Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: System identification in modern engineering systems faces emerging challenges from unanticipated adversarial attacks beyond existing detection mechanisms. In this work, we obtain a provably accurate estimate of the Markov parameter matrix of order $k$ to identify partially observed linear systems, in which the probability of having an attack at each time is $O(1/k)$. We show that given the batch data accumulated up to time $T^*$, the $\ell_2$-norm estimator achieves an error decaying exponentially as $k$ grows. We then propose a stochastic projected subgradient descent algorithm on streaming data that produces an estimate at each time $t&lt;T^*$, in which case the expected estimation error proves to be the larger of $O(k/\sqrt{t})$ and an exponentially decaying term in $k$. This stochastic approach illustrates how non-smooth estimators can leverage first-order methods despite lacking recursive formulas. Finally, we integrate batch and streaming estimations to recover the Hankel matrix using the appropriate estimates of the Markov parameter matrix, which enables the synthesis of a robust adaptive controller based on the estimated balanced truncated model under adversarial attacks.</description>

Abstract: We present a model predictive control (MPC) framework for efficient navigation of mobile robots in cluttered environments. The proposed approach integrates a finite-segment shortest path planner into the finite-horizon trajectory optimization of the MPC. This formulation ensures convergence to dynamically selected targets and guarantees collision avoidance, even under general nonlinear dynamics and cluttered environments. The approach is validated through hardware experiments on a small ground robot, where a human operator dynamically assigns target locations. The robot successfully navigated through complex environments and reached new targets within 2-3 seconds.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Physics Informed Neural Networks for Reliable Transformer Prognostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) integrates physics and data into the learning process, offering improved generalization compared with purely data-driven models. Despite its potential, applications of SciML in prognostics remain limited, partly due to the complexity of incorporating partial differential equations (PDEs) for ageing physics and the scarcity of robust uncertainty quantification methods. This work introduces a Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework for probabilistic prognostics estimation. By embedding Bayesian Neural Networks into the PINN architecture, the proposed approach produces principled, uncertainty-aware predictions. The method is applied to a transformer ageing case study, where insulation degradation is primarily driven by thermal stress. The heat diffusion PDE is used as the physical residual, and different prior distributions are investigated to examine their impact on predictive posterior distributions and their ability to encode a priori physical knowledge. The framework is validated against a finite element model developed and tested with real measurements from a solar power plant. Results, benchmarked against a dropout-PINN baseline, show that the proposed B-PINN delivers more reliable prognostic predictions by accurately quantifying predictive uncertainty. This capability is crucial for supporting robust and informed maintenance decision-making in critical power assets.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the set of terminal state covariances that are reachable over a finite time horizon from a given initial state covariance for a linear stochastic system with additive noise. For discrete-time systems, a complete characterization of the set of reachable state covariances is given. For continuous-time systems, we present an upper bound on the set of reachable state covariances. Moreover, for both linear discrete-time and continuous-time systems, necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for the controllability of the state covariance over a finite horizon.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Electricity Consumption Flexibility in Different Industrial Plant Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources into power systems is intensifying the demand for greater flexibility among industrial electricity consumers. However, operational constraints, production requirements, and market dynamics pose significant challenges to achieving optimal flexibility. This paper presents an enhanced mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that directly optimizes electricity consumption flexibility in manufacturing plants. Unlike previous approaches, the proposed model determines optimal transactions with both day-ahead and intraday continuous electricity markets, while ensuring production continuity and adhering to plant-specific operational constraints. The methodology is validated through annual simulations of two real world industrial configurations, cement manufacturing and steel production, using 2023 market data. Comparative results highlight that the steel plant achieved average electricity cost savings through flexibility of 0.41 euro/MWh, whereas the cement plant achieved 0.24 euro/MWh, reflecting differences in storage capacities, production rates, and operational flexibility. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further identifies key parameters affecting flexibility potential, such as the production to demand ratio, storage capacity, and minimum operation periods. The findings offer valuable insights for industrial operators aiming to reduce energy costs, enhance operational flexibility, and support the decarbonization of electricity systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21461v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate frequency estimation is critical for the control, monitoring and protection of electrical power systems, in particular, of systems with a high penetration of power electronics. This paper introduces the novel concept of Quasi Steady-State (QSS) frequency as a quantity that fills the gap between stationary and instantaneous frequency. QSS frequency coincides with the fundamental frequency of an AC voltage in any stationary conditions, including unbalanced and non-sinusoidal, and is able to capture the time-varying fundamental frequency in transient conditions. The paper also proposes a metric borrowed from fluid dynamics, namely, the time derivative of the circulation, to define the scope of validity of the QSS frequency. Analytical examples as well as a case study based on a fully-fledged EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system serve to illustrate, respectively, the properties of the QSS frequency and its behavior in transient conditions.</description>

      <title>Resilient Event-Triggered Control of Vehicle Platoon Under DoS Attacks and Parameter Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of dynamic event-triggered platoon control for intelligent vehicles (IVs) under denial of service (DoS) attacks and parameter uncertainty. DoS attacks disrupt vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, leading to the destabilization of vehicle formations. To alleviate the burden of the V2V communication network and enhance the tracking performance in the presence of DoS attacks and parameter uncertainty, a resilient and dynamic event-triggered mechanism is proposed. In contrast to the static event-triggering mechanism (STEM), this approach leverages the internal dynamic variable to further save communication resources. Subsequently, a method is developed for designing the desired triggering mechanism. Following this, a co-design framework is constructed to guarantee robust and resilient control against DoS attacks, with the analysis of eliminating Zeno behavior. Lastly, extensive simulations are presented to show the superiority of the proposed method in terms of enhancing platoon resilience and robustness and improving communication efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Goal-Oriented Approach for Active Object Detection with Exploration-Exploitation Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active object detection, which aims to identify objects of interest through controlled camera movements, plays a pivotal role in real-world visual perception for autonomous robotic applications, such as manufacturing tasks (e.g., assembly operations) performed in unknown environments. A dual control for exploration and exploitation (DCEE) algorithm is presented within goal-oriented control systems to achieve efficient active object detection, leveraging active learning by incorporating variance-based uncertainty estimation in the cost function. This novel method employs an exploration-exploitation balanced cost function to actively guide the selection of the next viewpoint. Specifically, active object detection is achieved through the development of a reward function that encodes knowledge about the confidence variation of objects as a function of viewpoint position within a given domain. By identifying the unknown parameters of this function, the system generates an optimal viewpoint planning strategy. DCEE integrates parameter estimation of the reward function and view planning, ensuring a balanced trade-off between the exploitation of learned knowledge and active exploration during the planning process. Moreover, it demonstrates remarkable adaptability across diverse scenarios, effectively handling LEGO brick detection at varying locations. Importantly, the algorithm maintains consistent configuration settings and a fixed number of parameters across various scenarios, underscoring its efficiency and robustness. To validate the proposed approach, extensive numerical studies, high-fidelity virtual simulations, and real-world experiments under various scenarios were conducted. The results confirm the effectiveness of DCEE in active object detection, showcasing superior performance compared to existing methods, including model predictive control (MPC) and entropy approaches.</description>

      <title>Lateral oscillation and body compliance help snakes and snake robots stably traverse large, smooth obstacles</title>

Abstract: Snakes can move through almost any terrain. Similarly, snake robots hold the promise as a versatile platform to traverse complex environments like earthquake rubble. Unlike snake locomotion on flat surfaces which is inherently stable, when snakes traverse complex terrain by deforming their body out of plane, it becomes challenging to maintain stability. Here, we review our recent progress in understanding how snakes and snake robots traverse large, smooth obstacles that lack anchor points for gripping or bracing. First, we discovered that the generalist variable kingsnake combines lateral oscillation and cantilevering. Regardless of step height and surface friction, the overall gait is preserved. Next, to quantify static stability of the snake, we developed a method to interpolate continuous body in three dimensions (both position and orientation) between discrete tracked markers. By analyzing the base of support using the interpolated continuous body 3-D kinematics, we discovered that the snake maintained perfect stability during traversal, even on the most challenging low friction, high step. Finally, we applied this gait to a snake robot and systematically tested its performance traversing large steps with variable heights to further understand stability principles. The robot rapidly and stably traversed steps nearly as high as a third of its body length. As step height increased, the robot rolled more frequently to the extent of flipping over, reducing traversal probability. The absence of such failure in the snake with a compliant body inspired us to add body compliance to the robot. With better surface contact, the compliant body robot suffered less roll instability and traversed high steps at higher probability, without sacrificing traversal speed. Our robot traversed large step-like obstacles more rapidly than most previous snake robots, approaching that of the animal.</description>

      <title>An energy landscape approach to locomotor transitions in complex 3D terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.12717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective locomotion in nature happens by transitioning across multiple modes (e.g., walk, run, climb). Despite this, far more mechanistic understanding of terrestrial locomotion has been on how to generate and stabilize around near-steady-state movement in a single mode. We still know little about how locomotor transitions emerge from physical interaction with complex terrain. Consequently, robots largely rely on geometric maps to avoid obstacles, not traverse them. Recent studies revealed that locomotor transitions in complex 3-D terrain occur probabilistically via multiple pathways. Here, we show that an energy landscape approach elucidates the underlying physical principles. We discovered that locomotor transitions of animals and robots self-propelled through complex 3-D terrain correspond to barrier-crossing transitions on a potential energy landscape. Locomotor modes are attracted to landscape basins separated by potential energy barriers. Kinetic energy fluctuation from oscillatory self-propulsion helps the system stochastically escape from one basin and reach another to make transitions. Escape is more likely towards lower barrier direction. These principles are surprisingly similar to those of near-equilibrium, microscopic systems. Analogous to free energy landscapes for multi-pathway protein folding transitions, our energy landscape approach from first principles is the beginning of a statistical physics theory of multi-pathway locomotor transitions in complex terrain. This will not only help understand how the organization of animal behavior emerges from multi-scale interactions between their neural and mechanical systems and the physical environment, but also guide robot design, control, and planning over the large, intractable locomotor-terrain parameter space to generate robust locomotor transitions through the real world.</description>

      <title>Coordinated appendages accumulate more energy to self-right on the ground</title>

Abstract: Animals and robots must right themselves after flipping over on the ground. The discoid cockroach pushes its wings against the ground in an attempt to dynamically self-right by a somersault. However, because this maneuver is strenuous, the animal often fails to overcome the potential energy barrier and makes continual attempts. In this process, the animal flails its legs, whose lateral perturbation eventually leads it to roll to the side to self-right. Our previous work developed a cockroach-inspired robot capable of leg-assisted, winged self-righting, and a robot simulation study revealed that the outcome of this strategy depends sensitively on wing-leg coordination (measured by the phase between their motions). Here, we further elucidate why this is the case by developing a template to model the complex hybrid dynamics resulting from discontinuous contact and actuation. We used the template to calculate the potential energy barrier that the body must overcome to self-right, mechanical energy contribution by wing pushing and leg flailing, and mechanical energy dissipation due to wing-ground collision. The template revealed that wing-leg coordination (phase) strongly affects self-righting outcome by changing mechanical energy budget. Well-coordinated appendage motions (good phase) accumulate more mechanical energy than poorly-coordinated motions (bad phase), thereby better overcoming the potential energy barrier to self-right more successfully. Finally, we demonstrated practical use of the template for predicting a new control strategy to further increase self-righting performance and informing robot design.</description>

      <title>Limitations of Fault-Tolerant Quantum Linear System Solvers for Quantum Power Flow</title>

Abstract: Quantum computers hold promise for solving problems intractable for classical computers, especially those with high time or space complexity. Practical quantum advantage can be said to exist for such problems when the end-to-end time for solving such a problem using a classical algorithm exceeds that required by a quantum algorithm. Reducing the power flow (PF) problem into a linear system of equations allows for the formulation of quantum PF (QPF) algorithms, which are based on solving methods for quantum linear systems such as the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm. Speedup from using QPF algorithms is often claimed to be exponential when compared to classical PF solved by state-of-the-art algorithms. We investigate the potential for practical quantum advantage in solving QPF compared to classical methods on gate-based quantum computers. Notably, this paper does not present a new QPF solving algorithm but scrutinizes the end-to-end complexity of the QPF approach, providing a nuanced evaluation of the purported quantum speedup in this problem. Our analysis establishes a best-case bound for the HHL-based quantum power flow complexity, conclusively demonstrating that the HHL-based method has higher runtime complexity compared to the classical algorithm for solving the direct current power flow (DCPF) and fast decoupled load flow (FDLF) problem. Notably, our analysis and conclusions can be extended to any quantum linear system solver with rigorous performance guarantees, based on the known complexity lower bounds for this problem. Additionally, we establish that for potential practical quantum advantage (PQA) to exist it is necessary to consider DCPF-type problems with a very narrow range of condition number values and readout requirements.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal Beyond Diagonal RIS: Sum-Rate Maximization in Full-Duplex Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been envisioned as a key technology in future wireless communication networks to enable smart radio environment. To further enhance the passive beamforming capability of RIS, beyond diagonal (BD)-RIS has been proposed considering reconfigurable interconnections among different RIS elements. BD-RIS has a unique feature that cannot be enabled by conventional diagonal RIS; it can be realized by non-reciprocal circuits and thus enables an asymmetric scattering matrix. This feature provides the capability to break the wireless channel reciprocity, and has the potential to benefit full-duplex (FD) systems. In this paper, we model the BD RIS-assisted FD systems, where the impact of BD-RIS non-reciprocity and that of structural scattering, which refers to the specular reflection generated by RIS when the RIS is turned OFF, are explicitly captured. To assess the benefits of non-reciprocal BD-RIS, we optimise the scattering matrix, precoder and combiner to maximize the DL and UL sum-rates in the FD system. To tackle this optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on block coordination descent (BCD) and penalty dual decomposition (PDD). Numerical results demonstrate surprising benefits of non-reciprocal BD-RIS that it can achieve much higher DL and UL sum-rates in the FD scenario than reciprocal BD-RIS and conventional diagonal RIS.</description>

      <title>Testing and Fault Tolerance Techniques for CNT-Based FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the semiconductor manufacturing process technology node shrinks into the nanometer-scale, the CMOS-based Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) face big challenges in scalability of performance and power consumption. Multi-walled Carbon Nanotube (MWCNT) serves as a promising candidate for Cu interconnects thanks to the superior conductivity. Moreover, Carbon Nanotube Field Transistor (CNFET) also emerges as a prospective alternative to the conventional CMOS device because of high power efficiency and large noise margin. The combination of MWCNT and CNFET enables the promising CNT-based FPGAs. However, the MWCNT interconnects exhibit significant process variations due to immature fabrication process, leading to delay faults. Also, the non-ideal CNFET fabrication process may generate a few metallic CNTs (m-CNTs), rendering correlated faulty blocks. In this article, we propose a ring oscillator (RO) based testing technique to detect delay faults due to the process variation of MWCNT interconnects. Furthermore, we propose an effective testing technique for the carry chains in CLBs, and an improved circuit design based on the lookup table (LUT) is applied to speed up the fault testing of CNT-based FPGAs. In addition, we propose a testing algorithm to detect m-CNTs in CLBs. Finally, we propose a redundant spare row sharing architecture to improve the yield of CNT-based FPGA further. Experimental results show that the test time for a 6-input LUT can be reduced by 35.49% compared with conventional testing, and the proposed algorithm can achieve a high test coverage with little overhead. The proposed redundant architecture can repair the faulty segment effectively and efficiently.</description>

      <title>Online Learning of Deceptive Policies under Intermittent Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In supervisory control settings, autonomous systems are not monitored continuously. Instead, monitoring often occurs at sporadic intervals within known bounds. We study the problem of deception, where an agent pursues a private objective while remaining plausibly compliant with a supervisor's reference policy when observations occur. Motivated by the behavior of real, human supervisors, we situate the problem within Theory of Mind: the representation of what an observer believes and expects to see. We show that Theory of Mind can be repurposed to steer online reinforcement learning (RL) toward such deceptive behavior. We model the supervisor's expectations and distill from them a single, calibrated scalar -- the expected evidence of deviation if an observation were to happen now. This scalar combines how unlike the reference and current action distributions appear, with the agent's belief that an observation is imminent. Injected as a state-dependent weight into a KL-regularized policy improvement step within an online RL loop, this scalar informs a closed-form update that smoothly trades off self-interest and compliance, thus sidestepping hand-crafted or heuristic policies. In real-world, real-time hardware experiments on marine (ASV) and aerial (UAV) navigation, our ToM-guided RL runs online, achieves high return and success with observed-trace evidence calibrated to the supervisor's expectations.</description>
