      <title>Overlap reduction functions for pulsar timing arrays and astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient technique for calculating the angular two-point correlation functions (or ''overlap reduction functions'') induced by gravitational waves in both the pulse arrival times of pulsars and in the angular deflections of distant sources. In the most general case, there are six auto- and cross-correlations for the pulse arrival times and the two components of the angular deflection. We provide results for spin-2 (i.e., general-relativistic) gravitational waves as well as the spin-1 modes that may arise in alternative-gravity theories. These calculations can be easily implemented for future analysis or study, and we provide code to do so.</description>

      <title>The Bispectrum in Lagrangian Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the bispectrum in Lagrangian perturbation theory. Extending past results for the power spectrum, we describe a method to efficiently compute the bispectrum in LPT, focusing on the Zeldovich approximation, in which contributions due to linear displacements are captured to all orders in a manifestly infrared (IR) safe way. We then isolate the effects of these linear displacements on oscillatory components of the power spectrum like baryon acoustic oscillations or inflationary primordial features and show that the Eulerian perturbation theory (EPT) prescription wherein their effects are resummed by a Gaussian damping of the oscillations arise as a saddle-point approximation of our calculation. These two methods of IR resummation are in excellent agreement at 1-loop in the bispectrum. At tree level, resummed EPT does less well to capture the nonlinear damping of the oscillations, and the LPT calculation does not require an artificial split of the power spectrum into smooth and oscillatory components, making the latter particularly useful for modeling exotic features. We finish by extending our analysis of IR resummation in LPT to N-point functions of arbitrary order.</description>

      <title>Squeezing information from radio surveys to probe the primordial Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major goal of cosmology is to understand the nature of the field(s) which drove primordial Inflation. Through future observations, the statistics of large-scale structure will allow us to probe primordial non-Gaussianity of the curvature perturbation at the end of Inflation. We show how a new correlation statistic can significantly improve these constraints over conventional methods. Next-generation radio telescope arrays are under construction which will map the density field of neutral hydrogen to high redshifts. These telescopes can operate as an interferometer, able to probe small scales, or as a collection of single dishes, combining signals to map the large scales. We show how to fuse these these operating modes in order to measure the squeezed bispectrum with higher precision and greater economy. This leads to constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity that will improve on measurements by Planck, and out-perform other surveys such as Euclid. We forecast that $\sigma(f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{\mathrm{loc}})\sim 3$, achieved by using a small subset, $\mathcal{O}(10^2-10^3)$, of the total number of accessible triangles. The proposed method can be used for any signal that peaks in squeezed configurations.</description>

      <title>Blinding scheme for the scale-dependence bias signature of local primordial non-Gaussianity for DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of spectroscopic surveys is expected to achieve an unprecedented level of accuracy in the measurement of cosmological parameters. To avoid confirmation bias and thereby improve the reliability of these results, blinding procedures become a standard practice in the cosmological analyses of such surveys. Blinding is especially crucial when the impact of observational systematics is important relative to the cosmological signal, and a detection of that signal would have significant implications. This is the case for local primordial non-gaussianity, as probed by the scale-dependent bias of the galaxy power spectrum at large scales that are heavily sensitive to the dependence of the target selection on the imaging quality, known as imaging systematics. We propose a blinding method for the scale-dependent bias signature of local primordial non-gaussianity at the density field level which consists in generating a set of weights for the data that replicate the scale-dependent bias. The applied blinding is predictable, and can be straightforwardly combined with other catalog-level blinding procedures that have been designed for the baryon acoustic oscillation and redshift space distortion signals. The procedure is validated through simulations that replicate data from the first year of observation of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, but may find applications to other upcoming spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on a modified-gravity model with an exponential function of the curvature using the expansion history, the RSD, and the Pantheon$+$SH0ES data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering a well motivated $f(R)$ modified-gravity model, in which an exponential function of the curvature is included, in this paper we implement a statistical data analysis to set constraints on the parameters of the model, taking into account an analytic approximate solution for the expansion rate, $H(z)$. From the Monte Carlo Markov Chain-based analysis of the expansion rate evolution, the standardized SN distance modulus and the redshift space distortion observational data, we find that the preferred value for the perturbative parameter, $b$, quantifying the deviation of the $f(R)$ model from $\Lambda$CDM, lives in a region which excludes $b = 0$ at $\gtrsim 4.5 \sigma$ C.L., and that the predicted current value of the Hubble parameter, $H_0$, locates in between the two observational results currently under scrutiny from Planck and SH0ES collaborations, indicating that the proposed model would alleviate the apparent tension. Under the implemented approximate solution, and with the constraints obtained for the parameters, the proposed $f(R)$ model successfully reproduce the observational data and the predicted evolution of interesting cosmological parameters resemble the results of $\Lambda$CDM, as expected, while an oscillatory behavior of the dark energy equation of state is observed, pointing to deviation from the concordance cosmological model. The results presented here reinforces the conclusion that the $f(R)$ modified-gravity model represents a viable alternative to describe the evolution of the Universe, evading the challenges faced by $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Observational test for $f(Q)$ gravity with weak gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we confront a class of $f(Q)$ gravity models with observational data of galaxy-galaxy lensing. Specifically, we consider the $f(Q)$ gravity models containing a small quadratic correction when compared with General Relativity (GR), and quantify this correction by a model parameter $\alpha$. To derive the observational constraints, we start by extracting the spherically symmetric solutions which correspond to the deviations from the Schwarzschild solution that depends on the model parameter in a two-fold way, i.e., a renormalized mass and a new term proportional to $r^{-2}$. Then, we calculate the effective lensing potential, the deflection angle, the shear component, and the effective Excess Surface Density (ESD) profile. After that, we employ the group catalog and shape catalog from the SDSS DR7 for the lens and source samples respectively. Moreover, we handle the off-center radius as a free parameter and constrain it using the MCMC. Concerning the deviation parameter from GR we derive $\alpha=1.202^{+0.277}_{-0.179}\times 10^{-6} {\rm Mpc}^{-2}$ at 1 $\sigma$ confidence level, and then compare the fitting efficiency with the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm by applying the AIC and BIC information criteria. Our results indicate that the $f(Q)$ corrections alongside off-center effects yield a scenario that is slightly favored.</description>

      <title>Global Anisotropies of $\Omega_\Lambda$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analysis of the Cosmological Constant $\Omega_\Lambda$ fitted to subsamples of the Pantheon+ Type Ia SN sample spanning 2$\pi$ sterradians for a grid of 432 pole positions covering the whole sky reveals two large scale asymmetries. One of them is closely aligned with the Galactic North-South direction and the other points approximately towards RA$\sim 217.5^\circ$ Dec$\sim -26.4^\circ$, $\sim$50.9 degrees from the CMB dipole Apex. The signal to noise ratio (S/N) of the multiple $\Omega_\Lambda$ measurements in these directions is $3.2\lesssim $ S/N $\lesssim 8.4$. The first asymmetry is puzzling, and would indicate a systematic effect related with the distribution of Pantheon+ SNe on the sky and, probably, how the correction for reddening in the Galaxy is calculated. The second one, which entails a 2.8-$\sigma$ tension between $\Omega_\Lambda$ measure in opposite directions, bears strong implications on its interpretation as Dark Energy: It is consistent with the prediction for tilted observers located in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe who could measure an acceleration or a deceleration with a dipolar asymmetry, irrespective of what the universe as a whole is doing. In this case, $\Omega_\Lambda$ would not be a physical entity, a real Dark Energy, but an apparent effect associated with the relativistic frame of reference transformation.</description>

      <title>Reassessing constant-roll Warm Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Departing from standard slow-roll conditions is one way of putting the inflationary paradigm to test, and constraining the dynamics of the inflaton field with a constant-rate of roll of the inflaton field, a.k.a. the constant-roll scenario, is one way of exploring such deviation from the standard slow-roll dynamics. In this manuscript we explore such a possibility in a variant inflationary scenario, known as Warm Inflation. We construct and derive the conditions for having constant-roll WI models where inflation lasts at least for 60 $e-$folds, gracefully exits the constant-roll inflation phase, and maintains near thermal equilibrium of the system which is an essential feature of WI in the slow-roll regime. We show that while certain models of WI (the ones with dissipative coefficient as a function of temperature alone) can accommodate constant-roll dynamics, others (with dissipative coefficient as a function of temperature and the inflaton field both) fail to maintain thermal equilibrium once the constant-roll condition is imposed and hence cannot produce a constant-roll WI phase.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy in the light of DESI 2024 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent result from the DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) data release 1 (DR1) combined with the cosmic microwave background and supernova data shows a preference for the dynamical dark energy over the cosmological constant [1]. For this analysis, the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization of the dark energy equation of state has been used. Though CPL parametrization is the most popular parametrization of dark energy equation of state (EoS) recent studies have questioned its choice of prior and degeneracy. In this work, we propose a new parametrization of the dark energy equation of state motivated by its ability to cross the phantom barrier crossing. At a high redshift limit, this parametrization takes the form of CPL parametrization. We have used the Bayesian model selection criteria in which this parametrisation shows a moderate positive preference over the $\Lambda$CDM model. Contrary to the DESI2024 results our model suggests the current value of the dark energy equation of state to be phantom today with two phantom barrier crossings one at $z\simeq 0.4$ from deep phantom to quintessence which matches with the finding from the DESI2024 result and another phantom barrier crossing very recently at $z\simeq0.1$ from quintessence to phantom. The proposed model also weakens the Hubble tension significantly to $\approx 2 \sigma$ while comparing with the result from [2] and to $\approx 1.4 \sigma$ while comparing with [3].</description>

      <title>A catalogue of merging clusters of galaxies: cluster partners, merging subclusters, and post-collision clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clusters of galaxies are merging during the formation of large-scale structures in the Universe. Based on optical survey data, we identify a large sample of pre-mergers of galaxy clusters and merging subclusters in rich clusters. We find 39,382 partners within a velocity difference of 1500 km/s and a projected separation of 5r_{500} around 33,126 main clusters, where r_{500} is the radius of the main cluster. Based on the galaxy distribution inside rich clusters with more than 30 member galaxy candidates, we identify subclusters by modeling the smoothed optical distribution with a two-component profile, and a coupling factor is obtained for merging subclusters in 7845 clusters. In addition, we find 3446 post-collision mergers according to the deviations of brightest cluster galaxies from other member galaxies, most of which have been partially validated by using the Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray images. Two new bullet-like clusters have been identified by using the optical and X-ray images. The large samples of merging clusters of galaxies presented here are important databases for studying the hierarchical structure formation, cluster evolution, and the physics of intergalactic medium.</description>

      <title>Muon neutrinos and the cosmological abundance of primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the mixed dark matter scenarios consisting of primordial black holes (PBHs) and particle dark matter (DM), PBHs can accrete surrounding DM particles to form ultracompact minihalos (UCMHs or clothed PBHs) even at early epoch of the Universe. The distribution of DM particles in a UCMH follows a steeper density profile compared with classical DM halo. It is expected the DM annihilation rate is very large in UCMHs resulting in a contribution to, e.g., the extragalactic neutrino flux. In this work, we investigate the extragalactic neutrino flux from clothed PBHs due to DM annihilation, and then the muon flux for neutrino detection. Compared with the atmospheric neutrino flux, we derive the upper limits on the cosmological abundance of PBHs for 10 years exposure time of, e.g., the IceCube experiment. For the DM mass $m_{\chi}=100~(1000)$ GeV, the upper limits (2$\sigma$) on the fraction of DM in PBHs are $f_{\rm PBH}=1.2\times 10^{-3}~(8.9\times 10^{-5})$ for contained events and $f_{\rm PBH}=2.5\times 10^{-3}~(1.3\times 10^{-5})$ for upward events, respectively. Compared with other constrains, although the upper limits obtained by us are not the strongest, it is a different way to study the cosmological abundance of PBHs.</description>

      <title>Effects of local cosmic inhomogeneities on the gravitational wave event rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local universe is highly inhomogeneous and anisotropic. We live in a relatively sparse region of the Laniakea supercluster at the edge of a large 80 Mpc-wide void. We study the effect of these inhomogeneities on the measured gravitational wave event rates. In particular, we estimate how the measured merger rate of compact binaries is biased by the local matter distribution. The effect of the inhomogeneities on the merger rate is suppressed by the low angular resolution of gravitational wave detectors coupled with their smoothly decreasing population-averaged sensitivity with distance. We estimate the effect on the compact binary coalescence event rate to be at most 6% depending of the chirp mass of the target binary system and the sensitivity and orientation of the detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the initiation of cosmic inflation, in full numerical relativity, from pre-inflationary scenarios with large tensor and vector fluctuations in the metric. These settings are characterized by having large values in the Weyl curvature tensor. In the matter sector, we consider a single scalar field with inhomogeneous field velocities, corresponding to a kination period. In the context of large-field inflation, it is shown that the onset of inflation continues to be robust to this type of initial conditions, and that during inflation the Universe successfully homogenizes and flattens any type of curvature, leading to a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker Universe after just a few tens of efolds of accelerating expansion.</description>

      <title>Discreteness Effects in the Post-Reconstruction Galaxy Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have increasingly recognized the value of analyzing the post-reconstruction galaxy power spectrum for investigations into redshift space distortion (RSD) effects. In this paper, we present a novel theoretical model for the post-reconstruction galaxy power spectrum, designed for RSD analyses. In particular, we emphasize the importance of accounting for discrete effects arising from the reconstruction displacement vector, which have been overlooked. We specifically calculate these discrete effects, i.e., shot noise terms, within the framework of standard perturbation theory at the 1-loop level. In addition, we adopt a formulation that accounts for infrared (IR) effects to accurately model the non-linear damping of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal. Our model comprehensively integrates key physical phenomena relevant to the post-reconstruction galaxy power spectrum, such as gravitational non-linearities, RSD effects, bias effects, reconstruction effects, reconstruction-specific shot-noise effects, and the non-linear damping of the reconstructed BAO signal, thereby making it applicable to post-reconstruction RSD analyses.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Impact of the galaxy cluster environment on the stretch distribution of Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of the astrophysical environment on Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) properties is crucial to minimize systematic uncertainties in cosmological analyses based on this probe. We investigate the dependence of the SN Ia SALT2.4 light-curve stretch on the distance from their nearest galaxy cluster to study a potential effect of the intracluster medium (ICM) environment on SN Ia intrinsic properties. We use the largest SN Ia sample to date and cross-match it with existing X-ray, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich, and optical cluster catalogs in order to study the dependence between stretch and distance to the nearest detected cluster from each SN Ia. We model the underlying stretch distribution with a Gaussian mixture with relative amplitudes that depend on redshift and cluster-centric distance. We find a significant improvement of the fit quality of the stretch distribution if we include the distance-dependant term in the model with a variation of the Akaike information criterion $\rm{\Delta AIC} = -10.2$. Because of the known correlation between galaxy age and distance from cluster center, this supports previous evidence that the age of the stellar population is the underlying driver of the bimodial shape of the SN Ia stretch distribution. We further compute the evolution of the fraction of quenched galaxies as a function of distance with respect to cluster center from our best-fit model of the SNe Ia stretch distribution and compare it to previous results obtained from $H\alpha$ line measurements, optical broadband photometry, and simulations. We find our estimate to be compatible with these results. The results of this work indicate that SNe Ia searches at high redshift targeted towards clusters to maximize detection probability should be considered with caution as the stretch distribution of the detected sample would be strongly biased towards the old sub-population of SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Escape Velocity Mass of Abell 1063</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the radius-velocity phase-space edge profile for Abell 1063 using galaxy redshifts from arXiv:1409.3507 and arXiv:2109.03305. Combined with a cosmological model and after accounting for interlopers and sampling effects, we infer the escape velocity profile. Using the Poisson equation, we then directly constrain the gravitational potential profile and find excellent agreement between three different density models. For the NFW profile, we find log$_{10}$(M$_{200},{\rm crit}$)= $15.40^{+0.06}_{-0.12}$M$_{\odot}$, consistent to within $1\sigma$ of six recently published lensing masses. We argue that this consistency is due to the fact that the escape technique shares no common systematics with lensing other than radial binning. These masses are 2-4$\sigma$ lower than estimates using X-ray data, in addition to earlier velocity dispersion estimates. We measure the 1D velocity dispersion within r$_{200}$ to be $\sigma_{v} = 1477^{+87}_{-99}$ km/s, which combined with our escape velocity mass, brings the dispersion for A1063 in-line with hydrodynamic cosmological simulations for the first time.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN~Ia DR2: Cosmology-independent constraints on Type Ia supernova standardisation from supernova siblings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) and the empirical standardisation relations that make them excellent distance indicators is vital to improving cosmological constraints. SN~Ia ``siblings", i.e. two or more SNe~Ia in the same host or parent galaxy offer a unique way to infer the standardisation relations and their diversity across the population. We analyse a sample of 25 SN~Ia pairs, observed homogeneously by the Zwicky Transient Factory (ZTF) to infer the SNe~Ia light curve width-luminosity and colour-luminosity parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Using the pairwise constraints from siblings, allowing for a diversity in the standardisation relations, we find $\alpha = 0.218 \pm 0.055 $ and $\beta = 3.084 \pm 0.312$, respectively, with a dispersion in $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of $\leq 0.195$ and $\leq 0.923$, respectively, at 95$\%$ C.L. While the median dispersion is large, the values within $\sim 1 \sigma$ are consistent with no dispersion. Hence, fitting for a single global standardisation relation, we find $\alpha = 0.228 \pm 0.029 $ and $\beta = 3.160 \pm 0.191$. We find a very small intrinsic scatter of the siblings sample $\sigma_{\rm int} \leq 0.10$ at 95\% C.L. compared to $\sigma_{\rm int} = 0.22 \pm 0.04$ when computing the scatter using the Hubble residuals without comparing them as siblings. Splitting the sample based on host galaxy stellar mass, we find that SNe~Ia in both subsamples have consistent $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The $\beta$ value is consistent with the value for the cosmological sample. However, we find a higher $\alpha$ by $\sim 2.5 - 3.5 \sigma$. The high $\alpha$ is driven by low $x_1$ pairs, potentially suggesting that the slow and fast declining SN~Ia have different slopes of the width-luminosity relation. We can confirm or refute this with increased statistics from near future time-domain surveys. (abridged)</description>

      <title>New limits on warm inflation from pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) generated in the post-inflationary universe to infer new limits on warm inflation. We specifically examine the evolution of primordial GWs produced by scalar perturbations produced during the radiation-dominated epoch. For this purpose, we assume a weak regime of warm inflation under the slow-roll approximation, with a dissipation coefficient linearly dependent on the temperature of the radiation bath. We then derive analytical expressions for the curvature power spectrum and the scalar index, in the cases of chaotic and exponential potentials of the inflationary field. Subsequently, we compare the theoretical predictions regarding the relic energy density of GWs with the stochastic GW background signal recently detected by the NANOGrav collaboration through the use of pulsar timing array measurements. In so doing, we obtain numerical constraints on the free parameters of the inflationary models under study. Finally, we conduct a model selection analysis through the Bayesian inference method to measure the statistical performance of the different theoretical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Cosmoglobe DR2. II. CIB monopole measurements from COBE-DIRBE through global Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive new constraints on the CIB monopole spectrum from reprocessed COBE-DIRBE sky maps with lower instrumental and astrophysical contamination than the legacy DIRBE maps. These maps have been generated through a global Bayesian analysis framework that simultaneously fits cosmological, astrophysical, and instrumental parameters, described in a series of papers referred to as Cosmoglobe DR2. We have applied this method to the DIRBE Calibrated Individual Observations, complemented by selected HFI and FIRAS sky maps to break key astrophysical degeneracies, as well as WISE and Gaia compact object catalogs. In this paper, we focus on CIB constraints that result from this work. We report detections of an isotropic signal in five out of the ten DIRBE bands (1.25, 2.2, 3.5, 140, and 240 $\mu$m). For the 2.2 $\mu$m channel, we find an amplitude of $13\pm3\,\mathrm{nW\,m^{-2}\,sr^{-1}}$, 36% lower than reported from the official DIRBE release. For the 240 $\mu$m channel, we find $10\pm3\,\mathrm{nW\,m^{-2}\,sr^{-1}}$, 26% lower than the official DIRBE release. We interpret these lower values as resulting from improved zodiacal light and Galactic foreground modeling. For the bands between 4.9 and 100 $\mu$m, the presence of excess radiation in solar-centric coordinates reported in a companion paper precludes the definition of lower limits. However, the analysis still provides well-defined upper limits. For the 12 $\mu$m channel, we find an upper 95% confidence limit of 103 $\mathrm{nW\,m^{-2}\,sr^{-1}}$, a factor of four lower than the corresponding legacy result of 468 $\mathrm{nW\,m^{-2}\,sr^{-1}}$. The results presented in this paper redefines the state-of-the-art CIB monopole constraints from COBE-DIRBE, and it provides a real-world illustration of the power of global end-to-end analysis of multiple complementary data sets which is the foundational idea of the Cosmoglobe project.</description>

      <title>Modelling the redshift-space cluster-galaxy correlation function on Mpc scales with emulation of the pairwise velocity distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for modelling the cluster-galaxy correlation function in redshift-space, down to ~ Mpc scales. The method builds upon the so-called Galaxy Infall Kinematics (GIK) model, a parametric model for the pairwise velocities of galaxies with respect to nearby galaxy clusters. We fit the parameters of the GIK model to a suite of simulations run with different cosmologies, and use Gaussian Processes to emulate how the GIK parameters depend upon cosmology. This emulator can then be combined with knowledge of the real-space clustering of clusters and galaxies, to predict the cluster-galaxy correlation function in redshift space. Fitting this model to an observed correlation function enables the extraction of cosmological parameter constraints, and we present forecasts for a DESI-like survey. We also perform tests of the robustness of our constraints from fitting to mock data extracted from N-body simulations, finding that fitting to scales &lt; 3 Mpc/h leads to a biased inference on cosmology, due to model misspecification on these scales. Finally, we discuss what steps will need to be taken in order to apply our method to real data.</description>

      <title>Detectability and Characterisation of Strongly Lensed Supernova Lightcurves in the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) was expected to detect more than one strong gravitationally-lensed supernova (glSN) per year, but only one event was identified in the first four years of the survey. This work investigates selection biases in the search strategy that could explain the discrepancy and revise discovery predictions. We present simulations of realistic lightcurves for lensed thermonuclear (glSNIa) and core-collapse supernova (glCCSN) explosions over a span of 5.33 years of the survey, utilizing the actual observation logs of ZTF. We find that the magnitude limit in spectroscopic screening significantly biases the selection towards highly magnified glSNe, for which the detection rates are consistent with the identification of a single object by ZTF. To reach the higher predicted rate of detections requires an optimization of the identification criteria for fainter objects. We find that around 1.36 (3.08) Type Ia SNe (CCSNe) are identifiable with the magnification method per year in ZTF, but when applying the magnitude cut of m &lt; 19 mag, the detection rates decrease to 0.17 (0.32) per year. We compare our simulations with the previously found lensed Type Ia SNe, iPTF16geu and SN Zwicky, and conclude that considering the bias towards highly magnified events, the findings are within expectations in terms of detection rates and lensing properties of the systems. In addition, we provide a set of selection cuts based on simple observables to distinguish glSNe from regular, unlensed, supernovae to select potential candidates for spectroscopic and high-spatial resolution follow-up campaigns. We find optimal cuts in observed colours $g-r$, $g-i$, and $r-i$ as well as in the colour SALT2 fit parameter. The developed pipeline and the simulated lightcurves employed in this analysis can be found in the $LENSIT$ github repository.</description>

      <title>A simple model of magnetic universe without singularity associated with a quadratic equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A model of magnetic universe based on nonlinear electrodynamics has been introduced by Kruglov. This model describes an early inflation era followed by a radiation era. We show that this model is related to our model of universe based on a quadratic equation of state. We discuss two quantitatively different models of early universe. In Model I, the primordial density of the universe is identified with the Planck density. At $t=0$, the universe had the characteristics of a Planck black hole. During the inflation, which takes place on a Planck timescale, the size of the universe evolves from the Planck length to a size comparable to the Compton wavelength of the neutrino. If we interpret the radius of the universe at the end of the inflation (neutrino's Compton wavelength) as a minimum length related to quantum gravity and use Zeldovich's first formula of the vacuum energy, we obtain the correct value of the cosmological constant. In Model II, the primordial density of the universe is identified with the electron density as a consequence of nonlinear electrodynamics. At $t=0$, the universe had the characteristics of an electron. During the inflation, which takes place on a gravitoelectronic timescale, the size of the universe evolves from the electron's classical radius to a size comparable to the size of a dark energy star of the stellar mass. If we interpret the radius of the universe at the begining of the inflation (electron's classical radius) as a minimum length related to quantum gravity and use Zeldovich's second formula of the vacuum energy, we obtain the correct value of the cosmological constant. This provides an accurate form of Eddington relation between the cosmological constant and the mass of the electron. We also introduce a nonlinear electromagnetic Lagrangian that describes simultaneously the early inflation, the radiation era, and the dark energy era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators encode invaluable information about the wavefunction that characterises the state of the primordial universe. In this letter we present a simple yet novel duality between correlators and wavefunction coefficients that is valid to all orders in the loop expansion. The duality manifests itself as a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry in the correspondence between correlators and the physical parts of wavefunction coefficients. To demonstrate the power of the duality already at tree-level, we derive a correlator-to-correlator factorisation (CCF) formula for the parity-odd part of cosmological correlators that relates $n$-point observables to lower-point ones via a series of diagrammatic cuts. These relations are in principle testable as they involve observables defined for arbitrary physical kinematics (i.e. without performing any analytic continuation or taking any soft limits). For $n=4$, the CCF formula provides a relation between the parity-odd part of the trispectrum of curvature perturbations, the bispectra involving two curvature perturbations and an additional state with a complementary series mass and integer spin, and the power spectrum of this additional state.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey. X-ray emission from the warm-hot phase gas in long cosmic filaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) in the cosmic filaments are among the least quantified in modern astrophysics. eROSITA All Sky Survey (eRASS) provides us with a unique opportunity to study the X-ray emission of the WHIM. We applied both imaging and spectroscopic stacking techniques to the data of the first four eRASS scans to inspect the X-ray emissions from 7817 cosmic filaments identified from Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical galaxy samples. We obtained a 9-sigma significant detection of the total X-ray signal from filaments in the 0.3-1.2 keV band. We introduce a novel method to estimate the contamination fraction from unmasked X-ray halos, active galactic nuclei, and X-ray binaries that are associated with galaxies in filaments. We found an approximately 40% contamination fraction by these unmasked sources, suggesting that the remaining 60% of the signal could be from the WHIM and a 5.4-sigma detection significance of the WHIM. Moreover, we modeled the temperature and baryon density contrast of the detected WHIM by fitting the stacked spectrum and surface brightness profile. The best-fit temperature log(T/k)=6.84+/-0.07 obtained by using a single temperature model is marginally higher than the simulation results, which could be due to the fitting of a single temperature model on a multi-temperature spectrum. The best-fit baryon density contrast log\Delta_b=1.88+/-0.18 generally agrees with the X-ray emitting phases in the IllustrisTNG simulation, suggesting that the broadband X-ray emission traces the high temperature and density end of the entire WHIM population.</description>

      <title>Formation and decay of oscillons after inflation in the presence of an external coupling, Part-I: Lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation and decay of oscillons during the post-inflationary reheating epoch from inflaton oscillations around asymptotically flat potentials $V(\varphi)$ in the presence of an external coupling of the form $\frac{1}{2}\, g^2 \, \varphi^2 \, \chi^2$. It is well-known that in the absence of such an external coupling, the attractive self-interaction term in the potential leads to the formation of copious amounts of long-lived oscillons both for symmetric and asymmetric plateau potentials. We perform a detailed numerical analysis to study the formation of oscillons in the $\alpha$-attractor E- and T-model potentials using the publicly available lattice simulation code ${\cal C}$osmo${\cal L}$attice. We observe the formation of nonlinear oscillon-like structures with the average equation of state $\langle w_\varphi\rangle \simeq 0$ for a range of values of the inflaton self-coupling $\lambda$ and the external coupling $g^2$. Our results demonstrate that oscillons form even in the presence of an external coupling and we determine the upper bound on $g^2$ which facilitates oscillon formation. We also find that eventually, these oscillons decay into the scalar inflaton radiation as well as into the quanta of the offspring field $\chi$. Thus, we establish the possibility that reheating could have proceeded through the channel of oscillon decay, along with the usual decay of the oscillating inflaton condensate into $\chi$ particles. For a given value of the self-coupling $\lambda$, we notice that the lifetime of a population of oscillons decreases with an increase in the strength of the external coupling, following an (approximately) inverse power-law dependence on $g^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical origins of the majority of the IceCube neutrinos remain unknown. Effectively characterizing the spatial distribution of the neutrino samples and associating the events with astrophysical source catalogs can be challenging given the large atmospheric neutrino background and underlying non-Gaussian spatial features in the neutrino and source samples. In this paper, we investigate a framework for identifying and statistically evaluating the cross-correlations between IceCube data and an astrophysical source catalog based on the $k$-Nearest Neighbor Cumulative Distribution Functions ($k$NN-CDFs). We propose a maximum likelihood estimation procedure for inferring the true proportions of astrophysical neutrinos in the point-source data. We conduct a statistical power analysis of an associated likelihood ratio test with estimations of its sensitivity and discovery potential with synthetic neutrino data samples and a WISE-2MASS galaxy sample. We apply the method to IceCube's public ten-year point-source data and find no statistically significant evidence for spatial cross-correlations with the selected galaxy sample. We discuss possible extensions to the current method and explore the method's potential to identify the cross-correlation signals in data sets with different sample sizes.</description>

      <title>Probing flavored regimes of leptogenesis with gravitational waves from cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings radiate detectable gravitational waves in models featuring high-scale symmetry breaking, e.g., high-scale leptogenesis. In this Letter, for the first time, we show that different flavored regimes of high-scale leptogenesis can be tested distinctly with the spectral features in cosmic string-radiated gravitational waves. This is possible if the scalar field that makes right-handed neutrinos massive is feebly coupled to the Standard Model Higgs. Each flavored regime, sensitive to low-energy neutrino experiments, leaves a marked imprint on the gravitational waves spectrum. A three-flavor and a two-flavor regime could be probed by a characteristic fall-off of the gravitational wave spectrum at the LISA-DECIGO-ET frequency bands with preceding scale-invariant amplitudes bounded from above and below. We present Gravitational Waves windows for Flavored Regimes of Leptogenesis (GWFRL) falsifiable in the upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Emergent Cosmological Expansion in Scalar-Tensor Theories of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the emergence of large-scale cosmological expansion in scalar-tensor theories of gravity. This is achieved by modelling sub-horizon regions of space-time as weak-field expansions around Minkowski space, and then subsequently joining many such regions together to create a statistically homogeneous and isotropic cosmology. We find that when the scalar field can be treated perturbatively, the cosmological behaviour that emerges is well modelled by the Friedmann solutions of the theory. When non-perturbative screening mechanisms occur this result no longer holds, and in the case of scalar fields subject to the chameleon mechanism we find significant deviations from the expected Friedmann behaviour. In particular, the screened mass no longer contributes to the Klein-Gordon equation, suppressing deviations from general relativistic behaviour.</description>

      <title>Relativistic interacting fluids in cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by cosmological applications for interacting matters, an extension of the action functional for relativistic fluids is proposed to incorporate the physics of non-adiabatic processes and chemical reactions. The former are characterised by entropy growth, while the latter violate particle number conservation. The relevance of these physics is demonstrated in the contexts of self-interacting fluids, fluids interacting with scalar fields, and hyperhydrodynamical interactions with geometry. The possible cosmological applications range from early-universe phase transitions to astrophysical phenomena, and from matter creation inflationary alternatives to interacting dark sector alternatives to the $\Lambda$CDM model that aim to address its tensions. As an example of the latter, a single fluid model of a unified dark sector is presented. The simple action of the model features one field and one parameter, yet it can both reproduce the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and predict new phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Relic neutrino decay: a solution to the excess radio background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of excess radio background detected by ARCADE 2 suggests the presence of new physics as there exists no clear astrophysical solution. We find that the radiative decay of a relic neutrino into a sterile neutrino, assumed to be quasi-degenerate, provides a very good fit to ARCADE 2 data. The solution also predicts a stronger 21 cm absorption global signal than the predicted one from the $\Lambda$CDM model, with a contrast brightness temperature. The solution obtained is in mild tension with a much stronger signal claimed by the EDGES collaboration.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the behaviour of a minimally coupled tachyonic scalar field at inflection points in an accelerating universe. We consider the different expansion factors and obtain potentials of tachyonic scalar field. Inflection points of homogeneous tachyonic scalar field is calculated for these potentials.

      <title>The hydrodynamics of inverse phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First order phase transitions are violent phenomena that occur when the state of the universe evolves abruptly from one vacuum to another. A \emph{direct} phase transition connects a local vacuum to a deeper vacuum of the zero--temperature potential, and the energy difference between the two minima manifests itself in the acceleration of the bubble wall. In this sense, the transition is triggered by the release of vacuum energy. On the other hand, an \emph{inverse} phase transition connects a deeper minimum of the zero--temperature potential to a higher one, and the bubble actually expands against the vacuum energy. The transition is then triggered purely by thermal corrections. We study for the first time the hydrodynamics and the energy budget of inverse phase transitions. We find several modes of expansion for inverse bubbles, which are related to the known ones for direct transitions by a mirror symmetry. We finally investigate the friction exerted on the bubble wall and comment on the possibility of runaway walls in inverse phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: We describe an algorithm to generate temperature and polarization maps of the cosmic microwave background radiation containing non-Gaussianity of arbitrary local type. We apply an optimized quadrature scheme that allows us to predict and control integration accuracy, speed up the calculations, and reduce memory consumption by an order of magnitude. We generate 1000 non-Gaussian CMB temperature and polarization maps up to a multipole moment of l_max = 1024. We validate the method and code using the power spectrum and the fast cubic (bispectrum) estimator and find consistent results. The simulations are provided to the community.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the physics of second-order gravitational waves (GWs) induced by scalar-tensor perturbation interactions in the radiation-dominated Universe. We investigate the distinctive signatures of these GWs and their detectability compared to scalar-induced GWs. Unlike scalar-scalar induced GWs, scalar-tensor induced GWs do not present resonances or a logarithmic running in the low frequency tail in the case of peaked primordial spectra. But, interestingly, they partly inherit any primordial parity violation of tensor modes. We find that chirality in primordial GWs can lead to distinguishing effects in scalar-tensor induced GWs in the ultraviolet (UV) region. We also address a potential divergence in our GWs and explore possible solutions. This study contributes to our understanding of GWs in the early Universe and their implications for cosmology and GWs detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The compelling evidence for the detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background by NANOGrav imposes constraints on the mass of compact cores of ultralight dark matter, also known as "solitons", surrounding supermassive black holes found at the centers of large galaxies. The strong dynamical friction between the rotating black holes and the solitons competes with gravitational emission, resulting in a suppression of the characteristic strain in the nHz frequency range. Our findings robustly rule out ultralight dark matter particles with masses ranging from $1.3\times 10^{-21}$ eV to $1.4\times 10^{-20}$ eV condensing into solitons around supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Searching for local features in primordial power spectrum using genetic algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology for exploring local features directly in the primordial power spectrum using a genetic algorithm (GA) pipeline coupled with a Boltzmann solver and Cosmic Microwave Background data (CMB). After testing the robustness of our pipeline using mock data, we apply it to the latest CMB data, including Planck 2018 and CamSpec PR4. Our model-independent approach provides an analytical reconstruction of the power spectra that best fits the data, with the unsupervised machine learning algorithm exploring a functional space built off simple ``grammar'' functions. We find significant improvements upon the simple power-law behaviour, by $\Delta \chi^2 \lesssim -21$, consistently with more traditional model-based approaches. These best-fits always address both the low$\ell$ anomaly in the TT spectrum and the residual high$\ell$ oscillations in the TT, TE and EE spectra. The proposed pipeline provides an adaptable tool for exploring features in the primordial power spectrum in a model-independent way, providing valuable hints to theorists for constructing viable inflationary models that are consistent with the current and upcoming CMB surveys.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes without fine-tuning from a light stochastic spectator field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a mechanism of primordial black hole (PBH) formation that avoids any dependence on specific inflationary features or exotic physics. In this scenario, the required large curvature fluctuations leading to PBH formation are generated after inflation by the quantum fluctuations of a light stochastic spectator field during inflation, when this field transiently dominates the energy density. We calculate the dynamics of such a spectator field during and after inflation, the distribution of induced curvature perturbations and their non-Gaussian tails leading to the copious production of PBHs. For a plateau-like potential, this scenario produces an extended PBH mass distribution with a peak at the solar-mass scale when one takes into account the effects of the thermal history. What is remarkable in this scenario is the absence of parameter fine-tuning. Instead, it invokes an anthropic selection over all the realizations of PBH abundances predicted by the field stochasticity. This scenario offers a novel perspective for the formation of PBHs with minimal ingredients and without the need of fine-tuning. It is amenable to observational tests, notably with the gravitational-wave observations of black hole mergers and of a background at nanoHertz frequency, as recently observed by pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Model For Intrinsic Alignments: Insights From Cosmological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend current models of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) to include a flexible, empirical framework for the forward modeling of the intrinsic alignment (IA) of galaxies. A primary goal of this work is to produce mock galaxy catalogs for the purpose of validating existing models and methods for the mitigation of IA in weak lensing measurements. This technique can also be used to produce new, simulation-based predictions for IA and galaxy clustering. Our model is probabilistically formulated, and rests upon the assumption that the orientations of galaxies exhibit a correlation with their host dark matter (sub)halo orientation or with their position within the halo. We examine the necessary components and phenomenology of such a model by considering the alignments between (sub)halos in a cosmological dark matter only simulation. We then validate this model for a realistic galaxy population in a set of simulations in the IllustrisTNG suite. We create an HOD mock with TNG-like correlations using our method, constraining the associated IA model parameters, with the $\chi^2_{\rm dof}$ between our model's correlations and those of Illustris matching as closely as 1.4 and 1.1 for orientation--position and orientation--orientation correlation functions, respectively. By modeling the misalignment between galaxies and their host halo, we show that the 3-dimensional two-point position and orientation correlation functions of simulated (sub)halos and galaxies can be accurately reproduced from quasi-linear scales down to $0.1~h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. We also find evidence for environmental influence on IA within a halo. Our publicly-available software provides a key component enabling efficient determination of Bayesian posteriors on IA model parameters using observational measurements of galaxy-orientation correlation functions in the highly nonlinear regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic shear and cosmic magnification reflect the same gravitational lensing field. Each of these two probes are affected by different systematics. We study the auto- and cross-correlations of the cosmic shear from the China Space Survey Telescope (CSST) and cosmic magnification of supernovae from Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). We want to answer, to what extent, by adding the magnification data we can remove the systematic bias in cosmic shear measurement. We generate the mock shear/magnification maps based on the correlation between of different tomographic bins. After obtaining the corrected power spectra, we adopt the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to fit the theoretical models, and investigate the constraints on the cosmological and nuisance parameters. We find that the with only cosmic shear data, there are $1\sigma$ bias in $\sigma_8$ and intrinsic alignment model parameters. By adding the magnification data, we are able to remove these biases perfectly.</description>

      <title>Can Primordial Black Holes form in the Standard Model ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the viability of primordial black hole (PBH) formation in the Standard Model (SM) in a scenario that does not rely on specific inflationary features or any exotic physics such as phase transitions or non-minimal coupling to gravity. If the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) field lies exactly at the transition between metastability and stability, its potential exhibits an inflexion point due to radiative corrections. The BEH can act like a stochastic curvaton field, leading to a non-Gaussian tail of large curvature fluctuations that later collapse into PBHs when they re-enter inside the horizon. This scenario would require a precise value of the top-quark mas to ensure the Higgs stability, which is disfavored but still consistent with the most recent measurements. However, we also find that large curvature fluctuations are also generated on cosmological scales that are inconsistent with cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. We therefore conclude that the SM cannot have led to the formation of PBHs based on this mechanism. Nevertheless, a variation of the scenario based on the Palatini formulation of gravity may have provided the conditions to produce stellar-mass PBHs with an abundance comparable to dark matter, without producing too large curvature fluctuations on cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting dark matter solves the final parsec problem of supermassive black hole mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14450v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, plausibly originating from the merger of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), is accumulating with observations from pulsar timing arrays. An outstanding question is how inspiraling SMBHs get past the "final parsec" of separation, where they have a tendency to stall before GW emission alone can make the binary coalesce. We argue that dynamical friction from the dark matter (DM) spike surrounding the black holes is sufficient to resolve this puzzle, if the DM has a self-interaction cross section of order $\,$cm$^2$/g. The same effect leads to a softening of the GW spectrum at low frequencies as suggested by the current data. For collisionless cold DM, the friction deposits so much energy that the spike is disrupted and cannot bridge the final parsec, while for self-interacting DM, the isothermal core of the halo can act as a reservoir for the energy liberated from the SMBH orbits. A realistic velocity dependence, such as generated by the exchange of a massive mediator like a dark photon, is favored to give a good fit to the GW spectrum while providing a large enough core. A similar velocity dependence has been advocated for solving the small-scale structure problems of cold DM.</description>

Abstract: Galaxy cluster gas temperatures ($T$) play a crucial role in many cosmological and astrophysical studies. However, it has been shown that $T$ measurements can vary between different X-ray telescopes. These $T$ biases can propagate to several cluster applications for which $T$ can be used. Thus, it is important to accurately cross-calibrate X-ray instruments to account for systematic biases. In this work, we present the cross-calibration between SRG/eROSITA and Chandra/ACIS, and between SRG/eROSITA and XMM-Newton/EPIC, using for the first time a large sample of galaxy cluster $T$. To do so, we use the first eROSITA All-Sky Survey data and a large X-ray flux-limited cluster catalog. We measure X-ray $T$ for 186 independent cluster regions with both SRG/eROSITA and Chandra/ACIS in a self-consistent way, for three energy bands; 0.7-7 keV (full), 0.5-4 keV (soft), and 1.5-7 keV (hard). We do the same with SRG/eROSITA and XMM-Newton/EPIC for 71 different cluster regions and all three bands. We find that SRG/eROSITA measures systematically lower $T$ than the other two instruments. For the full band, SRG/eROSITA returns 20$\%$ and 14$\%$ lower $T$ than Chandra/ACIS and XMM-Newton/EPIC respectively, when the two latter instruments measure $k_{\text{B}}T\approx 3$ keV each. The discrepancy increases to 38\% and 32\% when Chandra/ACIS and XMM-Newton/EPIC measure $k_{\text{B}}T\approx 10$ keV respectively. For low-$T$ galaxy groups, the discrepancy becomes milder. The soft band shows a marginally lower discrepancy than the full band. In the hard band, the cross-calibration of SRG/eROSITA and the other instruments show stronger differences. We could not identify any possible systematic biases that significantly alleviated the tension. Finally, we provide conversion factors between SRG/eROSITA, Chandra/ACIS, and XMM-Newton/EPIC $T$ which will be beneficial for future cluster studies.</description>

Abstract: Anisotropies in the distance-redshift relation of cosmological sources are expected due to large-scale inhomogeneities in the local Universe. When the observed sources are tracing a large-scale matter flow in a general spacetime geometry, the distance-redshift relation with its anisotropies can be described with a geometrical prediction that generalises the well-known Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker result. Furthermore, it turns out that a finite set of multipole coefficients contain the full information about a finite-order truncation of the distance-redshift relation of a given observer. The multipoles of the distance-redshift relation are interesting new cosmological observables that have a direct physical interpretation in terms of kinematical quantities of the underlying matter flow. Using light cones extracted from $N$-body simulations we quantify the anisotropies expected in a $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmology by running a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis on the observed data. In this observational approach the survey selection implements an implicit smoothing scale over which the effective rest frame of matter is fitted. The perceived anisotropy therefore depends significantly on the redshift range and distribution of sources. We find that the multipoles of the expansion rate, as well as the observer's velocity with respect to the large-scale matter flow, can be determined robustly with our approach.</description>

      <title>Towards a new model-independent calibration of Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current data on baryon acoustic oscillations and Supernovae of Type Ia cover up to $z\sim 2.5$. These observations play a very important role in the determination of cosmological parameters and have been widely used to constrain the $\Lambda$CDM and models beyond it. To extend the investigation to higher $z$, Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) stand out as one of the most promising observables since can probe the universe up to $z\sim9.4$. The use of GRB correlations is still a challenge due to the spread in their intrinsic properties. In this work, we propose an innovative and cosmology-independent method of calibration of the so-called 3D Dainotti correlation. We employ state-of-the-art data on Cosmic Chronometers (CCH) at $z\lesssim2$ and use the Gaussian Processes reconstruction tool. To match the CCH redshift range, we select 20 long GRBs in $0.553\leq z\leq1.96$ from the Platinum sample, which consists of well-defined GRB plateau properties that obey the fundamental plane relation. We verify that the choice of priors on the parameters of the Dainotti relation and the modelling of CCH uncertainties and covariance have negligible impact on our results. We also consider the case in which the redshift evolution of the physical features of the plane is accounted for. We find that the use of CCH allows us to identify a sub-sample of GRBs that adhere even more closely to the fundamental plane relation, with an intrinsic scatter of $\sigma_{int}=0.20^{+0.03}_{-0.05}$ when evolutionary effects are considered. In an epoch in which we strive to reduce uncertainties on the GRB correlations variables to tighten constraints on cosmological parameters, we have found a novel model-independent approach to pinpoint a sub-sample that can thus represent a valuable set of standardizable candles. This allows us to extend the distance ladder presenting a new catalogue of calibrated luminosity distances up to $z=5$.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms for producing Primordial Black Holes from Inflationary Models Beyond Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present an analysis of the fine-tuning required in various inflationary models in order to explain the production of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). We specifically examine the degree of fine-tuning necessary in two prominent single field inflationary models: those with an inflection point and those with step-like features in the potential. Our findings indicate that models with step-like features generally require less fine-tuning compared to those with an inflection point, making them more viable for consistent PBH production. An interesting outcome of these models is that, in addition to improved fine-tuning, they may also predict low-frequency signals that can be detected by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations. Additionally, we extend our analysis to multifield inflationary models to assess whether the integration of additional fields can further alleviate the fine-tuning demands. The study also explores the role of a spectator field and its impact on the fine-tuning process. Through a comparative analysis across these models, we evaluate their parametric sensitivities and alignment with the constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. Our results indicate that although mechanisms involving a spectator field can circumvent the issue of fine-tuning parameters for PBH production, both multifield models and models with step-like features present promising alternatives. While fine-tuning involves multiple considerations, our primary objective is to evaluate various inflationary models to identify the one that most naturally explains the formation of PBHs. Hence, this study aims to the development of less constrained inflationary scenarios that align with observational data and support the theoretical possibility of PBH production.</description>

      <title>Double Inflation in Classically Conformal $B-L$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been shown in Ref. [1] that the double-inflation scenario based on the Coleman-Weinberg potential can successfully generate primordial black holes (PBHs) with the inflationary predictions consistent with the Planck measurements. These PBHs can play the role of dark matter in our universe. In this paper, we propose the classically conformal minimal $B-L$ model as an ultra-violet (UV) completion of the scenario. In our model, the $B-L$ Higgs field is identified with the inflaton and the electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by the radiative $B-L$ symmetry breaking with the Coleman-Weinberg potential. We show that this UV completion leads to a viable cosmological history after the double inflaton: the universe is reheated via inflaton decay into right-handed neutrinos whose mass is determined consistently by a relation between the number of e-folds and reheating temperature. Using the general parameterization for neutrino Dirac Yukawa couplings through the seesaw mechanism and the neutrino oscillation data, we also show that the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe is successfully reproduced by either resonant leptogenesis or non-thermal leptogenesis. Based on the scalar power spectrum shown in Ref. [1], we evaluate the scalar induced gravitational wave spectrum, which can be tested by various proposed gravitational wave observatories like BBO, DECIGO etc.</description>

      <title>Bulk Flow Motion Detection in the Local Universe with Pantheon$+$ Type Ia Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The {\em bulk flow} in the Local Universe is a collective phenomenon due to the peculiar motions of matter structures, which, instead of moving in random directions, appears to follow an approximate dipole velocity flow. We apply a directional analysis to investigate, through the Hubble-Lema\^{\i}tre diagram, the angular dependence of the Hubble constant $H_0$ of a sample of Type Ia Supernovae from the Pantheon+ catalog in the Local Universe ($0.015 \le z \le 0.06$). We perform a directional analysis that reveals a statistically significant dipole variation of $H_0$, at more than $99.9\%$ confidence level, showing that matter structures follow a dipole bulk flow motion towards $(l,b) = (326.^\circ1 \pm 11.^\circ2,27.^\circ8 \pm 11.^\circ2)$, close to the Shapley supercluster $(l_{\scalebox{0.6}{Shapley}},b_{\scalebox{0.6}{Shapley}}) = (311.^\circ5, 32.^\circ3)$, with velocity $132.14 \pm 109.3$ km s$^{-1}$ at the effective distance $102.83 \pm 10.2$~Mpc. Interestingly, the antipodal direction of this dipole points close to the Dipole Repeller structure. Our analyses confirm that the gravitational dipole system Shapley-Dipole Repeller explains well the observed bulk flow velocity field in the Local Universe. Furthermore, we performed robustness tests that support our results. Additionally, our approach provides a measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0 = 70.39 \pm 1.4$~\text{km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$}, at the effective distance $102.8$~Mpc, $z \simeq 0.025$. Note that this value was obtained using the first order approximation of the Hubble law because our methodology is model-independent. If one assumes, for instance, cosmography at second order with the $\Lambda$CDM value $q_0 = -0.55$, which is a model-dependent hypothesis, then $H_0 = 72.6 \pm 1.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, but our results: bulk flow velocity, dipole direction and its statistical significance remain the same.</description>

      <title>Comparing sharp and smooth transitions of the second slow-roll parameter in single-field inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In single-field inflation, violation of the slow-roll approximation can lead to growth of curvature perturbation outside the horizon. This violation is characterized by a period with a large negative value of the second slow-roll parameter. At an early time, inflation must satisfy the slow-roll approximation, so the large-scale curvature perturbation can explain the cosmic microwave background fluctuations. At intermediate time, it is viable to have a theory that violates the slow-roll approximation, which implies amplification of the curvature perturbation on small scales. Specifically, we consider ultraslow-roll inflation as the intermediate period. At late time, inflation should go back to the slow roll period so that it can end. This means that there are two transitions of the second slow-roll parameter. In this paper, we compare two different possibilities for the second transition: sharp and smooth transitions. Focusing on effects generated by the relevant cubic self-interaction of the curvature perturbation, we find that the bispectrum and one-loop correction to the power spectrum due to the change of the second slow-roll parameter vanish if and only if the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation for perturbation satisfies a specific condition called Wands duality. We also find in the case of sharp transition that, even though this duality is satisfied in the ultraslow-roll and slow-roll phases, it is severely violated at the transition so that the resultant one-loop correction is extremely large inversely proportional to the duration of the transition.</description>

      <title>Generating large primordial fluctuations in single-field inflation for PBH formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to produce appreciable amount of primordial black holes (PBHs), the square amplitude of curvature perturbation must take a large value of $\mathcal{O}(0.01)$, namely, seven digits larger than the value observed by cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) on large scales. Such a large fluctuation can be achieved by violating the slow-roll (SR) condition within a short duration. The best known of such possibilities is the ultraslow-roll (USR) inflation. We calculate the power spectrum of curvature perturbation in a simple single-field inflation model which evolves through the SR-USR-SR regimes so that both large-amplitude small-scale fluctuation for PBH formation and small-amplitude large-scale fluctuation as observed by CMB are realized. We further calculate the bispectrum and one-loop correction to the power spectrum induced by the third-order action of curvature perturbation as the beginning of precision cosmology on small scales. As a result, we show that single-field inflation model realizing PBH formation can be constrained by the quantum correction.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves and tadpole resummation: Efficient and easy convergence of finite temperature QFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate analytically and numerically that "optimized partial dressing" (OPD) thermal mass resummation, which uses gap equation solutions inserted into the tadpole, efficiently tames finite-temperature perturbation theory calculations of the effective thermal potential, without necessitating use of the high-temperature approximation. An analytical estimate of the scale dependence for OPD resummation, standard Parwani resummation (Daisy resummation), and dimensional reduction shows that OPD has similar scale dependence to dimensional reduction, greatly improving Parwani resummation. We also elucidate how to construct and solve the gap equation for realistic numerical calculations, and demonstrate OPD's improved accuracy for a toy scalar model. OPD's improved accuracy is most physically significant when the high-temperature approximation breaks down, rendering dimensional reduction unusable and Parwani resummation highly inaccurate, with the latter underestimating the maximal gravitational wave amplitude for the model by 2 orders of magnitude compared to OPD. Our work highlights the need to bring theoretical uncertainties under control even when analyzing broad features of a model. Given the simplicity of the OPD compared to two-loop dimensional reduction, as well as the ease with which this scheme handles departures from the high-temperature expansion, we argue this scheme has great potential in analyzing the parameter space of realistic beyond the Standard Model models.</description>

Abstract: A variety of supergravity and string models involve hidden sectors where the hidden sectors may couple feebly with the visible sectors via a variety of portals. While the coupling of the hidden sector to the visible sector is feeble its coupling to the inflaton is largely unknown. It could couple feebly or with the same strength as the visible sector which would result in either a cold or a hot hidden sector at the end of reheating. These two possibilities could lead to significantly different outcomes for observables. We investigate the thermal evolution of the two sectors in a cosmologically consistent hidden sector dark matter model where the hidden sector and the visible sector are thermally coupled. Within this framework we analyze several phenomena to illustrate their dependence on the initial conditions. These include the allowed parameter space of models, dark matter relic density, proton-dark matter cross section, effective massless neutrino species at BBN time, self-interacting dark matter cross-section, where self-interaction occurs via exchange of dark photon, and Sommerfeld enhancement. Finally fits to the velocity dependence of dark matter cross sections from galaxy scales to the scale of galaxy clusters is given. The analysis indicates significant effects of the initial conditions on the observables listed above. The analysis is carried out within the framework where dark matter is constituted of dark fermions and the mediation between the visible and the hidden sector occurs via the exchange of dark photons. The techniques discussed here may have applications for a wider class of hidden sector models using different mediations between the visible and the hidden sectors to explore the impact of Big Bang initial conditions on observable physics.</description>

      <title>Particle production from non-minimal coupling in a symmetry breaking potential transporting vacuum energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an inflationary scenario where the inflaton field is non-minimally coupled to spacetime curvature and inflation is driven by a vacuum energy symmetry breaking potential without specifying \emph{a priori} whether the inflaton field is small or large. As we incorporate vacuum energy into our analysis, we further explore the implications of a non-zero potential offset in relation to the emergence of inflationary dynamics. Thus, we propose that vacuum energy can transform into particles as a result of the transition triggered by spontaneous symmetry breaking. This entails a vacuum energy cancellation that yields an effective cosmological constant during inflation by virtue of a quasi-de Sitter evolution and shows that the vacuum energy contribution can manifest as \emph{geometric particles} produced by inflaton fluctuations, with particular emphasis on super-Hubble modes. We conjecture these particles as \emph{quasi-particles} arising from interaction between the inflaton and spacetime geometry, enhanced by non-minimal coupling. Specifically, we propose that dark matter arises from a pure geometric quasi-particle contribution, and we quantify the corresponding dark matter candidate ranges of mass. In this scenario, we further find that a zero potential offset leads to a bare cosmological constant at the end of inflation, while a negative offset would require an additional kinetic (or potential) contribution in order to be fully-canceled. In this regard, we conclude that the scenario of large field inflaton is preferred since it necessitates a more appropriate selection of the offset. Our conclusion is reinforced as small field inflaton would lead to a significant screening of the Newtonian gravitational constant as inflation ends.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Free Starbursts at Cosmic Dawn: Observable Predictions for JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the analysis of a physical model within the standard cosmology that robustly predicts a high star-formation efficiency (SFE) in massive galaxies at cosmic dawn due to feedback-free starbursts (FFBs). It implies an excess of bright galaxies at z&gt;~10 compared to the standard models based on the low SFE at later epochs, an excess indicated by JWST observations. Here we provide observable predictions based on the analytic FFB scenario. These can be compared with simulations and JWST observations. We approximate the SFE as a function of redshift and mass, assuming a maximum SFE of 0.2~1 in the FFB regime. From this, we derive the evolution of the galaxy mass and luminosity functions as well as the evolution of stellar and star-formation densities. We then predict the star-formation history (SFH), galaxy sizes, outflows, gas fractions, metallicities, and dust attenuation, all as functions of mass and redshift in the FFB regime. The major distinguishing feature is the occurrence of FFBs above a mass threshold that declines with redshift. The luminosities and star formation rates in bright galaxies are predicted to be in excess of extrapolations of standard empirical models and cosmological simulations, an excess that grows from z~9 to higher redshifts. The FFB phase of ~100 Myr is predicted to show a characteristic SFH that fluctuates on a timescale of ~10 Myr. The stellar systems are compact (Re~0.3 kpc at z~10 and declining with z). The galactic gas consists of a steady wind driven by supernovae from earlier generations, with high outflow velocities (FWHM~1400-6700km/s), low gas fractions (&lt;0.1), low metallicities (&lt;~0.1 solar), and low dust attenuation ($A_{UV}$~0.5 at z~10 and declining with z). We make tentative comparisons with current JWST observations for initial insights, anticipating more complete and reliable datasets for detailed quantitative comparisons in the future.</description>

Abstract: It was proposed that acoustic perturbations generated by the QCD phase transition could create an inverse turbulent cascade \cite{Kalaydzhyan:2014wca}. An assumption was that propagation toward smaller momenta could reach the wavelength of a few km, the Universe's size at the time. Such acoustic waves were proposed to be the source of gravity waves. The kilometer wavelength corresponds to year-long gravity wave today, which were recently discovered using pulsar correlations. This paper argues further that an acoustic turbulence must be an ensemble of shocks. This brings two consequences: First, shocks generate gravity waves much more efficiently than sound waves due to the intermittency of matter distribution. We reconsider gravity wave radiation, using universal emission theory for soft radiation, and argue that soft-momenta plateau should reach wavelengths of the order of shock mean free paths. Second, collisions of shock waves create local density excess, which may create primordial black holes. A good tool to settle this issue can be an evaluation of the {\em trapped surfaces} like it was done in studies of heavy ion collisions using AdS/CFT correspondence</description>

      <title>Anti-de Sitter $\to$ de Sitter transition driven by Casimir forces and mitigating tensions in cosmological parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12352v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last few years, low- and high-redshift observations set off tensions in the measurement of the present-day expansion rate $H_0$ and in the determination of the amplitude of the matter clustering in the late Universe (parameterized by $S_8$). It was recently noted that both these tensions can be resolved if the cosmological constant parametrizing the dark energy content switches its sign at a critical redshift $z_c \sim 2$. However, the anti-de Sitter (AdS) swampland conjecture suggests that the postulated switch in sign of the cosmological constant at zero temperature seems unlikely because the AdS vacua are an infinite distance appart from de Sitter (dS) vacua in moduli space. We provide an explanation for the required AdS $\to$ dS crossover transition in the vacuum energy using the Casimir forces of fields inhabiting the bulk. We then use entropy arguments to claim that any AdS $\to$ dS transition between metastable vacua must be accompanied by a reduction of the species scale where gravity becomes strong. We provide a few examples supporting this AdS $\to$ dS uplift conjecture.</description>

      <title>Phase-space analysis in non-minimal symmetric-teleparallel dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We modify the symmetric-teleparallel dark energy through the addition of a further Yukawa-like term, in which the non-metricity scalar, $Q$, is non-minimally coupled to a scalar field Lagrangian where the phion acts as quintessence, describing dark energy. We investigate regions of stability and find late-time attractors. To do so, we conduct a stability analysis for different types of physical potentials describing dark energy, namely the power-law, inverse power-law, and exponential potentials. Within these choices, we furthermore single out particular limiting cases, such as the constant, linear and inverse potentials. For all the considered scenarios, regions of stability are calculated in terms of the signs of the coupling constant and the exponent, revealing a clear degeneracy among coefficients necessary to ensure stability. We find that a generic power-law potential with $\alpha &gt; 0$ is not suitable as a non-minimal quintessence potential and we put severe limits on the use of inverse potential, as well. In addition, the equations of state of each potential have been also computed. We find the constant potential seems to be favored than other treatments, since the critical point appears independent of the non-minimal coupling.</description>

      <title>An \'Etude on the Regularization and Renormalization of Divergences in Primordial Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many cosmological observables of interest derive from primordial vacuum fluctuations evolved to late times. These observables represent statistical draws from some underlying quantum or statistical field theoretic framework where infinities arise and require regularization. After subtracting divergences, renormalization conditions must be imposed by measurements or observations at some scale, mindful of scheme and background dependence. We review this process on backgrounds that transition from finite duration inflation to radiation domination, and show how in spite of the ubiquity of scaleless integrals, UV divergences can still be meaningfully extracted from quantities that nominally vanish when dimensionally regularized. In this way, one can contextualize calculations with hard cutoffs, distinguishing between UV and IR scales corresponding to the beginning and end of inflation from UV and IR scales corresponding the unknown completion of the theory and its observables. This distinction has significance as observable quantities cannot depend on the latter although they will certainly depend on the former. One can also explicitly show the scheme independence of the coefficients of UV divergent logarithms. Furthermore, certain IR divergences can be shown to be an artifact of the de Sitter limit and are cured for finite duration inflation. For gravitational wave observables, we stress the need to regularize stress tensors that do not presume a prior scale separation in their construction (as with the standard Isaacson form), deriving an improved stress tensor fit to purpose. We conclude by highlighting the inextricable connection between inferring $N_{\rm eff}$ bounds from vacuum tensor perturbations and the process of background renormalization.</description>

      <title>Development of generic no-scale inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop generalized no-scale supergravity models of inflation, and then study the corresponding cosmological predictions as well as the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) and scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). With a new parameter $0&lt;\alpha\leq 1$, the $\alpha$-generalized no-scale supergravity provides the continuous connections among the generic no-scale supergravity from string theory compactifications. The resulting prediction of the CMB, spectrum index $n_s$, and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ can be highly consistent with the latest Planck/BICEP/Keck Array observations. Notably, the models with $\alpha\neq 1$ give a smaller ratio $r\leq 10^{-3}$, which is flexible even under the anticipated tighter observational constraints at the future experiments. Additionally, these models have the potential to generate a broad-band stochastic gravitational wave background, and thus explain the NANOGrav 15yr signal. Furthermore, they predict the formation of PBHs with various mass scales, which could account for a significant portion of dark matter relic density in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum sensitivities in scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories have a long history as possible phenomenological alternatives to General Relativity, but are known to potentially produce deviations from the (strong) equivalence principle in systems involving self-gravitating objects, as a result of the presence of an additional gravitational scalar field besides the tensor modes of General Relativity. We describe here a novel mechanism whereby the equivalence principle is violated for an isolated rotating neutron star, if the gravitational scalar field is changing in time far from the system. We show that the neutron star rotational period changes due to an effective coupling ("angular momentum sensitivity") to the gravitational scalar, and compute that coupling for viable equations of state for nuclear matter. We comment on the relevance of our findings for testing scalar-tensor theories and models of ultralight dark matter with pulsar timing observations, a topic that we tackle in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Primordial Black Hole Capture by Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A sub-solar mass primordial black hole (PBH) passing through a neutron star, can lose enough energy through interactions with the dense stellar medium to become gravitationally bound to the star. Once captured, the PBH would sink to the core of the neutron star, and completely consume it from the inside. In this paper, we improve previous energy-loss calculations by considering a realistic solution for the neutron star interior, and refine the treatment of the interaction dynamics and collapse likelihood. We then consider the effect of a sub-solar PBH population on neutron stars near the Galactic center. We find that it is not possible to explain the lack of observed pulsars near the galactic center through dynamical capture of PBHs, as the velocity dispersion is too high. We then show that future observations of old neutron stars close to Sgr A* could set stringent constraints on the PBHs abundance. These cannot however be extended in the currently unconstrained asteroid-mass range, since PBHs of smaller mass would lose less energy in their interaction with the neutron star and end up in orbits that are too loosely bound and likely to be disrupted by other stars in the Galactic center.</description>
