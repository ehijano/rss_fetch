      <title>Seismic Oscillations Excited by Giant Impacts in Directly-Imaged Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radii and masses of many giant exoplanets imply their interiors each contain more than $\sim$100 $M_\oplus$ of solids. A large metal content may arise when a giant planet grows by colliding and merging with multiple $\sim$10 $M_\oplus$ solid cores. Here we show that a giant impact with a young gas giant excites long-lived seismic oscillations that can be detected photometrically. Mode lifetimes are close to the planet's Kelvin-Helmholtz time, a significant fraction of a young planet's age. Oscillation periods lie between tens of minutes to an hour, and variability amplitudes can exceed a percent for several million years. Beta Pictoris b is a young super-Jupiter known to be highly metal-enriched. If a Neptune-mass (17 $M_\oplus$) body impacted $\beta$ Pictoris b in the past $\sim$9--18 Myr, the planet could still be ringing with a percent-level photometric variability measurable with JWST.</description>

      <title>Comparative Biosignatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of inhabited exoplanets hinges on identifying biosignature gases. JWST is revealing potential biosignatures in exoplanet atmospheres, though their presence is yet to provide strong evidence for life. The central challenge is attribution: how to confidently identify biogenic sources while ruling out, or deeming unlikely, abiotic explanations? Attribution is particularly difficult for individual planets, especially regarding system-scale stochastic processes that could set atmospheric conditions. To address this, we here propose a comparative multi-planet approach: comparing atmospheric compositions across multiple planets within a system to empirically define the 'abiotic baseline'. This baseline serves as a reference point for biosignatures, and enables marginalisation over inaccessible, shared abiotic parameters. This is possible because planets within a system are linked by their birth in the same natal disk, having been irradiated by the same evolving star, and having a related dynamical history. Observations aligning with the abiotic baseline, where the locally informed abiotic models demonstrate high out-of-sample predictive accuracy, are likely non-biological. Deviations from the baseline -- potentially biotic anomalies -- suggest an alternative origin. We present the application of Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation to evaluate the performance of geochemical- and biogeochemical-climate models in explaining these anomalies, using the expected log pointwise predictive density as a diagnostic. When biogeochemical models outperform their abiotic counterparts, the anomaly may be shaped by life, and constitutes a comparative biosignature. If both models perform poorly, the anomaly is flagged as an "unknown unknown" -- a signature of either unrecognised abiotic chemistry, or life as we don't yet know it.</description>

      <title>Dark skies of the slightly eccentric WASP-18 b from its optical-to-infrared dayside emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse jointly phase-curve observations of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-18 b from the visible to the mid-infrared, using unpublished data from CHEOPS, TESS and Spitzer. We aim to characterise the planetary atmosphere with a consistent view over the large wavelength range covered using GCMs and retrieval analyses, and including JWST data. We obtain new ephemerides with unprecedented precisions of 1 second and 1.4 millisecond on the time of inferior conjunction and orbital period, respectively. We compute a planetary radius of $R_p = 1.1926 \pm 0.0077 R_J$ with a precision of 0.65%, or 550 km. Through a timing inconsistency with JWST, we discuss and confirm orbital eccentricity ($e = 0.00852 \pm 0.00091$), and constrain the argument of periastron to $\omega = 261.9^{+1.3}_{-1.4}$ deg. We show that the large dayside emission implies the presence of magnetic drag and super-solar metallicity. We find a steep thermally-inverted gradient in the planetary atmosphere, which is common for UHJs. We detect the presence of strong CO emission lines at 4.5 $\mu$m from an excess of dayside brightness in the Spitzer/IRAC/Ch2 passband. Using these models to constrain the reflected contribution in the CHEOPS passband, we derive an extremely low geometric albedo $A_g^\text{CHEOPS} = 0.027 \pm 0.011$.</description>

      <title>From Tides to Currents: Unraveling the Mechanism That Powers WASP-107b's Internal Heat Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sub-Jovian exoplanet WASP-107b ranks among the best-characterized low-density worlds, featuring a Jupiter-like radius and a mass that lies firmly in the sub-Saturn range. Recently obtained JWST spectra reveal significant methane depletion in the atmosphere, indicating that WASP-107b's envelope has both a high metallicity and an elevated internal heat flux. Together with a detected non-zero orbital eccentricity, these data have been interpreted as evidence of tidal heating. However, explaining the observed luminosity with tidal dissipation requires an unusually low tidal quality factor of $Q \sim 100$. Moreover, we find that secular excitation by the RV-detected outer companion WASP-107c, generally cannot sustain WASP-107b's eccentricity in steady state against tidal circularization. As an alternative explanation, we propose that Ohmic dissipation -- generated by interactions between zonal flows and the planetary magnetic field in a partially ionized atmosphere -- maintains the observed thermal state. Under nominal assumptions for the field strength, atmospheric circulation, and ionization chemistry, we show that Ohmic heating readily accounts for WASP-107b's inflated radius and anomalously large internal entropy.</description>

      <title>Classifying and characterizing the evolution of minimum orbit intersection distance for near-Earth asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the minimum orbit intersection distances (MOIDs) of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) over the next 200 years were computed and analyzed in detail. It was shown that the MOID of a NEA relative to the Earth-Moon barycenter (EMB) is usually a superior metric for predicting a potential impact than that relative to the Earth. Subsequently, a novel MOID Evolution Index (MEI) spanning from 0.0 to 9.9 was proposed and the orbits of NEAs are classified into 100 distinct categories by considering the variations of the MOID over time, which is useful for quickly screening and prioritizing hazardous asteroids for future research. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that a linear fitting to the MOID evolution provides a simple yet valid approach for most of the NEAs, which is useful for quickly estimating the MOID value without the need to perform an orbit propagation. As a result, a scheme with several parameters was proposed to characterize the MOID variations as well as the relative position information of the critical points along the orbits associated with the minimum distances. A database incorporating these parameters and the MEI values was therefore established for the cataloged NEAs, enabling the derivation of statistically constrained upper bounds for secular MOID drift rate as function of the semi-major axes. Finally, some special orbital configurations and dynamical mechanisms that may lead to a large deviation from the linear fit or multiple orbit crossings were also investigated, indicating the intricate nature in the patterns of MOID evolution for some NEAs.</description>

      <title>The impact of rates of reactions with cosmic ray induced photons on chemical composition of protoplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays and cosmic ray induced photons are vital components of chemical evolution in areas of interstellar medium that are impenetrable by external ultraviolet radiation. However, rates of reactions with cosmic ray induced photons used in astrochemical models were calculated for molecular clouds and can be different in protoplanetary discs, where dust grows up to larger sizes. Using ANDES astrochemical model, we study how an increase in both upper dust size and rates of reactions with cosmic ray induced photons can influence species abundances in protoplanetary discs. We show that the increase in these reactions' rates has a significant impact on the ice mass fraction in area between 2 and 20 au but has little impact on ionisation degree in disc.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric height measurement of meteors detected simultaneously by Digisonde and multi-site optical cameras during the 2019 Geminid shower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous optical and ionosonde detections of meteors offer a great opportunity to measure the transient physical properties of the meteor's ionization trail. One of the key parameters of the ionization trail is its true geometric height above the surface of the Earth, which can be determined from the trajectory of the optical meteors by multi-site measurements. During the peak of the 2019 Geminid shower we looked for optical meteors among the Konkoly Meteor Observatory Network data taken at ELTE Gothard Observatory, Szombathely, and contemporaneous meteor signals detected by the DPS-4D type ionosonde (Digisonde) operating at Sz\'echenyi Istv\'an Geophysical Observatory (SZIGO), Nagycenk, Hungary. From the 2 simultaneous detections we inferred the atmospheric height of the meteors using the method of intersecting planes. The results, about 90 and 85 km, are consistent with the detection limit (above 80 km) of the Digisonde.</description>

      <title>Observations of the temporal evolution of Saturn's stratosphere following the Great Storm of 2010-2011 I. Temporal evolution of the water abundance in Saturn's hot vortex of 2011-2013</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water vapour is delivered to Saturn's stratosphere by Enceladus' plumes and subsequent diffusion in the planet system. It is expected to condense into a haze in the middle stratosphere. The hot stratospheric vortex (the `beacon') that formed as an aftermath of Saturn's Great Storm of 2010 significantly altered the temperature, composition, and circulation in Saturn's northern stratosphere. Previous photochemical models suggested haze sublimation and vertical winds as processes likely to increase the water vapour column density in the beacon. We aim to quantify the temporal evolution of stratospheric water vapour in the beacon during the storm. We mapped Saturn at 66.44 and 67.09 $\mu$m on seven occasions from July 2011 to February 2013 with the PACS instrument of the Herschel Space Observatory. The observations probe the millibar levels, at which the water condensation region was altered by the warmer temperatures in the beacon. Using radiative transfer modelling, we tested several empirical and physically based models to constrain the cause of the enhanced water emission found in the beacon. The observations show an increased emission in the beacon that cannot be reproduced only accounting for the warmer temperatures. An additional source of water vapour is thus needed. We find a factor (7.5$\pm$1.6) increase in the water column in the beacon compared to pre-storm conditions using empirical models. Combining our results with a cloud formation model for July 2011, we evaluate the sublimation contribution to 45-85% of the extra column derived from the water emission increase in the beacon. The observations confirm that the storm conditions enhanced the water abundance at the millibar levels because of haze sublimation and vertical winds in the beacon. Future work on the haze temporal evolution during the storm will help to better constrain the sublimation contribution over time.</description>

      <title>Noble gas depletion on Titan: Clathrate sequestration during the open ocean phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A plausible explanation for the absence of primordial argon, krypton, and xenon in Titan's current atmosphere is that these gases were sequestered in clathrate hydrates during Titan's "open-ocean" phase. We examine how clathrate hydrate formation at Titan's ocean surface in its early history may have contributed to noble gas depletion in the primordial atmosphere. Starting with vapor-liquid equilibrium modeling between water and volatiles, we used a statistical thermodynamic model to determine the clathrate hydrate crust thickness needed to deplete the primordial atmosphere of noble gases. Our computations suggest that if Titan's volatile budget was delivered by icy planetesimals with a comet-like composition, its primordial atmosphere should be rich in CO$_2$ and CH$_4$, with NH$_3$ largely retained in water as ions. We show that at 273.15 K, a clathrate crust tens of kilometers thick would deplete the primordial atmosphere of xenon and krypton. The lack of primordial argon in Titan's atmosphere may result from the partial de-volatilization of its accreted materials.</description>

      <title>Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES). IV. Synergy between astrometry and direct imaging missions of the Habitable World Observatory for detecting Earth-like planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection and characterization of habitable planets around nearby stars persist as one of the foremost objectives in contemporary astrophysics. This work investigates the synergistic integration of astrometric and direct imaging techniques by capitalizing on the complementary capabilities of the Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) and Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Planetary brightness and position vary over time due to phase effects and orbital architectures, information that can be precisely provided by CHES's astrometric measurements. By combining the precise orbital constraints from CHES with the imaging capabilities of HWO, we evaluate the improvements in detection efficiency, signal-to-noise ratio and overall planet yield. Completeness is quantified as the fraction of injected planets that are successfully detected, while yields are estimated for various scenarios using terrestrial planet occurrence rates derived from the Kepler dataset. Our results indicate that prior astrometric data significantly enhance detection efficiency. Under the adopted detection limit, our analysis indicates that prior CHES observations can increase completeness by approximately 10% and improve detection efficiency by factors ranging from two to thirty. The findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in the search for and characterization of habitable worlds.</description>

      <title>Gaia search for stellar companions of TESS Objects of Interest V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present the latest results of our ongoing multiplicity survey of (Community) TESS Objects of Interest, using astrometry and photometry from the latest data release of the ESA Gaia mission to detect stellar companions of these stars and to characterize their properties. A total of 92 binary and two hierarchical triple star systems are identified among the 745 target stars whose multiplicity is explored in this study, all at distances of less than 500pc around the Sun. As expected for components of gravitationally bound star systems, the targets and the detected companions are at the same distance and share a common proper motion, as shown by their accurate Gaia astrometry. The companions have masses of about 0.12 to 1.6$M_\odot$. and are most frequently found in the mass range up to 0.6$M_\odot$. The companions have projected separations from the targets between about 110 and 9600au. Their frequency is highest and constant from about 300 to 800au, decreasing at larger projected separations. In addition to main sequence stars, five white dwarf companions are detected in this study, whose true nature is unveiled by their photometric properties.</description>

      <title>Morphological Regimes of Rotating Moist Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moist convection is a physical process where the latent heat released by condensation acts as a buoyancy source that can enhance or even trigger an overturning convective instability. Since the saturation temperature often decreases with height, condensation releases latent heat preferentially in regions of upflow. Due to this inhomogeneous heat source, moist convection may be more sensitive to changes in flow morphology, such as those induced by rotation, than dry Rayleigh-B\'enard convection. In order to study the effects of rotation on flows driven by latent heat release, we present a suite of numerical simulations that solve the Rainy-B\'enard equations (Vallis et al. 2019). We identify three morphological regimes: a cellular regime and a plume regime broadly analogous to those found in rotating Rayleigh B\'enard convection, and a novel funnel regime that lacks a clear analog within the regimes exhibited by dry convection. We measure energy fluxes through the system and report rotational scalings of the Reynolds and moist Nusselt numbers. We find that moist static energy transport, as measured by a moist Nusselt number, is significantly enhanced in the funnel regime without a corresponding enhancement in Reynolds number, indicating that this funnel regime produces structures with more favorable correlations between the temperature and vertical velocity.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the magnetically enhanced radiative torque (MRAT) alignment theory for general astrophysical environments described by a dimensionless parameter $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$ with $U$ local radiation strength, $n_{1}=n_{\rm H}/(10{\rm cm}^{-3})$ the hydrogen density, and $T_{2}=T_{\rm gas}/100{\rm K}$ the gas temperature. We first derive the critical magnetic relaxation $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ required to produce high-J attractors for different RAT models and local conditions and find that $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ must be larger for stronger radiation fields. We then numerically study the grain alignment and rotational disruption by the MRAT mechanism taking into account gas collisions and magnetic fluctuations. We find that, for the collision-dominated (CD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})\leq 1$), collisional and magnetic excitations can slowly transport large grains from low-J rotation to high-J attractors, leading to the perfect {\it slow alignment} within $\sim 10-100$ damping times due to MRATs. However, for the radiation-dominated (RD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})&gt;1$), only a fraction of grains can be fast aligned at high-J attractors by MRATs, and the majority of grains are trapped at low-J rotation due to strong radiative torques, a new effect we term {\it radiative torque (RAT) trapping}. For extreme radiation fields of $U/(n_{1}T_{2})&gt;10^{4}$, the efficiency of magnetic relaxation on grain alignment is suppressed, and grains only have fast alignment and disruption purely determined by RATs. We quantified the fraction of grains with fast alignment at high-J attractors, $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$, for different RAT models, magnetic relaxation, and $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$, and found that the maximum $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$ can reach $45\%$ by MRATs and $22\%$ by RATs.</description>

      <title>Earths composition: origin, evolution and energy budget</title>

Abstract: One in every two atoms in the Earth, Mars, and the Moon is oxygen; it is the third most abundant element in the solar system. The oxygen isotopic compositions of the terrestrial planets are different from those of the Sun and demonstrate that these planets are not direct compositional analogs of the solar photosphere. Likewise, the Suns O/Fe, Fe/Mg and Mg/Si values are distinct from those of inner solar system chondrites and terrestrial planets. These four elements (O, Fe, Mg, Si) make up about 94% by mass of the rocky planets and their abundances are determined uniquely using geophysical, geochemical and cosmochemical constraints. The rocky planets grew rapidly from planetesimals, most of which were differentiated, having a core and a mantle, before being accreted. Planetary growth in the early stages of protoplanetary disk evolution was rapid and was only partially recorded by the meteoritic record. The noncarbonaceous meteorites (NC) provide insights into the early history of the inner solar system and are used to construct a framework for how the rocky planets were assembled. NC chondrites have chondrule ages that are two to three million years younger than t_zero (the age of calcium-aluminum inclusions, CAI), documenting that chondrites are middle- to late-stage products of solar system evolution. The composition of the Earth, its current form of mantle convection, and the amount of radiogenic power that drives its engine remain controversial topics. Earths dynamics are driven by primordial and radiogenic heat sources. Measurement of the Earths geoneutrino flux defines its radiogenic power and restricts its bulk composition. Using the latest data from the KamLAND and Borexino geoneutrino experiments affirms that the Earth has 20 TW of radiogenic power and sets the proportions of refractory lithophile elements in the bulk silicate Earth at 2.5 to 2.7 times that in CI chondrites.</description>

      <title>Rossby wave instability in weakly ionized protoplanetary disks. II. radial B-fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on our first paper in this series, we investigate the impact of radial magnetic fields and non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects - specifically, Ohmic resistivity, Hall drift, and ambipolar diffusion - on RWI unstable modes. The presence of a radial field is linked to the disk's vertical shear and vertical magnetic field. We perform radially global linear analyses and utilize the spectral code \textsc{Dedalus} to solve the matrix eigenvalue problems. Our findings reveal that radial fields exhibit behavior similar to vertical fields. In the ideal MHD limit, radial fields enhance the effect of vertical fields in reducing growth rates, with significant reductions starting at relatively weak field strengths, around $\beta \sim 10^3 - 10^4$, which are relevant to protoplanetary disks. In the non-ideal MHD limit, all three non-ideal effects, when sufficiently strong, cause the growth rates to closely resemble those observed in hydrodynamic models.</description>

      <title>The Two-component Model of the 'spokes' in Saturn's Rings</title>

Abstract: The spokes observed in Saturn's rings have been a subject of scientific debate since their discovery by Stephen J. O'Meara in the 1970s and their confirmation by the Voyager flybys in the early 1980s (Smith et al., 1982). While the Cassini spacecraft confirmed that the spokes are linked to Saturn's magnetosphere, their exact formation mechanism remains uncertain. This paper proposes that the spokes in Saturn's rings consist of two distinct components: (1) carbonaceous materials, namely pyrolytic carbon with diamagnetic properties and potentially other various forms of carbon-bearing compounds, which persist over longer timescales, and (2) rapidly forming and dissipating diamagnetic ice grains, which interact with Saturn's magnetosphere on much shorter timescales. We suggest that the spokes consist of diamagnetic pyrolytic carbon that has coated silicates through the process of high-temperature Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) during the formation of Saturn's protoplanetary disk. Additionally, the spokes consist of diamagnetic ice particles that can disappear within minutes to hours due to sublimation. The photoelectric effect causes the pyrolytic carbon grains to lose electrons, thus becoming paramagnetic, which results in their attraction back to the main B ring structure. We suggest that Saturn's rings are charged by the solar wind, generating a magnetic field that emanates orthogonally above and below the B ring plane due to the movement of charged particles in the rings. Statistical analysis of Cassini data reveals significant correlations between spoke activity and both Saturn's magnetospheric rotation and solar elevation angle, providing strong support for an electromagnetic mechanism in spoke formation. This hypothesis suggests that the visibility of the spokes is dictated by illumination conditions and electromagnetic effects.</description>

      <title>Projections of Earth's technosphere: Scenario modeling, worldbuilding, and overview of remotely detectable technosignatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00067</link>

Abstract: This study uses methods from futures studies to develop a set of ten self-consistent scenarios for Earth's 1000-year future, which can serve as examples for defining technosignature search strategies. We apply a novel worldbuilding pipeline that evaluates the dimensions of human needs in each scenario as a basis for defining the observable properties of the technosphere. Our scenarios include three with zero-growth stability, two that have collapsed into a stable state, one that oscillates between growth and collapse, and four that continue to grow. Only one scenario includes rapid growth that could lead to interstellar expansion. We examine absorption spectral features for a few scenarios to illustrate that nitrogen dioxide can serve as a technosignature to distinguish between present-day Earth, pre-agricultural Earth, and an industrial 1000-year future Earth. Three of our scenarios are spectrally indistinguishable from pre-agricultural Earth, even though these scenarios include expansive technospheres. Up to nine of these scenarios could represent steady-state examples that could persist for much longer timescales, and it remains possible that short-duration technospheres could be the most abundant. Our scenario set provides the basis for further systematic thinking about technosignature detection as well as for imagining a broad range of possibilities for Earth's future.</description>
