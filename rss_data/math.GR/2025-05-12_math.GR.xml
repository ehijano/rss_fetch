      <title>Products of three conjugacy classes in the alternating group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for $\delta$ small, $n$ large, and any three conjugacy classes $C_{1},C_{2},C_{3}$ of $G=\mathrm{Alt}(n)$ of size at least $|G|^{1-\delta}$ we have $C_{1}C_{2}C_{3}=G$.
  The result provides a positive answer to Problem 20.23 of the Kourovka Notebook [KM22], improves theorems of Garonzi and Mar\'oti [GM21] (using $4$ classes) and Rodgers [Rod02] (using larger classes), complements the known result for $G$ a simple group of Lie type [MP21] [LST24] [FM25], and is tight in several senses. Furthermore, since no character theory is involved, the proof can be used in principle to build a constructive algorithm that, given $g\in G$, outputs $c_{i}\in C_{i}$ such that $c_{1}c_{2}c_{3}=g$.</description>

      <title>Powers of commutators in infinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given elements $x,u,z$ in a finite group $G$ such that $z$ is the commutator of $x$ and $u$, and the orders of $x$ and $z$ divide respectively integers $k,m \geq 2$, and given an integer $r$ that is coprime to $k$ and $m$, there exists $w \in G$ such that the commutator of $x^r$ and $w$ is conjugate to $z^r$. If instead we are given elements $x,y,z \in G$ such that $xy = z$, whose respective orders divide integers $k,l,m \geq 2$, and are given an integer $r$ that is coprime to $k,l$ and $m$, then there exist $x'$, $y'$ and $z'$ conjugate to respectively $x^r$, $y^r$ and $z^r$ such that $x'y' = z'$. In this paper we completely answer the natural question for which values of $k,l,m,r$ every group has these properties. The proof uses combinatorial group theory and properties of the projective special linear group $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>$R$-weighted graphs and commutators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce balance equations over commutative rings $R$ and associate $R$-weighted graphs to them so that solving balance equations corresponds to a consistent labeling of vertices of the associated graph. Our primary focus is the case when $R$ is a commutative local ring whose residue field contains at least three elements. In this case, we provide explicit solutions of balance equations. As an application, letting $R$ to be the ring of $p$-adic integers, we examine some necessary and sufficient conditions for a $p$-group of nilpotency class $2$ to have its set of commutators coincide with its commutator subgroup. We also apply our results to study the surjectivity of the Lie bracket in Lie algebras, without any restriction on their dimension and the underlined field.</description>

      <title>Representation gaps of rigid planar diagram monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define non-pivotal analogs of the Temperley-Lieb, Motzkin, and planar rook monoids, and compute bounds for the sizes of their nontrivial simple representations. From this, we assess the two types of monoids in their relative suitability for use in cryptography by comparing their representation gaps and gap ratios. We conclude that the non-pivotal monoids are generally worse for cryptographic purposes.</description>

      <title>The Modular Isomorphism Problem over all fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Modular Isomorphism Problem asks, if an isomorphism between modular group algebras of finite $p$-groups over a field $F$ implies an isomorphism of the group bases. We explore the differences of knowledge on the problem when $F$ is either assumed to be a prime field or a general field of characteristic $p$. After revising the literature and explaining reasons for the differences, we generalize some of the positive answers to the problem from the prime field case to the general case.</description>

      <title>Siegel-Radon transforms of transverse dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Helgason's classical definition of a generalized Radon transform, defined for a pair of homogeneous spaces of an lcsc group $G$, to a broader setting in which one of the spaces is replaced by a possibly non-homogeneous dynamical system over $G$ together with a suitable cross section. This general framework encompasses many examples studied in the literature, including Siegel (or $\Theta$-) transforms and Marklof-Str\"ombergsson transforms in the geometry of numbers, Siegel-sVeech transforms for translation surfaces, and Zak transforms in time-frequency analysis.
  Our main applications concern dynamical systems $(X, \mu)$ in which the cross section is induced from a separated cross section. We establish criteria for the boundedness, integrability, and square-integrability of the associated Siegel-Radon transforms, and show how these transforms can be used to embed induced $G$-representations into $L^p(X, \mu)$ for appropriate values of $p$. These results apply in particular to hulls of approximate lattices and certain "thinnings" thereof, including arbitrary positive density subsets in the amenable case.
  In the special case of cut-and-project sets, we derive explicit formulas for the dual transforms, and in the special case of the Heisenberg group we provide isometric embedding of Schr\"odinger representations into the $L^2$-space of the hulls of positive density subsets of approximate lattices in the Heisenberg group by means of aperiodic Zak transforms.</description>

      <title>Proper partial linear spaces affording imprimitive rank 3 automorphism groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A partial linear space is a point--line incidence structure such that each line is incident with at least two points and each pair of points is incident with at most one line. It is said to be proper if there exists at least one non-collinear point pair, and at least one line incident with more than two points. The highest degree of symmetry for a proper partial linear space occurs when the automorphism group $G$ is transitive on ordered pairs of collinear points, and on ordered pairs of non-collinear points, that is to say, $G$ is a transitive rank $3$ group on the points. While the primitive rank 3 partial linear spaces are essentially classified, we present the first substantial classification of a family of imprimitive rank $3$ examples. We classify all imprimitive rank $3$ proper partial linear spaces such that the rank $3$ group is semiprimitive and induces an almost simple group on the unique nontrivial system of imprimitivity. In particular, this includes all partial linear spaces with a rank 3 imprimitive automorphism group that is innately transitive or quasiprimitive. We construct several infinite families of examples and ten individual examples. The examples admit a rank $3$ action of a linear or unitary group, and to our knowledge most of our examples have not appeared before in the literature.</description>

      <title>On integral decomposition of unipotent elements in integral group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jespers and Sun conjectured that if a finite group $G$ has the property ND, i.e. for every nilpotent element $n$ in the integral group ring $\mathbb{Z}G$ and every primitive central idempotent $e \in \mathbb{Q}G$ one still has $ne \in \mathbb{Z}G$, then at most one of the simple components of the group algebra $\mathbb{Q} G$ has reduced degree bigger than $1$. With the exception of one very special series of groups we are able to answer their conjecture, showing that it is true - up to exactly one exception. To do so we first describe groups with the so-called SN property which was introduced by Liu and Passman in their investigation of the Multiplicative Jordan Decomposition for integral group rings.
  We then study further objects connected to the property ND. This concerns on one hand a certain section of the unit group of $\mathbb{Z} G$ which measures how far $G$ is from having ND and about which Jespers and Sun posed two further questions which we answer. On the other hand we introduce two properties which appeared naturally in these investigations: one is purely representation-theoretic, while the other can be regarded as indicating that it might be hard to decide ND. Among others we show these two notions are equivalent for groups with SN.</description>

      <title>An atomic Coxeter presentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study parabolic double cosets in a Coxeter system by decomposing them into atom(ic coset)s, a generalization of simple reflections introduced in a joint work with Elias, Libedinsky, Patimo. We define and classify braid relations between compositions of atoms and prove a Matsumoto theorem. Together with a quadratic relation, our braid relations give a presentation of nilCoxeter algebroids similar to Demazure's presentation of nilCoxeter algebras. Our consideration of reduced compositions of atoms gives rise to a new combinatorial structure, which is equipped with a length function and a Bruhat order and is realized as Tits cone intersections in the sense of Iyama-Wemyss.</description>
