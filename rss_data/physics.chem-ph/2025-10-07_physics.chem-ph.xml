      <title>Enhancing NMR Shielding Predictions of Atoms-in-Molecules Machine Learning Models with Neighborhood-Informed Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shielding with machine learning (ML) models remains a central challenge for data-driven spectroscopy. We present atomic variants of the Coulomb matrix (aCM) and bag-of-bonds (aBoB) descriptors, and extend them using radial basis functions (RBFs) to yield smooth, per-atom representations (aCM-RBF, aBoB-RBF). Local structural information is incorporated by augmenting each atomic descriptor with contributions from the n nearest neighbors, resulting in the family of descriptors, aCM-RBF(n) and aBoB-RBF(n). For 13C shielding prediction on the QM9NMR dataset (831,925 shielding values across 130,831 molecules), aBoB-RBF(4) achieves an out-of-sample mean error of 1.69 ppm, outperforming models reported in previous studies. While explicit three-body descriptors further reduce errors at a higher cost, aBoB-RBF(4) offers the best balance of accuracy and efficiency. Benchmarking on external datasets comprising larger molecules (GDBm, Drug12/Drug40, and pyrimidinone derivatives) confirms the robustness and transferability of aBoB-RBF(4), establishing it as a practical tool for ML-based NMR shielding prediction.</description>

      <title>Advanced Characterization Methods for Crystals of an Extraordinary Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physicochemical characterization of materials is central to the field of science and engineering and is essential to design new/engineered materials with specific properties. Assays available for small-molecules, e.g., XRD, NMR, LC-MS, can't be applied to macromolecules easily. Thus, it is extremely challenging to characterize complex materials such as adeno-associated virus capsids (MW 5.8MDa). Capsid crystals produced in hanging-drop are characterized in-situ using cross-polarized light and ex-situ using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray, and transmission electron microscopy. Cross-polarized light can be used to identify capsid crystals within a heterogenous-system of kosmotropic/chaotropic-salt crystals, fibers, dense solid-phase, opaques crystals. Despite highly-conserved structures, crystal birefringence suggests that capsids possess serotype-specific structural differences. SEM demonstrated that crystal-growth occurs by random 2D-nucleation followed by kink-site attachment and/or spread by more 2D-nuclei and proteinaceous assemblies tend to form semi-crystalline solids appearing as dense/opaque materials. EDX shows that C, O, and N are present in ratio of 2.33+-0.222:1:0.583+-0.019 for serotypes 5, 8, and 9 and can be an alternative to protein sequencing-based virus identification. Biological macromolecular assemblies are found to facilitate plural-scattering responsible for Kikuchi-diffraction pattern even for thin-crystals (~300nm). For an optimal spot-diffraction, crystals must possess at least one dimension consisting of at most 8 layers of capsids.</description>

      <title>Large circular dichroism in the total photoemission yield of free chiral nanoparticles created by a pure electric dipole effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic techniques that are sensitive to molecular chirality are important analytical tools to quantitatively determine enantiomeric excess and purity of chiral molecular samples. Many chiroptical processes however produce weak enantio-specific asymmetries due to their origin relying on weak magnetic dipole or electric quadrupole effects. Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) in contrast, is an intense effect, that is fully contained in the electric dipole description of light matter interaction and creates a chiral asymmetry in the photoelectron angular distribution. Here, we demonstrate that this chiral signature in the angular distribution of emitted electrons can be translated into the total photoionization yield for submicron-sized condensed samples. The resulting chiral asymmetry of the photoionization yield (CAPY), mediated by the attenuation of light within the particles, can be detected experimentally without requiring high vacuum systems and electron spectrometers. This effect can be exploited as an analytical tool with high sensitivity to chirality and enantiopurity for studies of chiral organic and hybrid submicron particles in environmental, biomedical or catalytic applications.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Pruning for Increased Robustness and Reduced Computational Overhead in Gaussian Process Accelerated Saddle Point Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a strategy for accelerating saddle point searches on high-dimensional energy surfaces by reducing the number of times the energy and its derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates need to be evaluated. The computational overhead in the hyperparameter optimization can, however, be large and make the approach inefficient. Failures can also occur if the search ventures too far into regions that are not represented well enough by the GP model. Here, these challenges are resolved by using geometry-aware optimal transport measures and an active pruning strategy using a summation over Wasserstein-1 distances for each atom-type in farthest-point sampling, selecting a fixed-size subset of geometrically diverse configurations to avoid rapidly increasing cost of GP updates as more observations are made. Stability is enhanced by permutation-invariant metric that provides a reliable trust radius for early-stopping and a logarithmic barrier penalty for the growth of the signal variance. These physically motivated algorithmic changes prove their efficacy by reducing to less than a half the mean computational time on a set of 238 challenging configurations from a previously published data set of chemical reactions. With these improvements, the GP approach is established as, a robust and scalable algorithm for accelerating saddle point searches when the evaluation of the energy and atomic forces requires significant computational effort.</description>

      <title>Connections between Richardson-Gaudin States, Perfect-Pairing, and Pair Coupled-Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slater determinants underpin most electronic structure methods, but orbital-based approaches often struggle to describe strong correlation efficiently. Geminal-based theories, by contrast, naturally capture static correlation in bond-breaking and multireference problems, though at the expense of implementation complexity and limited treatment of dynamic effects. In this work, we examine the interplay between orbital and geminal frameworks, focusing on perfect-pairing (PP) wavefunctions and their relation to pair coupled-cluster doubles (pCCD) and Richardson-Gaudin (RG) states. We show that PP arises as an eigenvector of a simplified reduced Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) Hamiltonian expressed in bonding/antibonding orbital pairs, with the complementary eigenvectors enabling a systematic treatment of weak correlation. Second-order Epstein-Nesbet perturbation theory on top of PP is found to yield energies nearly equivalent to pCCD. These results clarify the role of pair-based ans\"atze and open avenues for hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of orbital- and geminal-based methods.</description>

      <title>Tunable electronic energy level alignment and exciton diversity in organic-inorganic van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: van der Waals stacking of two-dimensional (2D) materials offers a powerful platform for engineering material interfaces with tailored electronic and optical properties. While most van der Waals multilayers have featured inorganic monolayers, incorporating molecular monolayers introduces new degrees of tunability and functionality. Here, we investigate hybrid bilayers composed of atomically thin perylene-based molecular crystals interfaced with monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), specifically MoS2 and WS2. Using ab initio many-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation approach, we predict emergent properties beyond those of the isolated constituent systems. Notably, we find substantial renormalization of monolayer molecular crystal band gap due to TMD-induced polarization. Furthermore, by varying the TMD monolayer, we demonstrate tuning of the energy level alignment of the bilayer and subsequent control over a diversity of lowest-energy excitons, which include strongly bound hybrid excitons and long-lived charge-transfer excitons. These findings establish organic-inorganic van der Waals heterostructures as a promising class of materials for tunable optoelectronic devices and quantum excitonic phenomena, expanding the design space for low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>SHarmonic: A fast and accurate implementation of spherical harmonics for electronic-structure calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The authors present SHarmonic, a new implementation of the spherical harmonics targeted for electronic-structure calculations. Their approach is to use explicit formulas for the harmonics written in terms of normalized Cartesian coordinates. This approach results in a code that is as precise as other implementations while being at least one order of magnitude more computationally efficient. The library can run on graphics processing units (GPUs) as well, achieving an additional order of magnitude in execution speed. This new implementation is simple to use and is provided under an open source license, it can be readily used by other codes to avoid the error-prone and cumbersome implementation of the spherical harmonics.</description>

      <title>Photoswitchable radicals as reporter spins for quantum sensing with spin defects in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid decay of target signal strength with distance from the sensor presents a key challenge in nanoscale magnetic sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, limiting both sensitivity and spatial resolution. Here we introduce a strategy to overcome this limitation by using radical anions formed from rhodamine-derived dyes as reporter spins localized to the diamond surface. These radicals, generated through photoreduction, are optically identifiable and stable on timescales exceeding an hour. We experimentally demonstrate their coherent manipulation and detection using single, shallow NV centers for readout. We observe heterogeneity in the local magnetic environments of the photoactivated spins from site to site, likely due to variations in inter-radical couplings across our measurements. Looking forward, our approach enables correlative nanoscale magnetic and optical imaging, and opens new pathways toward single-molecule magnetic resonance studies.</description>

      <title>Imaging Nanoscale Carrier, Thermal, and Structural Dynamics with Time-Resolved and Ultrafast Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved and ultrafast electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) is an emerging technique for measuring photoexcited carriers, lattice dynamics, and near-fields across femtosecond to microsecond timescales. When performed in either a specialized scanning transmission electron microscope or ultrafast electron microscope (UEM), time-resolved and ultrafast EELS can directly image charge carriers, lattice vibrations, and heat dissipation following photoexcitation or applied bias. Yet recent advances in theoretical calculations and electron optics are often required to realize the full potential of ultrafast EEL spectrum imaging. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the recent progress in the theory and instrumentation of time-resolved and ultrafast EELS. We begin with an introduction to the technique, followed by a physical description of the loss function. We outline approaches for calculating and interpreting ground-state and transient EEL spectra spanning low-loss plasmons to core-level excitations analogous to X-ray absorption. We then survey the current state of time-resolved and ultrafast EELS techniques beyond photon-induced near-field electron microscopy, highlighting abilities to image carrier and thermal dynamics. Finally, we examine future directions enabled by emerging technologies, including electron beam monochromation, in situ and operando cells, laser-free UEM, and high-speed direct electron detectors. These advances position time-resolved and ultrafast EELS as a critical tool for uncovering nanoscale dynamic processes in quantum materials and solar energy conversion devices.</description>

      <title>The roles of elasticity and dimension in liquid-gel phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare six elastic models for polymer networks in the context of phase separation within a gel, including a new model that combines the finite extensible Arruda-Boyce model and the slip tube model for entangled chains. We study incompressible uniaxial stretch and compression, and three volume-changing constrained-dimension deformations, in which the material can only deform in the designated dimensions(s) while the constrained direction(s) remain(s) the same. Each model responds differently to large deformations, and our proposed model successfully describes both strain softening and strain hardening, which are both present in well-entangled elastomers. When considering phase separation, we show that the commonly-used neo-Hookean model fails to admit a common tangent construction for phase coexistence for 3D deformations. This can be resolved by using a model with finite extension, such as the Arruda-Boyce model. In constrained-dimension deformations, where the gel's volume is allowed to change, for elastic models in which phase coexistence is possible, the critical temperatures increases and the critical concentration decreases with increasing deformation dimensions. This strong dependence of the phase diagram on spatial dimension and geometry distinguishes phase separation elastic media from conventional phase separation.</description>

      <title>Surface Excess Energy Governs the Non-Monotonic Behavior of Active Diffusivity with Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-propulsion of particles is typically explained by phoretic mechanisms driven by externally imposed chemical, electric, or thermal gradients. In contrast, chemical reactions can enhance particle diffusion even in the absence of such external gradients. We refer to this increase as active diffusivity, often attributed to self-diffusiophoresis or self-electrophoresis, although these mechanisms alone do not fully account for experimental observations. Here, we investigate active diffusivity in catalytic Janus particles immersed in reactive media without imposed gradients. We show that interfacial reactions generate excess surface energy and sustained interfacial stresses that supplement thermal energy, enabling diffusion beyond the classical thermal limit. We consistently quantify this contribution using both dissipative and non-dissipative approaches, assuming that the aqueous bath remains near equilibrium. Our framework reproduces experimentally observed trends in diffusivity versus activity, including the non-monotonic behaviors reported in some systems, and agrees with data for nanometric Janus particles catalyzing charged substrates as well as vesicles with membrane-embedded enzymes driven by ATP hydrolysis. These results demonstrate that chemical reactions can induce and sustain surface-tension gradients and surface excess energy, providing design principles for tuning mobility in synthetic active matter.</description>

      <title>Co-evaporated Formamidinium tin triiodide with suppressed p-type self-doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Co-evaporation of formamidinium tin triiodide (FASnI3) precursors, without any additives or reducing agents, leads to the growth of a highly crystalline thin film which shows a bandgap around 1.31 eV, closely matching the theoretical value predicted from the ideal single crystal structure of FASnI3. The polycrystalline thin film presents a lower tendency of Sn2+ to Sn4+ oxidation and highly reduced tendency to self-doping, demonstrating, overall, an improved resistance to defects formation. These findings suggest solvent-free co-evaporation processes as a promising route for high quality Sn-based perovskite polycrystalline thin films.</description>

      <title>A fluorescence microscopy platform for time-resolved studies of spin-correlated radical pairs in biological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importance of spin-correlated radical pairs in biology is increasingly recognized, with roles in biological effects of weak magnetic fields and emerging quantum spin-based biomedical applications. Fluorescence microscopy offers sufficient sensitivity to study magnetic field effects on radical pair reactions in living cells, but conventional techniques cannot directly resolve their dynamics because most biologically relevant radical pairs are non-emissive. To overcome this challenge, we introduce two novel microscopy techniques: single color pump-probe (PP) and pump-field-probe (PFP) fluorescence. Here, we describe their working principles, provide their mathematical formulation, and validate both techniques through theoretical analysis and experiments on well-established flavin-based magnetic field sensitive reactions. These approaches offer a sensitive and broadly applicable platform for quantifying and visualizing the quantum spin dynamics of radical pair chemical reactions in biological systems.</description>

Abstract: Time delays in photoemission are on the order of attoseconds and have been experimentally determined in atoms, molecules and solids. Their magnitude and energy dependence are expected to yield fundamental insights into the properties of the systems in which they're measured. In a recent study Biswas \textsl{et al.} (Biswas, S., F\"org, B., Ortmann, L. et al. Probing molecular environment through photoemission delays. Nat. Phys. 16, 778-783 (2020)) determined the absolute photoemission time of the I$4d$ level in iodoethane via attosecond streaking spectroscopy, finding the presence of a functional group to increase the photoemission time delay, suggesting a correlation between the size of the functional group and time delay based on a semi-classical calculation. Here we experimentally study the dependence of the I$4d$ photoemission time on the functional group in the iodoalkanes from iodomethane up to 2-iodobutane at three photon energies across the giant resonance in the I$4d\to\varepsilon f$ photoemission channel, finding that the presence alone of a functional group does not necessarily increase the photoemission delay, and that overall no clear correlation between its size and the photoemission time delay can be established.</description>

      <title>A Third-Order Relativistic Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction Method for Double Ionization Potentials: Theory, Implementation, and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a relativistic third-order algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC(3)) approach for calculating double ionization potentials (DIPs). By employing the exact two-component atomic mean-field (X2CAMF) Hamiltonian in combination with a Cholesky decomposition (CD) representation of two-electron integrals and the frozen natural spinor (FNS) framework for virtual space truncation, we achieve a significant reduction in both memory requirements and computational cost. The DIPs obtained using the X2CAMF Hamiltonian show excellent agreement with results from fully relativistic four-component calculations. We have validated the accuracy of our implementation through comparisons with available experimental and theoretical data for inert gas atoms and diatomic species. The effect of higher-order relativistic corrections is also explored.</description>

      <title>A perturbative triples correction to relativistic Quadratic Unitary Coupled Cluster Method: Theory, Implementation and Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a perturbative triples correction to the relativistic quadratic unitary coupled cluster singles and doubles (qUCCSD) method, denoted as qUCCSD[T]. The method builds upon the Hermitian structure of the unitary ansatz and employs a many-body perturbation theory framework to consistently include the effects of triple excitations without the need for computationally intensive iterative procedures. Relativistic effects are incorporated using the exact two-component atomic mean-field (X2CAMF) Hamiltonian, and the computational cost is further reduced through the frozen natural spinor (FNS) and Cholesky decomposition (CD) approximations. Benchmark results demonstrate that qUCCSD[T] outperforms previously proposed triples corrections to the unitary coupled cluster method in the clasical computing regime and yields excellent agreement with experimental data and Full CI benchmarks. Specifically, the method shows high accuracy in computing bond dissociation enthalpies, molecular geometries, vibrational frequencies, ionization potentials, and electron affinities of heavy-element-containing systems.</description>

      <title>Dissipative ground state preparation in ab initio electronic structure theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipative engineering is a powerful tool for quantum state preparation, and has drawn significant attention in quantum algorithms and quantum many-body physics in recent years. In this work, we introduce a novel approach using the Lindblad dynamics to efficiently prepare the ground state for general ab initio electronic structure problems on quantum computers, without variational parameters. These problems often involve Hamiltonians that lack geometric locality or sparsity structures, which we address by proposing two generic types of jump operators for the Lindblad dynamics. Type-I jump operators break the particle number symmetry and should be simulated in the Fock space. Type-II jump operators preserves the particle number symmetry and can be simulated more efficiently in the full configuration interaction space. For both types of jump operators, we prove that in a simplified Hartree-Fock framework, the spectral gap of our Lindbladian is lower bounded by a universal constant. For physical observables such as energy and reduced density matrices, the convergence rate of our Lindblad dynamics with Type-I jump operators remains universal, while the convergence rate with Type-II jump operators only depends on coarse grained information such as the number of orbitals and the number of electrons. To validate our approach, we employ a Monte Carlo trajectory-based algorithm for simulating the Lindblad dynamics for full ab initio Hamiltonians, demonstrating its effectiveness on molecular systems amenable to exact wavefunction treatment.</description>

      <title>FreeBird.jl: An Extensible Toolbox for Simulating Interfacial Phase Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present FreeBird, an extensible Julia-based platform for computational studies of phase equilibria at generic interfaces. The package supports a range of system configurations, from atomistic solid surfaces to coarse-grained lattice$-$gas models, with energies evaluated using classical interatomic potentials or lattice Hamiltonians. Both atomistic and lattice systems accommodate single- or multi-component mixtures with flexibly definable surface and lattice geometries. Implemented sampling algorithms include nested sampling, Wang$-$Landau sampling, Metropolis Monte Carlo, and, for tractable lattice systems, exact enumeration. Leveraging Julia's type hierarchies and multiple dispatch, FreeBird provides a modular interface that allows seamless integration of system definitions, energy evaluators, and sampling schemes. Designed for flexibility, extensibility, and performance, FreeBird offers a versatile framework for exploring the thermodynamics of interfacial phenomena.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Efficiency of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Calculations of Dynamic Response Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) constitutes an essential technique for diagnosing material properties under extreme conditions, such as high pressures and intense laser heating. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is one of the most accurate available ab initio methods for modeling XRTS spectra, as well as a host of other dynamic material properties. However, strong thermal excitations, along with the need to account for variations in temperature and density as well as the finite size of the detector significantly increase the computational cost of TDDFT simulations compared to ambient conditions. In this work, we present a broadly applicable method for optimizing and enhancing the efficiency of TDDFT calculations. Our approach is based on a one-to-one mapping between the dynamic structure factor and the imaginary time density--density correlation function, which naturally emerges in Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum many-body theory. Specifically, we combine rigorous convergence tests in the imaginary time domain with a constraints-based noise attenuation technique to improve the efficiency of TDDFT modeling without the introduction of any significant bias. As a result, we can report a speed-up by up to an order of magnitude, thus potentially saving millions of CPU hours for modeling a single XRTS measurement of matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>The dawn of alchemical free-energy methods in biomolecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the onset of fundamental statistical mechanical constructs formulated in the late 19th century, alchemical free-energy methods slowly emerged and transitioned to become operational tools of biomolecular simulation applicable to a wide range of problems including protein-ligand binding for drug discovery research. This article reconstructs how statistical mechanical approaches such as thermodynamic integration and free-energy perturbation were reconfigured in the early 1980's to address the complexities of increasingly heterogeneous biomolecular systems. Drawing on oral history interviews and primary literature, the study examines the technical, institutional, theoretical, and infrastructural conditions under which these methods were implemented, and became progressively operational. These conditions encompassed the consolidation of lab-specific software infrastructures, the formulation of practical simulation protocols, as well as essential statistical mechanical clarifications. From this perspective, the progress of free-energy methods proceeded less from a unified convergence than from an iterative troubleshooting process of alignment involving practical and theoretical considerations. The aim of the present article is to offer a historically grounded account of how free-energy techniques acquired practical and functional reliability.</description>
