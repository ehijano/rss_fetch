      <title>Finite groups with few conjugate classes of minimal non-abelian subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite non-abelian group and $\kappa_1(G)$ the number of conjugate classes of minimal non-abelian subgroups of $G$. The structure of $G$ with $\kappa_1(G)=1$ is determined. In the case of $G$ being the $p$-groups, the structure of $G$ with $\kappa_1(G)\leqslant p$ is also determined.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport on Lie Group Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In its most general form, the optimal transport problem is an infinite-dimensional optimization problem, yet certain notable instances admit closed-form solutions. We identify the common source of this tractability as symmetry and formalize it using Lie group theory. Fixing a Lie group action on the outcome space and a reference distribution, we study optimal transport between measures lying on the same Lie group orbit of the reference distribution. In this setting, the Monge problem admits an explicit upper bound given by an optimization over the stabilizer subgroup of the reference distribution. The reduced problem's dimension scales with that of the stabilizing subgroup and, in the tractable cases we study, is either zero or finite. Under mild regularity conditions, a simple algebraic certificate, verified at an optimizer of the reduced problem, ensures tightness of the upper bound for both the Monge and Kantorovich formulations, with the optimal map realized by a single group element. This orbit-based viewpoint unifies known closed-form solutions, such as those for one-dimensional and elliptical distributions, and yields a new one for optimal transport between Wishart distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the problem of which Lie algebras appear as the derived algebra of a Lie algebra. We present new results that further develop this study and address two questions raised in a paper concerned with the corresponding problem for groups.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion and orbit counting of Kleinian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the divergence of Kleinian groups $\Gamma$ and the recurrence of simple random walks on the Schreier graph associated with $\Gamma$. In particular, we show that if $\Gamma$ is a subgroup of a lattice and is of divergence type, then the Schreier graph is recurrent. Our approach builds connections among the growth rate of the $\Gamma$-orbit, the volume growth rate of the quotient manifolds, and the growth rate of the Schreier graph. Using the connections, we construct abundant Kleinian groups of divergence type.</description>

      <title>Cubulating mapping tori of some polynomial growth free group automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:1605.07879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a finite-rank free group and let $\Phi\in\mathrm{Out}(F)$ have polynomial growth. Let $G=F\rtimes_\Phi\mathbb{Z}$. We give sufficient conditions on $\Phi$ that ensure $G$ acts freely on a CAT(0) cube complex. For $d=1$, the class of $G$ that we cubulate strictly contains tubular free-by-cyclic groups, which were cubulated by Button. For $d&gt;1$, we cubulate $G$ provided, for instance, the linear-growth mapping tori contained in $G$ are tubular and $G$ satisfies a condition on intersections of certain centralisers. These conditions are satisfied when the growth rate of $\Phi$ is as large as possible for $F$. Using this, we show that for any fixed $F$, a random unipotent polynomially growing automorphism $\Phi$ has cubulated mapping torus.
  We do not work directly with relative train tracks, but rely on them via the cyclic hierarchy from work of Macura in the superlinear case and the splitting over $\mathbb{Z}^2$ subgroups from from work of Andrew-Martino and Dahmani-Touikan in the linear case. Our proof relies on cubical small-cancellation theory to obtain free actions on CAT(0) cube complexes for groups admitting suitable acylindrical cyclic hierarchies whose bottom-level vertex groups are cubulated; this technical result is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Contractible Vietoris-Rips complexes of $\mathbb{Z}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new, short proof of a result of Virk, that the Vietoris-Rips complex of the group $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with the standard word metric is contractible at large enough scales. This is inspired by a key observation in Virk's proof, but we use Bestvina-Brady discrete Morse theory to get a very short proof with better bounds. In the course of this, we get a new, general criterion for a metric space to have contractible Vietoris-Rips complexes at large enough scales, which could prove useful in the future.</description>

      <title>Analogs of the lower and upper central series in skew braces: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01366v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A skew brace is a ring-like and group-like algebraic structure that was introduced in the study of set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. In this survey paper, we shall consider the left series, right series, socle series, and annihilator series of skew braces. They may be regarded as analogs of the lower and upper central series of groups. Other than some well-known facts regarding these series, we shall prove several new results about the relationship among their terms. We shall also consider the lower central series of skew braces that was defined by Bonatto and Jedli\v{c}ka. As we shall explain, it seems to be the ``correct" analog of the lower central series for skew braces. Concerning this, we shall also discuss the notion of the lower central series of ideals that is due to Ballester-Bolinches et al.</description>

      <title>The Levelwise Finite Generation of Free Tambara Functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the levelwise finite generation of free polynomial $G$-Tambara functors in a collection of cases, most notably when $G$ is a finite Dedekind group or when $G \cong C_p \rtimes C_q$, $p &gt; q$ primes. In the process, we establish the permanence of various finiteness conditions under box products and norms $n_H^G$ of Tambara functors, including a weak Hilbert Basis Theorem.</description>

      <title>Percolation in acylindrically hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an acylindrically hyperbolic group. We prove that Bernoulli bond percolation on every Cayley graph of $G$ has a nonuniqueness phase, in which there are infinitely many infinite clusters. This generalizes Hutchcroft's result for Gromov hyperbolic graphs to relatively hyperbolic groups, mapping class groups and rank-1 CAT(0) groups for example.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Anosov subgroups: Limit cones and Growth indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected semisimple real algebraic group. We prove that limit cones vary continuously under deformations of Anosov subgroups of $G$ under a certain convexity assumption, which turns out to be necessary. We apply this result to the notion of sharpness for the action of a discrete subgroup on a non-Riemannian homogeneous space. Finally, we show that, within the space of Anosov representations, the growth indicator, the critical exponents, and the Hausdorff dimension of limit sets (with respect to an appropriate non-Riemannian metric) all vary continuously.</description>
