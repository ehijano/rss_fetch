      <title>On Oriented Colourings of Graphs on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an oriented graph $G$, the least number of colours required to oriented colour $G$ is called the oriented chromatic number of $G$ and denoted $\chi_o(G)$.For a non-negative integer $g$ let $\chi_o(g)$ be the least integer such that $\chi_o(G) \leq \chi_o(g)$ for every oriented graph $G$ with Euler genus at most $g$. We will prove that $\chi_o(g)$ is nearly linear in the sense that $\Omega(\frac{g}{\log(g)}) \leq \chi_o(g) \leq O(g \log(g))$. This resolves a question of the author, Bradshaw, and Xu, by improving their bounds of the form $\Omega((\frac{g^2}{\log(g)})^{1/3}) \leq \chi_o(g)$ and $\chi_o(g) \leq O(g^{6400})$.</description>

      <title>Note on a Coin Tossing Problem Posed by Daniel Litt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of a coin-tossing problem posed by Daniel Litt which has generated some popular interest. We demonstrate a recursive identity which leads to relatively simple formulas for the excess number of wins for one player over the other together with its increments as the number of coin tosses increases.</description>

      <title>Frozen colourings in $2K_2$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \emph{reconfiguration graph of the $k$-colourings} of a graph $G$, denoted $\mathcal{R}_k(G)$, is the graph whose vertices are the $k$-colourings of $G$ and two vertices of $\mathcal{R}_k(G)$ are joined by an edge if the colourings of $G$ they correspond to differ in colour on exactly one vertex. A $k$-colouring of a graph $G$ is called \emph{frozen} if it is an isolated vertex in $\mathcal{R}_k(G)$; in other words, for every vertex $v \in V(G)$, $v$ is adjacent to a vertex of every colour different from its colour.
  A clique partition is a partition of the vertices of a graph into cliques. A clique partition is called a $k$-clique-partition if it contains at most $k$ cliques. Clearly, a $k$-colouring of a graph $G$ corresponds precisely to a $k$-clique-partition of its complement, $\overline{G}$. A $k$-clique-partition $\mathcal{Q}$ of a graph $H$ is called \emph{frozen} if for every vertex $v \in V(H)$, $v$ has a non-neighbour in each of the cliques of $\mathcal{Q}$ other than the one containing $v$.
  The cycle on four vertices, $C_4$, is sometimes called the \emph{square}; its complement is called $2K_2$.
  We give several infinite classes of $2K_2$-free graphs with frozen colourings. We give an operation which transforms a $k$-chromatic graph with a frozen $(k+1)$-colouring into a $(k+1)$-chromatic graph with a frozen $(k+2)$-colouring. Our operation preserves being $2K_2$-free. It follows that for all $k \ge 4$, there is a $k$-chromatic $2K_2$-free graph with a frozen $(k+1)$-colouring. We prove these results by studying frozen clique partitions in $C_4$-free graphs.
  We say a graph $G$ is \emph{recolourable} if $R_{\ell}(G)$ is connected for all $\ell$ greater than the chromatic number of $G$. We prove that every 3-chromatic $2K_2$-free graph is recolourable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dujmovi\'{c} et al. [arXiv:2407.05936] showed that any $n$-vertex planar graph is contained in a $O(\sqrt{n}\log^2(n))$-blowup of a fan, and asked if the same holds for any $n$-vertex $K_t$-minor-free graph. We answer this in the positive, showing that such a graph is contained in a $O_t(\sqrt{n}\log^2(n))$-blowup of a fan.</description>

      <title>Closures and heavy pairs for hamiltonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices is $\{H,F\}$-$o$-heavy if every induced subgraph of $G$ isomorphic to $H$ or $F$ contains two nonadjacent vertices with degree sum at least $n$. Generalizing earlier sufficient forbidden subgraph conditions for hamiltonicity, in 2012, Li, Ryj\'a\v{c}ek, Wang and Zhang determined all connected graphs $R$ and $S$ of order at least 3 other than $P_3$ such that every 2-connected $\{R,S\}$-$o$-heavy graph is hamiltonian. In particular, they showed that, up to symmetry, $R$ must be a claw and $S\in\{P_4,P_5,C_3,Z_1,Z_2,B,N,W\}$. In 2008, \v{C}ada extended Ryj\'a\v{c}ek's closure concept for claw-free graphs by introducing what we call the $c$-closure for claw-$o$-heavy graphs. We apply it here to characterize the structure of the $c$-closure of 2-connected $\{R,S\}$-$o$-heavy graphs, where $R$ and $S$ are as above. Our main results extend or generalize several earlier results on hamiltonicity involving forbidden or $o$-heavy subgraphs.</description>

      <title>On graphs isomorphic with their conduction graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conduction graphs are defined here in order to elucidate at a glance the often complicated conduction behaviour of molecular graphs as ballistic molecular conductors. The graph $G^{\mathrm C}$ describes all possible conducting devices associated with a given base graph $G$ within the context of the Source-and-Sink-Potential model of ballistic conduction. The graphs $G^{\mathrm C}$ and $G$ have the same vertex set, and each edge $xy$ in $G^{\mathrm C}$ represents a conducting device with graph $G$ and connections $x$ and $y$ that conducts at the Fermi level. If $G^{\mathrm C}$ is isomorphic with the simple graph $G$ (in which case we call $G$ conduction-isomorphic), then $G$ has nullity $\eta(G)=0$ and is an ipso omni-insulator. Motivated by this, examples are provided of ipso omni-insulators of odd order, thereby answering a recent question. For $\eta(G)=0$, $G^{\mathrm C}$ is obtained by 'booleanising' the inverse adjacency matrix $A^{-1}(G)$, to form $A(G^{\mathrm C})$, i.e. by replacing all non-zero entries $(A(G)^{-1})_{xy}$ in the inverse by $1+\delta_{xy}$ where $\delta_{xy}$ is the Kronecker delta function. Constructions of conduction-isomorphic graphs are given for the cases of $G$ with minimum degree equal to two or any odd integer. Moreover, it is shown that given any connected non-bipartite conduction-isomorphic graph $G$, a larger conduction-isomorphic graph $G'$ with twice as many vertices and edges can be constructed. It is also shown that there are no 3-regular conduction-isomorphic graphs. A census of small (order $\leq 11$) connected conduction-isomorphic graphs and small (order $\leq 22$) connected conduction-isomorphic graphs with maximum degree at most three is given. For $\eta(G)=1$, it is shown that $G^{\mathrm C}$ is connected if and only if $G$ is a nut graph (a singular graph of nullity one that has a full kernel vector).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, extending a result of Brooks et.al. [arXiv:2403.04110], we show that if an outerplanar graph $G$ with minimum degree at least $2$ has positive Lin-Lu-Yau curvature on every vertex pair, then $G$ has at most $10$ vertices, and this upper bound is sharp.</description>

      <title>The First Zagreb Index, the Forgotten Topological Index, the Inverse Degree and Some Hamiltonian Properties of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph. The first Zagreb index and the forgotten topological index of a graph $G$ are defined respectively as $\sum_{u \in V} d^2(u)$ and $\sum_{u \in V} d^3(u)$, where $d(u)$ is the degree of vertex $u$ in $G$. If the minimum degree of $G$ is at least one, the inverse degree of $G$ is defined as $\sum_{u \in V} \frac{1}{d(u)}$. In this paper, we, for a graph with minimum degree at least one, present an upper bound for the first Zagreb index of the graph and lower bounds for the forgotten topological index and the inverse degree of the graph. We also present sufficient conditions involving the first Zagreb index, the forgotten topological index, or the inverse degree for some Hamiltonian properties of a graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the game of Cat Herding, where an omnipresent herder slowly cuts down a graph until an evasive cat player has nowhere to go. The number of cuts made is the score of a game, and we study the score under optimal play. In this paper, we begin by deriving some general results, and then we determine the precise cat number for paths, cycles, stars, and wheels. Finally, we identify an optimal Cat and Herder strategy on complete graphs, while providing both a recurrence and closed form for $cat(K_n)$.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity Spectra and Integral Eigenvalues of Zero Divisor Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the eccentricity spectra of zero divisor graphs (ZDGs) associated with the ring $\mathbb{Z}_n.$ While previous studies have examined the Laplacian and distance Laplacian spectra of ZDGs, the eccentricity spectra have remained largely unknown due to the unique features of the eccentricity matrix. More specifically, we prove that for a prime $p$, the ZDG and extended ZDG of $\mathbb{Z}_{p^t}$ have integral eccentricity eigenvalues for $t \geq 3$ and $t \geq 2$, respectively. We also find the eccentricity spectra for specific classes of ZDGs and the relationship between the eccentricity matrix of these ZDGs and their tree structures using matrix analysis tools. In addition, for the usefulness of the energy gap in applications, we have calculated the eccentricity energy gap of ZDGs. These findings reveal interesting behaviours of the eccentricity matrix and may contribute to a more profound understanding of the structural properties of ZDGs.</description>

Abstract: Reid-Smith recently parametrised groups acting on trees with Tits' independence property (P) using graph-based combinatorial structures known as local action diagrams. Properties of the acting (topological) group, such as being locally compact, compactly generated or simple, are reflected in its local action diagram. In this article we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the local action diagram for the associated group to be discrete.</description>

      <title>Two-level D- and A-optimal main-effects designs with run sizes one and two more than a multiple of four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For run sizes that are a multiple of four, the literature offers many two-level designs that are D- and A-optimal for the main-effects model and minimize the aliasing between main effects and interaction effects and among interaction effects. For run sizes that are not a multiple of four, no conclusive results are known. In this paper, we propose two algorithms that generate all non-isomorphic D- and A-optimal main-effects designs for run sizes that are one and two more than a multiple of four. We enumerate all such designs for run sizes up to 18, report the numbers of designs we obtained, and identify those that minimize the aliasing between main effects and interaction effects and among interaction effects. Finally, we compare the minimally aliased designs we found with benchmark designs from the literature.</description>

Abstract: We provide an example of a virtually $2$-step nilpotent group, and a specific generating set, for which the Green series (sometimes called cogrowth series) is not D-finite. The proof relies on an arithmetical miracle, and the study of the subword complexity of a multiplicative sequence coming out of it.</description>

      <title>Expectation and Variance of the Degree of a Node in Random Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Gibbs distribution over all spanning trees of an undirected, edge weighted finite graph, where, up to normalization, the probability of each tree is given by the product of its edge weights. Defining the weighted degree of a node as the sum of the weights of its incident edges, we present analytical expressions for the expectation, variance and covariance of the weighted degree of a node across the Gibbs distribution. To generalize our approach, we distinguish between two types of weight: probability weights, which regulate the distribution of spanning trees, and degree weights, which define the weighted degree of nodes. This distinction allows us to define the weighted degree of nodes independently of the probability weights. By leveraging the Matrix Tree Theorem, we show that these degree moments ultimately depend on the inverse of a submatrix of the graph Laplacian. While our focus is on undirected graphs, we demonstrate that our results can be extended to the directed setting by considering incoming directed trees instead.</description>

      <title>Jordan Type stratification of spaces of commuting nilpotent matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An $n\times n$ nilpotent matrix $B$ is determined up to conjugacy by a partition $P_B$ of $n$, its Jordan type given by the sizes of its Jordan blocks. The Jordan type $\mathfrak D(P)$ of a nilpotent matrix in the dense orbit of the nilpotent commutator of a given nilpotent matrix of Jordan type $P$ is stable - has parts differing pairwise by at least two - and was determined by R. Basili. The second two authors, with B. Van Steirteghem and R. Zhao determined a rectangular table of partitions $\mathfrak D^{-1}(Q)$ having a given stable partition $Q$ as the Jordan type of its maximum nilpotent commutator. They proposed a box conjecture, that would generalize the answer to stable partitions $Q$ having $\ell$ parts: it was proven recently by J.~Irving, T. Ko\v{s}ir and M. Mastnak.
  Using this result and also some tropical calculations, the authors here determine equations defining the loci of each partition in $\mathfrak D^{-1}(Q)$, when $Q$ is stable with two parts. The equations for each locus form a complete intersection. The authors propose a conjecture generalizing their result to arbitrary stable $Q$.</description>

      <title>Parameterised Holant Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the complexity of parameterised holant problems $\textsc{p-Holant}(\mathcal{S})$ for families of signatures~$\mathcal{S}$. The parameterised holant framework was introduced by Curticapean in 2015 as a counter-part to the classical theory of holographic reductions and algorithms and it constitutes an extensive family of coloured and weighted counting constraint satisfaction problems on graph-like structures, encoding as special cases various well-studied counting problems in parameterised and fine-grained complexity theory such as counting edge-colourful $k$-matchings, graph-factors, Eulerian orientations or, subgraphs with weighted degree constraints. We establish an exhaustive complexity trichotomy along the set of signatures $\mathcal{S}$: Depending on $\mathcal{S}$, $\textsc{p-Holant}(\mathcal{S})$ is: (1) solvable in FPT-near-linear time (i.e. $f(k)\cdot \tilde{\mathcal{O}}(|x|)$); (2) solvable in "FPT-matrix-multiplication time" (i.e. $f(k)\cdot {\mathcal{O}}(n^{\omega})$) but not solvable in FPT-near-linear time unless the Triangle Conjecture fails; or (3) #W[1]-complete and no significant improvement over brute force is possible unless ETH fails. This classification reveals a significant and surprising gap in the complexity landscape of parameterised Holants: Not only is every instance either fixed-parameter tractable or #W[1]-complete, but additionally, every FPT instance is solvable in time $f(k)\cdot {\mathcal{O}}(n^{\omega})$.
  We also establish a complete classification for a natural uncoloured version of parameterised holant problem $\textsc{p-UnColHolant}(\mathcal{S})$, which encodes as special cases the non-coloured analogues of the aforementioned examples. We show that the complexity of $\textsc{p-UnColHolant}(\mathcal{S})$ is different: Depending on $\mathcal{S}$ all instances are either solvable in FPT-near-linear time, or #W[1]-complete.</description>

      <title>A q-analog of certain symmetric functions and one of its specializations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11221v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let the symmetric functions be defined for the pair of integers $\left( n,r\right) $, $n\geq r\geq 1$, by $p_{n}^{\left( r\right) }=\sum m_{\lambda }$ where $m_{\lambda }$ are the monomial symmetric functions, the sum being over the partitions $\lambda $ of the integer $n$ with length $r$. We introduce by a generating function, a $q$-analog of $p_{n}^{\left( r\right) }$ and give some of its properties. This $q$-analog is related to its the classical form using the $q$-Stirling numbers. We also start with the same procedure the study of a $p,q$-analog of $p_{n}^{\left( r\right) }$.
  By specialization of this $q$-analog in the series $\sum\nolimits_{n=0}^{ \infty }q^{\binom{n}{2}}t^{n}/n!$, we recover in a purely formal way$\ $a class of polynomials $J_{n}^{\left( r\right) }$ historically introduced as combinatorial enumerators, in particular of tree inversions. This also results in a new linear recurrence for those polynomials whose triangular table can be constructed, row by row, from the initial conditions $ J_{r}^{\left( r\right) }=1$. The form of this recurrence is also given for the reciprocal polynomials of $J_{n}^{\left( r\right) }$, known to be the sum enumerators of parking functions. Explicit formulas for $J_{n}^{\left( r\right) }$ and their reciprocals are deduced, leading inversely to new representations of these polynomials as forest statistics.</description>

      <title>Recognition of chordal graphs and cographs which are Cover-Incomparability graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cover-Incomparability graphs (C-I graphs) are an interesting class of graphs from posets. A C-I graph is a graph from a poset $P=(V,\le)$ with vertex set $V$, and the edge-set is the union of edge sets of the cover graph and the incomparability graph of the poset. The recognition of the C-I graphs is known to be NP-complete (Maxov\'{a} et al., Order 26(3), 229--236(2009)). In this paper, we prove that chordal graphs having at most two independent simplicial vertices are exactly the chordal graphs which are also C-I graphs. A similar result is obtained for cographs as well. Using the structural results of these graphs, we derive linear time recognition algorithms for chordal graphs and cographs which are C-I graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every ordered set, we reconstruct the deck obtained by removal of the elements of rank r that are neither minimal nor maximal. Consequently, we also reconstruct the deck obtained by removal of the extremal, that is, minimal or maximal, elements. Finally, we reconstruct the ordered sets with a minmax pair of pseudo-similar points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $q$-deformed real numbers are power series with integer coefficients. We study Stieltjes and Jacobi type continued fraction expansions of $q$-deformed real numbers and find many new examples of such continued fractions. We also investigate the corresponding sequences of Hankel determinants and find an infinite family of power series for which several of the first sequences of Hankel determinants consist of $-1,0$ and $1$ only. These Hankel sequences satisfy Somos and Gale-Robinson recurrences.</description>

      <title>Results on pattern avoidance in parking functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly study two notions of pattern avoidance in parking functions. First, for any collection of length 3 patterns, we compute the number of parking functions of size $n$ that avoid them under the first notion. This is motivated by the recent work of Adeniran and Pudwell, who obtained analogous results using a second notion of pattern avoidance. Then, we provide new purely bijective proofs for two of their results, and improve the formula of another one. Finally, we apply similar enumeration techniques to the work of Novelli and Thibon on certain Hopf algebras of generalised parking functions, and compute their graded dimensions.</description>

      <title>Scattering diagrams for generalized cluster algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.02416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct scattering diagrams for Chekhov-Shapiro's generalized cluster algebras where exchange polynomials are factorized into binomials, generalizing the cluster scattering diagrams of Gross, Hacking, Keel and Kontsevich. They turn out to be natural objects arising in Fock and Goncharov's cluster duality. Analogous features and structures (such as positivity and the cluster complex structure) in the ordinary case also appear in the generalized situation. With the help of these scattering diagrams, we show that generalized cluster variables are theta functions and hence have certain positivity property with respect to the coefficients in the binomial factors.</description>

      <title>On the Identity and Group Problems for Complex Heisenberg Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Identity Problem, the problem of determining if a finitely generated semigroup of matrices contains the identity matrix; see Problem 3 (Chapter 10.3) in ``Unsolved Problems in Mathematical Systems and Control Theory'' by Blondel and Megretski (2004). This fundamental problem is known to be undecidable for $\mathbb{Z}^{4 \times 4}$ and decidable for $\mathbb{Z}^{2 \times 2}$. The Identity Problem has been recently shown to be in polynomial time by Dong for the Heisenberg group over complex numbers in any fixed dimension with the use of Lie algebra and the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. We develop alternative proof techniques for the problem making a step forward towards more general problems such as the Membership Problem. Using our techniques we also show that the problem of determining if a given set of Heisenberg matrices generates a group can be decided in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>The number of random 2-SAT solutions is asymptotically log-normal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that throughout the satisfiable phase, the logarithm of the number of satisfying assignments of a random 2-SAT formula satisfies a central limit theorem. This implies that the log of the number of satisfying assignments exhibits fluctuations of order $\sqrt n$, with $n$ the number of variables. The formula for the variance can be evaluated effectively. By contrast, for numerous other random constraint satisfaction problems the typical fluctuations of the logarithm of the number of solutions are {\em bounded} throughout all or most of the satisfiable regime.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric polynomials and algebro-combinatorial duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we develop a systematic combinatorial definition for constructed earlier supersymmetric polynomial families. These polynomial families generalize canonical Schur, Jack and Macdonald families so that the new polynomials depend on odd Grassmann variables as well. Members of these families are labeled by respective modifications of Young diagrams. We show that the super-Macdonald polynomials form a representation of a super-algebra analog $\mathsf{T}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$ of Ding-Ioahara-Miki (quantum toroidal) algebra, emerging as a BPS algebra of D-branes on a conifold. A supersymmetric modification for Young tableaux and Kostka numbers are also discussed.</description>

      <title>On variants of the Furstenberg set problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an integer $d \geq 2$, $s \in (0,1]$, and $t \in [0,2(d-1)]$, suppose a set $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ has the following property: there is a collection of lines of packing dimension $t$ such that every line from the collection intersects $X$ in a set of packing dimension at least $s$. We show that such sets must have packing dimension at least $\max\{s,t/2\}$ and that this bound is sharp. In particular, the special case $d=2$ solves a variant of the Furstenberg set problem for packing dimension. We also solve the upper and lower box dimension variants of the problem. In both of these cases the sharp threshold is $\max\{s,t+1-d\}$.</description>
