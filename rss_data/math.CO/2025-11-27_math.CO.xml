      <title>Existence of $S(2,9,369)$, new unitals of order $6$ and other Steiner systems with block length $\ge 7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whereas Steiner systems $S(2,k,v)$ with block length $k \le 5$ have large amount of examples and the existence is established for all admissible $v$, for $k\ge 6$ only few examples are known even for decided cases. In this paper the existence of $S(2,9,369)$ is established and some new examples for other admissible pairs $(k,v)$ are given. In particular, lots of new unitals of order $6$ (or $S(2,7,217)$) together with $S(2,7,175)$, $S(2,7,259)$, $S(2,8,120)$, $S(2,8,504)$, $S(2,9,513)$ are presented. Found examples suggest two conjectures on infinite series of designs.</description>

      <title>Hall's Harem Theorem with controlled sizes of cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a new version of Hall's Harem Theorem, where the final matching is realized by a unary function with additional conditions on behavior of cycles. The present paper can be considered as a helpful companion of the paper of the author: arXiv:2105.06304, where a computable version of Hall's Harem Theorem with controlled sizes of cycles is proved. These two versions of Hall's Harem Theorem are independent: none of them follows from the other one.</description>

      <title>The $d$-gonal locus in the moduli space of tropical plane curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the locus $\mathbb{M}_{g,d}^\textrm{nd}$ of genus $g$ tropical plane curves of gonality $d$ inside the moduli space $\mathbb{M}^{\textrm{nd}}_{g}$ of tropical plane curves of genus $g$. Each such tropical curve arises from a Newton polygon, and we conjecture that the gonality of the tropical curve is equal to an easily computed parameter of this polygon called the expected gonality, closely related to the lattice width of the polygon. Let $\mathbb{M}_{g,{\underline{d}}}^\textrm{nd}$ denote the locus of tropical curves whose associated Newton polygon has expected gonality $d$. We prove that for fixed $d$ and sufficiently large genus $g$, the dimensions of these two loci agree: \[ \\dim\left(\mathbb{M}_{g,d}^\textrm{nd}\right) =\dim\left(\mathbb{M}_{g,{\underline{d}}}^\textrm{nd}\right). \] Our results provide evidence that, in sufficiently high genus compared to expected gonality, the gonality of a tropical curve is determined by the expected gonality of the Newton polygon from which it arises.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal partitions into four parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous pancake theorem states that for every finite set $X$ in the plane, there exist two orthogonal lines that divide $X$ into four equal parts. We propose an algorithm whose running time is linear in the number of points in $X$ and prove that this complexity is optimal. We also consider generalizations of the pancake theorem and show that orthogonal hyperplanes can be found in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>A new factorization of the generalized period-doubling sequences through kernel words and gaps sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study some new factorizations of period-doubling sequences over a $k$-letter alphabet, where $k\geq 2$. First, we define the combinatorial and arithmetic properties of these sequences. Then, we define the kernel words of period-doubling sequences and demonstrate how to factorize a binary sequence using its kernel words. Next, we define gap sequences for period-doubling sequences and explore their relationship with kernel words. Lastly, we present a factorization of period-doubling sequences for $k\geq 3$ based on kernel words and gap sequences.</description>

      <title>Toward a Canonical Representation of Blocked Rectangular Grids with an Application to Finite Tiling Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the collection of all $m\times n$ rectangular grids which have a fixed number $1\leq r\leq mn$ of blocked cells, we explicitly describe a proper subset of the collection which is guaranteed to contain at least one grid from each equivalence class under symmetry, eliminating the majority of redundant grids. We analyze the extent to which redundant grids remain in the reduced set, and give general cases in which our methods exactly produce a complete set of canonical representatives for the equivalence classes. As an application of our results, we specify collections of polyomino tiling problems and find all solvable grids in each collection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the expected number of calls required to achieve Bingo in a generalized (n,m)-Bingo game, where each n x n card is filled by sampling n numbers from m possible values per column. Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we derive exact formulas for the probability distribution and the expected game length. Our main theoretical result proves that the expected number of calls is a linear function of m.</description>

      <title>Permutations Almost Avoiding Monotone Distant Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous work, B\'ona and Pantone studied permutations that avoided all but one pattern of length $k$ that began with a length $k-1$ increasing subsequence. We draw the connection between that idea and distant patterns, first discussed heavily in a work by Dimitrov, and study similar permutation classes, where the index not part of the increasing subsequence can vary. We find a large class of Wilf-Equivalences between $k+1$ classes of $k$ patterns of length $k+1$, and outline several classes of unbalanced Wilf-Equivalences related to the first class. Using this, we are also find new bounds on the exponential growth rate on all monotone distant patterns with a single gap constraint.</description>

      <title>Impartial Games with Activeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A combinatorial game is a two-player game without hidden information or chance elements. The main object of combinatorial game theory is to obtain the outcome, which player has a winning strategy, of a given combinatorial game. Positions of many well-known combinatorial games are naturally decomposed into a disjunctive sum of multiple components and can be analyzed independently for each component. Therefore, the study of disjunctive sums is a major topic in combinatorial game theory. Combinatorial games in which both players have the same set of possible moves for every position are called impartial games. In the normal-play convention, it is known that the outcome of a disjunctive sum of impartial games can be obtained by computing the Grundy number of each term. The theory of impartial games is generalized in various forms. This paper proposes another generalization of impartial games to a new framework, impartial games with activeness: each game is assigned a status of either ``active'' or ``inactive''; the status may change by moves; a disjunctive sum of games ends immediately, not only when no further moves can be made, but also when all terms become inactive. We formally introduce impartial games with activeness and investigate their fundamental properties.</description>

      <title>Even with AI, Bijection Discovery is Still Hard: The Opportunities and Challenges of OpenEvolve for Novel Bijection Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary program synthesis systems such as AlphaEvolve, OpenEvolve, and ShinkaEvolve offer a new approach to AI-assisted mathematical discovery. These systems utilize teams of large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate solutions to a problem as human readable code. These candidate solutions are then 'evolved' with the goal of improving them beyond what an LLM can produce in a single shot. While existing mathematical applications have mostly focused on problems of establishing bounds (e.g., sphere packing), the program synthesis approach is well suited to any problem where the solution takes the form of an explicit construction. With this in mind, in this paper we explore the use of OpenEvolve for combinatorial bijection discovery. We describe the results of applying OpenEvolve to three bijection construction problems involving Dyck paths, two of which are known and one of which is open. We find that while systems like OpenEvolve show promise as a valuable tool for combinatorialists, the problem of finding novel, research-level bijections remains a challenging task for current frontier systems, reinforcing the need for human mathematicians in the loop. We describe some lessons learned for others in the field interested in exploring the use of these systems.</description>

      <title>Density of rainbow triangles and properly colored $K_4$'s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T.-W. Chao and H.-H. H. Yu showed in 2023 that a graph with $R$ red, $G$ green, and $B$ blue edges has at most $\sqrt{2 RGB}$ rainbow triangles. They proved this bound using the entropy method. We give a computer-free flag-algebra proof of this bound, and we also convert our proof into a classical counting proof. The ideas in our proof lead to an even shorter entropy proof. We also show uniqueness of the extremal construction.
  Additionally, we prove a similar result that gives a sharp upper bound on the number of properly $3$-edge-colored $K_4$'s in graphs with $R$ red, $G$ green and $B$ blue edges.</description>

      <title>A hypergraph analogue of Alon-Frankl Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Alon and Frankl (JCTB, 2024) determined the maximum number of edges in $K_{\ell+1}$-free $n$-vertex graphs with bounded matching number. For integers $\ell\ge r \ge 2$, the family $\mathcal{K}_{\ell+1}^{r}$ consists of all $r$-graphs $F$ with at most $\binom{\ell+1}{2}$ edges such that, for some $(\ell+1)$-set $K$, every pair $\{x,y\} \subseteq K$ is covered by an edge in $F$. In this paper, we study the maximum number of edges in $\mathcal{K}_{\ell+1}^r$-free $r$-uniform hypergraphs that have the matching number at most $s$, that is, $\mathrm{ex}_r(n, \{\mathcal{K}_{\ell+1}^r, M^r_{s+1}\})$, and obtain the exact value for sufficiently large $n$, along with the corresponding extremal hypergraph. This result can be viewed as a hypergraph extension of the work of Alon and Frankl. In addition, for the $3$-uniform Fano plane $\mathbb{F}$, we determine the exact value of $\mathrm{ex}_3(n, \{\mathbb{F}, M^3_{s+1}\})$, and characterize the corresponding extremal hypergraph.</description>

      <title>On Coalition Graphs and Coalition Count of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and order $n$. A coalition in a graph $G$ consists of two disjoint sets of vertices $V_1$ and $V_2$, neither of which is a dominating set but whose union $V_1 \cup V_2$ is a dominating set. A coalition partition, abbreviated $c$-partition, in a graph $G$ is a vertex partition $\pi=\left\{V_1 , V_2,\dots, V_k\right\}$ such that every set $V_i$ of $\pi$ is either a singleton dominating set, or is not a dominating set but forms a coalition with another set $V_j$ in $\pi$. The sets $V_i$ and $V_j$ are coalition partners in $G$. The coalition number $C(G)$ equals the maximum order $k$ of a $c$-partition of $G$. For any graph $G$ with a $c$-partition $\pi=\left\{V_1,V_2,\dots,V_k\right\}$, the coalition graph $CG(G,\pi)$ of $G$ is a graph with vertex set $V_1,V_2,\dots, V_k$, corresponding one-to-one with the set $\pi$, and two vertices $V_i$ and $V_j$ are adjacent in $CG(G,\pi)$ if and only if the sets $V_i$ and $V_j$ are coalition partners in $\pi$. In [4], authors proved that for every graph $G$ there exist a graph $H$ and $c$-partition $\pi$ such that $CG(H,\pi)\cong G$, and raised the question: Does there exist a graph $H^*$ of smaller order $n^*$ and size $m^*$ with a $c$-partition $\pi^*$ such that $CG(H^*,\pi^*)\cong G$?. In this paper, we constructed a graph $H^*$ of small order and size and a $c$- partition $\pi^*$ such that $CG(H^*,\pi^*)\cong G$. Recently, Haynes et al.[5] defined the coalition count $c(G)$ of a graph $G$ as the maximum number of different coalition in any $c$-partition of $G$. We characterize all graphs $G$ with $c(G)=1$. Further, imposing some suitable conditions on coalition number, we study the properties of coalition count of graph.</description>

      <title>On the order-diameter ratio of girth-diameter cages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For integers $k,g,d$, a $(k;g,d)$-cage (or simply girth-diameter cage) is a smallest $k$-regular graph of girth $g$ and diameter $d$ (if it exists). The order of a $(k;g,d)$-cage is denoted by $n(k;g,d)$. We determine asymptotic lower and upper bounds for the ratio between the order and the diameter of girth-diameter cages as the diameter goes to infinity. We also prove that this ratio can be computed in constant time for fixed $k$ and $g$.
  We theoretically determine the exact values $n(3;g,d)$, and count the number of corresponding girth-diameter cages, for $g \in \{4,5\}$. Moreover, we design and implement an exhaustive graph generation algorithm and use it to determine the exact order of several open cases and obtain -- often exhaustive -- sets of the corresponding girth-diameter cages. The largest case we generated and settled with our algorithm is a $(3;7,35)$-cage of order 136.</description>

      <title>Secure coalitions in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A secure coalition in a graph $G$ consists of two disjoint vertex sets $V_1$ and $V_2$, neither of which is a secure dominating set, but whose union $V_1 \cup V_2$ forms a secure dominating set. A secure coalition partition ($sec$-partition) of $G$ is a vertex partition $\pi = \{V_1, V_2, \dots, V_k\}$ where each set $V_i$ is either a secure dominating set consisting of a single vertex of degree $n-1$, or a set that is not a secure dominating set but forms a secure coalition with some other set $V_j \in \pi$. The maximum cardinality of a secure coalition partition of $G$ is called the secure coalition number of $G$, denoted $SEC(G)$. For every $sec$-partition $\pi$ of a graph $G$, we associate a graph called the secure coalition graph of $G$ with respect to $\pi$, denoted $SCG(G,\pi)$, where the vertices of $SCG(G,\pi)$ correspond to the sets $V_1, V_2, \dots, V_k$ of $\pi$, and two vertices are adjacent in $SCG(G,\pi)$ if and only if their corresponding sets in $\pi$ form a secure coalition in $G$. In this study, we prove that every graph admits a $sec$-partition. Further, we characterize the graphs $G$ with $SEC(G) \in \{1,2,n\}$ and all trees $T$ with $SEC(T) = n-1$. Finally, we show that every graph $G$ without isolated vertices is a secure coalition graph.</description>

      <title>Varieties of Lines in 3-Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider configurations of lines in 3-space with incidences prescribed by a graph. This defines a subvariety in a product of Grassmannians. Leveraging a connection with rigidity theory in the plane, for any graph, we determine the dimension of the incidence variety and characterize when it is irreducible or a complete intersection. We study its multidegree and the family of Schubert problems it encodes. Our spanning-tree coordinates enable efficient symbolic computations. We also provide numerical irreducible decompositions for incidence varieties with up to eight lines. These constructions with lines play a key role in the Landau analysis of scattering amplitudes in particle physics.</description>

Abstract: We construct explicit families of graphs whose eigenvalues are asymptotically distributed according to Wigner's semicircle law; in other words, that are spectrally indistinguishable from random graphs. However, in other respects they are strikingly dissimilar from random graphs; for example, they are $K_{2,3}$-free graphs with almost the maximum possible edge density.</description>

      <title>On existence of neutral graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph is considered neutral if its assortativity coefficient $r$ is equal to zero. In this paper, we address an outstanding conjecture, i.e., whether is there a neutral graph on $n$ vertices. First, we show that for $n\geq7$, there is at least one neutral tree, which suggests that we find a representative of any order neutral graph. Additionally, we obtain that given $n\geq13$, there exist at least one neutral non-tree graph.</description>

      <title>A PTR polynomial for the Hughes planes and a new class of permutation polynomials involving Catalan numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hughes introduced the projective planes that bear his name in 1957 and they have since been studied extensively. However, until now, no polynomial representation of a planar ternary ring that represents them has been determined. In this paper, we rectify this omission by determining a reduced PTR polynomial for any Hughes plane defined over a regular nearfield. The polynomials obtained provide a new surprising connection: both the Catalan numbers and generalized Catalan numbers occur among the coefficients, depending on the representation. Since every PTR polynomial has connections with several classes of permutation polynomials, we obtain three new infinite classes of permutation polynomials as a consequence of our main result, and these, too, involve the Catalan numbers. The differential uniformity of new permutation polynomials is also determined.</description>

      <title>Relative Tur\'an densities for ordered graphs: all and nothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reiher, R\"odl, Sales, and Schacht initiated the study of relative Tur\'an densities of ordered graphs and showed that it is more subtle and interesting than the unordered case. For an ordered graph $F$, its relative Tur\'an density, $\rho_{&lt;}(F)$, is the greatest $\alpha$ such that every ordered graph $G$ has an $F$-free subgraph with at least $\alpha e(G)$ edges.
  This paper contains two main results about relative Tur\'an densities. First, we find a family of host graphs that is optimal for all $F$. Second, we characterise the ordered graphs with zero relative Tur\'an density: precisely those with no monotone path of length two.</description>

      <title>A complete solution of the Erd\H{o}s-Kleitman matching problem for $n\le 3s$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given integers $n\ge s\ge 2$, let $e(n,s)$ stand for the maximum size of a family of subsets of an $n$-element set that contains no $s$ pairwise disjoint members. The study of this quantity goes back to the 1960s, when Kleitman determined $e(sm-1,s)$ and $e(sm,s)$ for all integer $m,s\ge 1$. The question of determining $e(n,s)$ is closely connected to its uniform counterpart, the subject of the famous Erd\H{o}s Matching Conjecture.
  The problem of determining $e(n,s)$ has proven to be very hard and, in spite of some progress during these years, even a general conjecture concerning the value of $e(n,s)$ is missing. In this paper, we completely solve the problem for $n\le 3s$. In this regime, the average size of a set in an $s$-matching is at most $3$, and it is a delicate interplay between the `missing' $2$- and $3$-element sets that plays a key role here. Four types of extremal families appear in the characterization. Our result sheds light on how the extremal function $e(n,s)$ may behave in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work by Botkin, Dawsey, Hemmer, Just and the present author, a deterministic model of prime number distribution is developed based on properties of integer partitions that gives almost exact estimates for $\pi(n)$, the number of primes less than or equal to positive integer $n$, up to $n=10{,}000$. In this follow-up paper, the author summarizes the ideas behind this partition-theoretic model of primes and formulates a computational model that is practically exact in its estimates of $\pi(n)$ up to $n=100,000$.</description>

      <title>Quadratic-Time Algorithm for the Maximum-Weight $(k, \ell)$-Sparse Subgraph Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The family of $(k, \ell)$-sparse graphs, introduced by Lorea, plays a central role in combinatorial optimization and has a wide range of applications, particularly in rigidity theory. A key algorithmic challenge is to compute a maximum-weight $(k, \ell)$-sparse subgraph of a given edge-weighted graph. Although prior approaches have long provided an $O(nm)$-time solution, a previously proposed $O(n^2 + m)$ method was based on an incorrect analysis, leaving open whether this bound is achievable.
  We answer this question affirmatively by presenting the first $O(n^2 + m)$-time algorithm for computing a maximum-weight $(k, \ell)$-sparse subgraph, which combines an efficient data structure with a refined analysis. This quadratic-time algorithm enables faster solutions to key problems in rigidity theory, including computing minimum-weight redundantly rigid and globally rigid subgraphs. Further applications include enumerating non-crossing minimally rigid frameworks and recognizing kinematic joints. Our implementation of the proposed algorithm is publicly available online.</description>

      <title>Equivariant homology of the symplectic affine Grassmannian and dual affine Schur $P$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the torus-equivariant homology $H_*^T(\mathrm{Gr}_G)$ of the affine Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}_G$, where $G=\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ is the symplectic group. This homology admits a natural ring structure and a Schubert basis, giving rise to a well-defined Schubert calculus. We realize $H_*^T(\mathrm{Gr}_G)$ in terms of symmetric functions. Our first main result introduces a new family of symmetric functions, called the \emph{dual affine Schur $P$-functions}, which represent the Schubert classes. These functions are defined through the action of the affine nil-Hecke algebra, and specialize, in the stable limit as $n\to \infty$, to the dual factorial $P$-functions of Nakagawa and Naruse. Our second main result gives a precise comparison between this symmetric function model and the geometric construction of $H_*^T (\mathrm{Gr}_G)$ due to Ginzburg and Peterson, which identifies it with a coordinate ring of a centralizer family in the Langlands dual group.</description>

Abstract: Given a language, which in this article is a set of strings of some fixed length, we study the problem of producing its elements by a procedure in which each position has its own local rule. We introduce a way of measuring how much communication is needed between positions. The communication structure is captured by a simplicial complex whose vertices are the positions and the simplices are the communication channels between positions. The main problem is then to identify the simplicial complexes that can be used to generate a given language. We develop the theory and apply it to a number of languages.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the self-projecting Grassmannian, an irreducible subvariety of the Grassmannian parametrizing linear subspaces that satisfy a generalized self-duality condition. We study its relation to classical moduli spaces, such as the moduli spaces of pointed curves of genus $g$, as well as to other natural subvarieties of the Grassmannian. We further translate the self-projectivity condition in the combinatorial language of matroids, introducing self-projecting matroids, and we computationally investigate their realization spaces inside the self-projecting Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits of critical FK-decorated random planar maps with $q=4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the first scaling limit for FK($q$)-weighted planar maps in the critical case $q=4$, resolving a problem that has remained open since Sheffield's seminal work arXiv:1108.2241. In that work, Sheffield proved a scaling limit for $q&lt;4$ via the celebrated hamburger-cheeseburger bijection, which initiated the peanosphere (mating-of-trees) approach to Liouville quantum gravity. We prove that, at criticality, the associated burger count $\mathcal{S}$ and discrepancy $\mathcal{D}$ satisfy \[ \left(\frac{\mathcal{S}_{\lfloor nt \rfloor}}{\sqrt{n}}, \frac{\log(n)}{{2\pi }\sqrt{n}} \mathcal{D}_{\lfloor nt \rfloor}\right)_{t\in\mathbb{R}} \stackrel{\text{d}}{\longrightarrow} (B^1_t, B^2_{t})_{t\in\mathbb{R}}, \] where $B^1$ and $B^2$ are independent two-sided Brownian motions. To the best of our knowledge, no conjecture for the correct discrepancy scaling factor had previously been formulated. Matching the limiting process with the critical mating of trees arXiv:2109.00275, we establish the first rigorous planar map convergence towards CLE$_4$ and critical ($\gamma=2$) Liouville quantum gravity, in the peanosphere sense. Our proof is based on a novel approach that reveals the exactly solvable nature of the model through a correspondence with the (bicoloured) fully packed loop-$O(2)$ model on triangulations, and yields critical geometric exponents matching the predictions of conformal field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relations under Weihrauch reducibility of the well-ordering preservation principle for the operator $X \mapsto X^\omega$ and the Ordered Ramsey Theorem. Both principles are known to be equivalent to $\Sigma^0_2$-induction in Reverse Mathematics.
  We show that the Ordered Ramsey Theorem is Weihrauch-equivalent to the parallel product of the well-ordering preservation principle for the operator $X \mapsto X^\omega$ and the Eventually Constant Tail principle.
  By previous work from Pauly, Pradic and Sold\`a, the Ordered Ramsey Theorem is known to be Weihrauch-equivalent to the parallel product of the Eventually Constant Tail principle and the parallelization of the jump of the Limited Principle of Omniscience. We show that the latter pinciple and the well-ordering preservation principle for $X \mapsto X^\omega$ are Weihrauch-incomparable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents conjectures about eigenvalues of matrices associated with $k$-path graphs, the algebraic connectivity, defined as the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, and the $\alpha$-index, as the largest eigenvalue of the $A_{\alpha}$-matrix. For this purpose, a process based in Pereira et al., is presented to generate lists of $k$-path graphs containing all non-isomorphic 2-paths, 3-paths, and 4-paths of order $n$, for $6 \leq n \leq 26, 8 \leq n \leq 19$, and $10 \leq n \leq 18$, respectively. Using these lists, exhaustive searches for extremal graphs of fixed order for the mentioned eigenvalues were performed. Based on the empirical results, conjectures are suggested about the structure of extremal $k$-path graphs for these eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Nearly Tight Lower Bounds for Relaxed Locally Decodable Codes via Robust Daisies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show a nearly optimal lower bound on the length of linear relaxed locally decodable codes (RLDCs). Specifically, we prove that any $q$-query linear RLDC $C\colon \{0,1\}^k \to \{0,1\}^n$ must satisfy $n = k^{1+\Omega(1/q)}$. This bound closely matches the known upper bound of $n = k^{1+O(1/q)}$ by Ben-Sasson, Goldreich, Harsha, Sudan, and Vadhan (STOC 2004).
  Our proof introduces the notion of robust daisies, which are relaxed sunflowers with pseudorandom structure, and leverages a new spread lemma to extract dense robust daisies from arbitrary distributions.</description>

Abstract: We show that there is a set which is not a set of multiple recurrence despite being a set of recurrence for nil-Bohr sets. This answers Huang, Shao, and Ye's \enquote{higher-order} version of Katznelson's Question on Bohr recurrence and topological recurrence in the negative. Equivalently, we construct a set $S$ so that there is a finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ without three-term arithmetic progressions with common differences in $S$, but so that $S$ lacks the usual polynomial obstacles to arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>On BPI in Symmetric Extensions Part 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historically, proofs of $\mathrm{BPI}$ in models without choice have relied on a contradiction framework that was introduced by Halpern. We introduce the filter extension property for permutation models and symmetric extensions, which formalizes the na\"ive approach to extend arbitrary filters to ultrafilters by repeatedly extending filters by minimal increments. We use this framework to give the first direct proof of $\mathrm{BPI}$ in the generalized Cohen model $N(I,Q)$ -- a model that adds a Dedekind-finite set of mutually $Q$-generic filters over a ground model $M\vDash\mathrm{ZFC}$. In the case that the index set $I$ is large, we adapt Harrington's proof of the Halpern-L\"auchli theorem to prove the result. We then extend the results from Karagila and Schlicht to show that $I$ can be assumed to be large without loss of generality. The approach given by Harrington's proof is essentially dynamical, and we show that this technique can be used in permutation models to reprove a direction of Blass' theorem: that a dynamical condition called the Ramsey property is sufficient for $\mathrm{BPI}$ to hold in a permutation model. We then introduce a dynamical generalization of the Ramsey property called the virtual Ramsey property, which abstracts core features of our adaptation of Harrington's proof, and we prove that the virtual Ramsey property is sufficient for $\mathrm{BPI}$ to hold in a symmetric extension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2003.03786v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate algebraic properties of big Ramsey degrees in categories satisfying some mild conditions. As the first nontrivial consequence of the generalization we advocate in this paper we prove that small Ramsey degrees are the minima of the corresponding big ones. We also prove that big Ramsey degrees are subadditive and show that equality is enforced by an abstract property of objects we refer to as self-similarity. Finally, we apply the abstract machinery developed in the paper to show that if a countable relational structure has finite big Ramsey degrees, then so do its quantifier-free reducts. In particular, it follows that the reducts of (Q, &lt;), the random graph, the random tournament and (Q, &lt;, 0) all have finite big Ramsey degrees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.09915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The matching complex of a graph $G$ is a simplicial complex whose simplices are matchings in $G$. In the last few years the matching complexes of grid graphs have gained much attention among the topological combinatorists. In 2017, Braun and Hough obtained homological results related to the matching complexes of $2 \times n$ grid graphs. Further in 2019, Matsushita showed that the matching complexes of $2 \times n$ grid graphs are homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres. In this article we prove that the matching complexes of $3\times n$ grid graphs are homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres. We also give the comprehensive list of the dimensions of spheres appearing in the wedge.</description>

      <title>Biembeddings of Archdeacon type: their full automorphism group and their number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.02066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Archdeacon, in his seminal paper $[1]$, defined the concept of Heffter array in order to provide explicit constructions of $\mathbb{Z}_{v}$-regular biembeddings of complete graphs $K_v$ into orientable surfaces.
  In this paper, we first introduce the quasi-Heffter arrays as a generalization of the concept of Heffer array and we show that, in this context, we can define a $2$-colorable embedding of Archdeacon type of the complete multipartite graph $K_{\frac{v}{t}\times t}$ into an orientable surface. Then, our main goal is to study the full automorphism groups of these embeddings: here we are able to prove, using a probabilistic approach, that, almost always, this group is exactly $\mathbb{Z}_{v}$.
  As an application of this result, given a positive integer $t\not\equiv 0\pmod{4}$, we prove that there are, for infinitely many pairs of $v$ and $k$, at least $(1-o(1)) \frac{(\frac{v-t}{2})!}{\phi(v)} $ non-isomorphic biembeddings of $K_{\frac{v}{t}\times t}$ whose face lengths are multiples of $k$. Here $\phi(\cdot)$ denotes the Euler's totient function. Moreover, in case $t=1$ and $v$ is a prime, almost all these embeddings define faces that are all of the same length $kv$, i.e. we have a more than exponential number of non-isomorphic $kv$-gonal biembeddings of $K_{v}$.</description>

Abstract: A $k$-ribbon tiling is a decomposition of a connected skew diagram into disjoint ribbons of size $k$. In this paper, we establish a connection between a subset of $k$-ribbon tilings and Petrie symmetric functions, thus providing a combinatorial interpretation for the coefficients in a Pieri-like rule for the Petrie symmetric functions due to Grinberg (Algebr. Comb. 5 (2022), no. 5, 947-1013). This also extends a result by Cheng, Chou and Eu et al. (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 151 (2023), no. 5, 1839-1854). As a bonus, our findings can be effectively utilized to derive certain specializations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $q$-matroid is the analogue of a matroid which arises by replacing the finite ground set of a matroid with a finite-dimensional vector space over a finite field. These $q$-matroids are motivated by coding theory as the representable $q$-matroids are the ones that stem from rank-metric codes. In this note, we establish a $q$-analogue of Nelson's theorem in matroid theory by proving that asymptotically almost all $q$-matroids are not representable. This answers a question about representable $q$-matroids by Jurrius and Pellikaan strongly in the negative.</description>

      <title>Counting Perfect Matchings In Dirac Hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the foundational theorems of extremal graph theory is Dirac's theorem, which says that if an n-vertex graph G has minimum degree at least n/2, then G has a Hamilton cycle, and therefore a perfect matching (if n is even). Later work by S\'arkozy, Selkow and Szemer\'edi showed that in fact Dirac graphs have many Hamilton cycles and perfect matchings, culminating in a result of Cuckler and Kahn that gives a precise description of the numbers of Hamilton cycles and perfect matchings in a Dirac graph G (in terms of an entropy-like parameter of G).
  In this paper we extend Cuckler and Kahn's result to perfect matchings in hypergraphs. For positive integers d &lt; k, and for n divisible by k, let $m_{d}(k,n)$ be the minimum d-degree that ensures the existence of a perfect matching in an n-vertex k-uniform hypergraph. In general, it is an open question to determine (even asymptotically) the values of $m_{d}(k,n)$, but we are nonetheless able to prove an analogue of the Cuckler-Kahn theorem, showing that if an n-vertex k-uniform hypergraph G has minimum d-degree at least $(1+\gamma)m_{d}(k,n)$ (for any constant $\gamma&gt;0$), then the number of perfect matchings in G is controlled by an entropy-like parameter of G. This strengthens cruder estimates arising from work of Kang-Kelly-K\"uhn-Osthus-Pfenninger and Pham-Sah-Sawhney-Simkin.</description>

      <title>Regular subgraphs at every density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1975, Erd\H{o}s and Sauer asked to estimate, for any constant $r$, the maximum number of edges an $n$-vertex graph can have without containing an $r$-regular subgraph. In a recent breakthrough, Janzer and Sudakov proved that any $n$-vertex graph with no $r$-regular subgraph has at most $C_r n \log \log n$ edges, matching an earlier lower bound by Pyber, R\"odl and Szemer\'edi and thereby resolving the Erd\H{o}s-Sauer problem up to a constant depending on $r$. We prove that every $n$-vertex graph without an $r$-regular subgraph has at most $Cr^2 n \log \log n$ edges. This bound is tight up to the value of $C$ for $n\geq n_0(r)$ and hence resolves the Erd\H{o}s-Sauer problem up to an absolute constant.
  Moreover, we obtain similarly tight results for the whole range of possible values of $r$ (i.e., not just when $r$ is a constant), apart from a small error term at a transition point near $r\approx \log n$, where, perhaps surprisingly, the answer changes. More specifically, we show that every $n$-vertex graph with average degree at least $\min(Cr\log(n/r),Cr^2 \log\log n)$ contains an $r$-regular subgraph. The bound $Cr\log(n/r)$ is tight for $r\geq \log n$, while the bound $Cr^2 \log \log n$ is tight for $r&lt;(\log n)^{1-\Omega(1)}$. These results resolve a problem of R\"odl and Wysocka from 1997 for almost all values of $r$.
  Among other tools, we develop a novel random process that efficiently finds a very nearly regular subgraph in any almost-regular graph. A key step in our proof uses this novel random process to show that every $K$-almost-regular graph with average degree $d$ contains an $r$-regular subgraph for some $r=\Omega_K(d)$, which is of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a matrix for a mixed graph, called the integrated adjacency matrix. This matrix uniquely determines a mixed graph, as long as the indices of the matrix are specified. Additionally, we associate an (undirected) graph with each mixed graph, enabling the spectral analysis of the integrated adjacency matrix to connect the structural properties of the mixed graph and its associated graph. Furthermore, we define certain mixed graph structures and establish their relationships to the eigenvalues of the integrated adjacency matrix.</description>

Abstract: Positive geometries are semialgebraic sets equipped with a canonical differential form whose residues mirror the boundary structure of the geometry. Every full-dimensional projective polytope is a positive geometry. Motivated by the canonical forms of polytopes, we construct a canonical form for any tope of an oriented matroid, inside the Orlik--Solomon algebra of the underlying matroid. Using these canonical forms, we construct bases for the Orlik--Solomon algebra of a matroid, and for the Aomoto cohomology. These bases of canonical forms are a foundational input in the theory of matroid amplitudes introduced by the second author.</description>

Abstract: Webs are graphical objects that give a tangible, combinatorial way to compute and classify tensor invariants. Recently, [Gaetz, Pechenik, Pfannerer, Striker, Swanson 2023+] found a rotation-invariant web basis for $\mathrm{SL}_4$, as well as its quantum deformation $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_4)$, and a bijection between move equivalence classes of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_4)$-webs and fluctuating tableaux such that web rotation corresponds to tableau promotion. They also found a bijection between the set of plane partitions in an $a\times b\times c$ box and a benzene move equivalence class of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_4)$-webs by determining the corresponding oscillating tableau. In this paper, we similarly find the oscillating tableaux corresponding to plane partitions in certain symmetry classes. We furthermore show that there is a projection from $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_4)$ invariants to $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_r)$ for $r=2,3$ for webs arising from certain symmetry classes.</description>

      <title>Additive structures imply more distances in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a set $E \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^d$, the distance set is defined as $\Delta(E) := \{\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\| : \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in E\}$, where $\|\cdot\|$ denotes the standard quadratic form. We investigate the Erd\H{o}s--Falconer distance problem within the flexible class of $(u, s)$--Salem sets introduced by Jonathan M. Fraser, with emphasis on the even case $u = 4$. By exploiting the exact identity between $\|\widehat{E}\|_4$ and the fourth additive energy $\Lambda_4(E)$, we prove that quantitative gains in $\Lambda_4(E)$ force the existence of many distances.
  In particular, for a $(4, s)$--Salem set $E\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ with $d \geq 2$, if \[ |E|\gg q^{\min\left\{\frac{d+2}{4s+1}, \frac{d+4}{8s}\right\}}, \] then $E$ determines a positive proportion of all distances. This strictly improves Fraser's threshold of $\frac{d}{4s}$ and the Iosevich-Rudnev bound of $q^{\frac{d+1}{2}}$ in certain parameter ranges. As applications, we obtain improved thresholds for multiplicative subgroups and sets on arbitrary varieties, and establish a sharp incidence bound for Salem sets that is of independent interest in incidence geometry. Moreover, our methods give sharp lower bounds for the number of distinct distances determined by two different sets. We also propose a unified conjecture for $(4, s)$--Salem sets that reconciles known bounds and pinpoints the odd-dimensional sphere regime: in odd dimensions $d \geq 3$, the often-cited $\frac{d-1}{2}$ threshold does not follow without additional structures. This provides a clear picture of the spherical distance conjecture.</description>

Abstract: In the context of generating uniform random contingency tables with pre-specified marginals, the number of (binary) matrices with given row- and column-sums is a well-studied object in the literature. We will denote this number by $N(p,q)$, where $p$ and $q$ are the vectors of row- and column-sums. The existing literature is mainly focused on computing or approximating $N(p,q)$. In this paper, we present two identities for polynomials whose coefficients depend on the $N(p,q)$ and explore some consequences.</description>

      <title>Enumerating minimal dominating sets in the (in)comparability graphs of bounded dimension posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.07214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enumerating minimal transversals in a hypergraph is a notoriously hard problem. It can be reduced to enumerating minimal dominating sets in a graph, in fact even to enumerating minimal dominating sets in an incomparability graph. We provide an output-polynomial time algorithm for incomparability graphs whose underlying posets have bounded dimension. Through a different proof technique, we also provide an output-polynomial algorithm for their complements, i.e., for comparability graphs of bounded dimension posets.
  Our algorithm for incomparability graphs is based on flashlight search and relies on the geometrical representation of incomparability graphs with bounded dimension, as given by Golumbic et al. in 1983. It runs with polynomial delay and only needs polynomial space. Our algorithm for comparability graphs is based on the flipping method introduced by Golovach et al. in 2015. It performs in incremental-polynomial time and requires exponential space.
  In addition, we show how to improve the flipping method so that it requires only polynomial space. Since the flipping method is a key tool for the best known algorithms enumerating minimal dominating sets in a number of graph classes, this yields direct improvements on the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Space Complexity of Vertex Connectivity Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.00408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $k$-vertex connectivity oracle for undirected $G$ is a data structure that, given $u,v\in V(G)$, reports $\min\{k,\kappa(u,v)\}$, where $\kappa(u,v)$ is the pairwise vertex connectivity between $u,v$. There are three main measures of efficiency: construction time, query time, and space. Prior work of Izsak and Nutov shows that a data structure of total size $\tilde{O}(kn)$ can even be encoded as a $\tilde{O}(k)$-bit labeling scheme so that vertex-connectivity queries can be answered in $\tilde{O}(k)$ time. The construction time is polynomial, but unspecified.
  In this paper we address the top three complexity measures: Space, Query Time, and Construction Time. We give an $\Omega(kn)$-bit lower bound on any vertex connectivity oracle. We construct an optimal-space connectivity oracle in max-flow time that answers queries in $O(\log n)$ time, independent of $k$.</description>

      <title>Variations on the Nerve Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a locally finite cover of a simplicial complex by subcomplexes, Bj\"orner's version of the Nerve Theorem provides conditions under which the homotopy groups of the nerve agree with those of the original complex through a range of dimensions. We extend this result to covers of CW complexes by subcomplexes and to open covers of arbitrary topological spaces, without local finiteness restrictions. Moreover, we show that under somewhat weaker hypotheses, the same conclusion holds when one utilizes the multinerve introduced by Colin de Verdi\`ere, Ginot, and Goaoc. Our main tool is the \v{C}ech complex associated to a cover, as analyzed in work of Dugger and Isaksen. As applications, we prove a generalized crosscut theorem for posets and some variations on Quillen's Poset Fiber Theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we extend a recent result showing the uniqueness of the maximum score in a classical round-robin tournament to round-robin tournament models with equally strong players, where the scores are valued on a lattice.</description>

      <title>The problem of deciding the positivity of Kronecker coefficients and Saxl conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an positive integer $k$, let $n:=\binom{k+1}{2}$. In 2012, during a talk at UCLA, Jan Saxl conjectured that all irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ occur in the decomposition of the tensor square of the irreducible representation corresponding to the staircase partition. In this paper, we investigate two useful methods to obtain some irreducible representations that occur in this decomposition. Our main tolls are the semi-group property for Kronecker coefficients and generalized blocks of symmetric groups.</description>
