      <title>Basic mechanisms for understanding container-content interactions: a fundamental perspective and application to polymer materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides a comprehensive understanding of the interactions that can occur at the interface between liquids and materials. It describes the phenomena of sorption (adsorption and absorption), permeation and leaching from a physicochemical perspective. In addition to examining these interactions, the historical context, detailing how these phenomena have been studied and demonstrated over time, it provides an understanding of the evolution of research in this field and the methodologies used to study these interactions, with a specific focus on polymer materials. The mechanisms underlying these interactions are presented as well as the equations that describe the processes involved, thus providing a scientific basis for understanding the complexities of container-content interactions.</description>

      <title>Sliding dynamics of a particle in a soap film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sliding dynamics of a millimeter-sized particle trapped in a horizontal soap film. Once released, the particle moves toward the center of the film in damped oscillations. We study experimentally and model the forces acting on the particle, and evidence the key role of the mass of the film on its shape and particle dynamics. Not only is the gravitational distortion of the film measurable, it completely determines the force responsible for the motion of the particle - the catenoid-like deformation induced by the particle has negligible effect on the dynamics. Surprisingly, this is expected for all film sizes as long as the particle radius remains much smaller than the film width. We also measure the friction force, and show that ambient air and the film contribute almost equally to the friction. The theoretical model that we propose predicts exactly the friction coefficient as long as inertial effects can be neglected in air (for the smallest and slowest particles). The fit between theory and experiments sets an upper boundary of 0.01 {\mu}Pa s m for the surface viscosity, in excellent agreement with recent interfacial microrheology measurements.</description>

      <title>Water-in-water PEG/DEX/protein microgel emulsions: effect of microgel particle size on the rate of emulsion phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein nanoparticles have been proven to be highly effective stabilizers of water-in-water emulsions obtained from a number of different types of aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS). The stabilizing efficiency of such particles is attributed to their affinity to the water/water interface of relevant ATPS, and emulsion formulations with long-term stability were reported in the recent years. In this study we investigated the macroscopic dynamics of the early-stage time evolution of dextran-in-polyethylene glycol emulsions obtained from a single ATPS and containing beta-lactoglobulin microgel particles of various diameters (ca. 40-190 nm). The results revealed the existence of a threshold in microgel size above which the water-in-water emulsion is stabilized, and that the process of segregative phase separation is determined by the interplay of droplets coalescence and sedimentation. Efficient droplet coalescence inhibition was found for microgel particles larger than 60 nm. Based on previous literature results, we discuss our coalescence-driven phase separation data in the context of the formation of durable particle layers on the emulsion droplets and the resulting droplet-droplet interactions.</description>

      <title>Dialectics of antimicrobial peptides I: common mechanisms of offensive and protecting roles of the peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have intrigued researchers for decades due to the contradiction between their high potential against resistant bacteria and the inability to find a structure-function relationship for the development of an effective and non-toxic agent. In the present study and the companion paper [Phys. Rev. E (2024)], we performed a comprehensive experimental and theoretical analysis of various aspects of AMP-membrane interactions and AMP-induced pore formation. Using the well-known melittin and magainin as examples, we showed, using patch-clamp and fluorescence measurements, that these peptides, even at nanomolar concentrations, modify the membrane by making it permeable to protons (and, possibly, water), but not to ions, and protect the membrane from large pore formation after subsequent addition of 20-fold higher concentrations of AMPs. This protective effect is independent of the membrane side (or both sides) of the peptide addition and is determined by the peptide-induced deformations of the membrane. Peptides create small, H+-permeable pores that incessantly connect the opposing membrane leaflets, allowing translocation of peptides and lipids and thus preventing further generation of large lateral pressure/tension imbalance. At the same time, such an imbalance is a key to the formation of peptide-induced pores at high AMP concentrations, with the main contribution coming from single ion-conducting events rather than stable channel-like structures. Therefore, our results suggest that lowering the AMP concentration, which is a common principle to reduce toxicity, may actually make bacteria resistant to AMP. However, a protective pre-treatment with nanomolar concentrations of peptides may be the key to protect eukaryotic cells from the high concentrations of AMPs.</description>

      <title>Dialectics of antimicrobial peptides II: Theoretical models of pore formation and membrane protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amphipathic peptides are considered promising antibiotics because of their ability to form pores in bacterial membranes. In two companion papers, we analyzed both experimentally and theoretically the mechanisms and consequences of the interaction of two types of amphipathic peptides (magainin and melittin) with lipid membranes. We studied this interaction for different peptide concentration: low, high, and low concentration followed by the addition of peptides in high concentration. Here we provide the theoretical description of the pore formation mechanisms. We predicted theoretically that two peptide molecules are enough to locally induce the formation of a small metastable pore that continuously connects two membrane leaflets and allows peptide and lipid translocation between the leaflets. This mechanism (referred to as local) is supposed to work at low peptide concentrations. When applied in high concentration, the one-sided adsorption of peptides onto a closed membrane generates lateral pressure in the contacting lipid monolayer and lateral tension in the opposing monolayer. Our calculations predicted such asymmetric pressure/tension to greatly facilitate the formation of large metastable pores at any point of the membrane, regardless of the distance to the nearest peptide molecule. We therefore refer to this mechanism of pore formation as non-local. When the application of peptides in low concentration is followed by high concentration addition, multiple small metastable pores are predicted to form in the membrane in accordance with the local mechanism. This prevents the generation of a large difference in lateral pressure/tension, thus protecting the membrane from the formation of large pores. The results of the theoretical analysis agree with the experimental data of the companion paper.</description>

      <title>Collective migration and topological phase transitions in confluent epithelia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective epithelial migration leverages on topological rearrangements of the intercellular junctions, which allow cells to intercalate without loosing confluency. In silico studies have provided a clear indication that this process could occur via a two-step phase transition, where a hierarchy of topological excitations progressively transforms an epithelial layer from a crystalline solid to an isotropic liquid, via an intermediate hexatic liquid crystal phase. Yet, the fundamental mechanism behind this process and its implications for collective cell behavior are presently unknown. In this article, we show that the onset of collective cell migration in cell-resolved models of epithelial layers takes place via an activity-driven melting transition, characterized by an exponentially-divergent correlation length across the solid/hexatic phase boundary. Using a combination of numerical simulations and Renormalization Group analysis, we show that the availability of topologically distinct rearrangements - known as T1 and T2 processes - and of a non-thermal route to melting, renders the transition significantly more versatile and tunable than in two-dimensional passive matter. Specifically, the relative frequency of T1 and T2 processes and of the "bare" stiffness of the cell layer affect the divergence of positional correlations within a well-defined spectrum of critical behaviors. Suppressing T1 processes, changes the nature of the transition by preventing collective migration in favor of a cellular analog of surface sublimation.</description>

      <title>Critical Motility-Induced Phase Separation in Three Dimensions is Consistent with Ising Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical investigations aiming to determine the universality class of critical motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) in two dimensions (2D) have resulted in inconclusive findings. Here, using finite-size scaling results obtained from large-scale computer simulations, we find that the static and dynamic critical exponents associated with 3D MIPS all closely match those of the 3D Ising universality class with a conserved scalar order parameter. This finding is corroborated by fluctuating hydrodynamic description of the critical dynamics of the order parameter field which precisely matching model B in three dimensions. Our work suggests that 3D MIPS and indeed the entire phase diagram of active Brownian spheres is remarkably similar to that of molecular passive fluids despite the absence of Boltzmann statistics.</description>

      <title>Universal criterion for selective outcomes under stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resetting plays a pivotal role in optimizing the completion time of complex first passage processes with single or multiple outcomes/exit possibilities. While it is well established that the coefficient of variation -- a statistical dispersion defined as a ratio of the fluctuations over the mean of the first passage time -- must be larger than unity for resetting to be beneficial for any outcome averaged over all the possibilities, the same can not be said while conditioned on a particular outcome. The purpose of this letter is to derive a universal condition which reveals that two statistical metric -- the mean and coefficient of variation of the conditional times -- come together to determine when resetting can expedite the completion of a selective outcome, and furthermore can govern the biasing between preferential and non-preferential outcomes. The universality of this result is demonstrated for a one dimensional diffusion process subjected to resetting with two absorbing boundaries.</description>

      <title>NextGenPB: an analytically-enabled super resolution and local (de)refinement Poisson-Boltzmann Equation solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE) is a relevant partial differential equation commonly used in biophysical applications to estimate the electrostatic energy of biomolecular systems immersed in electrolytic solutions. A conventional mean to improve the accuracy of its solution, when grid-based numerical techniques are used, consists in increasing the resolution, locally or globally. This, however, usually entails higher complexity, memory demand and computational cost. Here, we introduce NextGenPB, a linear PBE, adaptive-grid, FEM solver that leverages analytical calculations to maximize the accuracy-to-computational-cost ratio. Indeed, in NextGenPB (aka NGPB), analytical corrections at the surface of the solute enhance the solution's accuracy without requiring grid adaptation. This leads to more precise estimates of the electrostatic potential, fields, and energy at no perceptible additional cost. Also, we apply computationally efficient yet accurate boundary conditions by taking advantage of local grid de-refinement. To assess the accuracy of our methods directly, we expand the traditionally available analytical case set to many non-overlapping dielectric spheres. Then, we use an existing benchmark set of real biomolecular systems to evaluate the energy convergence concerning grid resolution. Thanks to these advances, we have improved state-of-the-art results and shown that the approach is accurate and largely scalable for modern high-performance computing architectures. Lastly, we suggest that the presented core ideas could be instrumental in improving the solution of other partial differential equations with discontinuous coefficients.</description>

      <title>Phase space contraction rate for classical mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical systems with non-reciprocal or dissipative forces evolve according to a generalization of Liouville's equation that accounts for the expansion and contraction of phase space volume. Here, we connect geometric descriptions of these non-Hamiltonian dynamics to a recently established classical density matrix theory. In this theory, the evolution of a "maximally mixed" classical density matrix is related to the well-known phase space contraction rate that, when ensemble averaged, is the rate of entropy exchange with the surroundings. Here, we extend the definition of mixed states to include statistical and mechanical components, describing both the deformations of local phase space regions and the evolution of ensembles within them. As a result, the equation of motion for this mixed state represents the rate of contraction for an ensemble of dissipative trajectories. Recognizing this density matrix as a covariance matrix, its contraction rate is another measure of entropy flow characterizing nonequilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Run-and-tumble particles with 1D Coulomb interaction: the active jellium model and the non-reciprocal self-gravitating gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently we studied $N$ run-and-tumble particles in one dimension - which switch with rate $\gamma$ between driving velocities $\pm v_0$ - interacting via the long range 1D Coulomb potential (also called rank interaction), both in the attractive and in the repulsive case, with and without a confining potential. We extend this study in two directions. First we consider the same system, but inside a harmonic confining potential, which we call "active jellium". We obtain a parametric representation of the particle density in the stationary state at large $N$, which we analyze in detail. Contrary to the linear potential, there is always a steady-state where the density has a bounded support. However, we find that the model still exhibits transitions between phases with different behaviors of the density at the edges, ranging from a continuous decay to a jump, or even a shock (i.e. a cluster of particles, which manifests as a delta peak in the density). Notably, the interactions forbid a divergent density at the edges, which may occur in the non-interacting case. In the second part, we consider a non-reciprocal version of the rank interaction: the $+$ particles (of velocity $+v_0$) are attracted towards the $-$ particles (of velocity $-v_0$) with a constant force $b/N$, while the $-$ particles are repelled by the $+$ particles with a force of same amplitude. In order for a stationary state to exist we add a linear confining potential. We derive an explicit expression for the stationary density at large $N$, which exhibits an explicit breaking of the mirror symmetry with respect to $x=0$. This again shows the existence of several phases, which differ by the presence or absence of a shock at $x=0$, with one phase even exhibiting a vanishing density on the whole region $x&gt;0$. Our analytical results are complemented by numerical simulations for finite $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mobile Coulomb gas permeating a fixed background crystalline lattice of charged colloidal crystals is subject to an electrostatic-elastic coupling, which we study on the continuum level by introducing a minimal coupling between electrostatic and displacement fields. We derive linearized, Debye-H\"uckel-like mean-field equations that can be analytically solved, incorporating the minimal coupling between electrostatic and displacement fields leading to an additional effective attractive interaction between mobile charges that depends in general on the strength of the coupling between the electrostatic and displacement fields. By analyzing the Gaussian fluctuations around the mean-field solution we also identify and quantify the region of its stability in terms of the electrostatic-elastic screening length. This detailed continuum theory incorporating the standard lattice elasticity and electrostatics of mobile charges provides a baseline to investigate the electrostatic-elastic coupling for microscopic models in colloid science and materials science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stress distribution in pastes after horizontal rotation by using an elasto-plastic model. Residual stress remains as a memory of rotation. The stress in the circumferential direction increases after the rotation, whereas that in the radial direction decreases. The residual stress is analytically related to the plastic deformation induced by the rotation. Based on the time evolution of plastic deformation, we theoretically describe the mechanism of the changes in the stress distribution.</description>

      <title>The trimer paradox: the effect of stiff constraints on equilibrium distributions in overdamped dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reconsider the classical problem of a freely joined chain of Brownian particles connected by elastic springs and study its conformational probability distribution function in the overdamped regime in the limit of infinite stiffness of constraints. We show that the well-known solution by Fixman [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 71, 3050 (1974)] is missing a shape-related term, later alluded to but not computed by Helfand [J. Chem. Phys 71, 5000 (1979)]. In our approach, the shape term, also termed zero-point energy, arises explicitly from a careful treatment of the distributional limit. We present a computationally feasible method for the calculation of the shape term and demonstrate its validity in a couple of examples.</description>

Abstract: Non-chiral liquid crystals (LCs) exhibiting ferroelectricity, distinguished by their dynamic responsiveness to external stimuli and high spontaneous polarization, provide renewed impetus for research into this area of soft matter and open novel application possibilities. Consequently, identifying structural elements within LC compounds that promote ferroelectricity in non-chiral systems is of critical importance. In this work, two homologs of rod-like compounds, with phenyl and ester groups in the rigid core substituted by fluorine atoms, differing by a single methylene unit, were synthesized and comprehensively analyzed using complementary experimental techniques and quantum-mechanical modeling. This systematic study presents the first documented instance in which such a minimal structural modification markedly influences the polarity of smectic phases in two homologs, without substantially altering phase transition temperatures, particularly the sequence and temperature ranges of smectic and nematic phases. Additionally, findings reveal that the longer homolog, which exhibits paraelectric phases, demonstrates a pronounced capacity to maintain ferroelectric phases in mixtures. These results provide new insights into the critical structure-property relationships between molecular architecture and ferroelectric characteristics in LCs, facilitating the targeted design of non-chiral compounds with polar phases. Moreover, the properties of the studied mixtures underscore the potential to develop multicomponent LC mixtures with stable ferroelectric properties in a broad temperature range, a feature of considerable significance for practical applications.</description>
