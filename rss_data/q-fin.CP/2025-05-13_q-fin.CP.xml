      <title>Copula Analysis of Risk: A Multivariate Risk Analysis for VaR and CoVaR using Copulas and DCC-GARCH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multivariate risk analysis for VaR and CVaR using different copula families is performed on historical financial time series fitted with DCC-GARCH models. A theoretical background is provided alongside a comparison of goodness-of-fit across different copula families to estimate the validity and effectiveness of approaches discussed.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning Across Fixed-Income Product Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for transfer learning of discount curves across different fixed-income product classes. Motivated by challenges in estimating discount curves from sparse or noisy data, we extend kernel ridge regression (KR) to a vector-valued setting, formulating a convex optimization problem in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Each component of the solution corresponds to the discount curve implied by a specific product class. We introduce an additional regularization term motivated by economic principles, promoting smoothness of spread curves between product classes, and show that it leads to a valid separable kernel structure. A main theoretical contribution is a decomposition of the vector-valued RKHS norm induced by separable kernels. We further provide a Gaussian process interpretation of vector-valued KR, enabling quantification of estimation uncertainty. Illustrative examples demonstrate that transfer learning significantly improves extrapolation performance and tightens confidence intervals compared to single-curve estimation.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Dimensional Barrier: A Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization for Continuous-Time Multi-Asset Portfolio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving large-scale, continuous-time portfolio optimization problems involving numerous assets and state-dependent dynamics has long been challenged by the curse of dimensionality. Traditional dynamic programming and PDE-based methods, while rigorous, typically become computationally intractable beyond a few state variables ($\sim$3-6 limit in prior studies). To overcome this critical barrier, we introduce the \emph{Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization} (PG-DPO) framework. PG-DPO leverages Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) and backpropagation-through-time (BPTT) to directly inform neural network-based policy learning. A key contribution is our highly efficient \emph{Projected PG-DPO (P-PGDPO)} variant. This approach uniquely utilizes BPTT to obtain rapidly stabilizing estimates of the Pontryagin costates and their crucial derivatives with respect to the state variables. These estimates are then analytically projected onto the manifold of optimal controls dictated by PMP's first-order conditions, significantly reducing training overhead and enhancing accuracy. This enables a breakthrough in scalability: numerical experiments demonstrate that P-PGDPO successfully tackles problems with dimensions previously considered far out of reach (up to 50 assets and 10 state variables). Critically, the framework accurately captures complex intertemporal hedging demands, a feat often elusive for other methods in high-dimensional settings. P-PGDPO delivers near-optimal policies, offering a practical and powerful alternative for a broad class of high-dimensional continuous-time control problems.</description>
