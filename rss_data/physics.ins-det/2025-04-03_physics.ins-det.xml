      <title>Optimization of singly-charged particles identification with the AMS02 RICH detector by a machine learning method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AMS-02 is a detector currently in operation onboard the International Space Station (ISS). One of the main scientific goals of the spectrometer is the measurement of charged particle fluxes. The detector design makes possible the identification of particles and antiparticles by precise measurement of particle momentum in the AMS-02 Silicon Tracker, and velocity in the Cherenkov (RICH) detector. The RICH is able to measure the isotopic composition of the light elements (up to charge Z=5) in the kinetic energy range from a few GeV/n to about 10 GeV/n. However, the velocity reconstruction for charge 1 particles is particularly challenging due to the low number of photons they produce in the RICH detector which can lead to wrong event reconstruction. In this paper, we show the high potential of the Multilayer Perceptron deep learning model (MLP-BFGS) for identification of signal and the background due to interactions inside the AMS-02 detector, and to significantly improve particle identification by its mass.</description>

      <title>Studies of Hadronic Showers in SND@LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SND@LHC experiment was built for observing neutrinos arising from LHC pp collisions. The detector consists of two sections: a target instrumented with SciFi modules and a hadronic calorimeter/muon detector. Energetic $\nu$N collisions in the target produce hadronic showers. Reconstruction of the shower total energy requires an estimate of the fractions deposited in both the target and the calorimeter. In order to calibrate the SND@LHC response, a replica of the detector was exposed to hadron beams with 100 to 300 GeV in the CERN SPS H8 test beam line in Summer 2023. This report describes the methods developed to tag the presence of a shower, to locate the shower origin in the target, and to combine the target SciFi and the calorimeter signals so to measure the shower total energy.</description>

      <title>Single-atom-at-a-time adsorption studies of $^{211}$Bi and its precursor $^{211}$Pb on SiO$_{2}$ surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In preparation of gas-phase chemical experiments with moscovium (Mc, element 115), we studied the chemical behavior of the short-lived bismuth radioisotope $^{211}$Bi in helium, argon, and oxygen atmosphere. Internal chromatograms were recorded as a function of various parameters including carrier gas type and flow rate, thus characterizing the novel miniCOMPACT detector array. This aids to optimize the conditions for experiments with superheavy elements. The bismuth progeny of $^{219}$Rn deposited on the SiO$_{2}$ surface of the miniCOMPACT via diffusion-controlled deposition. Bismuth showed the expected high reactivity towards the SiO$_{2}$ surface of the miniCOMPACT. Experiments in argon and oxygen atmosphere showed no measurable differences in the deposition distribution of the activity. The intermediate 36-min $^{211}$Pb is a member of the $^{227}$Ac decay chain, feeding the studied bismuth isotope, was taken into account. To extract thermodynamical data from the results, namely the lower limit of the value of the adsorption enthalpy of Bi on SiO$_{2}$, we performed Monte Carlo simulations, adapted to account for the precursor effect, and compared the experimental results to their output. Simulations were also performed for bismuths heavier homologue, moscovium, using a theoretically predicted value for the adsorption enthalpy of this element on SiO$_{2}$. These suggest moscovium to adsorb in the first part of the miniCOMPACT detection array, in line with recent observations.</description>

      <title>PoWER: a new concept for DUNE Phase 2 FD PDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel concept for the future modules of the DUNE Phase 2 Far Detector Photodetection System, namely the Polymer Wavelength shifter and Enhanced Reflection - PoWER. In this concept, the field cage of the LArTPC is entirely covered with polymeric wavelength shifting foils (PolyEthylene Naphthalate - PEN) to convert the liquid argon scintillation light from VUV to visible, and an Enhanced Specular Reflector (ESR) is installed on the membrane aiming to increase the number of reflections and consequently the detection probability. In addition, we use Light Detection Units (LDUs), which are a combination of standard and VUV-sensitive SiPM that can be used as an active veto for events occurring outside the field cage. We present a preliminary study using a Monte Carlo simulation, including a Light Map for photons generated inside the field cage and a demonstration of the active veto.</description>
