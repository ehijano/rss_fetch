      <title>Investigation of Energy-efficient AI Model Architectures and Compression Techniques for "Green" Fetal Brain Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence have contributed to advancements across various industries. However, the rapid growth of artificial intelligence technologies also raises concerns about their environmental impact, due to associated carbon footprints to train computational models. Fetal brain segmentation in medical imaging is challenging due to the small size of the fetal brain and the limited image quality of fast 2D sequences. Deep neural networks are a promising method to overcome this challenge. In this context, the construction of larger models requires extensive data and computing power, leading to high energy consumption. Our study aims to explore model architectures and compression techniques that promote energy efficiency by optimizing the trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption through various strategies such as lightweight network design, architecture search, and optimized distributed training tools. We have identified several effective strategies including optimization of data loading, modern optimizers, distributed training strategy implementation, and reduced floating point operations precision usage with light model architectures while tuning parameters according to available computer resources. Our findings demonstrate that these methods lead to satisfactory model performance with low energy consumption during deep neural network training for medical image segmentation.</description>

      <title>LiteNeXt: A Novel Lightweight ConvMixer-based Model with Self-embedding Representation Parallel for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of deep learning techniques has advanced the image segmentation task, especially for medical images. Many neural network models have been introduced in the last decade bringing the automated segmentation accuracy close to manual segmentation. However, cutting-edge models like Transformer-based architectures rely on large scale annotated training data, and are generally designed with densely consecutive layers in the encoder, decoder, and skip connections resulting in large number of parameters. Additionally, for better performance, they often be pretrained on a larger data, thus requiring large memory size and increasing resource expenses. In this study, we propose a new lightweight but efficient model, namely LiteNeXt, based on convolutions and mixing modules with simplified decoder, for medical image segmentation. The model is trained from scratch with small amount of parameters (0.71M) and Giga Floating Point Operations Per Second (0.42). To handle boundary fuzzy as well as occlusion or clutter in objects especially in medical image regions, we propose the Marginal Weight Loss that can help effectively determine the marginal boundary between object and background. Furthermore, we propose the Self-embedding Representation Parallel technique, that can help augment the data in a self-learning manner. Experiments on public datasets including Data Science Bowls, GlaS, ISIC2018, PH2, and Sunnybrook data show promising results compared to other state-of-the-art CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures. Our code will be published at: https://github.com/tranngocduvnvp/LiteNeXt.</description>

      <title>Diff-DTI: Fast Diffusion Tensor Imaging Using A Feature-Enhanced Joint Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a critical tool for neural disease diagnosis. However, long scan time greatly hinders the widespread clinical use of DTI. To accelerate image acquisition, a feature-enhanced joint diffusion model (Diff-DTI) is proposed to obtain accurate DTI parameter maps from a limited number of diffusion-weighted images (DWIs). Diff-DTI introduces a joint diffusion model that directly learns the joint probability distribution of DWIs with DTI parametric maps for conditional generation. Additionally, a feature enhancement fusion mechanism (FEFM) is designed and incorporated into the generative process of Diff-DTI to preserve fine structures in the generated DTI maps. A comprehensive evaluation of the performance of Diff-DTI was conducted on the Human Connectome Project dataset. The results demonstrate that Diff-DTI outperforms existing state-of-the-art fast DTI imaging methods in terms of visual quality and quantitative metrics. Furthermore, Diff-DTI has shown the ability to produce high-fidelity DTI maps with only three DWIs, thus overcoming the requirement of a minimum of six DWIs for DTI.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skin lesion segmentation is key for early skin cancer detection. Challenges in automatic segmentation from dermoscopic images include variations in color, texture, and artifacts of indistinct lesion boundaries. Deep learning methods like CNNs and U-Net have shown promise in addressing these issues. To further aid early diagnosis, especially on mobile devices with limited computing power, we present MUCM-Net. This efficient model combines Mamba State-Space Models with our UCM-Net architecture for improved feature learning and segmentation. MUCM-Net's Mamba-UCM Layer is optimized for mobile deployment, offering high accuracy with low computational needs. Tested on ISIC datasets, it outperforms other methods in accuracy and computational efficiency, making it a scalable tool for early detection in settings with limited resources. Our MUCM-Net source code is available for research and collaboration, supporting advances in mobile health diagnostics and the fight against skin cancer.

      <title>Reliable Source Approximation: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Vestibular Schwannoma MRI Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) has recently become a focus in the medical image domain adaptation, as it only utilizes the source model and does not require annotated target data. However, current SFUDA approaches cannot tackle the complex segmentation task across different MRI sequences, such as the vestibular schwannoma segmentation. To address this problem, we proposed Reliable Source Approximation (RSA), which can generate source-like and structure-preserved images from the target domain for updating model parameters and adapting domain shifts. Specifically, RSA deploys a conditional diffusion model to generate multiple source-like images under the guidance of varying edges of one target image. An uncertainty estimation module is then introduced to predict and refine reliable pseudo labels of generated images, and the prediction consistency is developed to select the most reliable generations. Subsequently, all reliable generated images and their pseudo labels are utilized to update the model. Our RSA is validated on vestibular schwannoma segmentation across multi-modality MRI. The experimental results demonstrate that RSA consistently improves domain adaptation performance over other state-of-the-art SFUDA methods. Code is available at https://github.com/zenghy96/Reliable-Source-Approximation.</description>

      <title>A better approach to diagnose retinal diseases: Combining our Segmentation-based Vascular Enhancement with deep learning features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abnormalities in retinal fundus images may indicate certain pathologies such as diabetic retinopathy, hypertension, stroke, glaucoma, retinal macular edema, venous occlusion, and atherosclerosis, making the study and analysis of retinal images of great significance. In conventional medicine, the diagnosis of retina-related diseases relies on a physician's subjective assessment of the retinal fundus images, which is a time-consuming process and the accuracy is highly dependent on the physician's subjective experience. To this end, this paper proposes a fast, objective, and accurate method for the diagnosis of diseases related to retinal fundus images. This method is a multiclassification study of normal samples and 13 categories of disease samples on the STARE database, with a test set accuracy of 99.96%. Compared with other studies, our method achieved the highest accuracy. This study innovatively propose Segmentation-based Vascular Enhancement(SVE). After comparing the classification performances of the deep learning models of SVE images, original images and Smooth Grad-CAM ++ images, we extracted the deep learning features and traditional features of the SVE images and input them into nine meta learners for classification. The results shows that our proposed UNet-SVE-VGG-MLP model has the optimal performance for classifying diseases related to retinal fundus images on the STARE database, with a overall accuracy of 99.96% and a weighted AUC of 99.98% for the 14 categories on test dataset. This method can be used to realize rapid, objective, and accurate classification and diagnosis of retinal fundus image related diseases.</description>

      <title>Combining Radiomics and Machine Learning Approaches for Objective ASD Diagnosis: Verifying White Matter Associations with ASD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder is a condition characterized by a typical brain development leading to impairments in social skills, communication abilities, repetitive behaviors, and sensory processing. There have been many studies combining brain MRI images with machine learning algorithms to achieve objective diagnosis of autism, but the correlation between white matter and autism has not been fully utilized. To address this gap, we develop a computer-aided diagnostic model focusing on white matter regions in brain MRI by employing radiomics and machine learning methods. This study introduced a MultiUNet model for segmenting white matter, leveraging the UNet architecture and utilizing manually segmented MRI images as the training data. Subsequently, we extracted white matter features using the Pyradiomics toolkit and applied different machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors to predict autism. The prediction sets all exceeded 80% accuracy. Additionally, we employed Convolutional Neural Network to analyze segmented white matter images, achieving a prediction accuracy of 86.84%. Notably, Support Vector Machine demonstrated the highest prediction accuracy at 89.47%. These findings not only underscore the efficacy of the models but also establish a link between white matter abnormalities and autism. Our study contributes to a comprehensive evaluation of various diagnostic models for autism and introduces a computer-aided diagnostic algorithm for early and objective autism diagnosis based on MRI white matter regions.</description>

      <title>Learning Point Spread Function Invertibility Assessment for Image Deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep-learning (DL)-based image deconvolution (ID) has exhibited remarkable recovery performance, surpassing traditional linear methods. However, unlike traditional ID approaches that rely on analytical properties of the point spread function (PSF) to achieve high recovery performance - such as specific spectrum properties or small conditional numbers in the convolution matrix - DL techniques lack quantifiable metrics for evaluating PSF suitability for DL-assisted recovery. Aiming to enhance deconvolution quality, we propose a metric that employs a non-linear approach to learn the invertibility of an arbitrary PSF using a neural network by mapping it to a unit impulse. A lower discrepancy between the mapped PSF and a unit impulse indicates a higher likelihood of successful inversion by a DL network. Our findings reveal that this metric correlates with high recovery performance in DL and traditional methods, thereby serving as an effective regularizer in deconvolution tasks. This approach reduces the computational complexity over conventional condition number assessments and is a differentiable process. These useful properties allow its application in designing diffractive optical elements through end-to-end (E2E) optimization, achieving invertible PSFs, and outperforming the E2E baseline framework.</description>

      <title>Memory-efficient High-resolution OCT Volume Synthesis with Cascaded Amortized Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) image analysis plays an important role in the field of ophthalmology. Current successful analysis models rely on available large datasets, which can be challenging to be obtained for certain tasks. The use of deep generative models to create realistic data emerges as a promising approach. However, due to limitations in hardware resources, it is still difficulty to synthesize high-resolution OCT volumes. In this paper, we introduce a cascaded amortized latent diffusion model (CA-LDM) that can synthesis high-resolution OCT volumes in a memory-efficient way. First, we propose non-holistic autoencoders to efficiently build a bidirectional mapping between high-resolution volume space and low-resolution latent space. In tandem with autoencoders, we propose cascaded diffusion processes to synthesize high-resolution OCT volumes with a global-to-local refinement process, amortizing the memory and computational demands. Experiments on a public high-resolution OCT dataset show that our synthetic data have realistic high-resolution and global features, surpassing the capabilities of existing methods. Moreover, performance gains on two down-stream fine-grained segmentation tasks demonstrate the benefit of the proposed method in training deep learning models for medical imaging tasks. The code is public available at: https://github.com/nicetomeetu21/CA-LDM.</description>

      <title>UniCompress: Enhancing Multi-Data Medical Image Compression with Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of medical image compression, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) networks have shown remarkable versatility due to their flexible compression ratios, yet they are constrained by a one-to-one fitting approach that results in lengthy encoding times. Our novel method, ``\textbf{UniCompress}'', innovatively extends the compression capabilities of INR by being the first to compress multiple medical data blocks using a single INR network. By employing wavelet transforms and quantization, we introduce a codebook containing frequency domain information as a prior input to the INR network. This enhances the representational power of INR and provides distinctive conditioning for different image blocks. Furthermore, our research introduces a new technique for the knowledge distillation of implicit representations, simplifying complex model knowledge into more manageable formats to improve compression ratios. Extensive testing on CT and electron microscopy (EM) datasets has demonstrated that UniCompress outperforms traditional INR methods and commercial compression solutions like HEVC, especially in complex and high compression scenarios. Notably, compared to existing INR techniques, UniCompress achieves a 4$\sim$5 times increase in compression speed, marking a significant advancement in the field of medical image compression. Codes will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>PASTA: Pathology-Aware MRI to PET Cross-Modal Translation with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a well-established functional imaging technique for diagnosing brain disorders. However, PET's high costs and radiation exposure limit its widespread use. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does not have these limitations. Although it also captures neurodegenerative changes, MRI is a less sensitive diagnostic tool than PET. To close this gap, we aim to generate synthetic PET from MRI. Herewith, we introduce PASTA, a novel pathology-aware image translation framework based on conditional diffusion models. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, PASTA excels in preserving both structural and pathological details in the target modality, which is achieved through its highly interactive dual-arm architecture and multi-modal condition integration. A cycle exchange consistency and volumetric generation strategy elevate PASTA's capability to produce high-quality 3D PET scans. Our qualitative and quantitative results confirm that the synthesized PET scans from PASTA not only reach the best quantitative scores but also preserve the pathology correctly. For Alzheimer's classification, the performance of synthesized scans improves over MRI by 4%, almost reaching the performance of actual PET. Code is available at https://github.com/ai-med/PASTA.</description>

      <title>Blind Data Adaptation to tackle Covariate Shift in Operational Steganalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of image manipulation for unethical purposes poses significant challenges in social networks. One particularly concerning method is Image Steganography, allowing individuals to hide illegal information in digital images without arousing suspicions. Such a technique pose severe security risks, making it crucial to develop effective steganalysis methods enabling to detect manipulated images for clandestine communications. Although significant advancements have been achieved with machine learning models, a critical issue remains: the disparity between the controlled datasets used to train steganalysis models against real-world datasets of forensic practitioners, undermining severely the practical effectiveness of standardized steganalysis models. In this paper, we address this issue focusing on a realistic scenario where practitioners lack crucial information about the limited target set of images under analysis, including details about their development process and even whereas it contains manipulated images or not. By leveraging geometric alignment and distribution matching of source and target residuals, we develop TADA (Target Alignment through Data Adaptation), a novel methodology enabling to emulate sources aligned with specific targets in steganalysis, which is also relevant for highly unbalanced targets. The emulator is represented by a light convolutional network trained to align distributions of image residuals. Experimental validation demonstrates the potential of our strategy over traditional methods fighting covariate shift in steganalysis.</description>

      <title>Multi-view Disparity Estimation Using a Novel Gradient Consistency Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational approaches to disparity estimation typically use a linearised brightness constancy constraint, which only applies in smooth regions and over small distances. Accordingly, current variational approaches rely on a schedule to progressively include image data. This paper proposes the use of Gradient Consistency information to assess the validity of the linearisation; this information is used to determine the weights applied to the data term as part of an analytically inspired Gradient Consistency Model. The Gradient Consistency Model penalises the data term for view pairs that have a mismatch between the spatial gradients in the source view and the spatial gradients in the target view. Instead of relying on a tuned or learned schedule, the Gradient Consistency Model is self-scheduling, since the weights evolve as the algorithm progresses. We show that the Gradient Consistency Model outperforms standard coarse-to-fine schemes and the recently proposed progressive inclusion of views approach in both rate of convergence and accuracy.</description>

      <title>MVMS-RCN: A Dual-Domain Unfolding CT Reconstruction with Multi-sparse-view and Multi-scale Refinement-correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) is one of the most important diagnostic imaging techniques in clinical applications. Sparse-view CT imaging reduces the number of projection views to a lower radiation dose and alleviates the potential risk of radiation exposure. Most existing deep learning (DL) and deep unfolding sparse-view CT reconstruction methods: 1) do not fully use the projection data; 2) do not always link their architecture designs to a mathematical theory; 3) do not flexibly deal with multi-sparse-view reconstruction assignments. This paper aims to use mathematical ideas and design optimal DL imaging algorithms for sparse-view tomography reconstructions. We propose a novel dual-domain deep unfolding unified framework that offers a great deal of flexibility for multi-sparse-view CT reconstruction with different sampling views through a single model. This framework combines the theoretical advantages of model-based methods with the superior reconstruction performance of DL-based methods, resulting in the expected generalizability of DL. We propose a refinement module that utilizes unfolding projection domain to refine full-sparse-view projection errors, as well as an image domain correction module that distills multi-scale geometric error corrections to reconstruct sparse-view CT. This provides us with a new way to explore the potential of projection information and a new perspective on designing network architectures. All parameters of our proposed framework are learnable end to end, and our method possesses the potential to be applied to plug-and-play reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework is superior to other existing state-of-the-art methods. Our source codes are available at https://github.com/fanxiaohong/MVMS-RCN.</description>

      <title>Partitioned Hankel-based Diffusion Models for Few-shot Low-dose CT Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) plays a vital role in clinical applications by mitigating radiation risks. Nevertheless, reducing radiation doses significantly degrades image quality. Concurrently, common deep learning methods demand extensive data, posing concerns about privacy, cost, and time constraints. Consequently, we propose a few-shot low-dose CT reconstruction method using Partitioned Hankel-based Diffusion (PHD) models. During the prior learning stage, the projection data is first transformed into multiple partitioned Hankel matrices. Structured tensors are then extracted from these matrices to facilitate prior learning through multiple diffusion models. In the iterative reconstruction stage, an iterative stochastic differential equation solver is employed along with data consistency constraints to update the acquired projection data. Furthermore, penalized weighted least-squares and total variation techniques are introduced to enhance the resulting image quality. The results approximate those of normal-dose counterparts, validating PHD model as an effective and practical model for reducing artifacts and noise while preserving image quality.</description>

      <title>Does Diffusion Beat GAN in Image Super Resolution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a prevalent opinion in the recent literature that Diffusion-based models outperform GAN-based counterparts on the Image Super Resolution (ISR) problem. However, in most studies, Diffusion-based ISR models were trained longer and utilized larger networks than the GAN baselines. This raises the question of whether the superiority of Diffusion models is due to the Diffusion paradigm being better suited for the ISR task or if it is a consequence of the increased scale and computational resources used in contemporary studies. In our work, we compare Diffusion-based and GAN-based Super Resolution under controlled settings, where both approaches are matched in terms of architecture, model and dataset size, and computational budget. We show that a GAN-based model can achieve results comparable to a Diffusion-based model. Additionally, we explore the impact of design choices such as text conditioning and augmentation on the performance of ISR models, showcasing their effect on several downstream tasks. We will release the inference code and weights of our scaled GAN.</description>

      <title>ComFace: Facial Representation Learning with Synthetic Data for Comparing Faces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Daily monitoring of intra-personal facial changes associated with health and emotional conditions has great potential to be useful for medical, healthcare, and emotion recognition fields. However, the approach for capturing intra-personal facial changes is relatively unexplored due to the difficulty of collecting temporally changing face images. In this paper, we propose a facial representation learning method using synthetic images for comparing faces, called ComFace, which is designed to capture intra-personal facial changes. For effective representation learning, ComFace aims to acquire two feature representations, i.e., inter-personal facial differences and intra-personal facial changes. The key point of our method is the use of synthetic face images to overcome the limitations of collecting real intra-personal face images. Facial representations learned by ComFace are transferred to three extensive downstream tasks for comparing faces: estimating facial expression changes, weight changes, and age changes from two face images of the same individual. Our ComFace, trained using only synthetic data, achieves comparable to or better transfer performance than general pre-training and state-of-the-art representation learning methods trained using real images.</description>

      <title>A 7K Parameter Model for Underwater Image Enhancement based on Transmission Map Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although deep learning based models for underwater image enhancement have achieved good performance, they face limitations in both lightweight and effectiveness, which prevents their deployment and application on resource-constrained platforms. Moreover, most existing deep learning based models use data compression to get high-level semantic information in latent space instead of using the original information. Therefore, they require decoder blocks to generate the details of the output. This requires additional computational cost. In this paper, a lightweight network named lightweight selective attention network (LSNet) based on the top-k selective attention and transmission maps mechanism is proposed. The proposed model achieves a PSNR of 97\% with only 7K parameters compared to a similar attention-based model. Extensive experiments show that the proposed LSNet achieves excellent performance in state-of-the-art models with significantly fewer parameters and computational resources. The code is available at https://github.com/FuhengZhou/LSNet}{https://github.com/FuhengZhou/LSNet.</description>

Abstract: Removing rain artifacts in images is recognized as a significant issue. In this field, deep learning-based approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have succeeded. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs) have exhibited superior performance across various tasks in both natural language processing and image processing due to their ability to model long-range dependencies. This study introduces SSM to rain removal and proposes a Deraining Frequency-Enhanced State Space Model (DFSSM). To effectively remove rain streaks, which produce high-intensity frequency components in specific directions, we employ frequency domain processing concurrently with SSM. Additionally, we develop a novel mixed-scale gated-convolutional block, which uses convolutions with multiple kernel sizes to capture various scale degradations effectively and integrates a gating mechanism to manage the flow of information. Finally, experiments on synthetic and real-world rainy image datasets show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Looks Too Good To Be True: An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Hallucinations in Generative Restoration Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of high perceptual quality in image restoration has driven the development of revolutionary generative models, capable of producing results often visually indistinguishable from real data. However, as their perceptual quality continues to improve, these models also exhibit a growing tendency to generate hallucinations - realistic-looking details that do not exist in the ground truth images. The presence of hallucinations introduces uncertainty regarding the reliability of the models' predictions, raising major concerns about their practical application. In this paper, we employ information-theory tools to investigate this phenomenon, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between uncertainty and perception. We rigorously analyze the relationship between these two factors, proving that the global minimal uncertainty in generative models grows in tandem with perception. In particular, we define the inherent uncertainty of the restoration problem and show that attaining perfect perceptual quality entails at least twice this uncertainty. Additionally, we establish a relation between mean squared-error distortion, uncertainty and perception, through which we prove the aforementioned uncertainly-perception tradeoff induces the well-known perception-distortion tradeoff. This work uncovers fundamental limitations of generative models in achieving both high perceptual quality and reliable predictions for image restoration. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through an analysis of single image super-resolution algorithms. Our work aims to raise awareness among practitioners about this inherent tradeoff, empowering them to make informed decisions and potentially prioritize safety over perceptual performance.</description>

      <title>A Study on Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Defect Localization using Generative Model in Ultrasonic Non-Destructive Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the deterioration of artificial materials used in structures has become a serious social issue, increasing the importance of inspections. Non-destructive testing is gaining increased demand due to its capability to inspect for defects and deterioration in structures while preserving their functionality. Among these, Laser Ultrasonic Visualization Testing (LUVT) stands out because it allows the visualization of ultrasonic propagation. This makes it visually straightforward to detect defects, thereby enhancing inspection efficiency. With the increasing number of the deterioration structures, challenges such as a shortage of inspectors and increased workload in non-destructive testing have become more apparent. Efforts to address these challenges include exploring automated inspection using machine learning. However, the lack of anomalous data with defects poses a barrier to improving the accuracy of automated inspection through machine learning. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method for automated LUVT inspection using an anomaly detection approach with a diffusion model that can be trained solely on negative examples (defect-free data). We experimentally confirmed that our proposed method improves defect detection and localization compared to general object detection algorithms used previously.</description>

      <title>Controlling Rate, Distortion, and Realism: Towards a Single Comprehensive Neural Image Compression Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, neural network-driven image compression (NIC) has gained significant attention. Some works adopt deep generative models such as GANs and diffusion models to enhance perceptual quality (realism). A critical obstacle of these generative NIC methods is that each model is optimized for a single bit rate. Consequently, multiple models are required to compress images to different bit rates, which is impractical for real-world applications. To tackle this issue, we propose a variable-rate generative NIC model. Specifically, we explore several discriminator designs tailored for the variable-rate approach and introduce a novel adversarial loss. Moreover, by incorporating the newly proposed multi-realism technique, our method allows the users to adjust the bit rate, distortion, and realism with a single model, achieving ultra-controllability. Unlike existing variable-rate generative NIC models, our method matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art single-rate generative NIC models while covering a wide range of bit rates using just one model.

      <title>DSU-Net: Dynamic Snake U-Net for 2-D Seismic First Break Picking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In seismic exploration, identifying the first break (FB) is a critical component in establishing subsurface velocity models. Various automatic picking techniques based on deep neural networks have been developed to expedite this procedure. The most popular class is using semantic segmentation networks to pick on a shot gather called 2-dimensional (2-D) picking. Generally, 2-D segmentation-based picking methods input an image of a shot gather, and output a binary segmentation map, in which the maximum of each column is the location of FB. However, current designed segmentation networks is difficult to ensure the horizontal continuity of the segmentation. Additionally, FB jumps also exist in some areas, and it is not easy for current networks to detect such jumps. Therefore, it is important to pick as much as possible and ensure horizontal continuity. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel semantic segmentation network for the 2-D seismic FB picking task, where we introduce the dynamic snake convolution into U-Net and call the new segmentation network dynamic-snake U-Net (DSU-Net). Specifically, we develop original dynamic-snake convolution (DSConv) in CV and propose a novel DSConv module, which can extract the horizontal continuous feature in the shallow feature of the shot gather. Many experiments have shown that DSU-Net demonstrates higher accuracy and robustness than the other 2-D segmentation-based models, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 2-D seismic field surveys. Particularly, it can effectively detect FB jumps and better ensure the horizontal continuity of FB. In addition, the ablation experiment and the anti-noise experiment, respectively, verify the optimal structure of the DSConv module and the robustness of the picking.</description>

      <title>Efficient Visual Fault Detection for Freight Train via Neural Architecture Search with Data Volume Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based fault detection methods have achieved significant success. In visual fault detection of freight trains, there exists a large characteristic difference between inter-class components (scale variance) but intra-class on the contrary, which entails scale-awareness for detectors. Moreover, the design of task-specific networks heavily relies on human expertise. As a consequence, neural architecture search (NAS) that automates the model design process gains considerable attention because of its promising performance. However, NAS is computationally intensive due to the large search space and huge data volume. In this work, we propose an efficient NAS-based framework for visual fault detection of freight trains to search for the task-specific detection head with capacities of multi-scale representation. First, we design a scale-aware search space for discovering an effective receptive field in the head. Second, we explore the robustness of data volume to reduce search costs based on the specifically designed search space, and a novel sharing strategy is proposed to reduce memory and further improve search efficiency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with data volume robustness, which achieves 46.8 and 47.9 mAP on the Bottom View and Side View datasets, respectively. Our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and linearly decreases the search costs with reduced data volumes.</description>

      <title>NeurTV: Total Variation on the Neural Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed the success of total variation (TV) for many imaging applications. However, traditional TV is defined on the original pixel domain, which limits its potential. In this work, we suggest a new TV regularization defined on the neural domain. Concretely, the discrete data is continuously and implicitly represented by a deep neural network (DNN), and we use the derivatives of DNN outputs w.r.t. input coordinates to capture local correlations of data. As compared with classical TV on the original domain, the proposed TV on the neural domain (termed NeurTV) enjoys two advantages. First, NeurTV is not limited to meshgrid but is suitable for both meshgrid and non-meshgrid data. Second, NeurTV can more exactly capture local correlations across data for any direction and any order of derivatives attributed to the implicit and continuous nature of neural domain. We theoretically reinterpret NeurTV under the variational approximation framework, which allows us to build the connection between classical TV and NeurTV and inspires us to develop variants (e.g., NeurTV with arbitrary resolution and space-variant NeurTV). Extensive numerical experiments with meshgrid data (e.g., color and hyperspectral images) and non-meshgrid data (e.g., point clouds and spatial transcriptomics) showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern MRI scanners utilize one or more arrays of small receive-only coils to collect k-space data. The sensitivity maps of the coils, when estimated using traditional methods, differ from the true sensitivity maps, which are generally unknown. Consequently, the reconstructed MR images exhibit undesired spatial variation in intensity. These intensity variations can be at least partially corrected using pre-scan data. In this work, we propose an intensity correction method that utilizes pre-scan data. For demonstration, we apply our method to a digital phantom, as well as to cardiac MRI data collected on a commercial scanner by Siemens Healthineers. The code is available at https://github.com/OSU-MR/SCC.</description>

      <title>Deep Image prior with StruCtUred Sparsity (DISCUS) for dynamic MRI reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-quality training data are not always available in dynamic MRI. To address this, we propose a self-supervised deep learning method called deep image prior with structured sparsity (DISCUS) for reconstructing dynamic images. DISCUS is inspired by deep image prior (DIP) and recovers a series of images through joint optimization of network parameters and input code vectors. However, DISCUS additionally encourages group sparsity on frame-specific code vectors to discover the low-dimensional manifold that describes temporal variations across frames. Compared to prior work on manifold learning, DISCUS does not require specifying the manifold dimensionality. We validate DISCUS using three numerical studies. In the first study, we simulate a dynamic Shepp-Logan phantom with frames undergoing random rotations, translations, or both, and demonstrate that DISCUS can discover the dimensionality of the underlying manifold. In the second study, we use data from a realistic late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) phantom to compare DISCUS with compressed sensing (CS) and DIP, and to demonstrate the positive impact of group sparsity. In the third study, we use retrospectively undersampled single-shot LGE data from five patients to compare DISCUS with CS reconstructions. The results from these studies demonstrate that DISCUS outperforms CS and DIP, and that enforcing group sparsity on the code vectors helps discover true manifold dimensionality and provides additional performance gain.</description>

Abstract: Image segmentation in total knee arthroplasty is crucial for precise preoperative planning and accurate implant positioning, leading to improved surgical outcomes and patient satisfaction. The biggest challenges of image segmentation in total knee arthroplasty include accurately delineating complex anatomical structures, dealing with image artifacts and noise, and developing robust algorithms that can handle anatomical variations and pathologies commonly encountered in patients. The potential of using machine learning for image segmentation in total knee arthroplasty lies in its ability to improve segmentation accuracy, automate the process, and provide real-time assistance to surgeons, leading to enhanced surgical planning, implant placement, and patient outcomes. This paper proposes a methodology to use deep learning for robust and real-time total knee arthroplasty image segmentation. The deep learning model, trained on a large dataset, demonstrates outstanding performance in accurately segmenting both the implanted femur and tibia, achieving an impressive mean-Average-Precision (mAP) of 88.83 when compared to the ground truth while also achieving a real-time segmented speed of 20 frames per second (fps). We have introduced a novel methodology for segmenting implanted knee fluoroscopic or x-ray images that showcases remarkable levels of accuracy and speed, paving the way for various potential extended applications.</description>

      <title>FLLIC: Functionally Lossless Image Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, DNN models for lossless image coding have surpassed their traditional counterparts in compression performance, reducing the bit rate by about ten percent for natural color images. But even with these advances, mathematically lossless image compression (MLLIC) ratios for natural images still fall short of the bandwidth and cost-effectiveness requirements of most practical imaging and vision systems at present and beyond. To break the bottleneck of MLLIC in compression performance, we question the necessity of MLLIC, as almost all digital sensors inherently introduce acquisition noises, making mathematically lossless compression counterproductive. Therefore, in contrast to MLLIC, we propose a new paradigm of joint denoising and compression called functionally lossless image compression (FLLIC), which performs lossless compression of optimally denoised images (the optimality may be task-specific). Although not literally lossless with respect to the noisy input, FLLIC aims to achieve the best possible reconstruction of the latent noise-free original image.

      <title>A Systematic Review of Low-Rank and Local Low-Rank Matrix Approximation in Big Data Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large volume and complexity of medical imaging datasets are bottlenecks for storage, transmission, and processing. To tackle these challenges, the application of low-rank matrix approximation (LRMA) and its derivative, local LRMA (LLRMA) has demonstrated potential. A detailed analysis of the literature identifies LRMA and LLRMA methods applied to various imaging modalities, and the challenges and limitations associated with existing LRMA and LLRMA methods are addressed. We note a significant shift towards a preference for LLRMA in the medical imaging field since 2015, demonstrating its potential and effectiveness in capturing complex structures in medical data compared to LRMA. Acknowledging the limitations of shallow similarity methods used with LLRMA, we suggest advanced semantic image segmentation for similarity measure, explaining in detail how it can be used to measure similar patches and its feasibility. We note that LRMA and LLRMA are mainly applied to unstructured medical data, and we propose extending their application to different medical data types, including structured and semi-structured. This paper also discusses how LRMA and LLRMA can be applied to regular data with missing entries and the impact of inaccuracies in predicting missing values and their effects. We discuss the impact of patch size and propose the use of random search (RS) to determine the optimal patch size. To enhance feasibility, a hybrid approach using Bayesian optimization and RS is proposed, which could improve the application of LRMA and LLRMA in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>YOLOv9 for Fracture Detection in Pediatric Wrist Trauma X-ray Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The introduction of YOLOv9, the latest version of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) series, has led to its widespread adoption across various scenarios. This paper is the first to apply the YOLOv9 algorithm model to the fracture detection task as computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) to help radiologists and surgeons to interpret X-ray images. Specifically, this paper trained the model on the GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset and extended the training set using data augmentation techniques to improve the model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to the mAP 50-95 of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, the YOLOv9 model increased the value from 42.16% to 43.73%, with an improvement of 3.7%. The implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/RuiyangJu/YOLOv9-Fracture-Detection.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Diffusion Modelling for Super-resolved Spatial Transcriptomics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST) allows to characterize spatial gene expression within tissue for discovery research. However, current ST platforms suffer from low resolution, hindering in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, current super-resolution methods are limited by restoration uncertainty and mode collapse. Although diffusion models have shown promise in capturing complex interactions between multi-modal conditions, it remains a challenge to integrate histology images and gene expression for super-resolved ST maps. This paper proposes a cross-modal conditional diffusion model for super-resolving ST maps with the guidance of histology images. Specifically, we design a multi-modal disentangling network with cross-modal adaptive modulation to utilize complementary information from histology images and spatial gene expression. Moreover, we propose a dynamic cross-attention modelling strategy to extract hierarchical cell-to-tissue information from histology images. Lastly, we propose a co-expression-based gene-correlation graph network to model the co-expression relationship of multiple genes. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in ST super-resolution on three public datasets.</description>

      <title>Vim4Path: Self-Supervised Vision Mamba for Histopathology Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Representation learning from Gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSI) poses a significant challenge in computational pathology due to the complicated nature of tissue structures and the scarcity of labeled data. Multi-instance learning methods have addressed this challenge, leveraging image patches to classify slides utilizing pretrained models using Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) approaches. The performance of both SSL and MIL methods relies on the architecture of the feature encoder. This paper proposes leveraging the Vision Mamba (Vim) architecture, inspired by state space models, within the DINO framework for representation learning in computational pathology. We evaluate the performance of Vim against Vision Transformers (ViT) on the Camelyon16 dataset for both patch-level and slide-level classification. Our findings highlight Vim's enhanced performance compared to ViT, particularly at smaller scales, where Vim achieves an 8.21 increase in ROC AUC for models of similar size. An explainability analysis further highlights Vim's capabilities, which reveals that Vim uniquely emulates the pathologist workflow-unlike ViT. This alignment with human expert analysis highlights Vim's potential in practical diagnostic settings and contributes significantly to developing effective representation-learning algorithms in computational pathology. We release the codes and pretrained weights at \url{https://github.com/AtlasAnalyticsLab/Vim4Path}.</description>

      <title>Calculation of Femur Caput Collum Diaphyseal angle for X-Rays images using Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of deep learning approaches to estimate the femur caput-collum-diaphyseal (CCD) angle from X-ray images. The CCD angle is an important measurement in the diagnosis of hip problems, and correct prediction can help in the planning of surgical procedures. Manual measurement of this angle, on the other hand, can be time-intensive and vulnerable to inter-observer variability. In this paper, we present a deep-learning algorithm that can reliably estimate the femur CCD angle from X-ray images. To train and test the performance of our model, we employed an X-ray image dataset with associated femur CCD angle measurements. Furthermore, we built a prototype to display the resulting predictions and to allow the user to interact with the predictions. As this is happening in a sterile setting during surgery, we expanded our interface to the possibility of being used only by voice commands.
  Our results show that our deep learning model predicts the femur CCD angle on X-ray images with great accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 4.3 degrees on the left femur and 4.9 degrees on the right femur on the test dataset. Our results suggest that deep learning has the potential to give a more efficient and accurate technique for predicting the femur CCD angle, which might have substantial therapeutic implications for the diagnosis and management of hip problems.</description>

      <title>All-in-One Deep Learning Framework for MR Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, all-in-one deep learning framework for MR image reconstruction, enabling a single model to enhance image quality across multiple aspects of k-space sampling and to be effective across a wide range of clinical and technical scenarios. This DICOM-based algorithm serves as the core of SwiftMR (AIRS Medical, Seoul, Korea), which is FDA-cleared, CE-certified, and commercially available. We first detail the comprehensive development process of the model, including data collection, training pair preparation, model architecture design, and DICOM inference. We then assess the model's capability to enhance image quality in a multi-dimensional manner, specifically across various aspects of k-space sampling. Subsequently, we evaluate several features of the multi-dimensional enhancement: the accuracy of tunable denoising, the effectiveness of super-resolution in each encoding direction, and the reduction of artifacts that become more prominent at lower spatial resolutions. Additionally, we assess its compatibility with various scan parameter sets and its generalizability across scanner vendors not seen during training. Finally, we present specific cases demonstrating the model's utility in reducing scan time across anatomical regions in conjunction with protocol optimization. The proposed model is compatible with a broad spectrum of scenarios, including various vendors, pulse sequences, scan parameters, and anatomical regions. Its DICOM-based operation particularly enhances its applicability for real-world applications. Given its demonstrated effectiveness and versatility, we expect its use to expand in the field of clinical MRI.</description>

      <title>Array SAR 3D Sparse Imaging Based on Regularization by Denoising Under Few Observed Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Array synthetic aperture radar (SAR) three-dimensional (3D) imaging can obtain 3D information of the target region, which is widely used in environmental monitoring and scattering information measurement. In recent years, with the development of compressed sensing (CS) theory, sparse signal processing is used in array SAR 3D imaging. Compared with matched filter (MF), sparse SAR imaging can effectively improve image quality. However, sparse imaging based on handcrafted regularization functions suffers from target information loss in few observed SAR data. Therefore, in this article, a general 3D sparse imaging framework based on Regulation by Denoising (RED) and proximal gradient descent type method for array SAR is presented. Firstly, we construct explicit prior terms via state-of-the-art denoising operators instead of regularization functions, which can improve the accuracy of sparse reconstruction and preserve the structure information of the target. Then, different proximal gradient descent type methods are presented, including a generalized alternating projection (GAP) and an alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM), which is suitable for high-dimensional data processing. Additionally, the proposed method has robust convergence, which can achieve sparse reconstruction of 3D SAR in few observed SAR data. Extensive simulations and real data experiments are conducted to analyze the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method has superior sparse reconstruction performance.</description>

      <title>Infrared Image Super-Resolution via Lightweight Information Split Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single image super-resolution (SR) is an established pixel-level vision task aimed at reconstructing a high-resolution image from its degraded low-resolution counterpart. Despite the notable advancements achieved by leveraging deep neural networks for SR, most existing deep learning architectures feature an extensive number of layers, leading to high computational complexity and substantial memory demands. These issues become particularly pronounced in the context of infrared image SR, where infrared devices often have stringent storage and computational constraints. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a novel, efficient, and precise single infrared image SR model, termed the Lightweight Information Split Network (LISN). The LISN comprises four main components: shallow feature extraction, deep feature extraction, dense feature fusion, and high-resolution infrared image reconstruction. A key innovation within this model is the introduction of the Lightweight Information Split Block (LISB) for deep feature extraction. The LISB employs a sequential process to extract hierarchical features, which are then aggregated based on the relevance of the features under consideration. By integrating channel splitting and shift operations, the LISB successfully strikes an optimal balance between enhanced SR performance and a lightweight framework. Comprehensive experimental evaluations reveal that the proposed LISN achieves superior performance over contemporary state-of-the-art methods in terms of both SR quality and model complexity, affirming its efficacy for practical deployment in resource-constrained infrared imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Deep Learning of Myocardium Segmentation and T2 Quantification for Acute Myocardial Infarction MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) analysis, simultaneous myocardial segmentation and T2 quantification are crucial for assessing myocardial pathologies. Existing methods often address these tasks separately, limiting their synergistic potential. To address this, we propose SQNet, a dual-task network integrating Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) components. SQNet features a T2-refine fusion decoder for quantitative analysis, leveraging global features from the Transformer, and a segmentation decoder with multiple local region supervision for enhanced accuracy. A tight coupling module aligns and fuses CNN and Transformer branch features, enabling SQNet to focus on myocardium regions. Evaluation on healthy controls (HC) and acute myocardial infarction patients (AMI) demonstrates superior segmentation dice scores (89.3/89.2) compared to state-of-the-art methods (87.7/87.9). T2 quantification yields strong linear correlations (Pearson coefficients: 0.84/0.93) with label values for HC/AMI, indicating accurate mapping. Radiologist evaluations confirm SQNet's superior image quality scores (4.60/4.58 for segmentation, 4.32/4.42 for T2 quantification) over state-of-the-art methods (4.50/4.44 for segmentation, 3.59/4.37 for T2 quantification). SQNet thus offers accurate simultaneous segmentation and quantification, enhancing cardiac disease diagnosis, such as AMI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated volumetric segmentation of the pancreas on cross-sectional imaging is needed for diagnosis and follow-up of pancreatic diseases. While CT-based pancreatic segmentation is more established, MRI-based segmentation methods are understudied, largely due to a lack of publicly available datasets, benchmarking research efforts, and domain-specific deep learning methods. In this retrospective study, we collected a large dataset (767 scans from 499 participants) of T1-weighted (T1W) and T2-weighted (T2W) abdominal MRI series from five centers between March 2004 and November 2022. We also collected CT scans of 1,350 patients from publicly available sources for benchmarking purposes. We developed a new pancreas segmentation method, called PanSegNet, combining the strengths of nnUNet and a Transformer network with a new linear attention module enabling volumetric computation. We tested PanSegNet's accuracy in cross-modality (a total of 2,117 scans) and cross-center settings with Dice and Hausdorff distance (HD95) evaluation metrics. We used Cohen's kappa statistics for intra and inter-rater agreement evaluation and paired t-tests for volume and Dice comparisons, respectively. For segmentation accuracy, we achieved Dice coefficients of 88.3% (std: 7.2%, at case level) with CT, 85.0% (std: 7.9%) with T1W MRI, and 86.3% (std: 6.4%) with T2W MRI. There was a high correlation for pancreas volume prediction with R^2 of 0.91, 0.84, and 0.85 for CT, T1W, and T2W, respectively. We found moderate inter-observer (0.624 and 0.638 for T1W and T2W MRI, respectively) and high intra-observer agreement scores. All MRI data is made available at https://osf.io/kysnj/.

      <title>A Novel Feature Map Enhancement Technique Integrating Residual CNN and Transformer for Alzheimer Diseases Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alzheimer diseases (ADs) involves cognitive decline and abnormal brain protein accumulation, necessitating timely diagnosis for effective treatment. Therefore, CAD systems leveraging deep learning advancements have demonstrated success in AD detection but pose computational intricacies and the dataset minor contrast, structural, and texture variations. In this regard, a novel hybrid FME-Residual-HSCMT technique is introduced, comprised of residual CNN and Transformer concepts to capture global and local fine-grained AD analysis in MRI. This approach integrates three distinct elements: a novel CNN Meet Transformer (HSCMT), customized residual learning CNN, and a new Feature Map Enhancement (FME) strategy to learn diverse morphological, contrast, and texture variations of ADs. The proposed HSCMT at the initial stage utilizes stem convolution blocks that are integrated with CMT blocks followed by systematic homogenous and structural (HS) operations. The customized CMT block encapsulates each element with global contextual interactions through multi-head attention and facilitates computational efficiency through lightweight. Moreover, inverse residual and stem CNN in customized CMT enables effective extraction of local texture information and handling vanishing gradients. Furthermore, in the FME strategy, residual CNN blocks utilize TL-based generated auxiliary and are combined with the proposed HSCMT channels at the target level to achieve diverse enriched feature space. Finally, diverse enhanced channels are fed into a novel spatial attention mechanism for optimal pixel selection to reduce redundancy and discriminate minor contrast and texture inter-class variation. The proposed achieves an F1-score (98.55%), an accuracy of 98.42% and a sensitivity of 98.50%, a precision of 98.60% on the standard Kaggle dataset, and demonstrates outperformance existing ViTs and CNNs methods.</description>

      <title>I$^2$VC: A Unified Framework for Intra- &amp; Inter-frame Video Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video compression aims to reconstruct seamless frames by encoding the motion and residual information from existing frames. Previous neural video compression methods necessitate distinct codecs for three types of frames (I-frame, P-frame and B-frame), which hinders a unified approach and generalization across different video contexts. Intra-codec techniques lack the advanced Motion Estimation and Motion Compensation (MEMC) found in inter-codec, leading to fragmented frameworks lacking uniformity. Our proposed Intra- &amp; Inter-frame Video Compression (I$^2$VC) framework employs a single spatio-temporal codec that guides feature compression rates according to content importance. This unified codec transforms the dependence across frames into a conditional coding scheme, thus integrating intra- and inter-frame compression into one cohesive strategy. Given the absence of explicit motion data, achieving competent inter-frame compression with only a conditional codec poses a challenge. To resolve this, our approach includes an implicit inter-frame alignment mechanism. With the pre-trained diffusion denoising process, the utilization of a diffusion-inverted reference feature rather than random noise supports the initial compression state. This process allows for selective denoising of motion-rich regions based on decoded features, facilitating accurate alignment without the need for MEMC. Our experimental findings, across various compression configurations (AI, LD and RA) and frame types, prove that I$^2$VC outperforms the state-of-the-art perceptual learned codecs. Impressively, it exhibits a 58.4% enhancement in perceptual reconstruction performance when benchmarked against the H.266/VVC standard (VTM).

      <description>arXiv:2405.15413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learned visual compression is an important and active task in multimedia. Existing approaches have explored various CNN- and Transformer-based designs to model content distribution and eliminate redundancy, where balancing efficacy (i.e., rate-distortion trade-off) and efficiency remains a challenge. Recently, state-space models (SSMs) have shown promise due to their long-range modeling capacity and efficiency. Inspired by this, we take the first step to explore SSMs for visual compression. We introduce MambaVC, a simple, strong and efficient compression network based on SSM. MambaVC develops a visual state space (VSS) block with a 2D selective scanning (2DSS) module as the nonlinear activation function after each downsampling, which helps to capture informative global contexts and enhances compression. On compression benchmark datasets, MambaVC achieves superior rate-distortion performance with lower computational and memory overheads. Specifically, it outperforms CNN and Transformer variants by 9.3% and 15.6% on Kodak, respectively, while reducing computation by 42% and 24%, and saving 12% and 71% of memory. MambaVC shows even greater improvements with high-resolution images, highlighting its potential and scalability in real-world applications. We also provide a comprehensive comparison of different network designs, underscoring MambaVC's advantages.</description>

Abstract: Purpose: To introduce a widely applicable workflow for pulmonary lobe segmentation of MR images using a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained with chest computed tomography (CT) datasets. The feasibility is demonstrated for 2D coronal ultra-fast balanced steady-state free precession (ufSSFP) MRI.
  Methods: Lung lobes of 250 publicly accessible CT datasets of adults were segmented with an open-source CT-specific algorithm. To match 2D ufSSFP MRI data of pediatric patients, both CT data and segmentations were translated into pseudo-MR images, masked to suppress anatomy outside the lung. Network-1 was trained with pseudo-MR images and lobe segmentations, and applied to 1000 masked ufSSFP images to predict lobe segmentations. These outputs were directly used as targets to train Network-2 and Network-3 with non-masked ufSSFP data as inputs, and an additional whole-lung mask as input for Network-2. Network predictions were compared to reference manual lobe segmentations of ufSSFP data in twenty pediatric cystic fibrosis patients. Manual lobe segmentations were performed by splitting available whole-lung segmentations into lobes.
  Results: Network-1 was able to segment the lobes of ufSSFP images, and Network-2 and Network-3 further increased segmentation accuracy and robustness. The average all-lobe Dice similarity coefficients were 95.0$\pm$2.8 (mean$\pm$pooled SD [%]), 96.4$\pm$2.0, 93.0$\pm$2.0, and the average median Hausdorff distances were 6.1$\pm$0.9 (mean$\pm$SD [mm]), 5.3$\pm$1.1, 7.1$\pm$1.3, for Network-1, Network-2, and Network-3, respectively.
  Conclusions: RNN lung lobe segmentation of 2D ufSSFP imaging is feasible, in good agreement with manual segmentations. The proposed workflow might provide access to automated lobe segmentations for various lung MRI examinations and quantitative analyses.</description>

      <title>RN-Net: Reservoir Nodes-Enabled Neuromorphic Vision Sensing Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10770v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event-based cameras are inspired by the sparse and asynchronous spike representation of the biological visual system. However, processing the event data requires either using expensive feature descriptors to transform spikes into frames, or using spiking neural networks that are expensive to train. In this work, we propose a neural network architecture, Reservoir Nodes-enabled neuromorphic vision sensing Network (RN-Net), based on simple convolution layers integrated with dynamic temporal encoding reservoirs for local and global spatiotemporal feature detection with low hardware and training costs. The RN-Net allows efficient processing of asynchronous temporal features, and achieves the highest accuracy of 99.2% for DVS128 Gesture reported to date, and one of the highest accuracy of 67.5% for DVS Lip dataset at a much smaller network size. By leveraging the internal device and circuit dynamics, asynchronous temporal feature encoding can be implemented at very low hardware cost without preprocessing and dedicated memory and arithmetic units. The use of simple DNN blocks and standard backpropagation-based training rules further reduces implementation costs.</description>

      <title>Speck: A Smart event-based Vision Sensor with a low latency 327K Neuron Convolutional Neuronal Network Processing Pipeline</title>

Abstract: Edge computing solutions that enable the extraction of high-level information from a variety of sensors is in increasingly high demand. This is due to the increasing number of smart devices that require sensory processing for their application on the edge. To tackle this problem, we present a smart vision sensor System on Chip (SoC), featuring an event-based camera and a low-power asynchronous spiking Convolutional Neural Network (sCNN) computing architecture embedded on a single chip. By combining both sensor and processing on a single die, we can lower unit production costs significantly. Moreover, the simple end-to-end nature of the SoC facilitates small stand-alone applications as well as functioning as an edge node in larger systems. The event-driven nature of the vision sensor delivers high-speed signals in a sparse data stream. This is reflected in the processing pipeline, which focuses on optimising highly sparse computation and minimising latency for 9 sCNN layers to 3.36{\mu}s for an incoming event. Overall, this results in an extremely low-latency visual processing pipeline deployed on a small form factor with a low energy budget and sensor cost. We present the asynchronous architecture, the individual blocks, and the sCNN processing principle and benchmark against other sCNN capable processors.</description>

      <title>Universal Adversarial Defense in Remote Sensing Based on Pre-trained Denoising Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have risen to prominence as key solutions in numerous AI applications for earth observation (AI4EO). However, their susceptibility to adversarial examples poses a critical challenge, compromising the reliability of AI4EO algorithms. This paper presents a novel Universal Adversarial Defense approach in Remote Sensing Imagery (UAD-RS), leveraging pre-trained diffusion models to protect DNNs against universal adversarial examples exhibiting heterogeneous patterns. Specifically, a universal adversarial purification framework is developed utilizing pre-trained diffusion models to mitigate adversarial perturbations through the introduction of Gaussian noise and subsequent purification of the perturbations from adversarial examples. Additionally, an Adaptive Noise Level Selection (ANLS) mechanism is introduced to determine the optimal noise level for the purification framework with a task-guided Frechet Inception Distance (FID) ranking strategy, thereby enhancing purification performance. Consequently, only a single pre-trained diffusion model is required for purifying universal adversarial samples with heterogeneous patterns across each dataset, significantly reducing training efforts for multiple attack settings while maintaining high performance without prior knowledge of adversarial perturbations. Experimental results on four heterogeneous RS datasets, focusing on scene classification and semantic segmentation, demonstrate that UAD-RS outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial purification approaches, providing universal defense against seven commonly encountered adversarial perturbations. Codes and the pre-trained models are available online (https://github.com/EricYu97/UAD-RS).</description>

      <title>R2D2 image reconstruction with model uncertainty quantification in radio astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ``Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic range imaging'' (R2D2) approach was recently introduced for Radio-Interferometric (RI) imaging in astronomy. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively estimated as outputs of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) taking the previous iteration's image estimate and associated data residual as inputs. In this work, we investigate the robustness of the R2D2 image estimation process, by studying the uncertainty associated with its series of learned models. Adopting an ensemble averaging approach, multiple series can be trained, arising from different random DNN initializations of the training process at each iteration. The resulting multiple R2D2 instances can also be leveraged to generate ``R2D2 samples'', from which empirical mean and standard deviation endow the algorithm with a joint estimation and uncertainty quantification functionality. Focusing on RI imaging, and adopting a telescope-specific approach, multiple R2D2 instances were trained to encompass the most general observation setting of the Very Large Array (VLA). Simulations and real-data experiments confirm that: (i) R2D2's image estimation capability is superior to that of the state-of-the-art algorithms; (ii) its ultra-fast reconstruction capability (arising from series with only few DNNs) makes the computation of multiple reconstruction samples and of uncertainty maps practical even at large image dimension; (iii) it is characterized by a very low model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>WateRF: Robust Watermarks in Radiance Fields for Protection of Copyrights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advances in the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) research offer extensive applications in diverse domains, but protecting their copyrights has not yet been researched in depth. Recently, NeRF watermarking has been considered one of the pivotal solutions for safely deploying NeRF-based 3D representations. However, existing methods are designed to apply only to implicit or explicit NeRF representations. In this work, we introduce an innovative watermarking method that can be employed in both representations of NeRF. This is achieved by fine-tuning NeRF to embed binary messages in the rendering process. In detail, we propose utilizing the discrete wavelet transform in the NeRF space for watermarking. Furthermore, we adopt a deferred back-propagation technique and introduce a combination with the patch-wise loss to improve rendering quality and bit accuracy with minimum trade-offs. We evaluate our method in three different aspects: capacity, invisibility, and robustness of the embedded watermarks in the 2D-rendered images. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with faster training speed over the compared state-of-the-art methods.</description>
