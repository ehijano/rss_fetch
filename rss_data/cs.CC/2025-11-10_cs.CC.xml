      <title>Pseudodeterministic Communication Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit an $n$-bit partial function with randomized communication complexity $O(\log n)$ but such that any completion of this function into a total one requires randomized communication complexity $n^{\Omega(1)}$. In particular, this shows an exponential separation between randomized and \emph{pseudodeterministic} communication protocols. Previously, Gavinsky (2025) showed an analogous separation in the weaker model of parity decision trees. We use lifting techniques to extend his proof idea to communication complexity.</description>

      <title>On the gradient of the coefficient of the characteristic polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the bivariate Cayley-Hamilton theorem, a powerful generalization of the classical Cayley-Hamilton theorem. The bivariate Cayley-Hamilton theorem has three direct corollaries that are usually proved independently: The classical Cayley-Hamilton theorem, the Girard-Newton identities, and the fact that the determinant and every coefficient of the characteristic polynomial has polynomially sized algebraic branching programs (ABPs) over arbitrary commutative rings. This last fact could so far only be obtained from separate constructions, and now we get it as a direct consequence of this much more general statement.
  The statement of the bivariate Cayley-Hamilton theorem involves the gradient of the coefficient of the characteristic polynomial, which is a generalization of the adjugate matrix. Analyzing this gradient, we obtain another new ABP for the determinant and every coefficient of the characteristic polynomial. This ABP has one third the size and half the width compared to the current record-holder ABP constructed by Mahajan-Vinay in 1997. This is the first improvement on this problem for 28 years.
  Our ABP is built around algebraic identities involving the first order partial derivatives of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial, and does not use the ad-hoc combinatorial concept of clow sequences. This answers the 26-year-old open question by Mahajan-Vinay from 1999 about the necessity of clow sequences.
  We prove all results in a combinatorial way that on a first sight looks similar to Mahajan-Vinay, but it is closer to Straubing's and Zeilberger's constructions.</description>

      <title>Modular composition &amp; polynomial GCD in the border of small, shallow circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular composition is the problem of computing the coefficient vector of the polynomial $f(g(x)) \bmod h(x)$, given as input the coefficient vectors of univariate polynomials $f$, $g$, and $h$ over an underlying field $\mathbb{F}$. While this problem is known to be solvable in nearly-linear time over finite fields due to work of Kedlaya &amp; Umans, no such near-linear-time algorithms are known over infinite fields, with the fastest known algorithm being from a recent work of Neiger, Salvy, Schost &amp; Villard that takes $O(n^{1.43})$ field operations on inputs of degree $n$. In this work, we show that for any infinite field $\mathbb{F}$, modular composition is in the border of algebraic circuits with division gates of nearly-linear size and polylogarithmic depth. Moreover, this circuit family can itself be constructed in near-linear time.
  Our techniques also extend to other algebraic problems, most notably to the problem of computing greatest common divisors of univariate polynomials. We show that over any infinite field $\mathbb{F}$, the GCD of two univariate polynomials can be computed (piecewise) in the border sense by nearly-linear-size and polylogarithmic-depth algebraic circuits with division gates, where the circuits themselves can be constructed in near-linear time. While univariate polynomial GCD is known to be computable in near-linear time by the Knuth--Sch\"{o}nhage algorithm, or by constant-depth algebraic circuits from a recent result of Andrews &amp; Wigderson, obtaining a parallel algorithm that simultaneously achieves polylogarithmic depth and near-linear work remains an open problem of great interest. Our result shows such an upper bound in the setting of border complexity.</description>

      <title>Deterministic list decoding of Reed-Solomon codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Reed-Solomon codes of dimension $k$ and block length $n$ over any finite field $\mathbb{F}$ can be deterministically list decoded from agreement $\sqrt{(k-1)n}$ in time $\text{poly}(n, \log |\mathbb{F}|)$.
  Prior to this work, the list decoding algorithms for Reed-Solomon codes, from the celebrated results of Sudan and Guruswami-Sudan, were either randomized with time complexity $\text{poly}(n, \log |\mathbb{F}|)$ or were deterministic with time complexity depending polynomially on the characteristic of the underlying field. In particular, over a prime field $\mathbb{F}$, no deterministic algorithms running in time $\text{poly}(n, \log |\mathbb{F}|)$ were known for this problem.
  Our main technical ingredient is a deterministic algorithm for solving the bivariate polynomial factorization instances that appear in the algorithm of Sudan and Guruswami-Sudan with only a $\text{poly}(\log |\mathbb{F}|)$ dependence on the field size in its time complexity for every finite field $\mathbb{F}$. While the question of obtaining efficient deterministic algorithms for polynomial factorization over finite fields is a fundamental open problem even for univariate polynomials of degree $2$, we show that additional information from the received word can be used to obtain such an algorithm for instances that appear in the course of list decoding Reed-Solomon codes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Parallel Basis Finding in Graphic and Related Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the parallel complexity of finding a basis of a graphic matroid under independence-oracle access. Karp, Upfal, and Wigderson (FOCS 1985, JCSS 1988) initiated the study of this problem and established two algorithms for finding a spanning forest: one running in $O(\log m)$ rounds with $m^{\Theta(\log m)}$ queries, and another, for any $d \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, running in $O(m^{2/d})$ rounds with $\Theta(m^d)$ queries. A key open question they posed was whether one could simultaneously achieve polylogarithmic rounds and polynomially many queries. We give a deterministic algorithm that uses $O(\log m)$ adaptive rounds and $\mathrm{poly}(m)$ non-adaptive queries per round to return a spanning forest on $m$ edges, and complement this result with a matching $\Omega(\log m)$ lower bound for any (even randomized) algorithm with $\mathrm{poly}(m)$ queries per round. Thus, the adaptive round complexity for graphic matroids is characterized exactly, settling this long-standing problem. Beyond graphs, we show that our framework also yields an $O(\log m)$-round, $\mathrm{poly}(m)$-query algorithm for any binary matroid satisfying a smooth circuit counting property, implying, among others, an optimal $O(\log m)$-round parallel algorithms for finding bases of cographic matroids.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage from effective $200$-qubit holographic random circuit sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers hold the promise of outperforming classical computers in solving certain problems. While large-scale quantum algorithms will require fault-tolerant devices, near-term demonstrations of quantum advantage on existing devices can provide important milestones. Random circuit sampling has emerged as a leading candidate for such demonstrations. However, existing implementations often underutilize circuit depth, limiting the achievable advantage. We introduce a holographic random circuit sampling algorithm that substantially increases the sampling complexity by leveraging repeated interactions and mid-circuit measurements. This approach scales the effective sampling dimension with the circuit depth, ultimately leading to an exponential growth in sampling complexity. With merely 20 physical qubits on IBM quantum devices, we experimentally demonstrate the effective sampling of up to 200 qubits, with a cross-entropy benchmark fidelity of $0.0593$, establishing a new route to scalable quantum advantage through the combined use of spatial and temporal quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Barriers for rectangular matrix multiplication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2003.03019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic problem of multiplying large matrices that are rectangular. We prove that the method that has been used to construct the fastest algorithms for rectangular matrix multiplication cannot give algorithms with complexity $n^{p + 1}$ for $n \times n$ by $n \times n^p$ matrix multiplication. In fact, we prove a precise numerical barrier for this method. Our barrier improves the previously known barriers, both in the numerical sense, as well as in its generality. In particular, we prove that any lower bound on the dual exponent of matrix multiplication $\alpha$ via the big Coppersmith-Winograd tensors cannot exceed 0.6218.</description>

      <title>Formalizing the notions of non-interactive and interactive algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An earlier paper gives an account of a quest for a satisfactory formalization of the classical informal notion of an algorithm. That notion only covers algorithms that are deterministic and non-interactive. In this paper, an attempt is made to generalize the results of that quest first to a notion of an algorithm that covers both deterministic and non-deterministic algorithms that are non-interactive and then further to a notion of an algorithm that covers both deterministic and non-deterministic algorithms that are interactive. The notions of an non-interactive proto-algorithm and an interactive proto-algorithm are introduced. Non-interactive algorithms and interactive algorithms are expected to be equivalence classes of non-interactive proto-algorithms and interactive proto-algorithms, respectively, under an appropriate equivalence relation. On both non-interactive proto-algorithms and interactive proto-algorithms, three equivalence relations are defined. Two of them are deemed to be bounds for an appropriate equivalence relation and the third is likely an appropriate one.</description>

      <title>Boolean function monotonicity testing requires (almost) $n^{1/2}$ queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for any constant $c&gt;0$, any (two-sided error) adaptive algorithm for testing monotonicity of Boolean functions must have query complexity $\Omega(n^{1/2-c})$. This improves the $\tilde\Omega(n^{1/3})$ lower bound of [CWX17] and almost matches the $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ upper bound of [KMS18].</description>

      <title>Performance of Gaussian Boson Sampling on Planted Bipartite Clique Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) can provide a computational advantage for solving the planted biclique problem, which is a graph problem widely believed to be classically hard when the planted structure is small. Although GBS has been heuristically and experimentally observed to favor sampling dense subgraphs, its theoretical performance on this classically hard problem remains largely unexplored. We focus on a natural statistic derived from GBS output: the frequency with which a node appears in GBS samples, referred to as the node weight. We rigorously analyze whether this signal is strong enough to distinguish planted biclique nodes from background nodes. Our analysis characterizes the distribution of node weights under GBS and quantifies the bias introduced by the planted structure. The results reveal a sharp limitation: when the planted biclique size falls within the conjectured hard regime, the natural fluctuations in node weights dominate the bias signal, making detection unreliable using simple ranking strategies. These findings provide the first rigorous evidence that planted biclique detection may remain computationally hard even under GBS-based quantum computing, and they motivate further investigation into more advanced GBS-based algorithms or other quantum approaches for this problem.</description>
