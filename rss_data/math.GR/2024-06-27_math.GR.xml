      <title>A characterization of some finite simple groups by their character codegrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$ and an irreducible complex character $\chi$ of $G$, the codegree of $\chi$ is defined by $\textrm{cod}(\chi)=|G:\textrm{ker}(\chi)|/\chi(1)$, where $\textrm{ker}(\chi)$ is the kernel of $\chi$. In this paper, we show that if $H$ is a finite simple exceptional group of Lie type or a projective special linear group and $G$ is any finite group such that the character codegree sets of $G$ and $H$ coincide, then $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Decidability of Krohn-Rhodes complexity for all finite semigroups and automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Krohn-Rhodes Theorem proves that a finite semigroup divides a wreath product of groups and aperiodic semigroups. Krohn-Rhodes complexity equals the minimal number of groups that are needed. Determining an algorithm to compute complexity has been an open problem for more than 50 years. The main result of this paper proves that it is decidable whether a semigroup has complexity k for any k greater than or equal to 0. This builds on our previous work for complexity 1. In that paper we proved using profinite methods and results on free Burnside semigroups by McCammond and others that the lower bound from a 2012 paper by Henckell, Rhodes and Steinberg is precise for complexity 1. In this paper we define an improved version of the lower bound from the 2012 paper and prove that it is exact for arbitrary complexity.</description>

      <title>Constructing regular saturated formations of finite soluble groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a formation $\mathfrak{F}$ of finite groups consider a graph whose vertices are elements of a finite group and two vertices are connected by an edge if and only if they generates non-$\mathfrak{F}$-group as elements of a group. A hereditary formation $\mathfrak{F}$ is called regular if the set of all isolated vertices of the described graph coincides with the intersection of all maximal $\mathfrak{F}$-subgroups in every group. The constructive description of saturated regular formations of soluble groups which improves the results of Lucchini and Nemmi is obtained in this paper. In particular, it is showed that saturated regular non-empty formations of soluble groups are just hereditary formations $\mathfrak{F}$ of soluble groups that contains every group all whose cyclic primary subgroups are $K$-$\mathfrak{F}$-subnormal. Also we prove that the lattice of saturated regular formations of soluble groups is lattice isomorphic to the Steinitz's lattice.</description>

      <title>Geometrical finiteness for automorphism groups via cone conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to establish the geometrical finiteness for the natural isometric actions of (birational) automorphism groups on the hyperbolic spaces for K3 surfaces, Enriques surfaces, Coble surfaces, and irreducible symplectic varieties.
  As an application, it can be seen that such groups are non-positively curved: ${\rm CAT(0)}$ and relatively hyperbolic. In the case of K3 surfaces, we additionally provide a dynamical characterization of the relative hyperbolicity, and the first counterexample to Mukai's conjecture concerning the virtual cohomological dimension of automorphism groups.</description>

      <title>On minimal coverings of groups by proper normalizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.01045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a group $G$, a {\it normalizer covering} of $G$ is a finite set of proper normalizers of some subgroups of $G$ whose union is $G$. We study $p$-groups ($p$ a prime) having a normalizer covering and find the minimal size of a normalizer covering for all nilpotent groups. As an application, we determine some non-nilpotent groups having a nilpotent normalizer covering.</description>

      <title>Unipotent linear suspensions of free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of the conjugacy problem for outer automorphism of free groups, we develop the algorithmic theory of the free-by-cyclic group produced by unipotent linearly growing automorphisms of f.g. free groups.
  We compute canonical splittings of these suspensions as well as their subgroups. We compute their automorphism groups. We show that this class of suspensions is effectively coherent. We solve the mixed Whitehead problem in these suspensions and show that their subgroups all satisfy the Minkowski property, i.e. that torsion in their outer automorphism group is faithfully represented in some computable finite quotients.
  An application of our results is a solution to the conjugacy problem for outer automorphisms of free groups whose polynomially growing part is unipotent linear.</description>

      <title>On homological properties of the Schlichting completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how finiteness properties of a group and a subgroup transfer to finiteness properties of the Schlichting completion relative to this subgroup. Further, we provide a criterion when the dense embedding of a discrete group into the Schlichting completion relative to one of its subgroups induces an isomorphism in (continuous) cohomology. As an application, we show that the continuous cohomology of the Neretin group vanishes in all positive degrees.</description>

      <title>Content systems and deformations of cyclotomic KLR algebras of type $A$ and $C$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00134v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper initiates a systematic study of the cyclotomic KLR algebras of affine types $A$ and $C$. We start by introducing a graded deformation of these algebras and the constructing all of the irreducible representations of the deformed cyclotomic KLR algebras using content systems and a generalisation of the Young's seminormal forms for the symmetric groups. Quite amazingly, this theory simultaneously captures the representation theory of the cyclotomic KLR algebras of types $A$ and $C$, with the main difference being the definition of residue sequences of tableaux. We then use our semisimple deformations to construct two "dual" cellular bases for the non-semisimple KLR algebras of affine types $A$ and $C$. As applications of this theory we recover many of the main features from the representation theory in type $A$, simultaneously proving them for the cyclotomic KLR algebras of types $A$ and $C$. These results are completely new in type $C$ and we, usually, more direct proofs in type $A$. In particular, we show that these algebras categorify the irreducible integrable highest weight modules of the corresponding Kac-Moody algebras, we construct and classify their simple modules, we investigate links with canonical bases and we generalise Kleshchev's modular branching rules to these algebras.</description>

      <title>A symplectic Hilbert-Smith conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove new cases of the Hilbert-Smith conjecture for actions by natural homeomorphisms in symplectic topology. Specifically, we prove that the group of $p$-adic integers $\mathbb Z_p$ does not admit non-trivial continuous actions by Hamiltonian homeomorphisms, the $C^0$ limits of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, on symplectically aspherical symplectic manifolds. For a class of symplectic manifolds, including all standard symplectic tori, we deduce that a locally compact group acting faithfully by homeomorphisms in the $C^0$ closure of time-one maps of symplectic isotopies must be a Lie group. Our methods of proof differ from prior approaches to the question and involve barcodes and power operations in Floer cohomology. They also apply to other natural metrics in symplectic topology, notably Hofer's metric. An appendix by Leonid Polterovich uses this to deduce obstructions on Hamiltonian actions by semi-simple $p$-adic analytic groups.</description>
