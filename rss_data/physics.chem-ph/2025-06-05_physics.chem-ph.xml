      <title>MC-PDFT Nuclear Gradients and L-PDFT Energies with Meta and Hybrid Meta On-Top Functionals for Ground- and Excited-State Geometry Optimization and Vertical Excitation Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) is a post-MCSCF multireference electronic-structure method that explicitly models strong electron correlation, and linearized pair-density functional theory (L-PDFT) is a recently developed multi-state extension that can accurately model conical intersections and locally-avoided crossings. Because MC-PDFT and L-PDFT rely on an on-top energy functional, their accuracy depends on the quality of the on-top functional used. Recent work has introduced translated meta-gradient-approximation (meta-GA) on-top functionals, and specifically the MC23 hybrid meta-GA on-top functional, which is the first on-top functional specifically optimized for MC-PDFT. Here we report the derivation and implementation of analytic nuclear gradients for MC-PDFT calculations using meta-GA and hybrid meta-GA on-top functionals. This development also enables analytic nuclear gradients for the widely successful tPBE0 hybrid on-top functional. Because MC-PDFT nuclear-gradient calculations involve the derivative of the on-top functional, this development also enables the use of meta-GA on-top functionals in L-PDFT single-point energy calculations. We use the new capabilities to test MC23 for ground-state geometries, excited-state geometries, and vertical excitation energies of s-trans-butadiene and benzophenone as well as to test MC23, another hybrid meta-GA, and seven other meta-GA on-top functionals for 441 vertical excitation energies. We find MC23 performs the best of all nine meta and hybrid meta functionals for vertical excitation energies and is comparable in accuracy to tPBE0 and to the NEVPT2 multireference wave function method. Additionally, we directly compare our MC-PDFT vertical excitation results to previously computed TD-DFT values and find that MC-PDFT outperforms even the best performing Kohn-Sham density functional.</description>

      <title>Three-body potential energy surface for parahydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a 3D isotropic ab initio three-body (para-H$_2$)$_3$ interaction potential energy surface (PES). The electronic structure calculations are carried out at the correlated coupled-cluster theory level, with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations. The calculations use an augmented correlation-consistent triple zeta basis set and a supplementary midbond function. We construct the PES using the Reproducing-Kernel Hilbert Space toolkit [J. Chem. Inf. Model. 57, 1923 (2017)] with phenomenological and empirical adjustments to account for short-range and long-range behaviour. The (para-H$_2$)$_3$ interaction energies deviate drastically from the Axilrod-Teller-Muto (ATM) potential at short intermolecular separations. We find that the configuration of three para-H$_2$ molecules at the corners of an equilateral triangle is responsible for the majority of the (para-H$_2$)$_3$ interaction energy contribution in a hexagonal-close-packed lattice. In cases where two para-H$_2$ molecules are close to one another while the third is far away, the (para-H$_2$)$_3$ interaction PES takes the form of a modified version of the ATM potential. We expect the combination of this PES together with a first principles para-H$_2$--para-H$_2$ Adiabatic Hindered Rotor potential to outperform a widely-used effective pair potential for condensed many-body systems of para-H$_2$.</description>

      <title>Equation of state of solid parahydrogen using ab initio two-body and three-body interaction potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the equation of state (EOS) of solid parahydrogen between $ 0.024 \, {\r{A}}^{-3} $ and $ 0.1 \, {\r{A}}^{-3} $ at $ T = 4.2 $ K, calculated using path-integral Monte Carlo simulations, with ab initio two-body and three-body interaction potentials. We correct for finite size simulation errors using potential tail corrections. Trotter factorization errors are accounted for, either via extrapolation, or by using a suitably small imaginary time step. We incorporate the three-body interaction using two methods; the full inclusion method, where pair and three-body interactions are used in both Monte Carlo sampling and in the energy estimators, and the perturbative method, where three-body interactions are omitted from sampling but are still present in energy estimations. Both treatments of the three-body interaction return very similar total energies and pressures. The presence of three-body interactions has only minor effects on the structural properties of the solid. Whereas the pair interaction, on its own, significantly overestimates the pressure of solid parahydrogen, the additional presence of the three-body interaction causes a severe underestimation of the pressure. Our findings suggest that accurate simulations of solid parahydrogen require four-body and possibly higher-order many-body interactions. It may also be the case that static interaction potentials are entirely unsuitable for simulations of solid parahydrogen at high densities.</description>

      <title>Delayed photoisomerisation of the trans-PSB3 retinal toy model using on-the-fly quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the trans-cis photoisomerisation process in a representative retinal protonated Schiff base known as trans-PSB3, employing the quantum dynamics method direct dynamics variational multiconfigurational gaussian -- DD-vMCG -- in full dimensionality, i.e., 36 degrees of freedom on potential energy surfaces computed on-the-fly using the SA(2)-CAS(6,6)SCF electronic structure method with the 6-31G basis set. Although the toy molecule has been extensively studied using trajectory methods such as Tully Surface Hopping and Ab Initio Multiple Spawning, the on-the-fly quantum dynamics method DD-vMCG shows a trans-cis isomerisation hundreds of femtoseconds slower using the same electronic structure method, which can be explained in terms of the accesibility to the conical intersection connecting the ground and the excited state.</description>

      <title>Interplay between ultrafast electronic and librational dynamics in liquid nitrobenzene probed with two-color four-wave mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental and theoretical study of the interplay between ultrafast electron dynamics and librational dynamics in liquid nitrobenzene. A femtosecond ultraviolet pulse and two femtosecond near infrared pulses interact with nitrobenzene molecules, generating a four-wave mixing nonlinear signal that is measured in the Optical Kerr Effect geometry. The near infrared nonlinear signal is measured to be non-zero only at negative time delays, corresponding to the near infrared pulses arriving earlier than the ultraviolet pulse. We perform time-dependent Quantum Master Equation calculations, which include a classical libration model, to simulate the experiment. The simulations support the conclusion that the near infrared pulses launch librational motion, while simultaneously creating electronic coherences that result in a libration-modulated electronic nonlinear response. Furthermore, we conclude that the measured nonlinear optical signal corresponds to a non-parametric process that leaves the molecules in an excited electronic state. This work provides new insight into ultrafast nonlinear optical interactions in liquids and is an important step towards probing ultrafast electronic coherences in large molecules in the liquid phase.</description>

      <title>Superatomic hydrogen: achieving effective aggregation of hydrogen atoms at pressures lower than that of metallic hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal hydrogen exhibiting electron delocalization properties has been recognized as an important prospect for achieving controlled nuclear fusion, but the extreme pressure conditions required exceeding hundreds of GPa remain a daunting challenge. Here, we propose a model of superatomic hydrogen, aiming to reduce the pressure conditions required for the effective aggregation of elemental hydrogen atoms. High-precision ab initio calculations indicate that the pressure required to compress the H13 system with one central atom and 12 surrounding atoms into a superatomic state is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that of metallic hydrogen. Atomic-level analyses reveal that in the superatomic state of compressed H13, the central H atom donates its electron, and all electrons are delocalized on the superatomic molecular orbitals, which conforms to properties of metallic hydrogen. Our discovery in principle opens up the prospect of superatomic hydrogen in areas such as nuclear fusion.</description>

      <title>Ultralong Room-Temperature Qubit Lifetimes of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular electron spin qubits offer atomic-level tunability and room-temperature quantum coherence. Their integration into engineered solid-state matrices can enhance performance towards ambient quantum information technologies. Herein, we demonstrate covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as programmable matrices of stable organic radical qubits allowing strategic optimization of spin-phonon and spin-spin interactions. Using two classic boronate-ester frameworks, COF-5 and COF-108, to host semiquinone-like radical qubits, we achieve ultralong spin relaxation time (T1 &gt; 300 {\mu}s) at 298 K, which outperforms most molecular qubits and rivals inorganic spin defects. The suppression of spin relaxation is attributed to rigid and neutral structures as well as carbon-centered spin distributions that effectively weaken spin-phonon coupling. Employing dynamical decoupling methods to both COFs improves their quantum coherence and enables room-temperature detection of nuclear spins including 1H, 11B, and 13C. Our work establishes COFs as designer quantum materials, opening new avenues for quantum sensing of nuclear spins at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Efficient and standardized interface energy calculations in hybrid heterostructures using fictitious atoms surface passivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures combining diverse physico-chemical properties are increasingly in demand for a wide range of applications in modern science and technology. However, despite their importance in materials science, accurately determining absolute interface energies remains a major challenge. This difficulty arises from periodic boundary conditions, high computational costs of plane-wave methods, multipolar interactions in heterostructures, the need for thick slabs for interface convergence, and reconstructed surfaces on both slab faces. Here, we introduce a standardized and computationally efficient fictitious H* charge passivation method for the surface termination, designed to accurately determine absolute interface energies in heterogeneous materials associations. This approach effectively addresses issues associated with surface reconstructions while significantly reducing computational costs within the framework of density functional theory. To demonstrate its reliability, we calculate the absolute interface energies for various quasi-lattice-matched and lattice-mismatched abrupt III-V/Si interfaces using the H* passivation technique and benchmark the results against those obtained using conventional reconstructed surface methods. We further explore the early stages of strained epitaxial GaAs on Si(001). Finally, we assess the fictitious H* passivation method, showing its effectiveness in minimizing electric dipole errors, reducing computational costs, and thus decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from high-performance computing. Finally, the potential of the approach to compute interface energies across a broad spectrum of materials is emphasized.</description>

      <title>Limitations of Quantum Hardware for Molecular Energy Estimation Using VQE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) are among the most promising quantum algorithms for solving electronic structure problems in quantum chemistry, particularly during the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. In this study, we investigate the capabilities and limitations of VQE algorithms implemented on current quantum hardware for determining molecular ground-state energies, focusing on the adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-Trotter ansatz VQE (ADAPT-VQE). To address the significant computational challenges posed by molecular Hamiltonians, we explore various strategies to simplify the Hamiltonian, optimize the ansatz, and improve classical parameter optimization through modifications of the COBYLA optimizer. These enhancements are integrated into a tailored quantum computing implementation designed to minimize the circuit depth and computational cost. Using benzene as a benchmark system, we demonstrate the application of these optimizations on an IBM quantum computer. Despite these improvements, our results highlight the limitations imposed by current quantum hardware, particularly the impact of quantum noise on state preparation and energy measurement. The noise levels in today's devices prevent meaningful evaluations of molecular Hamiltonians with sufficient accuracy to produce reliable quantum chemical insights. Finally, we extrapolate the requirements for future quantum hardware to enable practical and scalable quantum chemistry calculations using VQE algorithms. This work provides a roadmap for advancing quantum algorithms and hardware toward achieving quantum advantage in molecular modeling.</description>

      <title>chemtrain-deploy: A parallel and scalable framework for machine learning potentials in million-atom MD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have advanced rapidly and show great promise to transform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, most existing software tools are tied to specific MLP architectures, lack integration with standard MD packages, or are not parallelizable across GPUs. To address these challenges, we present chemtrain-deploy, a framework that enables model-agnostic deployment of MLPs in LAMMPS. chemtrain-deploy supports any JAX-defined semi-local potential, allowing users to exploit the functionality of LAMMPS and perform large-scale MLP-based MD simulations on multiple GPUs. It achieves state-of-the-art efficiency and scales to systems containing millions of atoms. We validate its performance and scalability using graph neural network architectures, including MACE, Allegro, and PaiNN, applied to a variety of systems, such as liquid-vapor interfaces, crystalline materials, and solvated peptides. Our results highlight the practical utility of chemtrain-deploy for real-world, high-performance simulations and provide guidance for MLP architecture selection and future design.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quantum Chemistry and MaxCut: Classical Performance Guarantees and Quantum Algorithms for the Hartree-Fock Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum chemistry, self-consistent field (SCF) algorithms define a nonlinear optimization problem, with both continuous and discrete components. In this work, we derive Hartree-Fock-inspired SCF algorithms that can be exactly written as a sequence of Quadratic Unconstrained Spin/Binary Optimization problems (QUSO/QUBO). We reformulate the optimization problem as a series of MaxCut graph problems, which can be efficiently solved using semi-definite programming techniques. This procedure provides performance guarantees at each SCF step, irrespective of the complexity of the optimization landscape. We numerically demonstrate the QUBO-SCF and MaxCut-SCF methods by studying the hydroxide anion OH- and molecular Nitrogen N2. The largest problem addressed in this study involves a system comprised of 220 qubits (equivalently, spin-orbitals). Our results show that QUBO-SCF and MaxCut-SCF suffer much less from internal instabilities compared with conventional SCF calculations. Additionally, we show that the new SCF algorithms can enhance single-reference methods, such as configuration interaction. Finally, we explore how quantum algorithms for optimization can be applied to the QUSO problems arising from the Hartree-Fock method. Four distinct hybrid-quantum classical approaches are introduced: GAS-SCF, QAOA-SCF, QA-SCF and DQI-SCF.</description>

      <title>Equation of State and First Principles Prediction of the Vibrational Matrix Shift of Solid Parahydrogen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generate the equation of state (EOS) of solid parahydrogen using a path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulation based on a highly accurate first-principles adiabatic hindered rotor (AHR) potential energy curve for the parahydrogen dimer. The EOS curves for the fcc and hcp structures of solid parahydrogen near the equilibrium density show that the hcp structure is the more stable of the two, in agreement with experiment. To accurately reproduce the structural and energy properties of solid parahydrogen, we eliminated by extrapolation the systematic errors associated with the choice of simulation parameters used in the PIMC calculation. We also investigate the temperature dependence of the EOS curves, and the invariance of the equilibrium density with temperature is satisfyingly reproduced. The pressure as a function of density, and the compressibility as a function of pressure, are both calculated using the obtained EOS and are compared with previous simulation results and experiments. We also report the first ever a priori prediction of a vibrational matrix shift from first-principles two-body potential functions, and its result for the equilibrium state agrees well with experiment.</description>

      <title>FragFM: Hierarchical Framework for Efficient Molecule Generation via Fragment-Level Discrete Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce FragFM, a novel hierarchical framework via fragment-level discrete flow matching for efficient molecular graph generation. FragFM generates molecules at the fragment level, leveraging a coarse-to-fine autoencoder to reconstruct details at the atom level. Together with a stochastic fragment bag strategy to effectively handle an extensive fragment space, our framework enables more efficient and scalable molecular generation. We demonstrate that our fragment-based approach achieves better property control than the atom-based method and additional flexibility through conditioning the fragment bag. We also propose a Natural Product Generation benchmark (NPGen) to evaluate modern molecular graph generative models' ability to generate natural product-like molecules. Since natural products are biologically prevalidated and differ from typical drug-like molecules, our benchmark provides a more challenging yet meaningful evaluation relevant to drug discovery. We conduct a FragFM comparative study against various models on diverse molecular generation benchmarks, including NPGen, demonstrating superior performance. The results highlight the potential of fragment-based generative modeling for large-scale, property-aware molecular design, paving the way for more efficient exploration of chemical space.</description>
