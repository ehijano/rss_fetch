      <title>Fractons on curved spacetime in $2+1$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dipole Chern-Simons theory with and without a cosmological constant in $2+1$ dimensions. We write the theory in a second order formulation and show that this leads to a fracton gauge theory coupled to Aristotelian geometry which can also be coupled to matter. This coupling exhibits the remarkable property of generalizing dipole gauge invariance to curved spacetimes, without placing any limitations on the possible geometries. We also use the second order formulation to construct a higher dimensional generalization of the action. Finally, for the $(2+1)$-dimensional Chern-Simons theory we find solutions and interpret these as electric monopoles, analyze their charges and argue that the asymptotic symmetries are infinite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>$AdS$ solutions with spindle factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By globally completing previously known local solutions, we present $AdS_3\times\Sigma\times{KE}_2^+\times{T}^2\times(\psi)$ solutions of type IIB supergravity and $AdS_2\times\Sigma\times{KE}_4^+\times{T}^2\times(\psi)$ solutions of eleven-dimensional supergravity where $\Sigma$ is a spindle factor. For the $AdS_3$ solutions, the internal space of $\Sigma\times{KE}_2^+\times(\psi)$ was previously known as the $\mathscr{Y}^{p,q}$ manifold, which shares the identical topology of the $Y^{p,q}$ manifolds. Unlike the previously known spindle solutions, the gauged supergravity origin and the field theory dual of the solutions are not clear at the moment. We perform the flux quantizations and calculate the holographic central charge and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the presumed black hole solutions, respectively.</description>

      <title>Confinement and screening via holographic Wilson loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the holographic dual to a family of ${\cal N}=1$ SCFTs in four dimensions, deformed by a VEV leading to a gapped system. We calculate Wilson loops in this system containing adjoint, bifundamental and fundamental matter. We calculate the quark-antiquark energy $E$ in terms of their separation $L$, finding an approximate analytic expression for $E(L)$. This expression shows the transition between conformal, confining and screened behaviours. Interesting phenomenology is discussed in a variety of examples. The tool used is the minimization of the F1 string action, for which the code used is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Shift operators and momentum-space conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A momentum-space approach to conformal field theory offers a new perspective on cosmological correlators and better reveals the underlying connections to scattering amplitudes. This thesis explores the interplay between integral representations and shift operators.
  A representation for the general $n$-point function of scalar operators was recently proposed in the form of a Feynman integral with the topology of an $(n-1)$-simplex, featuring an arbitrary function of momentum-space cross ratios. We show the graph polynomials for this integral can all be expressed in terms of the first and second minors of the Laplacian matrix for the simplex. Computing the effective resistance between nodes of the corresponding electrical network, an inverse parametrisation is found in terms of the determinant and first minors of the Cayley-Menger matrix. These parametrisations reveal new families of shift operators expressible as determinants that connect $n$-point functions in spacetime dimensions differing by two. Furthermore, they enable the validity of the conformal Ward identities to be established directly without recourse to recursion in the number of points.
  We then analyse the representation of conformal and Feynman integrals through a class of multivariable hypergeometric functions proposed by Gelfand, Kapranov \&amp; Zelevinsky. Among other advantages, this formalism enables the systematic construction of highly non-trivial weight-shifting operators known as ``creation'' operators. We discuss these operators emphasising their close connection to the spectral singularities that arise for special parameter values, and their relationship to the Newton polytope of the integrand. Via these methods we construct novel weight-shifting operators connecting contact Witten diagrams of different operator and spacetime dimensions, as well as exchange diagrams with purely non-derivative vertices.</description>

      <title>Phases and Phase transitions of U(1)$\times$SU(2) symmetric holographic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase diagram and symmetry breaking patterns of a holographic CFT with U(1)$\times$SU(2) symmetry are analyzed using the simplest holographic action, namely Einstein-Yang-Mills (YM) theory with a negative cosmological constant. This is relevant for both condensed matter and QCD applications. With a U(1) and an "isospin" chemical potential turned on, we determine all possible symmetry breaking patterns, which are associated to the condensation of spin-one order parameters. The possible IR asymptotics of the Einstein-YM solutions are derived analytically, both for 2+1 and 3+1 boundary dimensions. The competing solutions are then computed numerically, both at zero and non-zero temperature, from which the full three-dimensional phase diagram is determined. We find a surface of second order phase transitions that separate uncondensed and condensed phases. In some regions with a large fraction of charged to neutral degrees of freedom, the phase transition becomes first order.</description>

      <title>Probing the Holographic Universe: Aspects of Entanglement Entropy Modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy is crucial for understanding the link between quantum mechanics and information theory. This thesis investigates how energy fluctuations and acceleration affect entanglement entropy through three key scenarios. First, we analyze entanglement between disjoint Rindler observers in de Sitter spacetime. We introduce 1-loop corrections to the partition function of the conformal field theory, disrupting the previously flat entanglement spectrum and resulting in an area law for entanglement entropy, while preserving the finiteness of the Hilbert space. Next, we extend the holographic entanglement entropy framework to field theories with global $U(1)$ symmetry, considering non-linearly charged theories and their thermal and quantum fluctuations. We find that the dual theory experiences spontaneous symmetry breaking and a reduction in the leading-order coefficient of the $\langle TT\rangle$ correlator due to quantum corrections. Using conformal electrodynamics coupled with three-dimensional gravity as an example, we explore a black hole solution and its connection to two-dimensional free bosons. Finally, we investigate three-dimensional accelerating black holes, revealing that increased acceleration reduces the accessible boundary region and, consequently, the entanglement entropy. This suggests a loss of information in the dual theory due to acceleration.</description>

      <title>Investigating 9d/8d non-supersymmetric branes and theories from supersymmetric heterotic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider heterotic string theories in nine and eight dimensions. We identify the disconnected part of the spacetime gauge group by studying the outer automorphism of the charge lattices. The absence of the global symmetry indicates the existence of non-supersymmetric codimension two branes. Moreover, we provide a list of gauge groups and matter contents of non-supersymmetric rank-reduced heterotic string theories (a branch corresponding to the $E_8$ string on $S^1$) from the orbifolding of the outer automorphism as well as the fermion parity. We also provide examples in eight dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JNR ansatz provides a simple formula to obtain families of charge N self-dual SU(2) Yang-Mills instantons in four-dimensional Euclidean space, from the free data of N+1 distinct points with associated positive weights. Here an analogous formula is presented for Skyrme fields in three-dimensional Euclidean space. These families of Skyrme fields include good approximations to a range of Skyrmions, with energies that are typically within a few percent of the numerically computed solutions.</description>

      <title>Extended Generalized Uncertainty Principles, Liouville theorem and density of states: Snyder-De Sitter and Yang models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modifications in quantum mechanical phase space lead to changes in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, these can result in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) or the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP), which introduce quantum gravitational effects at small and large distances, respectively. A combination of GUP and EUP, the Extended Generalized Uncertainty Principle (EGUP or GEUP), further generalizes these modifications by incorporating noncommutativity in both coordinates and momenta. This paper examines the impact of EGUP on the Liouville theorem in statistical physics and density of states within non-relativistic quantum mechanics framework. We find a weighted invariant phase space volume element in the cases of Snyder-de Sitter and Yang models, presenting how EGUP alters the density of states, potentially affecting physical (thermodynamical) properties.</description>

      <title>Hietarinta's classification of $4\times 4$ constant Yang-Baxter operators using algebraic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifying Yang-Baxter operators is an essential first step in the study of the simulation of integrable quantum systems on quantum computers. One of the earliest initiatives was taken by Hietarinta in classifying constant Yang-Baxter solutions for a two-dimensional local Hilbert space (qubit representation). He obtained 11 families of invertible solutions, including the one generated by the permutation operator. While these methods work well for 4 by 4 solutions, they become cumbersome for higher dimensional representations. In this work, we overcome this restriction by constructing the constant Yang-Baxter solutions in a representation independent manner by using ans\"{a}tze from algebraic structures. We use four different algebraic structures that reproduce 10 of the 11 Hietarinta families when the qubit representation is chosen. The methods include a set of commuting operators, Clifford algebras, Temperley-Lieb algebras, and partition algebras. We do not obtain the $(2,2)$ Hietarinta class with these methods.</description>

      <title>Generalized Abel-Plana formula as a renormalization tool in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum field theory the vacuum expectation values of physical observables, bilinear in the field operator, diverge. Among the most important points in the investigations of those expectation values is the regularization of divergent expressions, separation of divergences and the renormalization. In problems with boundaries the expectation values are expressed in the form of the difference of the divergent series and the corresponding integral. In problems with planar boundaries a finite integral representation for that difference is provided by the Abel-Plana summation formula. In the present contribution we consider the generalization of the Abel-Plana formula that allows to obtain similar representations for more general classes of series where the summation goes over the zeros of a given function. Applications are discussed in quantum field theoretical problems with nontrivial spatial topology and curved boundaries.</description>

      <title>Brick Wall in AdS-Schwarzschild Black Hole: Normal Modes and Emerging Thermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the normal modes of a probe scalar field in a five-dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole with the brick wall boundary condition near the horizon. We employ various techniques to compute the spectrum and analyze its properties. Our results reveal a linear dependence of the spectrum on the principal quantum number while demonstrating a non-trivial dependence on the angular momentum quantum number. We compute the Spectral Form Factor (SFF) and find a dip-ramp-plateau structure, with the slope of the ramp approaching unity as the brick wall nears the horizon. We also observe that as the brick wall approaches the horizon, the poles of the retarded Green's function condense on the real line, leading to an emergent thermal behavior in the boundary theory. This work extends previous studies on lower-dimensional black holes to higher dimensions, providing insights into the connection between black hole microstate models and boundary chaos. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussions on the information paradox and the nature of black hole interiors in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics of Random Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal field theories with central charge $c\le1$ on random surfaces have been extensively studied in the past. Here, this discussion is extended from their equilibrium distribution to their critical dynamics. This is motivated by the conjecture that these models describe the time evolution of certain social networks that are self-driven to a critical point. The time evolution of the surface area is identified as a Cox Ingersol Ross process. Planar surfaces shrink, while higher genus surfaces grow until the cosmological constant stops their growth. Three different equilibrium states are distingushed, dominated by (i) small planar surfaces, (ii) large surfaces with high but finite genus, and (iii) foamy surfaces, whose genus diverges. Time variations of the order parameter are analyzed and are found to have generalized hyperbolic distributions. In state (i), those have power law tails with a tail index close to 4. Analogies between the time evolution of the order parameter and a multifractal random walk are also pointed out.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Curvature Corrections in Double Field Theory via Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in the classical Double Copy (DC) procedure have revealed a profound connection between gauge theories and T-duality invariant frameworks, with Double Field Theory (the classical DC of Yang-Mills theory) emerging as the first explicit example. Extending this procedure to higher-derivative gauge theories predicts the existence of a Higher-Derivative Double Theory (HDDT), which incorporates Weyl gravity along with $b$-field and dilaton contributions, all in a T-duality invariant manner. In this work, we show that combining both mappings leads to DFT$+$, a T-duality invariant model related to the bosonic string, incorporating first-order $\alpha'$ corrections upon parameterization. Our results expand the potential applications of the DC program towards constructing perturbative $\alpha'$-corrected Lagrangians, while also opening up possibilities for reversing the map by considering the single and zeroth copies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper represents a continuation of our previous work, where the Bolzmann weights (BWs) for several Interaction-Round-the Face (IRF) lattice models were computed using their relation to rational conformal field theories. Here, we focus on deriving solutions for the Boltzmann weights of the Interaction-Round the Face lattice model, specifically the unrestricted face model, based on the $\mathfrak{su}(3)_k$ affine Lie algebra. The admissibility conditions are defined by the adjoint representation. We find the BWs by determining the quantum $R$ matrix of the $U_q(\mathfrak{sl} (3))$ quantum algebra in the adjoint representation and then applying the so-called Vertex-IRF correspondence. The Vertex-IRF correspondence defines the BWs of IRF models in terms of $R$ matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Constraints, Conserved Charges and Extended BRST Algebra for a 3D Field-Theoretic Example for Hodge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the constraint analysis of a three (2 + 1)-dimensional (3D) field-theoretic example for Hodge theory (i) at the classical level within the ambit of Lagrangian formulation, and (ii) at the quantum level within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism. We derive the conserved charges corresponding to the six continuous symmetries of our present theory. These six continuous summery transformations are the nilpotent (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST symmetries, a unique bosonic symmetry and the ghost-scale symmetry. It turns out that the Noether conserved (anti-)BRST charges are found to be non-nilpotent even though they are derived from the off-shell nilpotent versions of the continuous and infinitesimal (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations. We obtain the nilpotent versions of the (anti-)BRST charges from the non-nilpotent Noether (anti-)BRST charges and discuss the physicality criteria w.r.t. the latter to demonstrate that the operator forms of the first-class constraints (of the classical gauge theory) annihilate the physical states at the quantum level. This observation is consistent with Dirac's quantization conditions for the systems that are endowed with the constraints. We lay emphasis on the existence of a single (anti-)BRST invariant Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restriction in our theory and derive it from various theoretical angles.</description>

      <title>Current density induced by a cosmic string in de Sitter spacetime in the presence of two flat boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the vacuum bosonic current density induced by a carrying-magnetic-flux cosmic string in a $(D+1)$-de Sitter spacetime considering the presence of two flat boundaries perpendicular to it. In this setup, the Robin boundary conditions are imposed on the scalar charged quantum field on the boundaries. The particular cases of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are studied separately. Due to the coupling of the quantum scalar field with the classical gauge field, corresponding to a magnetic flux running along the string's core, a nonzero vacuum expectation value for the current density operator along the azimuthal direction is induced. The two boundaries divide the space in three regions with different properties of the vacuum states. In this way, our main objective is to calculate the induced currents in these three regions. In order to develop this analysis we calculate, for both regions, the positive frequency Wightman functions. Because the vacuum bosonic current in dS space has been investigated before, in this paper we consider only the contributions induced by the boundaries. We show that for each region the azimuthal current densities are odd functions of the magnetic flux along the string. To probe the correctness of our results, we take the particular cases and analyze some asymptotic limits of the parameters of the model. Also some graphs are presented exhibiting the behavior of the current with relevant physical parameter of the system.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary Field Deformations of (Semi-)Symmetric Space Sigma Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the auxiliary field deformations of the principal chiral model (PCM) introduced in arXiv:2405.05899 and arXiv:2407.16338 to sigma models whose target manifolds are symmetric or semi-symmetric spaces, including a Wess-Zumino term in the latter case. This gives rise to a new infinite family of classically integrable $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ coset models of the form which are of interest in applications of integrability to worldsheet string theory and holography. We demonstrate that every theory in this infinite class admits a zero-curvature representation for its equations of motion by exhibiting a Lax connection.</description>

      <title>Mixmasters in Wonderland: Chaotic dynamics from Carroll limits of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Carroll limit of general relativity coupled to matter captures the chaotic mixmaster dynamics of near-singularity limits. Zooming in on the behavior of general relativity close to spacelike singularities reveals rich and solvable ultra-local Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) dynamics, which we show to be captured by a Carroll limit. Specifically, building on recent work on geometric Carroll expansions of general relativity, we establish that leading-order Carroll gravity, with suitable matter coupling, accurately describes well-known cosmological billiards behavior. Since the Carroll limit implements the ultra-local limit off shell, this opens up the door to a wide range of possible tractable applications, including spatially inhomogeneous setups and the emergence of spikes at late times. This further suggests that Carroll gravity, along with its subleading corrections, could serve as a valuable tool for studying deep infrared physics in AdS/CFT.</description>

      <title>A Bottom-Up Approach to Black Hole Microstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:2312.14108, we argued that a sliver at the black hole mass in the Hilbert space of a quantum field theory on an AdS black hole with a stretched horizon, has many desirable features of black hole microstates. A key observation is that the stretched horizon requires a finite Planck length, i.e., finite-$N$. Therefore it is best viewed as a ``quantum horizon" -- a proxy for the UV-complete bulk description, and not directly an element in the bulk EFT. It was shown in arXiv:2312.14108 that despite the manifest absence of the interior, the 2-point function in the sliver is indistinguishable from the smooth horizon correlator, up to the Page time. In this paper, instead of boundary correlators, we work directly in the bulk, and demonstrate the appearance of the bulk Hartle-Hawking correlator in the large-$N$ limit. This is instructive because it shows that the analytic continuation across the horizon is emergent. It is a $bulk$ transition to a Type III algebra and provides a structural distinction between black holes and weakly coupled thermal systems. We also identify a mechanism for universal code subspaces and interior tensor factors to appear via a quantum horizon version of thermal factorization. Our claims apply directly only within a ``Page window", so they are not in immediate tension with firewall arguments. During a Page window, typical heavy microstates probed by light single trace operators respond with effectively smooth horizons in low-point correlators. We work in 2+1 dimensions to be concrete, but expect our results to hold in all higher dimensions. We discuss some important differences between our approach and the conventional fuzzball program, and also argue that probe-notions (like infalling boundary conditions) must be distinguished from microstate-notions (like size of the Einstein-Rosen bridge) to make meaningful statements about post-Page smoothness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fifth force and equivalence principle tests search for new interactions by precisely measuring forces between macroscopic collections of atoms and molecules and their properties under free fall. In contrast, the early Universe plasma probes these interactions at a more fundamental level. In this paper, we consider the case of a scalar mediating a fifth force, and show that the effects of dimensional transmutation, spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the running of the gauge couplings cause the scalar's low-energy interactions to mix, leading to nearly universal dynamics at early times. We use known expressions for the pressure of the Standard Model during its various epochs to compute the scalar effective potential, and find that the cosmological dynamics of this scalar are very sensitive to the reheat temperature of the Universe. Given the unknown reheat temperature, we show that scalar couplings to matter larger than $\sim 10^{-6}(m_\phi/{\rm eV})^{-1/4}$ relative to gravity produce the correct dark matter abundance, motivating new physics searches in this part of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Higher-derivative corrections to the Kerr quasinormal mode spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the most complete analysis so far of quasinormal modes of rotating black holes in a general higher-derivative extension of Einstein's theory. By finding the corrections to the Teukolsky equation and expressing them in a simple form, we are able to apply a generalized continued fraction method that allows us to find the quasinormal mode frequencies including overtones. We obtain the leading-order corrections to the Kerr quasinormal mode frequencies of all the $(l,m,n)$ modes with $l=2,3,4$, $-l\le m\le l$ and $n=0,1,2$, and express them as a function of the black hole spin $\chi$ using polynomial fits. We estimate that our results remain accurate up to spins between $\chi\sim 0.7$ and $\chi\sim 0.95$, depending on the mode. We report that overtones are overall more sensitive to corrections, which is expected from recent literature on this topic. We also discuss the limit of validity of the linear corrections to the quasinormal mode frequencies by estimating the size of nonlinear effects in the higher-derivative couplings. All our results are publicly available in an online repository.</description>

      <title>The renormalized stress-energy tensor for scalar fields in the Boulware state with applications to extremal black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a mode-sum prescription to directly compute the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) for scalar fields in the Boulware vacuum. The method generalizes the recently developed extended coordinate method which was previously only applicable to Hartle-Hawking states. We exhibit the accuracy and efficiency of the method by calculating the RSET in sub-extremal and extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetimes. We find numerical evidence for the regularity of the RSET at the extremal horizon regardless of the field mass and its coupling. We employ our numerical results of the RSET to source the semi-classical Einstein equations, demonstrating that if the RSET is considered as a static perturbation, it will either de-extremalize the black hole, or convert it into a horizonless object.</description>

      <title>On a Solution to the Dirac Equation with a Triangular Potential Well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral anomalies resulting from the breaking of classical symmetries at the quantum level are fundamental to quantum field theory and gaining ever-growing importance in the description of topological materials in condensed matter physics. Here we present analytical solutions of the Dirac equation for massless 3+1 fermions confined to an infinite stripe and placed into a background gauge field forming a triangular potential well across the width of the stripe. Such an effective 1+1 system hosts zero-energy modes resulting in the gauge field-dependent chiral anomaly structure. This problem has a direct relation to a half-bearded graphene nanoribbon placed into an in-plane external electric field and offers it an exact solution in terms of new special functions that are similar but not reducible to Airy functions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational baryogenesis in energy-momentum squared gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of gravitational baryogenesis within the context of a specific modified theory of gravity, namely, energy-momentum squared gravity or $f(R, T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ gravity. In this framework, the gravitational Lagrangian is formulated as a general function of the Ricci scalar $R$ and the self-contraction of the energy-momentum tensor, $\mathcal{T}^2 \equiv T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}$. This approach extends the conventional paradigm of gravitational baryogenesis by introducing new dependencies that allow for a more comprehensive exploration of the baryon asymmetry problem. Our analysis aims to elucidate the role of these gravitational modifications in the generation of baryon asymmetry, a critical issue in cosmology that remains unresolved within the Standard Model of particle physics. By incorporating $\mathcal{T}^2$ into the gravitational action, we propose that these modifications can significantly influence the dynamics of the early universe, thereby altering the conditions under which baryogenesis occurs. This study not only provides a novel depiction of gravitational baryogenesis but also offers insights into how modified gravity theories can address the longstanding question of baryon asymmetry. The implications of our findings suggest that $f(R, T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ gravity could play a crucial role in understanding the fundamental processes that led to the matter-antimatter imbalance observed in the universe today.</description>

      <title>Spin-charge separation for paired Dirac fermions in $(1+1)$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Dirac fermions at finite density coupled to a complex pairing field assumed to obey scalar field theory with quartic self-repulsion. The bulk of our work develops the mathematics that elucidates the propagation of fermionic excitations in such systems as independent spin (boosts) and charge (fermion number) degrees of freedom. A necessary ingredient is the presence of broken $U(1)$ symmetry in the pairing field and decoupling of its density and phase. In the fermion sector, these elements give rise to an emergent spin-dependent gauge coupling which binds in-vacuum spin and charge into elementary fermions, while driving proliferation of unbound spin and charge for finite condensation in the pairing field. Notably, the onset of spin-charge separation is signaled by $\mathcal{P} \mathcal{T}$-symmetry breaking and decoupling of spin components under Lorentz transformations. Our investigation concludes with two theorems that identify generic features of spin-charge separation in such systems.</description>

      <title>Reduction to master integrals and transverse integration identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reduction of Feynman integrals to a basis of linearly independent master integrals is a pivotal step in loop calculations, but also one of the main bottlenecks. In this paper, we assess the impact of using transverse integration identities for the reduction to master integrals. Given an integral family, some of its sectors correspond to diagrams with fewer external legs or to diagrams that can be factorized as products of lower-loop integrals. Using transverse integration identities, i.e. a tensor decomposition in the subspace that is transverse to the external momenta of the diagrams, one can map integrals belonging to such sectors and their subsectors to (products of) integrals belonging to new and simpler integral families, characterized by either fewer generalized denominators, fewer external invariants, fewer loops or combinations thereof. Integral reduction is thus drastically simpler for these new families. We describe a proof-of-concept implementation of the application of transverse integration identities in the context of integral reduction. We include some applications to cutting-edge integral families, showing significant improvements over traditional algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Using the approach derived by Caron-Huot and Gale from the BDMPS-Z formalism, we obtain medium-induced parton splitting rates in a Bjorken expanding QCD matter. We compare the rate with the case of a static medium and investigate the impact of the medium expansion on the splitting rate. We also consider the leading order in the opacity expansion and the harmonic oscillator solution. These approximations are recovered in the limits of small and large formation times, respectively.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry in the Seiberg-Witten Theory: A Window into Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We take supersymmetry in the Seiberg-Witten theory as a case study of the uses of (super)symmetry arguments in studying the ontology of four-dimensional interacting quantum field theories. Together with a double expansion, supersymmetry is a via media that helps to bridge the gap between the ontologies of an exact quantum field theory and its semi-classical limit. We discuss a class of states that exist at any value of the coupling, and whose properties such as mass, electric and magnetic charges, and spin quantum numbers can be precisely characterised at low energies. The low-energy theory is best presented as a one-dimensional complex manifold, equipped with metric and other structures: namely, the space of low-energy vacua, covered by three open regions that are interpreted as macroscopic phases. We discuss two cases of emergence: the emergence of the low-energy regime and the emergence between models at low energies, thereby highlighting the significance of the topology of the space of vacua for such cases of emergence.</description>

      <title>Loop quantum effects on direct detection prediction in two-scalar dark matter scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of quantum corrections on the elastic scattering cross section of dark matter off nucleus in two-scalar dark matter model. Among two extra singlet scalars in two-scalar model, the lighter one is stable and plays the role of dark matter candidate and the heavier one contributes in dark matter coannihilation processes in thermal history of the early universe. It is already known that the two-scalar model at tree level, in spite of the single-scalar dark matter model, can easily evade the bounds from direct detection (DD) experiments. The claim here is that taking into account the loop effects, in some regions of the parameter space, the DM-nucleon cross section becomes larger than the tree level contribution. Therefore, loop effects move the regions which were below the neutrino floor at tree level, up to the regions which are detectable by future DD experiments.</description>

      <title>Partial-wave analysis to determine the spin of $\Xi(1690)^-$ and $\Xi(1820)^-$ produced in $\overline{p}p$ annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04886</link>

Abstract: Recently [arXiv:2201.03852v2] the PANDA collaboration studied the feasibility of determining the spin and parity of the $\Xi(1690)^{-}$and $\Xi(1820)^{-}$ resonances in the $\Lambda K^-$ system produced in $\bar{p}p$ collisions via the reaction channel $\overline{p} p \rightarrow \bar{\Xi}^{+} \Lambda K^{-}$. This contribution aims to study these reactions using a model-independent irreducible tensor formalism developed earlier. This study leads us to identify the partial-wave amplitude, which would be zero if $\Xi(1690)^{-}$ or $\Xi(1820)^{-}$ had spin-1/2, provided these resonances are produced at threshold (s-wave production).</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topology of Black Holes in $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity's Rainbow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topology of black hole thermodynamics is a fascinating area of study that explores the connections between thermodynamic properties and topological features of black holes. This paper has led to several significant findings: We successfully derive the field equations for $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg theory, providing a framework for studying the interplay between modified gravity and non-linear electromagnetic effects. We obtain an analytical solution for a static, spherically symmetric, energy-dependent black hole with constant scalar curvature. Also, our analysis of black holes in F(R)-Euler-Heisenberg gravity's Rainbow reveals significant insights into their topological properties. We identified the total topological charges by examining the normalized field lines along various free parameters. Our findings indicate that the parameters $( R_0 )$ and $( f_{\epsilon} = g_{\epsilon} )$ influence the topological charges. These results are comprehensively summarized in Table I. Additionally, a general overview of Tables II, III, and IV related to the photon sphere of the mentioned black hole reveals that with an increase in $f_{\varepsilon}$, the permissible range of negative $\lambda$ in the first case gradually transitions into a non-permissible region in the third case. On the other hand, it is known that the QED parameter, which measures the strength of nonlinear effects, can be either positive or negative. A positive QED parameter reduces the electric field near the horizon and increases the black hole's mass, whereas a negative QED parameter increases the electric field and decreases the mass. According to the two statements above, it can be concluded that the increase in $f_{\varepsilon}$ actually decreases the strength of the electric field near the horizon and strengthens the effects of gravity.</description>

      <title>The spin correlation of fermion pairs created by a Kerr black hole gravitationalpotential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of massive fermions created and scattered by a rotating Kerr black hole. The helicities of the scattered fermions can vary during propagation. A fermion with a right-handed helicity can become either right or left-handed after interacting with the gravitational potential. This implies that measuring characteristics of an escaping particle is insufficient to reconstruct all the characteristics of its infalling partner. This further means the helicities of a particle pair created by the gravitational potential are not fully entangled. Since spin and helicity share many common features, it is likely that the same is true for spins of spontaneously created particles.</description>

      <title>Dual conformal invariant kinematics and folding of Grassmannian cluster algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum field theory study, Grassmannian manifolds $\text{Gr}(4,n)$ are closely related to $D{=}4$ kinematics input for $n$-particle scattering processes, whose combinatorial and geometrical structures have been widely applied in studying conformal invariant physical theories and their scattering amplitudes. Recently, \cite{HLY21} observed that constraining $D{=}4$ kinematics input to its $D{=}3$ subspace can be interpreted as folding Grassmannian cluster algebras $\mathbb{C}[\text{Gr}(4,n)]$. In this paper, we deduce general expressions for these constraints in terms of Pl\"ucker variables of $\text{Gr}(4,n)$ directly from $D{=}3$ subspace definition, and propose a series of initial quivers for algebra $\mathbb{C}[\text{Gr}(4,n)]$ whose folding conditions exactly meet the constraints, which proves the observation finally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrability equips models of theoretical physics with efficient methods for the exact construction of useful states and their evolution. Relevant tools for classical integrable field models in one spatial dimensional are spectral curves in the case of periodic fields and inverse scattering for asymptotic boundary conditions. Even though the two methods are quite different in many ways, they ought to be related by taking the periodicity length of closed boundary conditions to infinity.
  Using the Korteweg-de Vries equation and the continuous Heisenberg magnet as prototypical classical integrable field models, we discuss and illustrate how data for spectral curves transforms into asymptotic scattering data. In order to gain intuition and also for concreteness, we review how the elliptic states of these models degenerate into solitons at infinite length.</description>

Abstract: Phenomenological aspects of non-invertible symmetries, in particular the flavor structure of quarks and leptons, are studied. We start with a $\mathbb{Z}_M$ discrete symmetry and gauge $\mathbb{Z}_2$ so as to obtain a non-invertible symmetry. We study which Yukawa textures can be derived from the non-invertible symmetries. Various textures can be realized and some of them cannot be realized by a conventional symmetry. For example, the nearest neighbor interaction texture as well as other interesting textures of quarks and leptons are obtained.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of $a_0$, $f_0$, $f_2$, and $K^*_2$ resonances as dynamically generated states of two vector mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-body strong decays of the $f_0(1500)$, $f_0(1710)$, $a_0(1710)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_2'(1525)$, and $K_2^*(1430)$ resonances are investigated, assuming them as dynamically generated states of two vector mesons via $s$-wave interactions. The partial decay widths of all the possible two-body pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson final states are calculated considering the triangular diagrams. It is found that the ratios of branching fractions are similar to the previous results for most channels, which were obtained by using the real-axis method and considering the box diagrams. However, there are also differences. In addition, our focus is on the partial decay widths. More precise experimental measurements are needed to test the model calculations and determine the nature of these scalar and tensor mesons. It is anticipated that the BES\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral3}, Belle\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2} and LHCb collaborations will conduct these measurements in the future.</description>

      <title>Multi-label Classification of Parameter Constraints in BSM Extensions using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shortcomings of the Standard Model (SM) motivate its extension to accommodate new expected phenomena, such as dark matter and neutrino masses. However, such extensions are generally more complex due to the presence of a larger number of free parameters as well as additional phenomenology. Understanding how current theoretical and experimental constraints, individually and collectively, affect the parameter spaces of new models is of utmost importance in achieving testable predictions and targeted model-building that aims to solve certain issues. We present a comprehensive approach of using Deep Learning (DL) for the multi-label classification (MLC) of theoretical and experimental limits on the two-Higgs doublet model augmented by a real singlet (N2HDM), as a representative case. This approach can be generalized to any extension beyond the SM.</description>

      <title>Probing strangeness with event topology classifiers in pp collisions at the LHC with rope hadronization mechanism in PYTHIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the formation of a deconfined and thermalized state of partons, known as quark-gluon plasma, leads to enhanced production of strange hadrons in contrast to proton-proton (pp) collisions, which are taken as baseline. This observation is known as strangeness enhancement in heavy-ion collisions and is considered one of the important signatures that can signify the formation of QGP. However, in addition to strangeness enhancement, recent measurements hint at observing several heavy-ion-like features in high-multiplicity pp collisions at the LHC energies. Alternatively, event shape observables, such as charged particle multiplicity, transverse spherocity, transverse sphericity, charged particle flattenicity, and relative transverse activity classifiers, can fundamentally separate hard interaction-dominated jetty events from soft isotropic events. These features of event shape observables can probe the observed heavy-ion-like features in pp collisions with significantly reduced selection bias and can bring all collision systems on equal footing. In this article, we present an extensive summary of the strange particle ratios to pions as a function of different event classifiers using the PYTHIA~8 model with color reconnection and rope hadronization mechanisms to understand the microscopic origin of strangeness enhancement in pp collisions and also prescribe the applicability of these event classifiers in the context of strangeness enhancement. Charged-particle flattenicity is found to be most suited for the study of strangeness enhancement, and it shows a similar quantitative enhancement as seen for the analysis based on the number of multi-parton interactions.</description>

      <title>Trace Anomaly in Metric-Affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the trace (Weyl) anomaly within a general metric-affine geometry that includes both torsion and nonmetricity. Using the Heat Kernel method and Seeley's algorithm, we compute the Minakshisundaram coefficients for arbitrary spacetimes within this framework, incorporating the effects of the nonmetricity and torsion tensors for the first time. We then determine the corrections to the trace anomaly at one loop for the matter sector in theories invariant under conformal transformation, frame rescaling transformation, and projective transformation. We identify a new anomaly related to hypermomentum, arising from the dilation part mediated by the Weyl component of nonmetricity. As particular cases, we analyze the spin $0$ and spin $1/2$ cases, considering various couplings between matter and the gravitational sector. We demonstrate that invariance under the frame rescaling transformation results in an anomaly in the relationship between the hypermomentum and the stress-energy tensor. In contrast, under the projective transformation, no anomaly is present; specifically, there is no non-zero trace of the hypermomentum tensor in any of our concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Measuring temporal entanglement in experiments as a hallmark for integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel experimental approach to probe many-body quantum systems by developing a protocol to measure generalized temporal entropies. We demonstrate that the recently proposed generalized temporal entropies [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 033021] are equivalent to observing the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a replicated system induced by a double quench protocol using local operators as probes. This equivalence, confirmed through state-of-the-art tensor network simulations for one-dimensional systems, validates the feasibility of measuring generalized temporal entropies experimentally. Our results reveal that the dynamics governed by the transverse field Ising model integrable Hamiltonian differ qualitatively from those driven by the same model with an additional parallel field, breaking integrability. They thus suggest that generalized temporal entropies can serve as a tool for identifying different dynamical classes. This work represents the first practical application of generalized temporal entropy characterization in one-dimensional many-body quantum systems and offers a new pathway for experimentally detecting integrability. We conclude by outlining the experimental requirements for implementing this protocol with state of the art quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a geometrical origin for the Shibata-Sasaki compaction function, which is known to be a reliable indicator of primordial black hole (PBH) formation, at least during radiation domination. We identify it with a compactness function in the static spacetime obtained by removing the cosmological scale factor from the metric in the long-wavelength limit. Furthermore, we discover that it reaches its maximum value of 1/2 at extremal surfaces on the constant-time spacelike hypersurface, which simultaneously are bifurcating trapping horizons and admit circular photon orbits in the static spacetime. Thus, the Shibata-Sasaki compaction function measures how close the positively curved region is to a type II configuration, with extremal surfaces where the value reaches 1/2.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Form Factors of Hadrons from CFT in Momentum Space and the Dilaton in Perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the hard scattering amplitude of the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of hadrons at one-loop, in relation to their conformal field theory (CFT) description, within the framework of QCD factorization for hard exclusive processes at large momentum transfers. These form factors play an essential role in studying the quark and gluon angular momentum of the hadrons due to their relation to the Mellin moments of the Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) invariant amplitudes. Our analysis is performed using a diffeomorphism invariant approach, applying the formalism of the gravitational effective action and conformal symmetry in momentum space for the discussion of the quark and gluon contributions. The interpolating correlator in the hard scattering of any GFF is the non-Abelian $TJJ$ (stress-energy/gluon/gluon) 3-point function at $O(\alpha_s^2)$, revealing an effective dilaton interaction in the $t$-channel due to the trace anomaly, in the form of a massless anomaly pole in the QCD hard scattering, constrained by a sum rule on its spectral density. We investigate the role of quarks, gauge-fixing and ghost contributions in the reconstruction of the hard scattering amplitude mediated by this interaction, performed in terms of its transverse traceless, longitudinal, and trace decomposition, as identified from CFT in momentum space. We present a convenient parameterization of the hard scattering amplitude relevant for future experimental investigations of the DVCS/GFF amplitudes at the Electron-Ion Collider at BNL.\end{abstract}</description>

Abstract: We present a new number theoretic definition of discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFrFT) . In this approach the DFrFT is defined as the $N \times N$ dimensional unitary representation of the generator of the arithmetic rotational group $SO_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_N]$, which is the finite set of $\bmod N$ integer, $2\times 2$ matrices acting on the points of the discrete toroidal phase space lattice $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$, preserving the euclidean distance $\bmod N$.
  We construct explicitly, using techniques of the Finite Quantum Mechanics (FQM), the $p^n$ dimensional unitary matrix representation of the group $SO_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_{p^n}]$ and especially we work out in detail the one which corresponds to the generator. This is our definition of the arithmetic fractional Fourier transform (AFrFT).
  Following this definition, we proceed to the construction of efficient quantum circuits for the AFrFT, on sets of $n$ $p$-dimensional qudits with $p$ a prime integer, by introducing novel quantum subcircuits for diagonal operators with quadratic phases as well as new quantum subcircuits for multipliers by a constant. The quantum subcircuits that we introduce provide a set capable to construct quantum circuits for any element of a more general group, the group of Linear Canonical Transformations (LCT), $SL_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_N]$ of the toroidal phase space lattice. As a byproduct, extensions of the diagonal and multiplier quantum circuits for both the qudit and qubit case are given, which are useful alone in various applications. Also, we analyze the depth, width and gate complexity of the efficient AFrFT quantum circuit and we estimate its gate complexity which is of the order $O(n^2)$, its depth which is of the order $O(n)$ with depth $n$, while at the same time it has a structure permitting local interactions between the qudits.</description>

      <title>Nonabelian Anyon Condenstion in 2+1d topological orders: A String-Net Model Realization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for realizing anyon condensation of topological orders within the string-net model by constructing a Hamiltonian that bridges the parent string-net model before and the child string-net model after anyon condensation. Our approach classifies all possible types of bosonic anyon condensation in any parent string-net model and identifies the basic degrees of freedom in the corresponding child models. Compared with the traditional UMTC perspective of topological orders, our method offers a finer categorical description of anyon condensation at the microscopic level. We also explicitly represent relevant UMTC categorical entities characterizing anyon condensation through our model-based physical quantities, providing practical algorithms for calculating these categorical data.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Gravitational Radiation Reaction: Failed Tail, Memories &amp; Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Schwinger-Keldysh "in-in" effective field theory (EFT) framework, we complete the knowledge of nonlinear gravitational radiation-reaction effects in the (relative) dynamics of binary systems at fifth Post-Newtonian (5PN) order. Diffeomorphism invariance plays a key role guaranteeing that the Ward identities are obeyed (in background-field gauge). Nonlocal-in-time (memory) effects appear in the soft-frequency limit as boundary terms in the effective action, consistently with the loss of (canonical) angular momentum. We identify a conservative sector through Feynman's $i0^+$-prescription. Notably, terms at second order in the (linear) radiation-reaction force also produce conservative-like effects (as we likewise demonstrate in electromagnetism). For the sake of comparison, we derive the ${\cal O}(G^4)$ contribution to the total (even-in-velocity) 5PN relative scattering angle. We find perfect agreement in the overlap with the state of the art in the Post-Minkowskian expansion, both in the conservative and dissipative sectors, resolving the (apparent) discrepancy with previous EFT results. We will return to the full conservative part of the 5PN dynamics elsewhere.</description>

Abstract: The instanton in the Sakai-Sugimoto model corresponds to the Skyrmion on the holographic boundary - which is asymptotically flat - and is fundamentally different from the flat Minkowski space Yang-Mills instanton. We use the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem and a series of transformations to show that there are 6k zeromodes - or moduli - in the limit of infinite 't Hooft coupling of the Sakai-Sugimoto model. The implications for the low-energy baryons - the Skyrmions - on the holographic boundary, is a scale separation between 2k "heavy" massive modes and 6k-9 "light" massive modes for k&gt;1; the 9 global transformations that correspond to translations, rotations and isorotations remain as zeromodes. For k=1 there are 2 "heavy" modes and 6 zeromodes due to degeneracy between rotations and isorotations.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Being Entangled</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nielsen's approach to quantum state complexity relates the minimal number of quantum gates required to prepare a state to the length of geodesics computed with a certain norm on the manifold of unitary transformations. For a bipartite system, we investigate binding complexity, which corresponds to norms in which gates acting on a single subsystem are free of cost. We reduce the problem to the study of geodesics on the manifold of Schmidt coefficients, equipped with an appropriate metric. Binding complexity is closely related to other quantities such as distributed computing and quantum communication complexity, and has a proposed holographic dual in the context of AdS/CFT. For finite dimensional systems with a Riemannian norm, we find an exact relation between binding complexity and the minimal R\'enyi entropy. We also find analytic results for the most commonly used non-Riemannian norm (the so-called $F_1$ norm) and provide lower bounds for the associated notion of state complexity ubiquitous in quantum computation and holography. We argue that our results are valid for a large class of penalty factors assigned to generators acting across the subsystems. We demonstrate that our results can be borrowed to study the usual complexity (not-binding) for a single spin for the case of the $F_1$ norm which was previously lacking from the literature. Finally, we derive bounds for multi-partite binding complexities and the related (continuous) circuit complexity where the circuit contains at most $2$-local interactions.</description>

      <title>One-loop vacuum energy in 10D super-Yang-Mills theory on magnetized tori with/without 4D N=1 supersymmetric completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the behavior of the one-loop vacuum energy of 10 dimensional (10D) super Yang-Mills theory on magnetized tori $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}\times (\mathbb{T}^2)^3$ in the presence of the Abelian magnetic fluxes, including all the contributions from Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes. Higher-dimensional super Yang-Mills action is known to be repackaged in terms of 4D $\mathcal{N}=1$ superfield. We, however, find that such a superspace action differs from the original 10D super Yang-Mills action in the presence of magnetic fluxes. We show that the KK mass spectrum and hence the vacuum energy computed from these two actions differ from each other. In particular, we find that the UV divergence of the vacuum energy based on the original action precisely cancels independently of flux configuration whereas that based on the superspace completion does only when flux configuration preserves supersymmetry, which implies spontaneous or explicit breaking of hidden extended supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearly charging the conformally dressed black holes preserving duality and conformal invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We start this paper by concisely rederiving ModMax, which is nothing but the unique nonlinear extension of Maxwell's equations preserving conformal and duality invariance. The merit of this new derivation is its transparency and simplicity since it is based on an approach where the elusive duality invariance is manifest. In the second part, we couple the ModMax electrodynamics to Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant together with a standard conformal scalar field, and new stationary spacetimes with dyonic charges are found. These solutions are later used as seed configurations to generate nonlinearly charged (super-)renormalizably dressed spacetimes by means of a known generating method that we extend to include any nonlinear conformal electrodynamics. We end by addressing the issue of how to generalize some of these results to include the recently studied non-Noetherian conformal scalar fields, whose equation of motion still enjoys conformal symmetry even though its action does not. It turns out that the static non-Noetherian conformally dressed black holes also become amenable to being charged by ModMax.</description>

      <title>Ground States of Class S Theory on ADE Singularities and dual Chern-Simons theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In radial quantization, the ground states of a gauge theory on ADE singularities $\mathbb{R}^4/\Gamma$ are characterized by flat connections that are maps from $\Gamma$ to the gauge group. We study Class $\mathcal{S}$ theory of type $\mathfrak{a}_1=\mathfrak{su}(2)$ on a Riemann surface of genus $g&gt;1$, without punctures. The fundamental building block of Class $\mathcal{S}$ theory is the trifundamental Trinion theory - a low energy limit of two M5 branes compactified on the three-punctured Riemann sphere. We show, through the superconformal index, that the supersymmetric Casimir energy of the trifundamental theory imposes a constraint on the set of allowed flat connections, which agrees with the prediction of a duality relating the ground state Hilbert space of Class $\mathcal{S}$ on ADE singularities to the Hilbert space of a certain dual Chern-Simons theory whose gauge group is given by the McKay correspondence. The conjecture is shown to hold for $\Gamma=\mathbb{Z}_k$, agreeing with the previous results of Benini et al. and Alday et al. A non-abelian generalization of this duality is analyzed by considering the example of the dicyclic group $\Gamma=\text{Dic}_2$, corresponding to Chern-Simons gauge group SO$(8)$.</description>

Utilizing the expression of the generalized complex structure on the metric Lie group manifold $G$ in terms of operator relations on its Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, we formulate a Yang-Baxter sigma model with a generalized complex structure. Additionally, we present multi-Yang-Baxter sigma models featuring two and three compatible Nijenhuis structures. Examples for each of these models are provided.</description>

      <title>Warped CFT duals of the Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski family of solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the symmetry properties of the complete family of type D spacetimes generalized form the Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solution in four dimensions holographically in terms of a warped CFT. The generalized Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solutions are black hole-like spacetimes characterized by seven physical parameters. Most of the black holes in four dimensions are included within this family. Generically consider a solution with horizon in this family, we figure out the possible warped conformal symmetry attached to the horizon. The horizon can be either extremal or non-extremal. In the extremal case, the near horizon region can be mapped to an infinite spacetime with geometry given by a warped and twist product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$. The new boundary conditions for AdS$_2$ as well as their higher dimensional uplifts are applied here to manifest the asymptotic symmetry as the warped conformal symmetry. In the non-extremal case, the global warped conformal symmetry is singled out by analyzing the scalar wave equation with constant frequency. The local warped conformal symmetries are represented by the charge algebra associated to the vector fields which preserve the scalar wave equation as well as its frequency. In defining the variation of the covariant charges, a proper counterterm is introduced for consistency conditions which is supposed to be suitable for all the solutions within the family. As a consistency check, the horizon entropy is reproduced by the entropy formula of the warped CFT by using its modular covariance and the central terms derived in the bulk spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic excitations play a crucial role in understanding the color confinement of $4$d Yang-Mills theory, and we have the monopole and the center vortex as plausible candidates to explain its mechanism. Under suitable compactified setups of $4$d Yang-Mills theory, we can achieve different weakly-coupled descriptions of confinement phenomena: The monopole mechanism takes place on $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$ with the double-trace deformation, and the center-vortex mechanism is effective on $\mathbb{R}^2\times T^2$ with the 't Hooft flux. We unify these two semiclassical descriptions by showing the explicit relation between the monopole and center vortex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By applying the braneworld model, we investigate the time evolution of two-point functions holographically in expanding universes. In order to explain the FLRW cosmologies, we take into account a $p$-brane gas geometry. When we take the boundary of a $p$-brane gas geometry as the braneworld we are living in, $p$-branes are detected as $(p-1)$-dimensional objects to an observer living in the braneworld. These objects lead to the FLRW cosmology which is related to the radial motion of the braneworld in the $p$-brane gas geometry. Utilizing this $p$-brane gas geometry, we investigate the time-dependent two-point functions of FLRW cosmologies. For $p=4$, we reproduce the known two-point functions of the dS space and find a new analytic two-point function for $p=2$ which corresponds to an expanding universe with uniformly distributed cosmic strings. Moreover, we show that the two-point function suppresses in the late time era with a specific power that is associated with the equation of state parameter of the uniformly distributed matter.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the formulation of horizon symmetries presented in previous literature to include diffeomorphisms that can shift the location of the horizon. In the context of the AdS/CFT duality, we show that horizon symmetries can be interpreted on the boundary as emergent low-energy gauge symmetries. In particular, we identify a new class of horizon symmetries that extend the so-called shift symmetry, which was previously postulated for effective field theories of maximally chaotic systems. Additionally, we comment on the connections of horizon symmetries with bulk calculations of out-of-time-ordered correlation functions and the phenomenon of pole-skipping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the bulk reconstruction of AdS black hole spacetime emergent from quantum entanglement within a machine learning framework. Utilizing neural ordinary differential equations alongside Monte-Carlo integration, we develop a method tailored for continuous training functions to extract the general isotropic bulk metric from entanglement entropy data. To validate our approach, we first apply our machine learning algorithm to holographic entanglement entropy data derived from the Gubser-Rocha and superconductor models, which serve as representative models of strongly coupled matters in holography. Our algorithm successfully extracts the corresponding bulk metrics from these data. Additionally, we extend our methodology to many-body systems by employing entanglement entropy data from a fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling, exemplifying critical one-dimensional systems, and derive the associated bulk metric. We find that the metrics for a tight-binding chain and the Gubser-Rocha model are similar. We speculate this similarity is due to the metallic property of these models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the harmonic superspace approach, we construct, at the linearized level, $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric curvatures generalizing scalar curvature, Ricci curvature and Weyl tensor. These supercurvatures are the building blocks of various linearized $4D, \, \mathcal{N}=2$ Einstein supergravity invariants. The supercurvatures involving the scalar and Ricci curvatures are analytic harmonic ${\cal N}=2$ superfields, while the Weyl supertensor is a chiral $\mathcal{N}=2$ superfield. As the basic distinguished feature of our construction, all these objects are expressed through the fundamental analytic gauge prepotentials $h^{++M}, M= (\alpha\dot\alpha, +\alpha, +\dot\alpha, 5)$. The related characteristic features are the heavy use of harmonic derivatives and harmonic zero-curvature equations. On a number of instructive examples, we describe the component reduction of the superfield invariants constructed.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills extension of the Loop Quantum Gravity-corrected Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we endeavour to build up a non-Abelian formulation to describe the self-interactions of massless vector bosons in the context of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). To accomplish this task, we start off from the modified Maxwell equations with the inclusion of LQG corrections and its corresponding local $U(1)$ gauge invariance. LQG effects in the electromagnetic interactions have significant importance, as they might be adopted to describe the flight time of cosmic photons coming from very high-energy explosions in the Universe, such as events of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). These photons have energy-dependent speeds, indicating that the velocity of light in the vacuum is not constant. To carry out the extension from the Abelian to the non-Abelian scenario, we shall follow the so-called Noether current procedure, which consists in recurrently introducing self-interactions into an initially free action for vector bosons by coupling the latter to the conserved currents of a global symmetry present in the action of departure. In the end of the non-Abelianization process, the initial global symmetry naturally becomes local. Once the Yang-Mills system includes LQG correction terms, it becomes possible to analyze how quantum-gravity induced contributions show up in both the electroweak and the QCD sectors of the Standard Model, providing a set-up for phenomenological investigations that may bring about new elements to discuss Physics beyond the Standard-Model.</description>

      <title>Chaos Bound and its violation in Black p-brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we have extensively investigated the dynamics of circular geodesic (chargeless massive particle) followed by the investigation of the pulsating classical string in the p-brane background. This study is a continuation of our previous work (arXiv:2307.12350v3), in which we numerically identified the presence of chaos for a classical string hovering near generic p-branes ($p &lt; 7$). Here, for a particle probe, we have found evidence of chaos in the vicinity of the horizon. Furthermore, we observed a violation of the well-known MSS bound in specific extremal p-branes; however, no such violation is seen in the non-extremal cases. Similar observations were made for the classical string, where the violation of the bound is significant near the horizon. Thus, our semi-analytical arguments demonstrate that chaotic dynamics in black p-branes exhibit the (generalized) universal bound with notable violations, regardless of whether a particle or classical string is used as a probe.</description>

Abstract: We formulate scalar electrodynamics in the braided $L_\infty$-algebra formalism and study its perturbative expansion in the algebraic framework of Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization. We confirm that UV/IR mixing is absent at one-loop order in this noncommutative field theory, and that the non-anomalous Ward-Takahashi identities for the braided gauge symmetry are satisfied.</description>

      <title>The Dark Dimension and the Grand Unification of Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dark dimension scenario, predicting one extra mesoscopic dimension in the micron range, has emerged by applying various Swampland principles to the dark energy. In this note we find that realizing the grand unification of gauge forces is highly constraining in this context. Without actually constructing any GUT models, we argue that the mere assumption of grand unification of forces in this scenario, together with the experimental bounds on massive replicas of the Standard Model gauge bosons, predicts an upper bound for the GUT scale, $M_{GUT}\lesssim 10^{16}\ {\rm GeV}$. Combined with the experimental bound on the proton lifetime, this predicts that the $X$ gauge boson mediating proton decay is a 5d solitonic string of Planckian tension stretched across a length scale $L\sim ({\rm 1-10\ TeV})^{-1}$ ending on gauge branes of the same diameter $\sim L$. This leads to a mass of $M_X\sim 10^{15}-10^{16}\ {\rm GeV}$. In particular assuming grand unification in the dark dimension scenario results in a tower of Kaluza-Klein excitations of Standard Model gauge bosons on the gauge branes in the 1-10 TeV range. This suggests that the diameter/separation $L$ of the gauge branes correlates with both the weak scale $\sim 1/L$ near a TeV {\it and} the GUT scale $\sim M_5^2 L$ at $10^{16}\ {\rm GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetry Resolution of Entanglement in CFT for Twisted and Anyonic sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comprehensive symmetry resolution of the entanglement entropy (EE) in $(1+1)$-d rational conformal field theories (RCFT) with categorical non-invertible symmetries is presented. This amounts to symmetry resolving the entanglement with respect to the generalized twisted and anyonic charge sectors of the theory. The anyonic sectors label the irreducible representations of a modular fusion category defining the symmetry and can be understood through the $(2+1)$-d symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) that encodes the symmetry features of the CFT. Using this, we define the corresponding generalized boundary dependent charged moments necessary for the symmetry resolution of the entanglement entropy, which is the main result of this work. Furthermore, contrary to the case of invertible symmetries, we observe the breakdown of entanglement equipartition between different charged sectors at the next-to-leading order in the ultraviolet cutoff.</description>

      <title>Bounds on ultralight bosons from the Event Horizon Telescope observation of Sgr A$^*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observation of Sagittarius A$^*$ (Sgr A$^*$) by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration has uncovered various unanswered questions in black hole (BH) physics. Besides, it may also probe various beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios. One of the most profound possibilities is the search for ultralight bosons (ULBs) using BH superradiance (SR). EHT observations imply that Sgr A$^*$ has a non-zero spin. Using this observation, we derive bounds on the mass of ULBs with purely gravitational interactions. Considering self-interacting ultralight axions, we constrain new regions in the parameter space of decay constant, for a certain spin of Sgr A$^*$. Future observations of various spinning BHs can improve the present constraints on ULBs.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Quantum Particle Statistics: Bosons, Fermions, and Transtatistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identical quantum particles exhibit only two types of statistics: bosonic and fermionic. Theoretically, this restriction is commonly established through the symmetrization postulate or (anti)commutation constraints imposed on the algebra of creation and annihilation operators. The physical motivation for these axioms remains poorly understood, leading to various generalizations by modifying the mathematical formalism in somewhat arbitrary ways. In this work, we take an opposing route and classify quantum particle statistics based on operationally well-motivated assumptions. Specifically, we consider that a) the standard (complex) unitary dynamics defines the set of single-particle transformations, and b) phase transformations act locally in the space of multi-particle systems. We develop a complete characterization, which includes bosons and fermions as basic statistics with minimal symmetry. Interestingly, we have discovered whole families of novel statistics (dubbed transtatistics) accompanied by hidden symmetries, generic degeneracy of ground states, and spontaneous symmetry breaking -- effects that are (typically) absent in ordinary statistics.</description>

Abstract: Unlike a single Carroll particle, a multiparticle Carroll system can move under suitable conditions, as we demonstrate it explicitly for two particles with a momentum-dependent interaction: the center-of-mass remains fixed, however relative motion is possible, confirming previous statements made by Bergshoeff, Casalbuoni, and their collaborators. Analogous results are obtained for electric dipoles with the roles of the center-of-mass and the relative position interchanged.</description>

      <title>The Ontology of Compositeness Within Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we attempt to define a notion of compositeness compatible with Quantum Field Theory. Considering the analytic properties of the S-matrix, we conclude that there is no satisfactory definition of compositeness compatible with Quantum Field Theory. Without this notion, one must claim that all bound states are equally fundamental, that is, one cannot rigorously claim that everyday objects are made of atoms or that atoms are made of protons and neutrons. I then show how an approximate notion of compositeness may be recovered in the regime where the mass of a bound state is close to a multi-particle threshold.
  Finally, we see that rejecting compositeness solves several of the "problems of everyday objects" encountered in an undergraduate metaphysics course.</description>

      <title>Analytic solutions for the motion of spinning particles near spherically symmetric black holes and exotic compact objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapidly rotating bodies moving in curved space-time experience the so-called spin-curvature force, which becomes important for the motion of compact objects in gravitational-wave inspirals. As a first approximation, this effect is captured in the motion of a spinning test particle. We solve the equations motion of a spinning particle to leading order in spin in arbitrary static and spherically symmetric space-times in terms of one-dimensional closed-form integrals. This solves the problem and proves its integrability in a wide range of modified gravities and near exotic compact objects. Then, by specializing to the case of bound orbits in Schwarzschild space-time, we demonstrate how to express the solution in the form of Jacobi elliptic functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study higher dimensional charged Kerr-Schild (KS) spacetimes that can be constructed by a KS transformation of a vacuum solution with an arbitrary cosmological constant, and for which the vector potential is aligned with the KS vector $\mathbf{k}$. Focusing on the case of an expanding $\mathbf{k}$, we first characterize the presence of shear as an obstruction to non-null fields (thereby extending an early no-go result of Myers and Perry). We next obtain the complete family of shearfree solutions. In the twistfree case, they coincide with charged Schwarzschild-Tangherlini-like black holes. Solutions with a twisting $\mathbf{k}$ consist of a four-parameter family of higher dimensional charged Taub-NUT metrics with a base space of constant holomorphic sectional curvature. In passing, we identify the configurations for which the test-field limit gives rise to instances of the KS double copy. Finally, it is shown that null fields define a branch of twistfree but shearing solutions, exemplified by the product of a Vaidya-like radiating spacetime with an extra dimension.</description>

Abstract: Using the spherical collapse approach, we investigate the impact of two alternative dark matter models, each characterized by distinct non-zero equations of state, one constant and the other time dependent on the nonlinear regime. Specifically, we compare these models to standard cold dark matter (CDM) by analyzing their influence on the linear density threshold for nonrelativistic component collapse and virial overdensity. Additionally, we explore the number count of collapsed objects, or dark matter halos, analogous to the number count of galaxy clusters. Finally, in light of recent discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), indicating the potential for more efficient early galaxy formation at higher redshifts, we investigate how alternative dark matter assumptions can enhance structure formation efficiency during the early universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Schwinger model is one of the simplest gauge theories. It is known that a topological term of the model leads to the infamous sign problem in the classical Monte Carlo method. In contrast to this, recently, quantum computing in Hamiltonian formalism has gained attention. In this work, we estimate the resources needed for quantum computers to compute physical quantities that are challenging to compute on classical computers. Specifically, we propose an efficient implementation of block-encoding of the Schwinger model Hamiltonian. Considering the structure of the Hamiltonian, this block-encoding with a normalization factor of $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ can be implemented using $\mathcal{O}(N+\log^2(N/\varepsilon))$ T gates. As an end-to-end application, we compute the vacuum persistence amplitude. As a result, we found that for a system size $N=128$ and an additive error $\varepsilon=0.01$, with an evolution time $t$ and a lattice spacing a satisfying $t/2a=10$, the vacuum persistence amplitude can be calculated using about $10^{13}$ T gates. Our results provide insights into predictions about the performance of quantum computers in the FTQC and early FTQC era, clarifying the challenges in solving meaningful problems within a realistic timeframe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical reconstruction techniques are widely employed in the calculation of multi-loop scattering amplitudes. In recent years, it has been observed that the rational functions in multi-loop calculations greatly simplify under partial fractioning. In this article, we present a technique to reconstruct rational functions directly in partial-fractioned form, by evaluating the functions at special integer points chosen for their properties under a p-adic metric. As an application, we apply this technique to reconstruct the largest rational function in the integration-by-parts reduction of one of the rank-5 integrals appearing in 2-loop 5-point full-colour massless amplitude calculations in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The number of required numerical probes (per prime field) is found to be around 25 times smaller than in conventional techniques, and the obtained result is 130 times smaller. The reconstructed result displays signs of additional structure that could be used to further reduce its size and the number of required probes.</description>

      <title>Exploring Stability of f(Q,B) gravity via Dynamical System Approach: a Comprehensive Bayesian Statistical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our work investigates the cosmological stability of $f(Q, B)$ gravity by employing a dynamical system approach, where $Q$ is the nonmetricity scalar that plays the role of gravity, and $B$ is the boundary term. In the phase space, the model parameters of $f(Q, B)$ are determined using a Bayesian statistical analysis via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, incorporating numerical solutions and observational data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), the extended Pantheon+ dataset, and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements. We identified a stable critical point within the dynamical system of the model, corresponding to the de Sitter phase. This observation is consistent with current data, indicating a Universe dominated by dark energy (DE) and undergoing late-time accelerated expansion. Furthermore, we explore the cosmological implications of $f(Q, B)$ gravity, which suggest both deceleration and Equation of State (EoS) parameters show a smooth transition from deceleration to an accelerating expansion phase in the evolution of the Universe. Finally, we claimed the $f(Q, B)$ model is compared with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, demonstrating its potential as a viable alternative cosmological framework.</description>

      <title>New look at AdS black holes with conformal scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit static, spherically symmetric solutions to AdS-Einstein gravity with a conformally coupled scalar field (and no self-interaction potential) in four dimensions. We first observe that a convenient choice of coordinates leads to a significant simplification of the field equations, which enables one to identify various roots of the indicial equations and thus distinct branches of solutions. Next, we construct an explicit 2-parameter hairy black hole solution in terms of an infinite power series around the event horizon. The black hole is non-extremal with a regular scalar field on and outside the event horizon, and it reduces to the Schwarzschild-AdS metric in the limit of vanishing hair. Its properties are illustrated for various values of the parameters and compared with previous numerical results by other authors. In addition, the analysis reveals the presence of a photon sphere and how the scalar field affects its size and the angular radius of the corresponding shadow. The thermodynamics of the solution is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing Massive Fields with Multi-Band Gravitational-Wave Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the prospect of probing massive fields and testing gravitational theories with multiband observations of gravitational waves emitted from coalescing compact binaries. Focusing on the dipole radiation induced by a massive field, we show that multiband observations can probe the field with mass ranging from $10^{-16} $ to $10^{-15} {\rm eV}$, a parameter space that cannot be probed by the millihertz band observations alone. Multiband observations can also improve the constraints obtained with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binaries by at most 3 orders of magnitude in the mass range. Moreover, we show that multiband observations can discriminate the spin of the field, which cannot be identified with single-band observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a detailed canonical analysis of the $n$-dimensional $f$(Riemann) gravity, correcting the earlier results in the literature. We also write the field equations in the Fischer-Marsden form which is amenable to identifying the non-stationary energy on a spacelike hypersurface.

      <title>Spontaneous CP violation and partially broken modular flavor symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the realization of spontaneous CP violation through moduli stabilization. In modular flavor models, the source of CP violation is the vacuum expectation values of the complex structure moduli of toroidal compact space. We demonstrate that the combined effects of Type IIB flux compactifications with modular invariant couplings between the moduli and matter fields can induce spontaneous CP violation without or with supersymmetry breaking. Furthermore, some general properties of CP and modular invariant scalar potentials are presented. It is found that certain modifications or partial breakings of modular symmetry are useful in generating spontaneous CP violation.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how out-of-equilibrium states thermalize under quantum unitary dynamics is an important problem in many-body physics. In this work, we propose a statistical ansatz for the matrix elements of non-equilibrium initial states in the energy eigenbasis, in order to describe such evolution. The approach is inspired by the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis (ETH) but the proposed ansatz exhibits different scaling. Importantly, we point out the exponentially small cross-correlations between the observable and the initial state matrix elements that determine relaxation dynamics toward equilibrium. We numerically verify scaling and cross-correlation, point out the emergent universality of the high-frequency behavior, and outline possible generalizations.</description>

      <title>Influence of thermal bath on Pancharatnam-Berry phase in an accelerated frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A uniformly accelerated atom captures Pancharatnam-Berry phase in its quantum state and the phase factor depends on the vacuum fluctuation of the background quantum fields. We observe that the thermal nature of the fields further affects the induced phase. Interestingly the induced phase captures the exchange symmetry between the Unruh and real thermal baths. This observation further supports the claim that the Unruh thermal bath mimics a real thermal bath. Moreover for certain values of system parameters and at high temperature, the phase is enhanced compared to zero temperature situation. However the required temperature to observe the phase experimentally is so high that the detection of Unruh effect through this is not possible within the current technology.</description>

      <title>Searching for cosmic strings via black hole spin-down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings that are attached to rapidly spinning black holes can extract significant amounts of rotational energy and angular momentum. Here we study the effect on primordial black holes, which are expected to form with one or more cosmic strings attached. Although large primordial black holes are predicted to rapidly spin up due to accretion soon after forming, we argue that cosmic strings will spin them down again. We show that if there are cosmic strings with tension greater than $10^{-20}$, the spins of large primordial black holes of mass greater than $30 M_\odot$ should consequently be observed to be near zero. We also investigate the effect on a supermassive black hole of capturing a cosmic string and the possibility of observing the subsequent spin down by its effect on a pulsar orbiting the black hole.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love numbers and Green's functions in black hole spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal interactions play a crucial role in deciphering gravitational wave signals emitted by the coalescence of binary systems. They are usually quantified by a set of complex coefficients which include tidal Love numbers, describing the conservative response to an external perturbation. In the static case, these are found to vanish exactly for asymptotically flat black holes in general relativity in four spacetime dimensions, and recently they have been generalized to dynamical interactions. In the context of response theory, the retarded Green's function provides the complete description of the behavior of dynamical systems. In this work we investigate the relation between Love numbers and Green's functions, and highlight the relevance of radiation reaction effects to their connection. As a special case, we discuss Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black holes, where the absence of radiative modes allows us to make a direct link between them.</description>

      <title>Random matrix universality in dynamical correlation functions at late times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of two-time correlation functions at late times for finite system sizes considering observables whose (one-point) average value does not depend on energy. In the long time limit, we show that such correlation functions display a ramp and a plateau determined by the correlations of energy levels, similar to what is already known for the spectral form factor. The plateau value is determined, in absence of degenerate energy levels, by the fluctuations of diagonal matrix elements, which highlights differences between different symmetry classes. We show this behavior analytically by employing results from Random Matrix Theory and the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis, and numerically by exact diagonalization in the toy example of a Hamiltonian drawn from a Random Matrix ensemble and in a more realistic example of disordered spin glasses at high temperature. Importantly, correlation functions in the ramp regime do not show self-averaging behaviour, and, at difference with the spectral form factor the time average does not coincide with the ensemble average.</description>

      <title>Fermi Machine -- Quantum Many-Body Solver Derived from Correspondence between Noninteracting and Strongly Correlated Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stimulated by the successful descriptions of strongly correlated electron systems by fractionalized fermions, correspondence between interacting fermions and non-interacting multi-component fermions is formulated in examples of the Hubbard model. The formalism enables constructions of the neural network for a quantum many-body solver represented by coupled noninteracting fermions. After showing the exact correspondence of 1- and 2-site Hubbard model to two-component noninteracting fermions, numerical algorithm of the quantum machine learning for the Hubbard model is proposed. Benchmark for the 4-site systems is successfully presented and promising future directions as well as implications are discussed.</description>

Abstract: For different cohomology theories (including the Hochschild homology, Hodge cohomology, and Chow groups), we identify the cohomology of moduli space of rank 1 perverse coherent sheaves on the blow-up of a surface by Nakajima-Yoshioka as the tensor product of cohomology of Hilbert schemes with a Fermionic Fock space. As the stable limit, we identify the cohomology of Hilbert schemes of blow-up of a surface as the tensor product of cohomology of Hilbert schemes on the surface with a Bosonic Fock space. The actions of the infinite-dimensional Clifford algebra and Heisenberg algebra are all given by geometric correspondences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08094v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We survey elementary features of Lovelock gravity and its maximally symmetric vacuum solutions. The latter is solely determined by the real roots of a dimension-dependent polynomial. We also recover the static spherically symmetric (black hole) solutions of Lovelock gravity using Palais' symmetric criticality principle. We show how to linearize the generic field equations of Lovelock models about a given maximally symmetric vacuum, which turns out to factorize into the product of yet another dimension-dependent polynomial and the linearized Einstein tensor about the relevant background. We also describe how to compute conserved charges using linearized field equations along with the relevant background Killing isometries. We further describe and discuss the special vacua which are defined by the simultaneous vanishing of the aforementioned polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of high-energy events can take place in the seconds leading up to a binary neutron-star merger. Mechanisms involving tidal resonances, electrodynamic interactions, or shocks in mass-loaded wakes have been proposed as instigators of these precursors. With a view of gravitational-wave and multimessenger astrophysics more broadly, premerger observations and theory are reviewed emphasising how gamma-ray precursors and dynamical tides can constrain the neutron-star equation of state, thermodynamic microphysics, and evolutionary pathways. Connections to post-merger phenomena, notably gamma-ray bursts, are discussed together with how magnetic fields, spin and misalignment, crustal elasticity, and stratification gradients impact observables.</description>

      <title>Bound states of massive complex ghosts in superrenormalizable quantum gravity theories\</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the remarkable differences between renormalizable quantum gravity with four-derivative action and its superrenormalizable polynomial generalizations is that the latter admit a more sophisticated particle mass spectrum. Already in the simplest superrenormalizable case, the theory has a six-derivative Lagrangian, admitting either a real or complex spectrum of masses. In the case of a real spectrum, there are the graviton, massive unphysical ghosts, and normal particles with masses exceeding the ones of the ghosts. It is also possible to have pairs of complex conjugate massive ghost-like particles. We show that in both cases, these theories do not admit a K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation and do not satisfy the positivity criterium of consistency in terms of the fields associated to those particles. In the main part of the work, using a relatively simple Euclidean scalar toy model, we show that the theory with complex spectrum forms bound states confining unphysical massive excitations into a normal composite particle. Finally, we discuss the cosmological implications of such a ghost confinement.</description>
