      <title>Momentum transfer and foam production via breaking waves in hurricane conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generated under hurricane conditions, a slip layer composed of foam, bubble emulsion, and spray determines the behavior of the surface drag with wind speed. This study enables us to estimate foam's contribution to this behavior. A logarithmic parametrization of surface drag is introduced, wherein the effective roughness length of the underlying surface is decomposed into three fractional roughness lengths. These correspond to the foam-free area (as determined by laboratory data, which includes the effects of spray and bubble emulsion) and ocean areas covered by whitecaps and streaks, each weighted by their respective coverage coefficients. A key concept of this approach is the use of well-established experimental bubble-size spectra produced by breaking surface waves to obtain the effective roughness length. This method provides a fair correlation of the logarithmic parametrization of surface drag against wind speed with a wide class of respective experimental data. Additionally, this approach estimates the hurricane's potential intensity, demonstrating reasonable agreement with experimental findings.</description>

      <title>A machine-learning approach to thunderstorm forecasting through post-processing of simulation data</title>

Abstract: Thunderstorms pose a major hazard to society and economy, which calls for reliable thunderstorm forecasts. In this work, we introduce a Signature-based Approach of identifying Lightning Activity using MAchine learning (SALAMA), a feedforward neural network model for identifying thunderstorm occurrence in numerical weather prediction (NWP) data. The model is trained on convection-resolving ensemble forecasts over Central Europe and lightning observations. Given only a set of pixel-wise input parameters that are extracted from NWP data and related to thunderstorm development, SALAMA infers the probability of thunderstorm occurrence in a reliably calibrated manner. For lead times up to eleven hours, we find a forecast skill superior to classification based only on NWP reflectivity. Varying the spatiotemporal criteria by which we associate lightning observations with NWP data, we show that the time scale for skillful thunderstorm predictions increases linearly with the spatial scale of the forecast.</description>

      <title>3D-Var Data Assimilation using a Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data assimilation of atmospheric observations traditionally relies on variational and Kalman filter methods. Here, an alternative neural-network data assimilation (NNDA) with variational autoencoder (VAE) is proposed. The three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) data assimilation cost function is utilised to determine the analysis that optimally fuses simulated observations and the encoded short-range persistence forecast (background), accounting for their errors. The minimisation is performed in the reduced-order latent space, discovered by the VAE. The variational problem is auto-differentiable, simplifying the computation of the cost function gradient necessary for efficient minimisation. We demonstrate that the background-error covariance ($\mathbf{B}$) matrix measured and represented in the latent space is quasi-diagonal. The background-error covariances in the grid-point space are flow-dependent, evolving seasonally and depending on the current state of the atmosphere. Data assimilation experiments with a single temperature observation in the lower troposphere indicate that the $\mathbf{B}$-matrix simultaneously describes both tropical and extratropical background-error covariances.</description>
