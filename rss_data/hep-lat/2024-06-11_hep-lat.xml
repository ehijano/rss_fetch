      <title>New ideas in nonperturbative QCD -- I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent development of the Field Correlator Method (FCM) is discussed, with applications to the most interesting areas of QCD physics obtained in the lattice data and experiment. These areas include: a) the connection of colorelectric confinement with the basic quark and gluon condensates; b) the explicit form of the colorelectric deconfinement at a growing temperature $T$; c) the theory of the colormagnetic confinement at all temperatures; d) the theory of strong decays, the theory of pdf and jets in the instantaneous formalism with confinement. We demonstrate that the FCM with instantaneous formalism and confinement (instead of the light cone formalism and pure perturbation theory) can provide the way to the theory of QCD, which helps to describe world data without phenomenological parameters.</description>

      <title>The matrix model of two-color one-flavor QCD: The ultra-strong coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using variational methods, we numerically investigate the matrix model for the two-color QCD coupled to a single quark (matrix-QCD$_{2,1}$) in the limit of ultra-strong Yang-Mills coupling ($g =\infty$). The spectrum of the model has superselection sectors labelled by baryon number $B$ and spin $J$. We study sectors with $B=0,1,2$ and $J=0,1$, which may be organized as mesons, (anti-)diquarks and (anti-)tetraquarks. For each of these sectors, we study the properties of the respective ground states in both chiral and heavy quark limits, and uncover a rich quantum phase transition (QPT) structure. We also investigate the division of the total spin between the glue and the quark and show that glue contribution is significant for several of these sectors. For the $(B,J)=(0,0)$ sector, we find that the dominant glue contribution to the ground state comes from reducible connections. Finally, in the presence of non-trivial baryon chemical potential $\mu$, we construct the phase diagram of the model. For sufficiently large $\mu$, we find that the ground state of the theory may have non-zero spin.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi entanglement entropy of spin chain with Generative Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a method to estimate R\'enyi entanglement entropy of a spin system, which is based on the replica trick and generative neural networks with explicit probability estimation. It can be extended to any spin system or lattice field theory. We demonstrate our method on a one-dimensional quantum Ising spin chain. As the generative model, we use a hierarchy of autoregressive networks, allowing us to simulate up to 32 spins. We calculate the second R\'enyi entropy and its derivative and cross-check our results with the numerical evaluation of entropy and results available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Study of topological quantities of lattice QCD with a modified Wasserstein generative adversarial network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a modified Wasserstein generative adversarial network (M-WGAN) to study the distribution of the topological charge in lattice QCD based on Monte Carlo simulations. We construct new generator and discriminator in M-WGAN to support the generation of high-quality distribution. Our results show that the M-WGAN scheme of machine learning should be helpful for us to calculate efficiently the 1D distribution of topological charge compared with the method by the MC simulation alone.</description>

      <title>Inclusive hadronic decay rate of the $\tau$ lepton from lattice QCD: the $\bar u s$ flavour channel and the Cabibbo angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a lattice determination of the inclusive decay rate of the process $\tau\mapsto X_{us} \nu_\tau$ in which the $\tau$ lepton decays into a generic hadronic state $X_{us}$ with $\bar u s$ flavour quantum numbers. Our results have been obtained in $n_f=2+1+1$ iso-symmetric QCD with full non-perturbative accuracy, without any OPE approximation and, except for the presently missing long-distance isospin-breaking corrections, include a solid estimate of all sources of theoretical uncertainties. This has been possible by using the Hansen-Lupo-Tantalo method [1] that we have already successfully applied in [2] to compute the inclusive decay rate of the process $\tau\mapsto X_{ud} \nu_\tau$ in the $\bar u d$ flavour channel. By combining our first-principles theoretical results with the presently-available experimental data we extract the CKM matrix element $\vert V_{us}\vert$, the Cabibbo angle, with a $0.9$\% accuracy, dominated by the experimental error.</description>

Abstract: We consider the discretized version of the sigma-model with supersphere target space $OSp(N+2m|2m)/OSp(N+2m-1|2m)$ and present a preliminary numerical study of bosonic and fermionic two-point functions for the cases $OSp(3|2)$ and $OSp(5|2)$. We observe consistency with the expectations of this supersymmetric setup and discuss the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Primary and Secondary Order Parameters in the Fully Frustrated Transverse Field Ising Model on the Square Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field-theory arguments, we study the fully frustrated (Villain) transverse-field Ising model on the square lattice. We consider a "primary" spin order parameter and a "secondary" dimer order parameter, which both lead to the same phase diagram but detect $Z_8$ and $Z_4$ symmetry, respectively. The spin order scales with conventional exponents, both in the finite temperature critical phase and at the $T = 0$ quantum critical point. The scaling of the dimer order requires more detailed investigations of the applicable low-energy theories; the height model at $T &gt; 0$ and the $O(2)$ model in 2+1 dimensions at $T = 0$. Relating the order parameters to operators in these effective models, we predict the secondary critical exponents and confirm them numerically. The relationships between the primary and secondary order parameters have not been previously discussed in this context and provide insight more broadly for Ising models whose low-energy physics involves dimer degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Strategies for simulating time evolution of Hamiltonian lattice field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating the time evolution of quantum field theories given some Hamiltonian $H$ requires developing algorithms for implementing the unitary operator e^{-iHt}. A variety of techniques exist that accomplish this task, with the most common technique used so far being Trotterization, which is a special case of the application of a product formula. However, other techniques exist that promise better asymptotic scaling in certain parameters of the theory being simulated, the most efficient of which are based on the concept of block encoding.
  In this work we study the performance of such algorithms in simulating lattice field theories. We derive and compare the asymptotic gate complexities of several commonly used simulation techniques in application to Hamiltonian Lattice Field Theories. Using the scalar \phi^4 theory as a test, we also perform numerical studies and compare the gate costs required by Product Formulas and Signal Processing based techniques to simulate time evolution. For the latter, we use the the Linear Combination of Unitaries construction augmented with the Quantum Fourier Transform circuit to switch between the field and momentum eigenbases, which leads to immediate order-of-magnitude improvement in the cost of preparing the block encoding.
  The paper also includes a pedagogical review of utilized techniques, in particular Product Formulas, LCU, Qubitization, QSP, as well as a technique we call HHKL based on its inventors' names.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic properties of vector doubly charmed tetraquark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic study of the electromagnetic properties of multiquark systems with undetermined internal structures. Motivated by the recent observation of the $T_{cc}^+$ state, we apply the light-cone version of the QCD sum rule method to extract the magnetic dipole moments of several possible doubly-charmed vector tetraquark states. When analyzing the magnetic dipole moment of these states, they are modeled to have the diquark-antidiquark configurations. The magnetic dipole moments for the members are extracted as $ \mu_{T_{cc \bar{u} \bar{d}}} = 1.17^{+0.44}_{-0.32} \, \mu_N$, $ \mu_{T_{cc \bar{u} \bar{s}}} = 1.35^{+0.50}_{-0.37} \, \mu_N$, $ \mu_{T_{cc \bar{d} \bar{s}}} = -2.69^{+1.02}_{-0.75} \, \mu_N$, $ \mu_{T_{cc \bar{u} \bar{u}}} = 1.33^{+0.56}_{-0.40} \, \mu_N$, $ \mu_{T_{cc \bar{d} \bar{d}}} = 1.41^{+0.57}_{-0.43} \, \mu_N$ and $ \mu_{T_{cc \bar{s} \bar{s}}} = 1.44^{+0.53}_{-0.41} \, \mu_N$. Comparing the results obtained for the magnetic dipole moments of the $T_{cc \bar{u} \bar{d}}$ state with the $T_{cc \bar{u} \bar{s}}$ state, the $U$-symmetry is seen to be broken at about $\%15$, while for the $T_{cc \bar{d} \bar{d}}$ and $T_{cc \bar{s} \bar{s}}$ states, this symmetry is minimally broken. The obtained results may be useful to determine the true nature of these new interesting states.</description>

      <title>Properties of the ground and excited states of triply heavy spin-1/2 baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14348v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the triply heavy spin-1/2 baryons with quark contents $ ccb $ and $ bbc $, and calculate their mass and residue using QCD sum rules. In the calculations, we consider the ground (1S), first orbitally excited (1P) and first radially excited (2S) states. Aiming to achieve higher accuracies in the results, we perform the computations by taking into account the non-perturbative operators up to eight mass dimensions. We compare our results with the predictions of other theoretical studies existing in the literature. The obtained results may help experimental groups in their search for these yet unseen, but previously predicted by the quark model, interesting particles.</description>

      <title>Duality transformations and the entanglement entropy of gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of entanglement in gauge theories is expected to provide insights into many fundamental phenomena, including confinement. However, calculations of quantities related to entanglement in gauge theories are limited by ambiguities that stem from the non-factorizability of the Hilbert space. In this work we study lattice gauge theories that admit a dual description in terms of spin models, for which the replica trick and R\'enyi entropies are well defined. In the first part of this work, we explicitly perform the duality transformation in a replica geometry, deriving the structure of a replica space for a gauge theory. Then, in the second part, we calculate, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, the entropic c-function of the $\Z_2$ gauge theory in three spacetime dimensions, exploiting its dual description in terms of the three-dimensional Ising model.</description>

      <title>Defining the type IIB matrix model without breaking Lorentz symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The type IIB matrix model is a promising nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory, which may elucidate the emergence of (3+1)-dimensional space-time. However, the partition function is divergent due to the Lorentz symmetry, which is represented by a noncompact group. This divergence has been regularized conventionally by introducing some infrared cutoff, which breaks the Lorentz symmetry. Here we point out that Lorentz invariant observables become classical as one removes the infrared cutoff and that this "classicalization" is actually an artifact of the Lorentz symmetry breaking cutoff. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a natural way to "gauge-fix" the Lorentz symmetry in a fully nonperturbative manner. This also enables us to perform numerical simulations in such a way that the time-evolution can be extracted directly from the matrix configurations.</description>
