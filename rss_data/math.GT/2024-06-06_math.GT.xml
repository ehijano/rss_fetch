      <title>Classification of generalized torsion elements of order two in 3-manifold groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group and $g$ a non-trivial element in $G$. If some non-empty finite product of conjugates of $g$ equals to the identity, then $g$ is called a generalized torsion element. The minimum number of conjugates in such a product is called the order of $g$. We will classify $3$-manifolds $M$, each of whose fundamental group has a generalized torsion element of order two. Furthermore, we will classify such elements in $\pi_1(M)$. We also prove that $R$-group and $\overline{R}$-group coincide for $3$-manifold groups, and classify $3$-manifold groups which are $R$-groups (and hence $\overline{R}$-groups).</description>

      <title>Constructing embedded surfaces for cellular embeddings of leveled spatial graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding a closed orientable surface $\mathcal{S}$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ where a given spatial graph $\mathcal{G} \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ cellular embeds is in general not possible. We therefore restrict our interest to the special class of spatial graphs that are leveled. We show that for leveled spatial graphs with a small number of levels, a surface $\mathcal{S}$ can always be found. The argument is based on the idea of decomposing $\mathcal{G}$ into subgraphs that can be placed on a sphere and on handles that are attached to the sphere, together forming an embedding of $\mathcal{G}$ in $\mathcal{S}$. We generalize the procedure to an algorithm that, if successful, constructs $\mathcal{S}$ for leveled spatial graphs with any number of levels. We conjecture that all connected leveled embeddings can be cellular embedded with the presented algorithm.</description>

      <title>On the Legendrian realisation of parametric families of knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the natural inclusion of the space of Legendrian embeddings in $(\mathbb{S}^3,\xi_{\operatorname{std}})$ into the space of smooth embeddings from a homotopical viewpoint.
  T. K\'alm\'an posed in [Kal] the open question of whether for every fixed knot type $\mathcal{K}$ and Legendrian representative $\mathcal{L}$, the homomorphism $\pi_1(\mathcal{L})\to\pi_1(\mathcal{K})$ is surjective. We positively answer this question for infinitely many knot types $\mathcal{K}$ in the three main families (hyperbolic, torus and satellites) and every stabilised Legendrian representative in $(\mathbb{S}^3,\xi_{\operatorname{std}})$.
  We then show that for every $n\geq 3$, the homomorphisms $\pi_n(\mathcal{L})\to\pi_n(\mathcal{K})$ and $\pi_n(\mathcal{FL})\to\pi_n(\mathcal{K})$ are never surjective for any knot type $\mathcal K$, Legendrian representative $\mathcal L$ or formal Legendrian representative $\mathcal{FL}$. This shows the existence of rigidity at every higher-homotopy level beyond $\pi_3$. For completeness, we also show that surjectivity at the $\pi_2$-level depends on the smooth knot type.</description>

      <title>Invariant quasimorphisms and generalized mixed Bavard duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides an expository account of the celebrated duality theorem of Bavard and three its strengthenings. The Bavard duality theorem connects scl (stable commutator length) and quasimorphisms on a group. Calegari extended the framework from a group element to a chain on the group, and established the generalized Bavard duality. Kawasaki, Kimura, Matsushita and Mimura studied the setting of a pair of a group and its normal subgroup, and obtained the mixed Bavard duality. The first half of the present article is devoted to an introduction to these three Bavard dualities. In the latter half, we present a new strengthening, the generalized mixed Bavard duality, and provide a self-contained proof of it. This third strengthening recovers all of the Bavard dualities treated in the first half; thus, we supply complete proofs of these four Bavard dualities in a unified manner. In addition, we state several results on the space $\mathrm{W}(G,N)$ of non-extendable quasimorphisms, which is related to the comparison problem between scl and mixed scl via the mixed Bavard duality.</description>

      <title>Quiver Hecke algebras from Floer homology in Couloumb branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homology theories categorifying quantum group link invariants are known to be governed by the representation theory of quiver Hecke algebras, also called KLRW algebras. Here we show that certain cylindrical KLRW algebras, relevant in particular for cylindrical generalizations of link homology theories, can be realized by Lagrangian Floer homology in multiplicative Coulomb branches. This confirms a homological mirror symmetry prediction of the first author.</description>

      <title>The homotopy type of the PL cobordism category. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:1608.06236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a bordism category $\mathcal{C}_d^{PL}$ whose objects are bundles of closed $(d-1)$-dimensional piecewise linear manifolds and whose morphisms are bundles of $d$-dimensional piecewise linear cobordisms. In the main theorem of this article, we show that the classifying space $B\mathcal{C}_d^{PL}$ is weak homotopy equivalent to an infinite loop space. We regard $\mathcal{C}_d^{PL}$ as the piecewise linear analogue of the category of smooth cobordisms which has been studied extensively in connection to the Madsen-Weiss Theorem, and the main result of this paper is a first step towards obtaining Madsen-Weiss type results in the context of piecewise linear topology.</description>

      <title>Algebraic criteria for stable diffeomorphism of spin 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.06127v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study closed, connected, spin 4-manifolds up to stabilisation by connected sums with copies of $S^2 \times S^2$. For a fixed fundamental group, there are primary, secondary and tertiary obstructions, which together with the signature lead to a complete stable classification. The primary obstruction exactly detects $\mathbb{CP}^2$-stable diffeomorphism and was previously related to algebraic invariants by Kreck and the authors.
  In this article we formulate conjectural relationships of the secondary and tertiary obstructions with algebraic invariants: the secondary obstruction should be determined by the (stable) equivariant intersection form and the tertiary obstruction via a $\tau$-invariant recording intersection data between 2-spheres, with trivial algebraic self-intersection, and their Whitney discs.
  We prove our conjectures for the following classes of fundamental groups: groups of cohomological dimension at most 3, right-angled Artin groups, abelian groups, and finite groups with quaternion or abelian 2-Sylow subgroups. We apply our theory to give a complete algebraic stable classification of spin $4$-manifolds with fundamental group $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2$.</description>

      <title>A three-manifold invariant from graph configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The logarithm of the Kontsevich-Kuperberg-Thurston invariant counts embeddings of connected trivalent graphs in an oriented rational homology sphere, using integrals on configuration spaces of points in the given manifold. It is a universal finite type invariant of oriented rational homology spheres. The exponential of this invariant is often called the perturbative expansion of the Chern-Simons theory. In this article, we give an independent original definition of the degree two part of the logarithm of the Kontsevich-Kuperberg-Thurston invariant appropriate for concrete computations. This article can also serve as an introduction to the general definition of the logarithm of the Kontsevich-Kuperberg-Thurston invariant.</description>

      <title>Large alternating Montesinos knots do not admit purely cosmetic surgeries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is conjectured that, on a non-trivial knot in the 3-sphere, no pair of Dehn surgeries along distinct slopes are purely cosmetic, that is, none of them yield 3-manifolds those are orientation-preservingly homeomorphic. In this paper, we show that alternating knots having reduced alternating diagram with the twist number at least 7, Montesinos knots of length at least 5, and alternating Montesinos knots of length at least 4 do not admit purely cosmetic surgeries. As a corollary, we see that large alternating Montesinos knots have no purely cosmetic surgeries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a compact, oriented surface $S$ of finite genus and finitely many boundary components, we provide examples of finite covers $\tilde{S}$ of $S$ and non-simple closed curves $\gamma$ on $S$ which lifts to simple closed curves on $\tilde{S}$. In particular, given any positive integer $n\geq 2$, we construct explicit non-simple closed curves on $S$ which has a simple lift to a degree $n$ cover of $S$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-orientable 4-genus of a knot $K$ in $S^{3}$, denoted $\gamma_4(K)$, measures the minimum genus of a non-orientable surface in $B^{4}$ bounded by $K$. We compute bounds for the non-orientable 4-genus of knots $T_{5, q}$ and $T_{6, q}$, extending previous research. Additionally, we provide a generalized, non-recursive formula for $d(S^{3}_{-1}(T_{p,q}))$, the $d$-invariant of -1-surgery on torus knots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the PL analogue of the theorem of Galatius, Madsen, Tillmann, and Weiss which describes the homotopy type of the smooth cobordism category. More specifically, we introduce the PL Madsen-Tillmann spectrum $\mathbf{MT}PL(d)$ and prove that there is a weak homotopy equivalence of the form $B\mathsf{Cob}^{\mathrm{PL}}_d \simeq \Omega^{\infty-1}\mathbf{MT}PL(d)$. We also discuss how to adjust the methods of this paper to obtain the topological version of our main result.</description>
